<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">About</h1></header><main><p>Hi, I&#8217;m Ross. I&#8217;m a mid-forties, multi-disciplinary geek from Swindon, UK.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently employed as a full-stack web developer working with PHP, WordPress, JavaScript, and React.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve previously worked as a freelance software developer who used technology to help people solve problems and to do good &#8211; frequently working with charities, non-profits and small businesses. I use WordPress, Laravel and other web tech to build websites and web-based applications.</p>
<p>I love helping people to understand how they can use technology to achieve their goals, and help them implement that technology.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very experienced with computers and software, with a career that spans safety-critical software engineering in the aerospace sector, large-scale corporate IT and hosting operations, and software and website development, both freelance and full-time employed.</p>
<p>I have a softer side that likes to work with people, advising, consulting, and educating too.</p>
<p>I have numerous <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/projects/">side-projects</a>, (out of date) WordPress training videos at <a href="https://press-ups.com/">Press Ups</a>, and I occasionally do public speaking.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more or working with me <a href="https://rw.omg.lol/">contact me</a>.</p>
<p>When I&#8217;m not in the office I can be found parenting, cycling, gardening, trying to make sourdough rise, learning new skills, and, occasionally, writing about some of that here.</p>
