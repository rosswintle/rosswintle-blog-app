This is not really an M1 specific issue, apart from the fact that I can&#8217;t use homebrew to install anything other than the latest version of MariaDB.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some useful links that have helped me out along the way:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Homebrew\/brew\/issues\/7857\">Status of Homebrew on Apple Silicon<\/a><\/li><li>&#8220;Sam&#8221; has <a href=\"https:\/\/soffes.blog\/homebrew-on-apple-silicon\">a tip on running command line stuff using Rosetta<\/a><\/li><li>A clever person figured out that if you make a copy of terminal (or iTerm) and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.notion.so\/Run-x86-Apps-including-homebrew-in-the-Terminal-on-Apple-Silicon-8350b43d97de4ce690f283277e958602\">set it to &#8220;Run as Rosetta&#8221;<\/a> it seems to run any sub-commands using Rosetta too.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll have some write ups &#8211; or possibly unstructured brain dumps &#8211; on stuff I&#8217;ve learned along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>22:42<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside: yarn and npm are the one thing that I&#8217;ve noticed it REALLY FREAKING FAST on this machine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>22:32<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes &#8211; I&#8217;m still at it &#8211; in between other things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;d heard from a friend that lib-sass or node-sass &#8211; I don&#8217;t recall which &#8211; maybe both would fail to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s true. And it raises a whole weird load of questions about how Rosetta works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>yarn and npm both seem to work OK. But if I understand correctly, lib-sass was a compiled binary, and it refused to run with the usual webpack\/npm\/webpack barf, including:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nModule build failed: ModuleBuildError: Module build failed: Error: Node Sass does not yet support your current environment: OS X Unsupported architecture (arm64) with Unsupported runtime (88)\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>So why does everything else seem to run fine under Rosetta, but not this one thing?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, I eventually found a way to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>update <code>node-sass<\/code> to <code>dart-sass<\/code><\/li><li>update the <code>sass-loader<\/code> (v10 is too high &#8211; I get more barf and errors &#8211; v7.1 seems to work)<\/li><li>update the sass-loader config<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This then all runs under node 15, which I have compiled for ARM\/M1. And&#8230;YAY!!! I can successfully build the project I need to put live VERY SOON!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>20:18<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gosh I have a LOT of software!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is going pretty well considering. HOWEVER&#8230;  brew and node are pretty confusing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve basically got brew working, but it&#8217;s giving me this nudge to run it with Rosetta which I have no idea how to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have node v15 installed using <code>brew install -s node<\/code> (I had to run it a few times to get it to work)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can&#8217;t get the &#8216;<code>n<\/code>&#8216; node version manager to do anything &#8211; it&#8217;s installed but won&#8217;t list or install any versions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can&#8217;t get node@10 or node@12 to install with homebrew.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up &#8211; can I actually compile a project that uses node?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>16:28<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While pretty much every download-to-your-applicaitons folder app seems fine, the problems are on command-line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got Homebrew installed. And seem to have compiled my own version of PHP with <code>brew install -s php<\/code>, but I can&#8217;t get a build of nodeJs to compile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps there&#8217;s a better way than homebrew for this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>15:29<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be honest, this is going pretty well. I&#8217;ve not got some system utilities like Moom, Better Touch Tool, Bartender and the Harvest time tracking app installed. I&#8217;ve yet to set them up properly but they all seem to be working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have Sequel Ace for databases and Wavebox for managing some web apps &#8211; this is an Electron app and I thought there was issues with Electron. But seems it&#8217;s OK!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dashdocs, Tweetbot and iTerm are all doing fine now too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nice that MacOS now has zsh by default but there&#8217;s some dotfiles I&#8217;ll need to recover!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14:43<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a school run to do&#8230; back later!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14:17<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have Homebrew and am attempting a PHP 7.4 install. Not sure what&#8217;s gonna happen!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14:15<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tinkerwell and HELO installed. I have iTunes\/Music set up. I&#8217;ve attempted ClamXAV install but need to get a new license. Hmmm&#8230; Hurrying through now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:54<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weird &#8211; having installed the MacOS command-line tools, Firefox seems much happier! Perhaps extensions need some command line thing installed to work?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slack is installed and fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:10<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime I have an update from the Apple Service centre about my old MacBook &#8211; they can&#8217;t do anything. What diagnostics they can do are showing &#8211; surprise! &#8211; logic board failures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s back to Apple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:16<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to have to do some real work now. But just to add:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Homebrew not properly supported yet &#8211; it says to run it under Rosetta, but I don&#8217;t know how you do that from the command line! Work ongoing <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Homebrew\/brew\/issues\/7857\">here<\/a>. Another dev linked from that issue also has <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mikelxc\/Workarounds-for-ARM-mac\">a list of fixes and workarounds<\/a> for things.<\/li><li>PHP 7.3 in installed by default. I have composer running.<\/li><li>Git not installed by default? Having to download Apple&#8217;s command line utilities &#8211; this could take a while!<\/li><li>SourceTree is incoming&#8230;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Also &#8211; I will need to find a way to copy over, or recreate a LOT of configuration from my old machine. Not just dot files, but other stuff too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fun few days ahead!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:07<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not able to specifically point to anything wrong with Firefox extensions, but they generally seem broken. I turned them all off, and I could get a couple of them back on, but the Containers extension and React Dev tools seemed to just break Firefox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This needs sorting FAST!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12:54<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I&#8217;m gonna call it: Something in Firefox doesn&#8217;t work! It kinda opens tabs, but doesn&#8217;t load them. Incognito windows are fine. So it&#8217;s probably extension related.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blazing through app installs &#8211; I have a lot of stuff to install.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this my first Apple Silicon issue though? Wow! Not where I expected it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"368\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-1024x368.png\" alt=\"Operating system error sating &quot;Google Chrome quit unexpectedly&quot;\" class=\"wp-image-9658\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-1024x368.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-300x108.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-768x276.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25.png 1036w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>11:52<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weird that the 1Password APP wouldn&#8217;t take a physical security key. That was a test.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dropbox seems fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firefox and Chrome are incoming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No issues as yet. How do I know if apps are using Rosetta or are built for ARM?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:37<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, so far so good. I have 1Password (was a good test of my own security getting in on a new device!). I have Telegram and WhatsApp for chatting to some people. I have Alfred because I&#8217;m an option-space person, not a Cmd-space one! I&#8217;m downloading Dropbox&#8230;  argh! Is that going to work?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:23<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK &#8211; here I am in WordPress in Safari. First step: Get 1Password up and running so I can log in to stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Install from App Store was OK. But then it wouldn&#8217;t open. Eventually found a little window asking me to install Rosetta. Surprised 1Password isn&#8217;t a universal build yet! But it&#8217;s open and working!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No I\u2019m not \u201cunboxing\u201d it. You don\u2019t care about that. You want to know what software runs on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a dongle. You don\u2019t need a photo of that! ?<br><br>11:04<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/31318691-B160-46B0-BD72-11B2917399CA-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9647\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/31318691-B160-46B0-BD72-11B2917399CA-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/31318691-B160-46B0-BD72-11B2917399CA-300x225.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>11:00<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we are then. I have travelled to the stars (OK, to Cirencester) and I have forged new elements (OK, I have a new laptop with Apple Silicon)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big question is: can I get WordPress on my phone to upload photos?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9:10<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should say that this isn\u2019t some vain, impulse buy. It\u2019s well thought through. I\u2019ve been wanting to upgrade for about two years, but wanted a robust keyboard. That came along from Apple last year. And then Apple Silicon was announced and it\u2019s a call between a) how long before software stops working on Intel and b) how long before it starts working on M1?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I NEED to get a new laptop and I\u2019m trying to play the long game. If I want this machine to be running all my software in 5 or 6 years, the new chips seem to be the right choice. I hope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>8:40<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people have been warning me about compatibility of software and I do have concerns. But I\u2019ve researched and discussed this with people and let me say where I\u2019m at:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t do much\/any virtualisation. I don\u2019t use Docker &#8211; which I know doesn\u2019t work. What virtualisation I do is minimal and not mission-critical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looks like some software that integrates with the OS at low level like screen recorders and audio tools might struggle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There seem to have been concerns around Electron apps but I couldn\u2019t find anything concrete. It looks like Electron apps will build. But I\u2019m not sure what specific tools are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have concerns about Homebrew, PHP, composer, databases. But these are all Linux things right? Creating ARM binaries &#8211; if they don\u2019t already exist &#8211; should be OK?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well &#8211; that\u2019s what we\u2019re about to find out!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8:15 am: My late 2013 MacBook Pro has failed. Totally bricked. Others are reporting this failure too and a fix could be weeks away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m normally a risk-averse person. But for some stupid reason I\u2019ve decided to jump in on day 1 with an Apple Silicon M1 MacBook Air that I\u2019m collecting this morning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will I sink or swim? I know not everything will work on day 1. But will it be disastrous? Or just mildly annoying?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow along and see how it goes. If nothing else it might be an insight into the tools of this full-stack PHP\/WordPress\/Laravel developer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ll post updates here rather than Twitter. I guess you have to revisit occasionally to see what\u2019s going on!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",
