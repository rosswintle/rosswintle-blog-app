So&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I exist in geeky tech spaces where kindness is often far too lacking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opinions abound. Pragmatism, spectrums of opinion, and nuance in debate is rare. Right\/wrong dichotomies abound, and discussion can be heartless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kindness to me is acceptance that I don&#8217;t know everything; that the opinions of others are valid even if they are different to mine; that asking questions is better than stating opinions; that the person I&#8217;m talking with or thinking about is a person with feelings just like me, and that I should treat them as I would want myself to be treated. Yes, this is ancient and Biblical, but for me it defines kindness!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also once heard this seemingly-bizarre thing about &#8220;cows looking at cars&#8221; that has had a profound impact on me. I probably remember it because the picture it conjures is so odd and yet so meaningful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is from a monologue about what &#8220;love&#8221; (the non-romantic kind) is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>So when you&#8217;re walking around in the world you see lots of people. But you don&#8217;t really see them. They&#8217;re just objects. They are functions. You&#8217;re like a cow looking at cars. You know, a cow looks at a car. They watch it. But nothing&#8217;s going on. When you drive past a cow [in Ireland] it looks up, it watches, but there&#8217;s nothing going on inside. And then it goes back to eating. That&#8217;s how we treat people in daily life.<\/p><p>But when you love somebody, some individual comes out of that background and you see them in their subjectivity. You see them as an individual.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this notion that I can look at a person as an object without soul, without mind, without feelings, thoughts or a &#8220;spirit&#8221; of the person. If I see them like that I can justify all sorts of bad behaviour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I stop and think that that person is a person like me: an individual; something more than a functional mass of atoms. Then, regardless of our differences of opinion, I find I have no choice but to consider my actions carefully and be kind.<\/p>\n",
