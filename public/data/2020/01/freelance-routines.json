Every now and then the question of \u201chow do you fit things into your routine\u201d is asked. And I just posted a hefty answer of my own, so thought I\u2019d copy it here. Maybe some tips for people with families and business or homeworkers on health and housework<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My partner is employed but only 3.5 days a week. We have one kid at a preschool and one at school &#8211; they are in opposite directions but the school is really close to home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I work freelance and flexibly. And I have a small and very cheap office I rent that\u2019s about 3.5 miles from home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a pretty good routine for getting the kids and adults to the right places. But have also struggled with household stuff and social time. Especially as our little one (4) won\u2019t do bedtime with me very easily, older one (8) is resisting independence and needs chivvying though bedtime until 9ish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cleaning and some household stuff has just been done as and when due to the chaos of having a sub-four-year old around for the last 8 years. We\u2019re just about feeling like we could make some kind of rota for jobs now, and include 8yo on it. But really\u2026do the important stuff and don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t get to dust or hoover for weeks on end. You\u2019re not the only one and you need some personal time too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT\u2026I often combine chores with personal time. Listen to music or podcasts while washing up, hoovering or mowing the lawn, for example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get exercise by cycling to and from my office when I can. Its awesome exercise without really having to think about it. I have an extended route I can use if I have time for extra \u201cgym\u201d activity. If you don\u2019t have a commute then going for a run, brisk walk or bike ride around your local streets is a good way. Invent a commute &#8211; it acts as a transition time between home and work life too. Super helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also just bought some small dumbbell weights from Aldi (Aldi and Lidl both have fitness kit in the \u201csilly aisles\u201d right now!) and I\u2019m doing reps with those, or push ups or crunches, in my few minutes of break time each hour (I run a sort-of Pomodoro technique). This will hopefully get me extra calories burned through the day and some extra strength built up without the travel and financial costs of a gym.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I guess I\u2019m trying to integrate these things together. Make the personal care an integral part of the routines I\u2019m working with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t always get it right, but it seems to work well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when 4yo goes to school in September hopefully everything will be a load easier!<\/p>\n",
