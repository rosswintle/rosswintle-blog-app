<p><em>The short version: I&#8217;m live-streaming reviewing Gutenberg block-editor plugin releases and exploring new block editor features.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Getting behind the blocks</h3>



<p>I&#8217;ve got quite behind on the functionality of the &#8220;Gutenberg&#8221; Block Editor in WordPress. I&#8217;ve read articles about <a href="https://richtabor.com/block-patterns/">Block Patterns</a> and <a href="https://impress.org/wordpress-full-site-editing-gutenberg-7-7/">Full Site Editing</a> and I keep up with <a href="https://wptavern.com/?s=gutenberg">WP Tavern&#8217;s excellent coverage</a> of development on the editor.</p>



<p>But I&#8217;ve not done much other than simple post writing, and development of custom blocks using Advanced Custom Field&#8217;s excellent features.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s time I caught up with new features and dived into what&#8217;s been going on and what the future looks like for the editor.</p>



<p>Gutenberg development happens outside of WordPress &#8220;core&#8221; in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">Gutenberg plugin</a>. I&#8217;d been saving up articles to read on each of the Gutenberg releases with the aim of reviewing them and trying things out. But I wasn&#8217;t getting through them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Live Streaming Gutenberg Releases</h3>



<p>Enter Live Streaming &#8211; it&#8217;s what the cool kids do these days. And while I&#8217;m not a cool kid, and I have some objections to live streaming (mostly I don&#8217;t have time to watch everyone else&#8217;s streams &#8211; there&#8217;s too much interesting content!!), it&#8217;s something I thought I&#8217;d try out because:</p>



<ol><li>It kinda makes me accountable for doing things.</li><li>If I recorded and published video I&#8217;d want to edit it and I often get stuck at the very-time-consuming editing stage &#8211; live streaming means I just do it and publish.</li><li>It will help me develop a video &#8220;style&#8221;.</li><li>It will get me used to recording my work again &#8211; something I want to do for some projects in the future.</li><li>Maybe, if people come along for the ride, I&#8217;ll get some help as I explore Gutenberg!</li></ol>



<p>I&#8217;m keeping it simple, just streaming on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/the_magicroundabout">Twitch</a>, and publishing later on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkx-5bxvKn1mGn90XfLikBA">YouTube</a>. So follow along if you want to.</p>



<p>The videos are in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhrmKLkDYLGHlWwq45NTOahsPRfF5xlaI">YouTube playlist</a>. I&#8217;ve not embedded that here to protect your privacy.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Schedule and technology</h3>



<p><strong>Schedule:</strong> Unfortunately, I&#8217;m finding it hard to get good times to run the streams &#8211; I&#8217;m working from home in a temporary office during the Coronvirus lockdown, and my family are usually around. So finding quieter times when I won&#8217;t be interrupted is hard.</p>



<p><strong>Technology:</strong> While I have a pretty good A/V setup, my laptop is pretty old and struggling with the job of working, streaming and recording, so, compared to others, the streams aren&#8217;t brilliant quality, but I&#8217;m working with what I have.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m also new to streaming. <a href="https://streamlabs.com/">StreamLabs OBS</a> is good software and is helping me a lot. But I am getting to grips with it as I go, and for the early streams I&#8217;m using an out-of-the-box &#8220;theme&#8221;. But if you&#8217;re a regular streamer yourself, or used to watching streams, know that mine won&#8217;t be the best, but they are getting better!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Thoughts and reflections</h3>



<p><strong>I&#8217;m enjoying the streaming</strong>, and it&#8217;s good to be getting back into video and learning what&#8217;s coming in Gutenberg. I&#8217;ve already learned a lot about both!</p>



<p><strong>The Streaming software is pretty good.</strong> I&#8217;ve played with <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjN9fj2ssfqAhXXQUEAHYocCRA4FBAWMAB6BAgGEAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecamm.com%2Fmac%2Fecammlive%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1_hQf3vhAgGFP1oOrWTDej">eCamm Live</a> (paid), <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjfkfeqs8fqAhXKilwKHcJFARcQFjAAegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fobsproject.com%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw054AIqrSkxDm8_ctWCSWgb">OBS</a> (free/open source, but clunky) and now <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjf2Oiys8fqAhVGilwKHY_uABUQFjAAegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstreamlabs.com%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1GJO6w3mUw7KXC_z7IGH04">StreamLabs</a>. StreamLabs is based on OBS but seems simpler to use. And there&#8217;s a mobile app you can use as a remote control that&#8217;s a real bonus and gives you a mini control deck without needing something like a <a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck">Stream Deck</a>.</p>



<p>Mine is a simple and low cost setup, but it works for now.</p>



<p><strong>Streaming is hard</strong>: typing; thinking; talking; making sure audio and video are working; making sure you don&#8217;t disclose passwords and other secrets while on screen. There&#8217;s a LOT to be doing all at once. And that&#8217;s before people start to chat!</p>



<p><strong>Properly streaming also looks like a lot of work</strong>. You start seeing how others are managing their stream schedule, building communities in the chat, giving people chat moderation permissions, and designing all the screens and layouts and stuff. It&#8217;s a huge commitment to do it properly, and my reasons for doing it are so that I can do video more ad-hoc and SAVE me time. So there&#8217;s a bit of a conflict of needs there.</p>



<p><strong>I&#8217;ve chosen NOT to do too much promotion.</strong> On a Friday my Twitter feed becomes a stream of &#8220;Streaming in&#8230;&#8221; posts from others, most of which, as far as I can tell, are unnecessary because Twitch emails me when someone starts streaming. Plus, I&#8217;m nervous about putting myself out there in the early days while I&#8217;m still learning.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s early days, and it&#8217;s mostly just me. But hopefully this Exploring Gutenberg process is helpful to others.</p>
