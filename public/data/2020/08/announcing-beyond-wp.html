<p>WordPress developers: Today I’m opening sign ups to a newsletter I’ll be starting soon called <a href="https://beyond-wp.com/">Beyond WP</a>.</p>



<p>It will be a resource that brings developer tools and ideas from outside the WordPress ecosystem to WordPress developers.</p>

<p>I’ve worked with WordPress for around ten years. I love it as a CMS. But I often feel like I push it to its limits. As a back-end developer who deals with complex data and builds applications, I’ve needed alternatives.</p>



<p>And I found the <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> framework!</p>



<p>Learning Laravel and being immersed in its ecosystem &#8211; the tooling, the learning resources, the people in the community &#8211; has been hugely beneficial for my work and career. Including ongoing WordPress work.</p>



<p>And I want to bring those benefits to others who&#8217;ve not found these things yet.</p>

<p>Sure, I’m not the only person that spans WordPress and Laravel worlds. But I made a <a href="https://wptolaravel.com">WordPress-to-Laravel</a> course, and some videos about useful PHP tools. And I’ve come to see one of my roles as being a bridge between these communities.</p>



<p>Beyond WP gives some structure to this. To start with, it will be an occasional email (I can’t promise a schedule) with useful stuff from outside the WP bubble that I think will interest and inspire WordPress developers.</p>



<p>If people like it I may expand the format.</p>



<p>I hope you will read more and sign up at <a href="https://beyond-wp.com/">https://beyond-wp.com/</a>, and please share this with others. You can follow on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/beyond_wp">@beyond_wp</a> too.</p>



<p>Join me in taking a step Beyond WP! It’s exciting and inspiring and fun.</p>
