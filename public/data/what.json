My writings are mostly about things that I&#8217;m learning and discovering, and so you will see me writing about most of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Life in Swindon.<\/li>\n<li>Technology &#8211; I have a degree in computer science, and there&#8217;s always something new to learn.<\/li>\n<li>Cycling.<\/li>\n<li>Music &#8211; I play guitar &#8211; sometimes publicly.<\/li>\n<li>Gardening &#8211; our new house has a large vegetable patch that we&#8217;re trying to make use of.<\/li>\n<li>Nature &#8211; a constant fascination of mine and unending source of discovery and wonder.<\/li>\n<li>My Christian Faith &#8211; life as an ordinary person trying to follow Jesus.<\/li>\n<li>Dance &#8211; my wife and I are taking Latin and Ballroom classes.<\/li>\n<li>Culture &#8211; I occasionally record my thoughts on films, music, books and art<\/li>\n<li>Politics &#8211; I think everyone should be involved in democracy, and I try to do my bit, though it doesn&#8217;t always work as it should.<\/li>\n<li>Holidays &#8211; I&#8217;m a words person, not a pictures person, so I like to record things in words.  So as well as photo albums, I write up holidays and share my experiences.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I also have a few ground rules for writing here.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s never about work.  You may possibly see general thoughts about workING, but I&#8217;ll never refer to my job or the people I work with<\/li>\n<li>I don&#8217;t name people.  My wife is mentioned &#8211; she&#8217;s pretty important and doesn&#8217;t seem to mind &#8211; but most other people, if mentioned at all, are not mentioned by name (unless I ask them first).<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s all about me.  This sounds selfish but I try not to talk about what other people are doing &#8211; it would be unfair to tell the world what others are doing and thinking.<\/li>\n<li>Be positive &#8211; I, like most people, like a good rant, but I believe that I&#8217;m only allowed to rant about the bad, if I also celebrate the good.  Please hold me to this!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",
