So as well as photo albums, I write up holidays and share my experiences.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I also have a few ground rules for writing here.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s never about work.  You may possibly see general thoughts about workING, but I&#8217;ll never refer to my job or the people I work with<\/li>\n<li>I don&#8217;t name people.  My wife is mentioned &#8211; she&#8217;s pretty important and doesn&#8217;t seem to mind &#8211; but most other people, if mentioned at all, are not mentioned by name (unless I ask them first).<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s all about me.  This sounds selfish but I try not to talk about what other people are doing &#8211; it would be unfair to tell the world what others are doing and thinking.<\/li>\n<li>Be positive &#8211; I, like most people, like a good rant, but I believe that I&#8217;m only allowed to rant about the bad, if I also celebrate the good.  Please hold me to this!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",
