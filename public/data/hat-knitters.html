<p>First of all THANK YOU! The response was amazing and I could probably secure 10-or-so hats if I wanted.</p>
<p>I want to quickly say that the request I had was aimed at my wife, who is a knitter herself. She&#8217;s being a fab mum to our 8-week-old boy right now, so spends most of her life doing things one handed.  Knitting, even if she had the time, is out of the question right now.</p>
<p>The girl with leukaemia is a friend of a friend.  She&#8217;s 4 and has very recently been diagnosed and put straight on chemotherapy.  I don&#8217;t want to reveal her identity at this point as I don&#8217;t have permission, she&#8217;s only little, and she doesn&#8217;t know anything about this.</p>
<p>I have already secure two hats, and this is enough. However, if you&#8217;re feeling generous and would like to make this little girl&#8217;s day then, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, the more the merrier!</p>
<p>I kinda assumed that volunteers would do this out of the goodness of their hearts, so I can&#8217;t offer to pay for yarn, time or postage. But if you did want to contribute, please contact me at <a title="twitknits@wintle.me.uk" href="mailto:twitknits@wintle.me.uk">twitknits@wintle.me.uk</a> and I&#8217;ll let you know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: People have been asking about colours. I&#8217;ve secured a couple of hats in the girl&#8217;s favourite colours, so if you&#8217;re offering an additional hat then just use your imagination and/or whatever&#8217;s in your yarn stash.  I&#8217;ve also been told that cotton/silk wool is better because the scalp is very sensitive.  Thanks.</p>
<p>Many of you were based in the US, so I should let you know that we&#8217;re in the UK and if you wanted to contribute then you&#8217;ll have to ship to England.</p>
<p>Again, thank you to all who offered.  Even if I get no more hats, I&#8217;ll certainly let our poorly little friend know how much love there is out there for her.</p>
<p>Ross</p>
