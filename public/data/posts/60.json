                "rendered": "<p>One of my favourite films is Pixar&#8217;s Toy Story&#8230;the first all-CGI feature-length movie, and a very cool buddy story.  I&#8217;m assuming knowledge of the story here so please forgive me if you&#8217;ve not seen it (and GO see it!).<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m having a bit of a Toy Story moment.  My old Raleigh bike (who I&#8217;ve taken to calling &#8220;Walter&#8221;) hasn&#8217;t been used much lately.  When Fuzzy (my road bike) came along he was so superior in so many ways that Walter got a bit forgotten about.  Walter is, if you like, my &#8220;Woody&#8221;, and Fuzzy is my &#8220;Buzz Lightyear&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>But this week, Fuzzy got a flat.  Not on the road, he got cut up by some glass on the garden path.  Still, it was a busy week and I didn&#8217;t have the time to get it fixed proper.  So I took to riding the Raleigh to work for a couple of days.<\/p>\n<p>And, you know what, he&#8217;s not so bad after all.  He&#8217;s a work horse.  Solid.  Dependable.  A bit rough around the edges, but he&#8217;s there when I need him.  OK, so he&#8217;s a bit uncool, but he&#8217;s done more than 1500 miles in 18 months.  When Fuzzy has problems, I&#8217;ll need Walter.<\/p>\n<p>And so to fixing the flat.  This should be bicycle maintenance 101.  It&#8217;s the first thing you learn to do right?  It&#8217;s EASY.  A kid could do it.<\/p>\n<p>So can I just say&#8230;a kid could NOT do it with a road bike!  Those things are so darn fiddly, the beading&#8217;s so tight.  It&#8217;s really hard!<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I fixed the flat mid-week but found a half-inch gash in the front tyre where the glass had got through so I bought two new tyres (700-25 Continental Gatorskins if you must know) and fitted them both today.  That&#8217;s three tyre changes in a week &#8211; I&#8217;m getting pretty good at them now despite the difficulty level!  Yet to give them a good ride but will be interesting to see how the bike handles with different rubber.<\/p>\n<p>Fuzzy also got a good and much needed clean, degrease and lube today.  The Raleigh is the workhorse, but the Felt is my slick, lean, fast machine and he still gets much more attention.<\/p>\n<p>To infinity and beyond anyone?<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m assuming knowledge of the story here so please forgive me if you&#8217;ve not seen it (and GO see it!).<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m having a bit of a Toy Story moment.  My old Raleigh bike (who I&#8217;ve taken to calling &#8220;Walter&#8221;) hasn&#8217;t been used much lately.  When Fuzzy (my road bike) came along he was so superior in so many ways that Walter got a bit forgotten about.  Walter is, if you like, my &#8220;Woody&#8221;, and Fuzzy is my &#8220;Buzz Lightyear&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>But this week, Fuzzy got a flat.  Not on the road, he got cut up by some glass on the garden path.  Still, it was a busy week and I didn&#8217;t have the time to get it fixed proper.  So I took to riding the Raleigh to work for a couple of days.<\/p>\n<p>And, you know what, he&#8217;s not so bad after all.  He&#8217;s a work horse.  Solid.  Dependable.  A bit rough around the edges, but he&#8217;s there when I need him.  OK, so he&#8217;s a bit uncool, but he&#8217;s done more than 1500 miles in 18 months.  When Fuzzy has problems, I&#8217;ll need Walter.<\/p>\n<p>And so to fixing the flat.  This should be bicycle maintenance 101.  It&#8217;s the first thing you learn to do right?  It&#8217;s EASY.  A kid could do it.<\/p>\n<p>So can I just say&#8230;a kid could NOT do it with a road bike!  Those things are so darn fiddly, the beading&#8217;s so tight.  It&#8217;s really hard!<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I fixed the flat mid-week but found a half-inch gash in the front tyre where the glass had got through so I bought two new tyres (700-25 Continental Gatorskins if you must know) and fitted them both today.  That&#8217;s three tyre changes in a week &#8211; I&#8217;m getting pretty good at them now despite the difficulty level!  Yet to give them a good ride but will be interesting to see how the bike handles with different rubber.<\/p>\n<p>Fuzzy also got a good and much needed clean, degrease and lube today.  The Raleigh is the workhorse, but the Felt is my slick, lean, fast machine and he still gets much more attention.<\/p>\n<p>To infinity and beyond anyone?<\/p>\n",

I did go and vote &#8211; I won&#8217;t say for whom, but I WILL say that I was VERY close to spoiling my paper.  Why?<\/p>\n<p>The run up to our election has seen a little paper battle going on.  First, a very good leaflet from the Tory guy.  A positive leaflet outlining what he do and with very little mocking of his Labour opponent.<\/p>\n<p>In reply came a Labour leaflet that contained nothing positive at all, just 10 reasons not to vote for the Tory guy.  Frankly this made the Labour guy look like an arse.  In reply to that came another positive Tory leaflet which made a point of the fact that it was positive and not belittling of the Labour guy.<\/p>\n<p>Ironically, both the Tory and the Labour candidates seem to want the same things, not many of which I think are particularly important.  We had no publicity from any of the other three candidates.<\/p>\n<p>So who to vote for.  On the face of it, the Tory guy wins my vote for presenting a positive agenda, but I don&#8217;t like Tory values.  The Labour guy lost my vote with his first leaflet.  The Lib Dem guys lives miles away from the area.  UKIP&#8230;need I say more.  Oh and there was a random independent candidate who could have been anyone.<\/p>\n<p>My choice remains secret.  My dissatisfaction with the political process does not.<\/p>\n",

I did go and vote &#8211; I won&#8217;t say for whom, but I WILL say that I was VERY close to spoiling my paper.  Why?<\/p>\n<p>The run up to our election has seen a little paper battle going on.  First, a very good leaflet from the Tory guy.  A positive leaflet outlining what he do and with very little mocking of his Labour opponent.<\/p>\n<p>In reply came a Labour leaflet that contained nothing positive at all, just 10 reasons not to vote for the Tory guy.  Frankly this made the Labour guy look like an arse.  In reply to that came another positive Tory leaflet which made a point of the fact that it was positive and not belittling of the Labour guy.<\/p>\n<p>Ironically, both the Tory and the Labour candidates seem to want the same things, not many of which I think are particularly important.  We had no publicity from any of the other three candidates.<\/p>\n<p>So who to vote for.  On the face of it, the Tory guy wins my vote for presenting a positive agenda, but I don&#8217;t like Tory values.  The Labour guy lost my vote with his first leaflet.  The Lib Dem guys lives miles away from the area.  UKIP&#8230;need I say more.  Oh and there was a random independent candidate who could have been anyone.<\/p>\n<p>My choice remains secret.  My dissatisfaction with the political process does not.<\/p>\n",

Did I want strangers coming to my house?  What sort of quality would the goods on offer be?  Won&#8217;t people just grab things and sell them on eBay or take them to car boot sales?<\/p>\n<p>But I have to say that we&#8217;ve had some really good experiences.  We&#8217;ve given away a few things, which has been a simple process and not at all scary having random visitors.  Plus, we&#8217;ve acquired a blackboard.  You can&#8217;t BUY a blackboard anywhere, so Sally posted a &#8220;Wanted&#8221; message, and some lovely people were throwing out a child&#8217;s easel, which they stripped the plastic frame off, cleaned up, and gave to us.  It&#8217;s probably only worth a few quid but the people were lovely and helpful and we not have something that we wanted&#8230;.for free!<\/p>\n<p>We have a box full of stuff that we&#8217;re going to give away in this way.

Did I want strangers coming to my house?  What sort of quality would the goods on offer be?  Won&#8217;t people just grab things and sell them on eBay or take them to car boot sales?<\/p>\n<p>But I have to say that we&#8217;ve had some really good experiences.  We&#8217;ve given away a few things, which has been a simple process and not at all scary having random visitors.  Plus, we&#8217;ve acquired a blackboard.  You can&#8217;t BUY a blackboard anywhere, so Sally posted a &#8220;Wanted&#8221; message, and some lovely people were throwing out a child&#8217;s easel, which they stripped the plastic frame off, cleaned up, and gave to us.  It&#8217;s probably only worth a few quid but the people were lovely and helpful and we not have something that we wanted&#8230;.for free!<\/p>\n<p>We have a box full of stuff that we&#8217;re going to give away in this way.

He was stoic throughout and <a href=\"http:\/\/ccgi.peteramey.plus.com\/MyBlog\">his Blog<\/a>, if it&#8217;s still there when you read this, gives some amount of testimony to both his physical and mental strength.  He was a big thinker and took a detailed interest in his condition and his treatment and this was his way of getting through.<\/p>\n<p>I knew Peter from my days working at Praxis Critical Systems Limited.  He was one of the founder members of staff of that little company.  It was a huge privilege to work along someone like Peter who put incredible effort into doing what he believed was right.<\/p>\n<p>He was a software engineer in a very literal sense &#8211; he engineered software.  He developed tools to enable other to write software correctly, first time, that could be proven to be correct by mathematics.  He championed the SPARK subset of the Ada language and poured a lot of his time, both professional and personal, into that work.<\/p>\n<p>But he was more than just an engineer; he was a teacher and a philosopher.  He worked with more than just software, turning his hand to things mechanical (bikes, cars and miscellany) and musical (Saxophone and, I&#8217;m sure, others).  And he was more than the sum of all those parts too; an encourager, a man of great principle, passion and wit, a good communicator, and an inspiration to many.<\/p>\n<p>Peter was a thoroughly good bloke.

It was a huge privilege to work along someone like Peter who put incredible effort into doing what he believed was right.<\/p>\n<p>He was a software engineer in a very literal sense &#8211; he engineered software.  He developed tools to enable other to write software correctly, first time, that could be proven to be correct by mathematics.  He championed the SPARK subset of the Ada language and poured a lot of his time, both professional and personal, into that work.<\/p>\n<p>But he was more than just an engineer; he was a teacher and a philosopher.  He worked with more than just software, turning his hand to things mechanical (bikes, cars and miscellany) and musical (Saxophone and, I&#8217;m sure, others).  And he was more than the sum of all those parts too; an encourager, a man of great principle, passion and wit, a good communicator, and an inspiration to many.<\/p>\n<p>Peter was a thoroughly good bloke.  The world will miss him.  I will miss him!<\/p>\n",

BUT &#8211; the songs are back on my list this week and this is a special!<\/p>\n<p>A while ago a friend of ours who&#8217;s heading out to Kenya on a mission trip this summer, asked if I&#8217;d like to be an act in their fundraising &#8220;Stars in their Eyes&#8221; night.  Well, that&#8217;s not actually how it happened, but anyway, myself and three other guys decided that we would be The Beatles for one night only.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve left it a bit late really &#8211; the show is on Saturday evening &#8211; but we&#8217;ve just met up and had a run through the song, and I think we&#8217;ll just about have an act.<\/p>\n<p>Bizarrely, I don&#8217;t really know many Beatles&#8217; songs.  I mean, I don&#8217;t know them well.  I know lots of the songs but do I know the words?  Apparently not.  Bit of choruses and bridges but not a whole song.<\/p>\n<p>So this has become song 10, and may well put me back on track.  I didn&#8217;t really learn the last three very well so I may have some revisiting to do.<\/p>\n<p>A big &#8220;well done&#8221;, then, for getting us organised and actually picking the song, and a big cheer for Lydia, who&#8217;s faithfully following God&#8217;s call to service &#8211; may her fun night be truly blessed.<\/p>\n",

BUT &#8211; the songs are back on my list this week and this is a special!<\/p>\n<p>A while ago a friend of ours who&#8217;s heading out to Kenya on a mission trip this summer, asked if I&#8217;d like to be an act in their fundraising &#8220;Stars in their Eyes&#8221; night.  Well, that&#8217;s not actually how it happened, but anyway, myself and three other guys decided that we would be The Beatles for one night only.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve left it a bit late really &#8211; the show is on Saturday evening &#8211; but we&#8217;ve just met up and had a run through the song, and I think we&#8217;ll just about have an act.<\/p>\n<p>Bizarrely, I don&#8217;t really know many Beatles&#8217; songs.  I mean, I don&#8217;t know them well.  I know lots of the songs but do I know the words?  Apparently not.  Bit of choruses and bridges but not a whole song.<\/p>\n<p>So this has become song 10, and may well put me back on track.  I didn&#8217;t really learn the last three very well so I may have some revisiting to do.<\/p>\n<p>A big &#8220;well done&#8221;, then, for getting us organised and actually picking the song, and a big cheer for Lydia, who&#8217;s faithfully following God&#8217;s call to service &#8211; may her fun night be truly blessed.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Off to the Lakes&#8230;on our own!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So, after a long, hard start to the year we had an enjoyable Easter at home followed by a little holiday.<\/p>\n<p>Easter had proven to be cold and damp &#8211; even snow was around in northern England!  So we approached a hill walking holiday with a little anticipation.  Especially as it was the first time Sally and I were going to do some serious walking without some more experienced &#8220;peak baggers&#8221; with us.<\/p>\n<p>But Sarah and Guy prepared us well and so off we drove with many layers, maps, and Wainwright guides, to the Lake District.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Travelling Up<\/span><\/p>\n<p>On the way &#8211; or slightly out of the way &#8211; we called in to stay with our friends, the Brays, in York.  As always with them it was just like old times and we quickly got into chatting like old friends and having deep-and-meaningfuls about the nature of creativity &#8211; much to the bemusement of the people at the next table in the restaurant.<\/p>\n<p>They were very generous and gave us a happy start to our week off.<\/p>\n<p>We left York on a bright and crisp Tuesday morning.  This was soon left behind however as we climbed to the highest motorway point in the country, atop the M62 trans-Pennine expressway.  The hilltop murk didn&#8217;t last long though and, shortly after a trip back in time at Barnsley&#8217;s quite sea-side-esque services, the weather cleared again and we continued to Ambleside and on to Grasmere in sunshine again.<\/p>\n<p>Grasmere was a bit of a surprise.  A very small village but VERY touristy.  We were thankful that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amblesideonline.co.uk\/display\/oaklodge\/main.html\">our B&amp;B for the week, Oak Lodge<\/a>, was a little off the beaten track, nestled in the shadow of Helm Crag, about half a mile north of the village.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Up Helm Crag<\/span><\/p>\n<p>As the weather was good we unloaded and promptly went for a warm-up walk up to Helm Crag&#8217;s summit.  Wainwright was, as ever, a good guide, aided by the walkers returning down the path from the summit.  A short walk and about 800ft of climbing left us slightly breathless, but very much enjoying the views from the ragged summit. (Oh to be as good with words as AW himself!)<\/p>\n<p>Our first solo peak!  And some excellent views across the valley to the fells we were hoping to conquor the next day&#8230;looking dangerously snow-capped!<\/p>\n<p>Tuesday evening was spent at The Lamb in Grasmere &#8211; handy pub food but nothing special.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Fairfield, Snow, Compasses and GPS<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Wednesday was our big walking day then.  Sarah and Guy had suggested walking the entire &#8220;Fairfield Horseshoe&#8221; but we hadn&#8217;t quite hit British Summer Time, the days were short and we didn&#8217;t feel we&#8217;d safely make the 12-or-so miles round. So the plan was to tackle a portion of it, taking in Great Rigg, Fairfield and Seat Sandal.<\/p>\n<p>The climb to Great Rigg was deceptive.  We were never quite  sure if we&#8217;d ever got to the landmark of &#8220;Stone Arthur&#8221; on the way, and when we thought we did we weren&#8217;t sure we found the path.  We soon picked up the main path again though and the summit of Great Rigg was quite clear when we found it.<\/p>\n<p>As we ascended the mist and snow cover increased and some sleet fell.  We had a hot chocolate stop at Great Rigg before starting the more gentle ascent to Fairfield itself.<\/p>\n<p>The snow continued to deepen and the mist to thicken and after a quick lunch at the summit of Fairfield we decided to forget about Seat Sandal and head back down as quick as we could.  The problem was, we could only see about 50 metres and we couldn&#8217;t spot any obvious paths with all the snow cover.<\/p>\n<p>We would probably have headed back the way we came, but Wainwright suggested that, as long as you headed somewhere between West and South you&#8217;d have a south descent.  So we found some cairns and with the help of the GPS that we had on loan to keep our position known, we pretty much walked off on a compass bearing down a snow-covered scree slope.<\/p>\n<p>One of the purposes of this week was to see how we managed at hill walking and navigation on our own, and with a few simple tools we did, eventually, find our way out of quite a tricky situation.  Had Wainwright said that the descent was perilous, we would have gone back down the clear path we ascended, but despite his comment that Fairfield&#8217;s summit &#8220;is confusing in the mist&#8221;, we felt confident that the descent would not be dangerous.<\/p>\n<p>It proved that way, and despite having to navigate some boggy marsh to pick up the path again, we made it safely back to Grasmere and a much-needed cuppa.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Great British Pub<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We ventured out a bit in the evening at Sarah&#8217;s suggestion, and found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.britinn.net\/\">the Brittania Inn<\/a> in Elterwater.  A fantastic, cosy, friendly pub with good beer and excellent food.  We&#8217;re definitely big fans and will go back for sure!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Bonus Day of Walking &#8211; Silver How and Blea Rigg<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The weather for the rest of the week was forecast to get worse and worse so we thought our best walking was over and we were glad for a rest.<\/p>\n<p>It was much to our surprise, then, to wake on Thursday to glorious sunshine!  A bonus day&#8217;s walking was in the off.  We felt strong and confident after Wednesday&#8217;s escapades, and so headed up towards Silver How, a small but interesting peak, with the possibility of extending the trek to Blea Rigg a couple of miles away.<\/p>\n<p>The views of Fairfield and Great Rigg opened up nicely before us (well, behind us actually) as we ascended to give us a great view of where we&#8217;d been the previous day, and particularly of the descent from Fairfield we&#8217;d managed, to cried of &#8220;We did THAT!!!&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The peak of Silver How was blustery, and sleet and wind had temporarily moved in.  We considered heading home but took a call to go on a bit further and see what happened.  A good call in the end as the weather cleared again and we ended up having a great days walking with spectacular views all the way around.<\/p>\n<p>We made it to Great Rigg, with beautiful views of the rugged Langdale Pikes, and headed down via Easedale Tarn.  A great days walking and not too taxing either.<\/p>\n<p>In the evening we headed into Ambleside to check out the food there, and decided on the local curry house, The Tagore!  It was expensive, but slightly-above-standard Indian fare.  I liked it.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Coniston Cruises<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Friday was definitely going to rain.  So rather than walk, we had a rest and headed off on a boat trip on the National Trust&#8217;s Steam Yacht Gondola on Consiton Water.  We didn&#8217;t think much of Coniston village, but the boat was a great experience despite the rain!  Well worth a visit!<\/p>\n<p>On the way back we had a little drive around the far side of Coniston Water and headed back to Ambleside for dinner, which we&#8217;d booked at &#8220;The Priest Hole&#8221;.  Their early dinner deal was cheap, if unsurprising Mediterranean fare, with excellent service.  A good place to go for a break from English pub food.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Highlights<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And that was about it, other than a bit of shopping and some real Grasmere gingerbread (YUM!!!!).<\/p>\n<p>Highlights from the week were definitely our gorgeous B&amp;B, the walking (in all weathers), the Steam Yacht Gondola and the Britannia Inn.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll be back to the Lakes soon!!!<\/p>\n",

So we approached a hill walking holiday with a little anticipation.  Especially as it was the first time Sally and I were going to do some serious walking without some more experienced &#8220;peak baggers&#8221; with us.<\/p>\n<p>But Sarah and Guy prepared us well and so off we drove with many layers, maps, and Wainwright guides, to the Lake District.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Travelling Up<\/span><\/p>\n<p>On the way &#8211; or slightly out of the way &#8211; we called in to stay with our friends, the Brays, in York.  As always with them it was just like old times and we quickly got into chatting like old friends and having deep-and-meaningfuls about the nature of creativity &#8211; much to the bemusement of the people at the next table in the restaurant.<\/p>\n<p>They were very generous and gave us a happy start to our week off.<\/p>\n<p>We left York on a bright and crisp Tuesday morning.  This was soon left behind however as we climbed to the highest motorway point in the country, atop the M62 trans-Pennine expressway.  The hilltop murk didn&#8217;t last long though and, shortly after a trip back in time at Barnsley&#8217;s quite sea-side-esque services, the weather cleared again and we continued to Ambleside and on to Grasmere in sunshine again.<\/p>\n<p>Grasmere was a bit of a surprise.  A very small village but VERY touristy.  We were thankful that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amblesideonline.co.uk\/display\/oaklodge\/main.html\">our B&amp;B for the week, Oak Lodge<\/a>, was a little off the beaten track, nestled in the shadow of Helm Crag, about half a mile north of the village.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Up Helm Crag<\/span><\/p>\n<p>As the weather was good we unloaded and promptly went for a warm-up walk up to Helm Crag&#8217;s summit.  Wainwright was, as ever, a good guide, aided by the walkers returning down the path from the summit.  A short walk and about 800ft of climbing left us slightly breathless, but very much enjoying the views from the ragged summit. (Oh to be as good with words as AW himself!)<\/p>\n<p>Our first solo peak!  And some excellent views across the valley to the fells we were hoping to conquor the next day&#8230;looking dangerously snow-capped!<\/p>\n<p>Tuesday evening was spent at The Lamb in Grasmere &#8211; handy pub food but nothing special.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Fairfield, Snow, Compasses and GPS<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Wednesday was our big walking day then.  Sarah and Guy had suggested walking the entire &#8220;Fairfield Horseshoe&#8221; but we hadn&#8217;t quite hit British Summer Time, the days were short and we didn&#8217;t feel we&#8217;d safely make the 12-or-so miles round. So the plan was to tackle a portion of it, taking in Great Rigg, Fairfield and Seat Sandal.<\/p>\n<p>The climb to Great Rigg was deceptive.  We were never quite  sure if we&#8217;d ever got to the landmark of &#8220;Stone Arthur&#8221; on the way, and when we thought we did we weren&#8217;t sure we found the path.  We soon picked up the main path again though and the summit of Great Rigg was quite clear when we found it.<\/p>\n<p>As we ascended the mist and snow cover increased and some sleet fell.  We had a hot chocolate stop at Great Rigg before starting the more gentle ascent to Fairfield itself.<\/p>\n<p>The snow continued to deepen and the mist to thicken and after a quick lunch at the summit of Fairfield we decided to forget about Seat Sandal and head back down as quick as we could.  The problem was, we could only see about 50 metres and we couldn&#8217;t spot any obvious paths with all the snow cover.<\/p>\n<p>We would probably have headed back the way we came, but Wainwright suggested that, as long as you headed somewhere between West and South you&#8217;d have a south descent.  So we found some cairns and with the help of the GPS that we had on loan to keep our position known, we pretty much walked off on a compass bearing down a snow-covered scree slope.<\/p>\n<p>One of the purposes of this week was to see how we managed at hill walking and navigation on our own, and with a few simple tools we did, eventually, find our way out of quite a tricky situation.  Had Wainwright said that the descent was perilous, we would have gone back down the clear path we ascended, but despite his comment that Fairfield&#8217;s summit &#8220;is confusing in the mist&#8221;, we felt confident that the descent would not be dangerous.<\/p>\n<p>It proved that way, and despite having to navigate some boggy marsh to pick up the path again, we made it safely back to Grasmere and a much-needed cuppa.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Great British Pub<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We ventured out a bit in the evening at Sarah&#8217;s suggestion, and found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.britinn.net\/\">the Brittania Inn<\/a> in Elterwater.  A fantastic, cosy, friendly pub with good beer and excellent food.  We&#8217;re definitely big fans and will go back for sure!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Bonus Day of Walking &#8211; Silver How and Blea Rigg<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The weather for the rest of the week was forecast to get worse and worse so we thought our best walking was over and we were glad for a rest.<\/p>\n<p>It was much to our surprise, then, to wake on Thursday to glorious sunshine!  A bonus day&#8217;s walking was in the off.  We felt strong and confident after Wednesday&#8217;s escapades, and so headed up towards Silver How, a small but interesting peak, with the possibility of extending the trek to Blea Rigg a couple of miles away.<\/p>\n<p>The views of Fairfield and Great Rigg opened up nicely before us (well, behind us actually) as we ascended to give us a great view of where we&#8217;d been the previous day, and particularly of the descent from Fairfield we&#8217;d managed, to cried of &#8220;We did THAT!!!&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The peak of Silver How was blustery, and sleet and wind had temporarily moved in.  We considered heading home but took a call to go on a bit further and see what happened.  A good call in the end as the weather cleared again and we ended up having a great days walking with spectacular views all the way around.<\/p>\n<p>We made it to Great Rigg, with beautiful views of the rugged Langdale Pikes, and headed down via Easedale Tarn.  A great days walking and not too taxing either.<\/p>\n<p>In the evening we headed into Ambleside to check out the food there, and decided on the local curry house, The Tagore!  It was expensive, but slightly-above-standard Indian fare.  I liked it.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Coniston Cruises<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Friday was definitely going to rain.  So rather than walk, we had a rest and headed off on a boat trip on the National Trust&#8217;s Steam Yacht Gondola on Consiton Water.  We didn&#8217;t think much of Coniston village, but the boat was a great experience despite the rain!  Well worth a visit!<\/p>\n<p>On the way back we had a little drive around the far side of Coniston Water and headed back to Ambleside for dinner, which we&#8217;d booked at &#8220;The Priest Hole&#8221;.  Their early dinner deal was cheap, if unsurprising Mediterranean fare, with excellent service.  A good place to go for a break from English pub food.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Highlights<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And that was about it, other than a bit of shopping and some real Grasmere gingerbread (YUM!!!!).<\/p>\n<p>Highlights from the week were definitely our gorgeous B&amp;B, the walking (in all weathers), the Steam Yacht Gondola and the Britannia Inn.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll be back to the Lakes soon!!!<\/p>\n",

I read books and magazines.  And when it came to getting Fuzzy home I generally thought I knew what I was doing&#8230;and I was well prepared for a LOT of time and effort doing maintenance.<\/p>\n<p>My first few rides, having fallen off, were tentative, and followed by a close inspection of parts.  But as time has gone on I&#8217;ve become less precious and Fuzzy&#8217;s not had much maintenance for a while now.<\/p>\n<p>I kinda feel bad about this.  But also, he doesn&#8217;t really need it!  He&#8217;s a bit grubby, but he&#8217;s well lubricated, the brakes are still strong and the transmission is smooth as silk still.<\/p>\n<p>The key, it seems, it making sure he&#8217;s looked after when he&#8217;s wet.  The books and forums all said to pay lots of attention to the chain, and to wipe down when you&#8217;ve been out in the rain.  And sure enough, this seems to have kept the bike in good nick.<\/p>\n<p>I really MUST spend some time doing some proper cleaning and maintenance at some point but for now it seems that little and often is the key, and it&#8217;s much less work than I thought it would be.<\/p>\n",

Therefore, there are lots of outdoors shops.  We also had a little trip to the Outdoors Show at the NEC which had lots of outdoors shops.<\/p>\n<p>The thing about outdoors shops is that they&#8217;re full of things that are well designed, functional, clever, and mostly with some element of cool too.<\/p>\n<p>I find myself in awe of all these things.  I don&#8217;t really do &#8220;pretty&#8221; clothes, but if it keeps you cool,  dry or stops the wind chill getting in, if it dries quickly, protects you from the sun, becomes a different article of clothing (convertible trousers!), makes you seen in the dark, weighs less, takes up less space in your luggage, washes at 30 degrees or gives you superhuman powers then it&#8217;s on my list!<\/p>\n<p>Seriously, I could spend a lot of money in these places.

This means that I don&#8217;t so much buying of things that I want.<\/p>\n<p>But with us getting into the outdoors, I&#8217;ve been finding myself a bit of a shopaholic.<\/p>\n<p>On our recent holiday we were in this little town called Grasmere, which is ALL set up as a tourist place for people who like the outdoors.  Therefore, there are lots of outdoors shops.  We also had a little trip to the Outdoors Show at the NEC which had lots of outdoors shops.<\/p>\n<p>The thing about outdoors shops is that they&#8217;re full of things that are well designed, functional, clever, and mostly with some element of cool too.<\/p>\n<p>I find myself in awe of all these things.  I don&#8217;t really do &#8220;pretty&#8221; clothes, but if it keeps you cool,  dry or stops the wind chill getting in, if it dries quickly, protects you from the sun, becomes a different article of clothing (convertible trousers!), makes you seen in the dark, weighs less, takes up less space in your luggage, washes at 30 degrees or gives you superhuman powers then it&#8217;s on my list!<\/p>\n<p>Seriously, I could spend a lot of money in these places.  And it bothers me.<\/p>\n",
