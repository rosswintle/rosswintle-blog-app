He was stoic throughout and <a href=\"http:\/\/ccgi.peteramey.plus.com\/MyBlog\">his Blog<\/a>, if it&#8217;s still there when you read this, gives some amount of testimony to both his physical and mental strength.  He was a big thinker and took a detailed interest in his condition and his treatment and this was his way of getting through.<\/p>\n<p>I knew Peter from my days working at Praxis Critical Systems Limited.  He was one of the founder members of staff of that little company.  It was a huge privilege to work along someone like Peter who put incredible effort into doing what he believed was right.<\/p>\n<p>He was a software engineer in a very literal sense &#8211; he engineered software.  He developed tools to enable other to write software correctly, first time, that could be proven to be correct by mathematics.  He championed the SPARK subset of the Ada language and poured a lot of his time, both professional and personal, into that work.<\/p>\n<p>But he was more than just an engineer; he was a teacher and a philosopher.  He worked with more than just software, turning his hand to things mechanical (bikes, cars and miscellany) and musical (Saxophone and, I&#8217;m sure, others).  And he was more than the sum of all those parts too; an encourager, a man of great principle, passion and wit, a good communicator, and an inspiration to many.<\/p>\n<p>Peter was a thoroughly good bloke.  The world will miss him.  I will miss him!<\/p>\n",

He was stoic throughout and <a href=\"http:\/\/ccgi.peteramey.plus.com\/MyBlog\">his Blog<\/a>, if it&#8217;s still there when you read this, gives some amount of testimony to both his physical and mental strength.  He was a big thinker and took a detailed interest in his condition and his treatment and this was his way of getting through.<\/p>\n<p>I knew Peter from my days working at Praxis Critical Systems Limited.  He was one of the founder members of staff of that little company.  It was a huge privilege to work along someone like Peter who put incredible effort into doing what he believed was right.<\/p>\n<p>He was a software engineer in a very literal sense &#8211; he engineered software.  He developed tools to enable other to write software correctly, first time, that could be proven to be correct by mathematics.  He championed the SPARK subset of the Ada language and poured a lot of his time, both professional and personal, into that work.<\/p>\n<p>But he was more than just an engineer; he was a teacher and a philosopher.  He worked with more than just software, turning his hand to things mechanical (bikes, cars and miscellany) and musical (Saxophone and, I&#8217;m sure, others).  And he was more than the sum of all those parts too; an encourager, a man of great principle, passion and wit, a good communicator, and an inspiration to many.<\/p>\n<p>Peter was a thoroughly good bloke.  The world will miss him.  I will miss him!<\/p>\n",

BUT &#8211; the songs are back on my list this week and this is a special!<\/p>\n<p>A while ago a friend of ours who&#8217;s heading out to Kenya on a mission trip this summer, asked if I&#8217;d like to be an act in their fundraising &#8220;Stars in their Eyes&#8221; night.  Well, that&#8217;s not actually how it happened, but anyway, myself and three other guys decided that we would be The Beatles for one night only.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve left it a bit late really &#8211; the show is on Saturday evening &#8211; but we&#8217;ve just met up and had a run through the song, and I think we&#8217;ll just about have an act.<\/p>\n<p>Bizarrely, I don&#8217;t really know many Beatles&#8217; songs.  I mean, I don&#8217;t know them well.  I know lots of the songs but do I know the words?  Apparently not.  Bit of choruses and bridges but not a whole song.<\/p>\n<p>So this has become song 10, and may well put me back on track.  I didn&#8217;t really learn the last three very well so I may have some revisiting to do.<\/p>\n<p>A big &#8220;well done&#8221;, then, for getting us organised and actually picking the song, and a big cheer for Lydia, who&#8217;s faithfully following God&#8217;s call to service &#8211; may her fun night be truly blessed.<\/p>\n",

Well, that&#8217;s not actually how it happened, but anyway, myself and three other guys decided that we would be The Beatles for one night only.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve left it a bit late really &#8211; the show is on Saturday evening &#8211; but we&#8217;ve just met up and had a run through the song, and I think we&#8217;ll just about have an act.<\/p>\n<p>Bizarrely, I don&#8217;t really know many Beatles&#8217; songs.  I mean, I don&#8217;t know them well.  I know lots of the songs but do I know the words?  Apparently not.  Bit of choruses and bridges but not a whole song.<\/p>\n<p>So this has become song 10, and may well put me back on track.  I didn&#8217;t really learn the last three very well so I may have some revisiting to do.<\/p>\n<p>A big &#8220;well done&#8221;, then, for getting us organised and actually picking the song, and a big cheer for Lydia, who&#8217;s faithfully following God&#8217;s call to service &#8211; may her fun night be truly blessed.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Off to the Lakes&#8230;on our own!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So, after a long, hard start to the year we had an enjoyable Easter at home followed by a little holiday.<\/p>\n<p>Easter had proven to be cold and damp &#8211; even snow was around in northern England!  So we approached a hill walking holiday with a little anticipation.  Especially as it was the first time Sally and I were going to do some serious walking without some more experienced &#8220;peak baggers&#8221; with us.<\/p>\n<p>But Sarah and Guy prepared us well and so off we drove with many layers, maps, and Wainwright guides, to the Lake District.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Travelling Up<\/span><\/p>\n<p>On the way &#8211; or slightly out of the way &#8211; we called in to stay with our friends, the Brays, in York.  As always with them it was just like old times and we quickly got into chatting like old friends and having deep-and-meaningfuls about the nature of creativity &#8211; much to the bemusement of the people at the next table in the restaurant.<\/p>\n<p>They were very generous and gave us a happy start to our week off.<\/p>\n<p>We left York on a bright and crisp Tuesday morning.  This was soon left behind however as we climbed to the highest motorway point in the country, atop the M62 trans-Pennine expressway.  The hilltop murk didn&#8217;t last long though and, shortly after a trip back in time at Barnsley&#8217;s quite sea-side-esque services, the weather cleared again and we continued to Ambleside and on to Grasmere in sunshine again.<\/p>\n<p>Grasmere was a bit of a surprise.  A very small village but VERY touristy.  We were thankful that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amblesideonline.co.uk\/display\/oaklodge\/main.html\">our B&amp;B for the week, Oak Lodge<\/a>, was a little off the beaten track, nestled in the shadow of Helm Crag, about half a mile north of the village.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Up Helm Crag<\/span><\/p>\n<p>As the weather was good we unloaded and promptly went for a warm-up walk up to Helm Crag&#8217;s summit.  Wainwright was, as ever, a good guide, aided by the walkers returning down the path from the summit.  A short walk and about 800ft of climbing left us slightly breathless, but very much enjoying the views from the ragged summit. (Oh to be as good with words as AW himself!)<\/p>\n<p>Our first solo peak!  And some excellent views across the valley to the fells we were hoping to conquor the next day&#8230;looking dangerously snow-capped!<\/p>\n<p>Tuesday evening was spent at The Lamb in Grasmere &#8211; handy pub food but nothing special.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Fairfield, Snow, Compasses and GPS<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Wednesday was our big walking day then.  Sarah and Guy had suggested walking the entire &#8220;Fairfield Horseshoe&#8221; but we hadn&#8217;t quite hit British Summer Time, the days were short and we didn&#8217;t feel we&#8217;d safely make the 12-or-so miles round. So the plan was to tackle a portion of it, taking in Great Rigg, Fairfield and Seat Sandal.<\/p>\n<p>The climb to Great Rigg was deceptive.  We were never quite  sure if we&#8217;d ever got to the landmark of &#8220;Stone Arthur&#8221; on the way, and when we thought we did we weren&#8217;t sure we found the path.  We soon picked up the main path again though and the summit of Great Rigg was quite clear when we found it.<\/p>\n<p>As we ascended the mist and snow cover increased and some sleet fell.  We had a hot chocolate stop at Great Rigg before starting the more gentle ascent to Fairfield itself.<\/p>\n<p>The snow continued to deepen and the mist to thicken and after a quick lunch at the summit of Fairfield we decided to forget about Seat Sandal and head back down as quick as we could.  The problem was, we could only see about 50 metres and we couldn&#8217;t spot any obvious paths with all the snow cover.<\/p>\n<p>We would probably have headed back the way we came, but Wainwright suggested that, as long as you headed somewhere between West and South you&#8217;d have a south descent.  So we found some cairns and with the help of the GPS that we had on loan to keep our position known, we pretty much walked off on a compass bearing down a snow-covered scree slope.<\/p>\n<p>One of the purposes of this week was to see how we managed at hill walking and navigation on our own, and with a few simple tools we did, eventually, find our way out of quite a tricky situation.  Had Wainwright said that the descent was perilous, we would have gone back down the clear path we ascended, but despite his comment that Fairfield&#8217;s summit &#8220;is confusing in the mist&#8221;, we felt confident that the descent would not be dangerous.<\/p>\n<p>It proved that way, and despite having to navigate some boggy marsh to pick up the path again, we made it safely back to Grasmere and a much-needed cuppa.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Great British Pub<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We ventured out a bit in the evening at Sarah&#8217;s suggestion, and found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.britinn.net\/\">the Brittania Inn<\/a> in Elterwater.  A fantastic, cosy, friendly pub with good beer and excellent food.  We&#8217;re definitely big fans and will go back for sure!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Bonus Day of Walking &#8211; Silver How and Blea Rigg<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The weather for the rest of the week was forecast to get worse and worse so we thought our best walking was over and we were glad for a rest.<\/p>\n<p>It was much to our surprise, then, to wake on Thursday to glorious sunshine!  A bonus day&#8217;s walking was in the off.  We felt strong and confident after Wednesday&#8217;s escapades, and so headed up towards Silver How, a small but interesting peak, with the possibility of extending the trek to Blea Rigg a couple of miles away.<\/p>\n<p>The views of Fairfield and Great Rigg opened up nicely before us (well, behind us actually) as we ascended to give us a great view of where we&#8217;d been the previous day, and particularly of the descent from Fairfield we&#8217;d managed, to cried of &#8220;We did THAT!!!&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The peak of Silver How was blustery, and sleet and wind had temporarily moved in.  We considered heading home but took a call to go on a bit further and see what happened.  A good call in the end as the weather cleared again and we ended up having a great days walking with spectacular views all the way around.<\/p>\n<p>We made it to Great Rigg, with beautiful views of the rugged Langdale Pikes, and headed down via Easedale Tarn.  A great days walking and not too taxing either.<\/p>\n<p>In the evening we headed into Ambleside to check out the food there, and decided on the local curry house, The Tagore!  It was expensive, but slightly-above-standard Indian fare.  I liked it.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Coniston Cruises<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Friday was definitely going to rain.  So rather than walk, we had a rest and headed off on a boat trip on the National Trust&#8217;s Steam Yacht Gondola on Consiton Water.  We didn&#8217;t think much of Coniston village, but the boat was a great experience despite the rain!  Well worth a visit!<\/p>\n<p>On the way back we had a little drive around the far side of Coniston Water and headed back to Ambleside for dinner, which we&#8217;d booked at &#8220;The Priest Hole&#8221;.  Their early dinner deal was cheap, if unsurprising Mediterranean fare, with excellent service.  A good place to go for a break from English pub food.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Highlights<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And that was about it, other than a bit of shopping and some real Grasmere gingerbread (YUM!!!!).<\/p>\n<p>Highlights from the week were definitely our gorgeous B&amp;B, the walking (in all weathers), the Steam Yacht Gondola and the Britannia Inn.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll be back to the Lakes soon!!!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Off to the Lakes&#8230;on our own!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So, after a long, hard start to the year we had an enjoyable Easter at home followed by a little holiday.<\/p>\n<p>Easter had proven to be cold and damp &#8211; even snow was around in northern England!  So we approached a hill walking holiday with a little anticipation.  Especially as it was the first time Sally and I were going to do some serious walking without some more experienced &#8220;peak baggers&#8221; with us.<\/p>\n<p>But Sarah and Guy prepared us well and so off we drove with many layers, maps, and Wainwright guides, to the Lake District.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Travelling Up<\/span><\/p>\n<p>On the way &#8211; or slightly out of the way &#8211; we called in to stay with our friends, the Brays, in York.  As always with them it was just like old times and we quickly got into chatting like old friends and having deep-and-meaningfuls about the nature of creativity &#8211; much to the bemusement of the people at the next table in the restaurant.<\/p>\n<p>They were very generous and gave us a happy start to our week off.<\/p>\n<p>We left York on a bright and crisp Tuesday morning.  This was soon left behind however as we climbed to the highest motorway point in the country, atop the M62 trans-Pennine expressway.  The hilltop murk didn&#8217;t last long though and, shortly after a trip back in time at Barnsley&#8217;s quite sea-side-esque services, the weather cleared again and we continued to Ambleside and on to Grasmere in sunshine again.<\/p>\n<p>Grasmere was a bit of a surprise.  A very small village but VERY touristy.  We were thankful that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amblesideonline.co.uk\/display\/oaklodge\/main.html\">our B&amp;B for the week, Oak Lodge<\/a>, was a little off the beaten track, nestled in the shadow of Helm Crag, about half a mile north of the village.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Up Helm Crag<\/span><\/p>\n<p>As the weather was good we unloaded and promptly went for a warm-up walk up to Helm Crag&#8217;s summit.  Wainwright was, as ever, a good guide, aided by the walkers returning down the path from the summit.  A short walk and about 800ft of climbing left us slightly breathless, but very much enjoying the views from the ragged summit. (Oh to be as good with words as AW himself!)<\/p>\n<p>Our first solo peak!  And some excellent views across the valley to the fells we were hoping to conquor the next day&#8230;looking dangerously snow-capped!<\/p>\n<p>Tuesday evening was spent at The Lamb in Grasmere &#8211; handy pub food but nothing special.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Fairfield, Snow, Compasses and GPS<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Wednesday was our big walking day then.  Sarah and Guy had suggested walking the entire &#8220;Fairfield Horseshoe&#8221; but we hadn&#8217;t quite hit British Summer Time, the days were short and we didn&#8217;t feel we&#8217;d safely make the 12-or-so miles round. So the plan was to tackle a portion of it, taking in Great Rigg, Fairfield and Seat Sandal.<\/p>\n<p>The climb to Great Rigg was deceptive.  We were never quite  sure if we&#8217;d ever got to the landmark of &#8220;Stone Arthur&#8221; on the way, and when we thought we did we weren&#8217;t sure we found the path.  We soon picked up the main path again though and the summit of Great Rigg was quite clear when we found it.<\/p>\n<p>As we ascended the mist and snow cover increased and some sleet fell.  We had a hot chocolate stop at Great Rigg before starting the more gentle ascent to Fairfield itself.<\/p>\n<p>The snow continued to deepen and the mist to thicken and after a quick lunch at the summit of Fairfield we decided to forget about Seat Sandal and head back down as quick as we could.  The problem was, we could only see about 50 metres and we couldn&#8217;t spot any obvious paths with all the snow cover.<\/p>\n<p>We would probably have headed back the way we came, but Wainwright suggested that, as long as you headed somewhere between West and South you&#8217;d have a south descent.  So we found some cairns and with the help of the GPS that we had on loan to keep our position known, we pretty much walked off on a compass bearing down a snow-covered scree slope.<\/p>\n<p>One of the purposes of this week was to see how we managed at hill walking and navigation on our own, and with a few simple tools we did, eventually, find our way out of quite a tricky situation.  Had Wainwright said that the descent was perilous, we would have gone back down the clear path we ascended, but despite his comment that Fairfield&#8217;s summit &#8220;is confusing in the mist&#8221;, we felt confident that the descent would not be dangerous.<\/p>\n<p>It proved that way, and despite having to navigate some boggy marsh to pick up the path again, we made it safely back to Grasmere and a much-needed cuppa.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Great British Pub<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We ventured out a bit in the evening at Sarah&#8217;s suggestion, and found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.britinn.net\/\">the Brittania Inn<\/a> in Elterwater.  A fantastic, cosy, friendly pub with good beer and excellent food.  We&#8217;re definitely big fans and will go back for sure!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Bonus Day of Walking &#8211; Silver How and Blea Rigg<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The weather for the rest of the week was forecast to get worse and worse so we thought our best walking was over and we were glad for a rest.<\/p>\n<p>It was much to our surprise, then, to wake on Thursday to glorious sunshine!  A bonus day&#8217;s walking was in the off.  We felt strong and confident after Wednesday&#8217;s escapades, and so headed up towards Silver How, a small but interesting peak, with the possibility of extending the trek to Blea Rigg a couple of miles away.<\/p>\n<p>The views of Fairfield and Great Rigg opened up nicely before us (well, behind us actually) as we ascended to give us a great view of where we&#8217;d been the previous day, and particularly of the descent from Fairfield we&#8217;d managed, to cried of &#8220;We did THAT!!!&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The peak of Silver How was blustery, and sleet and wind had temporarily moved in.  We considered heading home but took a call to go on a bit further and see what happened.  A good call in the end as the weather cleared again and we ended up having a great days walking with spectacular views all the way around.<\/p>\n<p>We made it to Great Rigg, with beautiful views of the rugged Langdale Pikes, and headed down via Easedale Tarn.  A great days walking and not too taxing either.<\/p>\n<p>In the evening we headed into Ambleside to check out the food there, and decided on the local curry house, The Tagore!  It was expensive, but slightly-above-standard Indian fare.  I liked it.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Coniston Cruises<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Friday was definitely going to rain.  So rather than walk, we had a rest and headed off on a boat trip on the National Trust&#8217;s Steam Yacht Gondola on Consiton Water.  We didn&#8217;t think much of Coniston village, but the boat was a great experience despite the rain!  Well worth a visit!<\/p>\n<p>On the way back we had a little drive around the far side of Coniston Water and headed back to Ambleside for dinner, which we&#8217;d booked at &#8220;The Priest Hole&#8221;.  Their early dinner deal was cheap, if unsurprising Mediterranean fare, with excellent service.  A good place to go for a break from English pub food.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Highlights<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And that was about it, other than a bit of shopping and some real Grasmere gingerbread (YUM!!!!).<\/p>\n<p>Highlights from the week were definitely our gorgeous B&amp;B, the walking (in all weathers), the Steam Yacht Gondola and the Britannia Inn.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll be back to the Lakes soon!!!<\/p>\n",

I read books and magazines.  And when it came to getting Fuzzy home I generally thought I knew what I was doing&#8230;and I was well prepared for a LOT of time and effort doing maintenance.<\/p>\n<p>My first few rides, having fallen off, were tentative, and followed by a close inspection of parts.  But as time has gone on I&#8217;ve become less precious and Fuzzy&#8217;s not had much maintenance for a while now.<\/p>\n<p>I kinda feel bad about this.  But also, he doesn&#8217;t really need it!  He&#8217;s a bit grubby, but he&#8217;s well lubricated, the brakes are still strong and the transmission is smooth as silk still.<\/p>\n<p>The key, it seems, it making sure he&#8217;s looked after when he&#8217;s wet.  The books and forums all said to pay lots of attention to the chain, and to wipe down when you&#8217;ve been out in the rain.  And sure enough, this seems to have kept the bike in good nick.<\/p>\n<p>I really MUST spend some time doing some proper cleaning and maintenance at some point but for now it seems that little and often is the key, and it&#8217;s much less work than I thought it would be.<\/p>\n",

There&#8217;s one really great feeling that you get when doing a circular route, and that&#8217;s the feeling of turning 90 or more degrees, out of an uphill road with a headwind, onto a downhill road with a tailwind.  It&#8217;s a truly glorious feeling and it makes me very happy indeed!<\/p>\n",

This means that I don&#8217;t so much buying of things that I want.<\/p>\n<p>But with us getting into the outdoors, I&#8217;ve been finding myself a bit of a shopaholic.<\/p>\n<p>On our recent holiday we were in this little town called Grasmere, which is ALL set up as a tourist place for people who like the outdoors.  Therefore, there are lots of outdoors shops.  We also had a little trip to the Outdoors Show at the NEC which had lots of outdoors shops.<\/p>\n<p>The thing about outdoors shops is that they&#8217;re full of things that are well designed, functional, clever, and mostly with some element of cool too.<\/p>\n<p>I find myself in awe of all these things.  I don&#8217;t really do &#8220;pretty&#8221; clothes, but if it keeps you cool,  dry or stops the wind chill getting in, if it dries quickly, protects you from the sun, becomes a different article of clothing (convertible trousers!), makes you seen in the dark, weighs less, takes up less space in your luggage, washes at 30 degrees or gives you superhuman powers then it&#8217;s on my list!<\/p>\n<p>Seriously, I could spend a lot of money in these places.

Therefore, there are lots of outdoors shops.  We also had a little trip to the Outdoors Show at the NEC which had lots of outdoors shops.<\/p>\n<p>The thing about outdoors shops is that they&#8217;re full of things that are well designed, functional, clever, and mostly with some element of cool too.<\/p>\n<p>I find myself in awe of all these things.  I don&#8217;t really do &#8220;pretty&#8221; clothes, but if it keeps you cool,  dry or stops the wind chill getting in, if it dries quickly, protects you from the sun, becomes a different article of clothing (convertible trousers!), makes you seen in the dark, weighs less, takes up less space in your luggage, washes at 30 degrees or gives you superhuman powers then it&#8217;s on my list!<\/p>\n<p>Seriously, I could spend a lot of money in these places.  And it bothers me.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>I&#8217;m beind with updates again, including a big write up of our holiday exploits.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a busy week, and with a 15 hour day at work on Wednesday, I was due a few late morning in, so I&#8217;ve been making use of my longer, 8.5 mile commute to work.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had two little incidents that are worth writing up.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday I did something a bit silly.  I was frustrated following a tractor that was doing about 12mph on a single track road.  It&#8217;s was slightly downhill and the wind was behind me so I should have been able to do a steady 25mph, if not more.  There were three cars backed up behind it and I was following behind them.  I saw that the road was getting a bit wider, so I nipped up the outside of the cars and went for it to get past the tractor.<\/p>\n<p>It was only when I pulled alongside that I noticed the road wasn&#8217;t too good at the edges.  So here I am, on the road bike, riding over rough and unpredictable ground, with a great big tractor about 4 feet to my left.<\/p>\n<p>It seemed like a good idea at the time, but looking back on it I really scared myself.  One wrong move and I was under a tractor wheel.  I&#8217;ll be more careful next time.<\/p>\n<p>So if Thursday&#8217;s ride in had something that could have damaged me physically, today&#8217;s ride home presented an overtaking opportunity that could have dented my pride.  I read an article a while ago (that I can&#8217;t find now) about overtaking, and how you need to be careful &#8216;cos if the person you pass is better than you they&#8217;ll hunt you down and get you back &#8211; to your shame!<\/p>\n<p>And so, a mile or so into my 5.5 miles home, I catch up with a woman on a road bike.  She has pretty strong looking legs, a nice bike with a ridiculously small cassette (that&#8217;s the rear gears), some semi-pro-looking, sponsored bike wear and jersey pockets stuffed full of stuff.  All of which says &#8220;I&#8217;m on a long ride and quite capable of outpacing you for a long time&#8221;.  But she was doing about 15mph up a slight incline &#8211; where I&#8217;d be doing 19 or 20!<\/p>\n<p>What do you?  Is it polite to breeze past in my relatively-amateur-looking gear on my commute home?  It seems like an insult.  And if I do pass is she going to hunt me down and breeze effortlessly past me shouting that I should try harder?  Should I wave?  Say &#8220;hi&#8221;?  Ring my bell?  All compounded by that fact that she&#8217;s a woman and any form of communication could be misinterpreted.<\/p>\n<p>AARRGHH!!!!!<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, just like with the tractor, I decided to go for it.  I sped up.  I got past.  I maintained my extra pace for as long as my tired legs would let me.   I looked back.  And she was nowhere to be seen.<\/p>\n<p>Result!<\/p>\n<p>In fact, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/news\/article\/humour-a-passing-score-12522\">FatCyclist&#8217;s overtaking point system<\/a> I reckon I got 6 points for passing one cyclist!  Though I&#8217;m not sure if the shaved legs points count for a woman.<\/p>\n<p>So, body and pride intact after 2 risky manoeuvres &#8211; it&#8217;s been a good week&#8217;s cycling!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;m beind with updates again, including a big write up of our holiday exploits.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a busy week, and with a 15 hour day at work on Wednesday, I was due a few late morning in, so I&#8217;ve been making use of my longer, 8.5 mile commute to work.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had two little incidents that are worth writing up.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday I did something a bit silly.  I was frustrated following a tractor that was doing about 12mph on a single track road.  It&#8217;s was slightly downhill and the wind was behind me so I should have been able to do a steady 25mph, if not more.  There were three cars backed up behind it and I was following behind them.  I saw that the road was getting a bit wider, so I nipped up the outside of the cars and went for it to get past the tractor.<\/p>\n<p>It was only when I pulled alongside that I noticed the road wasn&#8217;t too good at the edges.  So here I am, on the road bike, riding over rough and unpredictable ground, with a great big tractor about 4 feet to my left.<\/p>\n<p>It seemed like a good idea at the time, but looking back on it I really scared myself.  One wrong move and I was under a tractor wheel.  I&#8217;ll be more careful next time.<\/p>\n<p>So if Thursday&#8217;s ride in had something that could have damaged me physically, today&#8217;s ride home presented an overtaking opportunity that could have dented my pride.  I read an article a while ago (that I can&#8217;t find now) about overtaking, and how you need to be careful &#8216;cos if the person you pass is better than you they&#8217;ll hunt you down and get you back &#8211; to your shame!<\/p>\n<p>And so, a mile or so into my 5.5 miles home, I catch up with a woman on a road bike.  She has pretty strong looking legs, a nice bike with a ridiculously small cassette (that&#8217;s the rear gears), some semi-pro-looking, sponsored bike wear and jersey pockets stuffed full of stuff.  All of which says &#8220;I&#8217;m on a long ride and quite capable of outpacing you for a long time&#8221;.  But she was doing about 15mph up a slight incline &#8211; where I&#8217;d be doing 19 or 20!<\/p>\n<p>What do you?  Is it polite to breeze past in my relatively-amateur-looking gear on my commute home?  It seems like an insult.  And if I do pass is she going to hunt me down and breeze effortlessly past me shouting that I should try harder?  Should I wave?  Say &#8220;hi&#8221;?  Ring my bell?  All compounded by that fact that she&#8217;s a woman and any form of communication could be misinterpreted.<\/p>\n<p>AARRGHH!!!!!<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, just like with the tractor, I decided to go for it.  I sped up.  I got past.  I maintained my extra pace for as long as my tired legs would let me.   I looked back.  And she was nowhere to be seen.<\/p>\n<p>Result!<\/p>\n<p>In fact, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/news\/article\/humour-a-passing-score-12522\">FatCyclist&#8217;s overtaking point system<\/a> I reckon I got 6 points for passing one cyclist!  Though I&#8217;m not sure if the shaved legs points count for a woman.<\/p>\n<p>So, body and pride intact after 2 risky manoeuvres &#8211; it&#8217;s been a good week&#8217;s cycling!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>It&#8217;s been a while and we&#8217;re off on holiday tomorrow so here&#8217;s a few thoughts to jot down before I go.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Easter and &#8220;The Passion&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s Easter Sunday.  Easter is obviously a hijacked pagan festival &#8211; witness the eggs and bunnies that symbolise new life as spring approaches &#8211; heck the date of easter even changes with the lunar cycle!  But, regardless of that, this is the time when Christians celebrate that Jesus rose from the dead and brought us a new and different sort of life.  God has forgiven us of the wrong we&#8217;ve done and we can follow Jesus in faith knowing that he died and was brought back from the dead to live forever.  I join with the many today who shout &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221; &#8211; Praise the Lord!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a good time of reflecting on what Jesus did and why it means so much to us.  It<br \/>saddens me that people have so little understanding of the man at the centre of the Christian faith.  I&#8217;m not the sort to ram it down people throats, but if they ask I&#8217;ll happily explain, and highly recommend, my faith, that I have come to see as the truth.  But the<br \/>occasions to explain to people are sadly limited, even at this time of the year.<\/p>\n<p>Encouragingly, this year, the BBC has done a screening of a 4-part film of &#8220;The Passion&#8221; &#8211; the events of the last few days of Jesus&#8217; life.  This has been very interesting to watch.  Many have tried to interpret the events in their own ways down the years.  I like the BBC&#8217;s attempt.  It feels quite real and give you a good sense of what Jerusalem was like at the time, and some insight into why certain people may have done what they did on that first Easter.   What it lacked for me was a spiritual element &#8211; little prayer, no angels, no miracles, no fear of God.  I thought the  pharisees more interested in what was going on that then disciples.  It felt earthly, lacking a heavenly God.  A tale told, but somehow lacking the essence of what was really going on.  A political revolution was definitely going on, but the &#8220;kingdom of God&#8221; seemed relegated to little more than a nice-to-have desire of the heart.  I think it lacked&#8230;well&#8230;passion!<\/p>\n<p>But good on the Beeb for showing such a thing.  And don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; it was a REALLY good re-enactment of what happened &#8211; captivating and compelling.  It was just very non-committal too.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and there seems to have been a lot of chocolate around.  Not sure what that&#8217;s about.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Small Group Leading<\/p>\n<p><\/span><span>I attend a thing called a &#8220;Small Group&#8221;.  This is a group of about 10 people from church who meet during the week to chat, pray, study the bible and share news together.  Small groups are an important part of church life as they enable people to connect and meet in God&#8217;s presence in a deeper way than you can in a larger group on the Sunday.<\/p>\n<p>This week I led the group in a study.  It was the first time I&#8217;d done this for a long time and it seemed to go down well, but I&#8217;m not entirely sure.  It&#8217;s always hard to judge how these things look from the other side.  I really enjoy preparing and leading groups like this and I hope I&#8217;ll get to do it again.<br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/>Garden<\/span><\/p>\n<p>With 3 days off before our trip away, we were meant to be gardening.  Both digging and planting.  But the weather&#8217;s been AWFUL.  Snow, sleet, hail, rain, gales, freezing temperatures.  So that&#8217;ll have to wait. Longer days are coming so I suspect some evening digging may be required.  We&#8217;ve not planted a thing yet and only have a small patch of weedless garden.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">House<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So instead we&#8217;ve been concentrating on the house.  Sally&#8217;s a star with painting and has made great progress on the dining room.  We&#8217;ve committed quite a lot of the last couple of days to tidying up the edges and we&#8217;re VERY nearly done.  Here&#8217;s the before and after:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-a01UKeIXI\/AAAAAAAAB44\/mpaIwdDVJmc\/s1600-h\/IMG_0035.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-a01UKeIXI\/AAAAAAAAB44\/mpaIwdDVJmc\/s400\/IMG_0035.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-a1P0KeIYI\/AAAAAAAAB5A\/nMnvumVdO0o\/s1600-h\/IMG_0415.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-a1P0KeIYI\/AAAAAAAAB5A\/nMnvumVdO0o\/s400\/IMG_0415.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>As well as painting we&#8217;ve also put up another nice light.  I confess, I thought this was a bit over the top for the small room, but Sally loves it and it is a beautiful thing and we got it for half price.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-bGlUKeIZI\/AAAAAAAAB5I\/oE0l1b0x_I8\/s1600-h\/IMG_0411.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;cursor:pointer;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-bGlUKeIZI\/AAAAAAAAB5I\/oE0l1b0x_I8\/s320\/IMG_0411.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>Wiring the new light in was interesting (as are most thing involving the electrics in our house).  We have &#8220;loop in&#8221; wiring, so three cables come in from the ceiling; power in, power out, and the loop to the switch.  This makes for a complicated bit of wiring to get the light connected up.  However, in this fitting, the live and neutrals seemed to be wired backwards.  All the black cables were where the reds should be, and vice versa.  A quick chat with my dad and a few diagrams later and it appeared to be safe.  After all, the previous fitting worked!<\/p>\n<p>It seems that normally you have the three live wires tied together with power coming back from the switch to the light on the &#8220;spare&#8221; neutral cable.  In our case, we had the three neutrals tied together with the spare live coming back from the switch.  From a &#8220;logical&#8221; circuit point of view this means that the switch is on the neutral side of the light, rather than the live.  There was no reason why it shouldn&#8217;t work.  And, indeed, it does!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I should be more scared of electricals than I am.  I&#8217;ll get a nasty shock one day.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Rats!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Darn it.  The rats are back.  We&#8217;ve heard vague scratchings recently and dismissed it, but they were definitely up there last night.  I can only see one little hole outside that they might be getting in.  We&#8217;ve put fresh poison down and some proper rat traps in the loft.  Grrr&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Cycling<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Not much going on on the cycling front.  I&#8217;ve been doing longer trips into work and back and generally enjoying being out on the Felt.  Both bikes need a good clean which I was hoping to do this weekend and haven&#8217;t got around too.  Oh, and I had to replace another spoke on the Raleigh.  Not sure how this one broke but fixing it was easy having done it before.<\/p>\n<p>Had other transport problems too when the car started spluttering a bit on the way back from the outdoors show.  Kwik Fit fixed it with a new clamp on the exhaust &#8211; the existing one had come loose.  They charged me \u00a32.  Bargain!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Other Developments<\/span><\/p>\n<p>There are some other interesting developments going on that I can&#8217;t really talk about too.  These are very much connected to our spiritual and church life and involve some interesting changes that are going on around us.  Some of this is stuff that we thing God has been telling us might happen in some way over the last year so it&#8217;s very exciting seeing how that might come to fruition.  Please, if anyone&#8217;s reading, don&#8217;t ask us any questions because we can&#8217;t answer them.  I probably shouldn&#8217;t even be putting the teaser out.<\/p>\n<p>More will be apparent in the coming months, I hope!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Holiday<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And so to probably our most anticipated holiday so far.  We&#8217;re only going to York and the Lake Distri<br \/>\nct, but we&#8217;ve both had such a hard few weeks at work that we REALLY need it.  We&#8217;re looking forward to our first bit of fell walking on our own (how will we get on without a more experienced guide?), and we&#8217;ll hopefully have a rest in there too.<\/p>\n<p>I will probably be quiet for a few days, both Blog and Twitter-wise.  Back with some photos on Saturday!<\/p>\n",

        "title": "General Easter Update",
        "content": "<p>It&#8217;s been a while and we&#8217;re off on holiday tomorrow so here&#8217;s a few thoughts to jot down before I go.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Easter and &#8220;The Passion&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s Easter Sunday.  Easter is obviously a hijacked pagan festival &#8211; witness the eggs and bunnies that symbolise new life as spring approaches &#8211; heck the date of easter even changes with the lunar cycle!  But, regardless of that, this is the time when Christians celebrate that Jesus rose from the dead and brought us a new and different sort of life.  God has forgiven us of the wrong we&#8217;ve done and we can follow Jesus in faith knowing that he died and was brought back from the dead to live forever.  I join with the many today who shout &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221; &#8211; Praise the Lord!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a good time of reflecting on what Jesus did and why it means so much to us.  It<br \/>saddens me that people have so little understanding of the man at the centre of the Christian faith.  I&#8217;m not the sort to ram it down people throats, but if they ask I&#8217;ll happily explain, and highly recommend, my faith, that I have come to see as the truth.  But the<br \/>occasions to explain to people are sadly limited, even at this time of the year.<\/p>\n<p>Encouragingly, this year, the BBC has done a screening of a 4-part film of &#8220;The Passion&#8221; &#8211; the events of the last few days of Jesus&#8217; life.  This has been very interesting to watch.  Many have tried to interpret the events in their own ways down the years.  I like the BBC&#8217;s attempt.  It feels quite real and give you a good sense of what Jerusalem was like at the time, and some insight into why certain people may have done what they did on that first Easter.   What it lacked for me was a spiritual element &#8211; little prayer, no angels, no miracles, no fear of God.  I thought the  pharisees more interested in what was going on that then disciples.  It felt earthly, lacking a heavenly God.  A tale told, but somehow lacking the essence of what was really going on.  A political revolution was definitely going on, but the &#8220;kingdom of God&#8221; seemed relegated to little more than a nice-to-have desire of the heart.  I think it lacked&#8230;well&#8230;passion!<\/p>\n<p>But good on the Beeb for showing such a thing.  And don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; it was a REALLY good re-enactment of what happened &#8211; captivating and compelling.  It was just very non-committal too.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and there seems to have been a lot of chocolate around.  Not sure what that&#8217;s about.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Small Group Leading<\/p>\n<p><\/span><span>I attend a thing called a &#8220;Small Group&#8221;.  This is a group of about 10 people from church who meet during the week to chat, pray, study the bible and share news together.  Small groups are an important part of church life as they enable people to connect and meet in God&#8217;s presence in a deeper way than you can in a larger group on the Sunday.<\/p>\n<p>This week I led the group in a study.  It was the first time I&#8217;d done this for a long time and it seemed to go down well, but I&#8217;m not entirely sure.  It&#8217;s always hard to judge how these things look from the other side.  I really enjoy preparing and leading groups like this and I hope I&#8217;ll get to do it again.<br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/>Garden<\/span><\/p>\n<p>With 3 days off before our trip away, we were meant to be gardening.  Both digging and planting.  But the weather&#8217;s been AWFUL.  Snow, sleet, hail, rain, gales, freezing temperatures.  So that&#8217;ll have to wait. Longer days are coming so I suspect some evening digging may be required.  We&#8217;ve not planted a thing yet and only have a small patch of weedless garden.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">House<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So instead we&#8217;ve been concentrating on the house.  Sally&#8217;s a star with painting and has made great progress on the dining room.  We&#8217;ve committed quite a lot of the last couple of days to tidying up the edges and we&#8217;re VERY nearly done.  Here&#8217;s the before and after:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-a01UKeIXI\/AAAAAAAAB44\/mpaIwdDVJmc\/s1600-h\/IMG_0035.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-a01UKeIXI\/AAAAAAAAB44\/mpaIwdDVJmc\/s400\/IMG_0035.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-a1P0KeIYI\/AAAAAAAAB5A\/nMnvumVdO0o\/s1600-h\/IMG_0415.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-a1P0KeIYI\/AAAAAAAAB5A\/nMnvumVdO0o\/s400\/IMG_0415.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>As well as painting we&#8217;ve also put up another nice light.  I confess, I thought this was a bit over the top for the small room, but Sally loves it and it is a beautiful thing and we got it for half price.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-bGlUKeIZI\/AAAAAAAAB5I\/oE0l1b0x_I8\/s1600-h\/IMG_0411.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;cursor:pointer;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-bGlUKeIZI\/AAAAAAAAB5I\/oE0l1b0x_I8\/s320\/IMG_0411.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>Wiring the new light in was interesting (as are most thing involving the electrics in our house).  We have &#8220;loop in&#8221; wiring, so three cables come in from the ceiling; power in, power out, and the loop to the switch.  This makes for a complicated bit of wiring to get the light connected up.  However, in this fitting, the live and neutrals seemed to be wired backwards.  All the black cables were where the reds should be, and vice versa.  A quick chat with my dad and a few diagrams later and it appeared to be safe.  After all, the previous fitting worked!<\/p>\n<p>It seems that normally you have the three live wires tied together with power coming back from the switch to the light on the &#8220;spare&#8221; neutral cable.  In our case, we had the three neutrals tied together with the spare live coming back from the switch.  From a &#8220;logical&#8221; circuit point of view this means that the switch is on the neutral side of the light, rather than the live.  There was no reason why it shouldn&#8217;t work.  And, indeed, it does!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I should be more scared of electricals than I am.  I&#8217;ll get a nasty shock one day.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Rats!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Darn it.  The rats are back.  We&#8217;ve heard vague scratchings recently and dismissed it, but they were definitely up there last night.  I can only see one little hole outside that they might be getting in.  We&#8217;ve put fresh poison down and some proper rat traps in the loft.  Grrr&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Cycling<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Not much going on on the cycling front.  I&#8217;ve been doing longer trips into work and back and generally enjoying being out on the Felt.  Both bikes need a good clean which I was hoping to do this weekend and haven&#8217;t got around too.  Oh, and I had to replace another spoke on the Raleigh.  Not sure how this one broke but fixing it was easy having done it before.<\/p>\n<p>Had other transport problems too when the car started spluttering a bit on the way back from the outdoors show.  Kwik Fit fixed it with a new clamp on the exhaust &#8211; the existing one had come loose.  They charged me \u00a32.  Bargain!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Other Developments<\/span><\/p>\n<p>There are some other interesting developments going on that I can&#8217;t really talk about too.  These are very much connected to our spiritual and church life and involve some interesting changes that are going on around us.  Some of this is stuff that we thing God has been telling us might happen in some way over the last year so it&#8217;s very exciting seeing how that might come to fruition.  Please, if anyone&#8217;s reading, don&#8217;t ask us any questions because we can&#8217;t answer them.  I probably shouldn&#8217;t even be putting the teaser out.<\/p>\n<p>More will be apparent in the coming months, I hope!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Holiday<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And so to probably our most anticipated holiday so far.  We&#8217;re only going to York and the Lake Distri<br \/>\nct, but we&#8217;ve both had such a hard few weeks at work that we REALLY need it.  We&#8217;re looking forward to our first bit of fell walking on our own (how will we get on without a more experienced guide?), and we&#8217;ll hopefully have a rest in there too.<\/p>\n<p>I will probably be quiet for a few days, both Blog and Twitter-wise.  Back with some photos on Saturday!<\/p>\n",

Singing and playing this song at the same time is really hard.  So I know all the words, and I know all the music, but I can&#8217;t do both at the same time!<\/p>\n<p>Last week was Song 8 and I had a go at learning The Monkees &#8220;Daydream Believer&#8221;.  Another piece that I know all the words to already and so it should just be a case of committing the chords to memory, but again, rhythm got me stuck.  This really isn&#8217;t a guitar song&#8230;at least, not without some major re-arrangement.  So I gave up quite quickly.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve even memorised the chords.  Consider this dropped from the list!<\/p>\n<p>And so I approached song 9.  Leornard Cohen&#8217;s &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221;, which has been covered by many people in many different ways.  I&#8217;m attempting a fairly standard take of it on the accoustic guitar.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been simultaneously looking forward to and dreading this one.  When I mentioned it to Sally she expressed some doubt about it &#8211; it sounded to her like quite a complicated piece.  But I reckoned the chords weren&#8217;t too difficult (I&#8217;m sufficiently musical that I can tell a complicated chord sequence).  But any song that&#8217;s really a melancholy piano piece that will have to be carefully picked on the guitar is gonna be a bit hard.<\/p>\n<p>So I was delighted to find it not all that hard at all.  OK, so I don&#8217;t do it justice &#8211; it&#8217;s a beautiful song and I play it clumsily &#8211; but I can play C, F, G, Em and Am, and get between them, pretty OK.  I&#8217;ve still got some words to learn but most of them are there.  And it&#8217;s been a real joy to do.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m away on holiday next week so the next song may have to wait.  I&#8217;m well behind but have nearly 10 under my belt.  That&#8217;s 10 songs more than I knew by heart three months ago!  Yay!<\/p>\n",

Singing and playing this song at the same time is really hard.  So I know all the words, and I know all the music, but I can&#8217;t do both at the same time!<\/p>\n<p>Last week was Song 8 and I had a go at learning The Monkees &#8220;Daydream Believer&#8221;.  Another piece that I know all the words to already and so it should just be a case of committing the chords to memory, but again, rhythm got me stuck.  This really isn&#8217;t a guitar song&#8230;at least, not without some major re-arrangement.  So I gave up quite quickly.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve even memorised the chords.  Consider this dropped from the list!<\/p>\n<p>And so I approached song 9.  Leornard Cohen&#8217;s &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221;, which has been covered by many people in many different ways.  I&#8217;m attempting a fairly standard take of it on the accoustic guitar.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been simultaneously looking forward to and dreading this one.  When I mentioned it to Sally she expressed some doubt about it &#8211; it sounded to her like quite a complicated piece.  But I reckoned the chords weren&#8217;t too difficult (I&#8217;m sufficiently musical that I can tell a complicated chord sequence).  But any song that&#8217;s really a melancholy piano piece that will have to be carefully picked on the guitar is gonna be a bit hard.<\/p>\n<p>So I was delighted to find it not all that hard at all.  OK, so I don&#8217;t do it justice &#8211; it&#8217;s a beautiful song and I play it clumsily &#8211; but I can play C, F, G, Em and Am, and get between them, pretty OK.  I&#8217;ve still got some words to learn but most of them are there.  And it&#8217;s been a real joy to do.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m away on holiday next week so the next song may have to wait.  I&#8217;m well behind but have nearly 10 under my belt.  That&#8217;s 10 songs more than I knew by heart three months ago!  Yay!<\/p>\n",
