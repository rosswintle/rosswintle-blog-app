So I&#8217;m not officially a &#8220;web designer&#8221; as well as a &#8220;web developer&#8221;! I&#8217;m pretty proud of what we&#8217;ve achieved and it came in under budget too. (P.S. Thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.34sp.com\/\">34SP.com<\/a> for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.34sp.com\/charity-hosting\">free charity hosting<\/a>!)<\/li><li>I finished off building a small, <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/\">Laravel<\/a>-based proxy API for <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/\">MailChimp<\/a>.<br\/><br\/>The client was sending requests from a third-party tool into MailChimp and they were sometimes getting lost in transit, and the third party tool had no logs or error checking or anything.<br\/><br\/>This proxy takes the request, validates it, and passes it on to MailChimp. The benefit of the proxy is that it logs ALL signup attempts, regardless of validity, and records errors that come back from the MailChimp API.<\/li><li>I did some post-go-live snagging on a recently launched <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/\">WordPress<\/a> site.<\/li><li>I worked more on <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/08\/about-schoolbot\/\">SchoolBot<\/a> to try to get it to a point where I can demo it to demonstrate its usefulness. It now does better keyword recognition (though still not natural language processing), and has a number of new APIs that allow data to be got into a website using the WordPress plugin that I&#8217;m building alongside it. This remains a non-public project, and is only really for my own use and testing.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow &#8211; after really posting a lot in the previous week, last week I managed a grand total of ZERO blog posts. I will try to do better this week. I guess that&#8217;s what going back to work does! But I did dig up and share some old content that was relevant this week:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I regurgitated\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2012\/05\/parenthood-the-sum-of-my-knowledge\/\">this old post about everything I know about parenting<\/a>.<\/li><li>As much as I enjoy public speaking, I&#8217;ve only actually done three conference talks!

This is probably as much for my benefit as anything, but let me know if you find it interesting or helpful. Use the comments &#8211; I&#8217;m happy to tweak the format to make it more useful for others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It was back to work &#8220;full time&#8221; this week as kids went back to school.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I can now say that <a href=\"https:\/\/safestrongfree.org.uk\/\">the site I launched the week before<\/a> was for a brilliant little Devon-based charity called <a href=\"https:\/\/safestrongfree.org.uk\/\">CAP UK<\/a> that do assault prevention education, workshops and resources.<br\/><br\/>This is the first project where I&#8217;ve not had to work with a graphic designer &#8211; I did some iterative design in the browser and that was sufficient. So I&#8217;m not officially a &#8220;web designer&#8221; as well as a &#8220;web developer&#8221;! I&#8217;m pretty proud of what we&#8217;ve achieved and it came in under budget too. (P.S. Thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.34sp.com\/\">34SP.com<\/a> for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.34sp.com\/charity-hosting\">free charity hosting<\/a>!)<\/li><li>I finished off building a small, <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/\">Laravel<\/a>-based proxy API for <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/\">MailChimp<\/a>.<br\/><br\/>The client was sending requests from a third-party tool into MailChimp and they were sometimes getting lost in transit, and the third party tool had no logs or error checking or anything.<br\/><br\/>This proxy takes the request, validates it, and passes it on to MailChimp. The benefit of the proxy is that it logs ALL signup attempts, regardless of validity, and records errors that come back from the MailChimp API.<\/li><li>I did some post-go-live snagging on a recently launched <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/\">WordPress<\/a> site.<\/li><li>I worked more on <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/08\/about-schoolbot\/\">SchoolBot<\/a> to try to get it to a point where I can demo it to demonstrate its usefulness. It now does better keyword recognition (though still not natural language processing), and has a number of new APIs that allow data to be got into a website using the WordPress plugin that I&#8217;m building alongside it. This remains a non-public project, and is only really for my own use and testing.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow &#8211; after really posting a lot in the previous week, last week I managed a grand total of ZERO blog posts. I will try to do better this week. I guess that&#8217;s what going back to work does! But I did dig up and share some old content that was relevant this week:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I regurgitated\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2012\/05\/parenthood-the-sum-of-my-knowledge\/\">this old post about everything I know about parenting<\/a>.<\/li><li>As much as I enjoy public speaking, I&#8217;ve only actually done three conference talks! Two of them I am REALLY proud of. So I put out a reminder of &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.tv\/2016\/08\/09\/ross-wintle-you-are-creative\/\">You Are Creative<\/a>&#8221; If you think you&#8217;re NOT a creative person, I&#8217;d like to try to convince you otherwise:<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress-tv wp-block-embed is-type-video\">\n<iframe title=\"VideoPress Video Player\" aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/video.wordpress.com\/embed\/x6vaH1Tn?hd=1&amp;cover=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen allow='clipboard-write'><\/iframe><script src='https:\/\/v0.wordpress.com\/js\/next\/videopress-iframe.js?m=1674852142'><\/script>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pins: things I read and remembered<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Things I&#8217;ve bookmarked this week<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/antvis\/f2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">antvis\/f2: ??An elegant, interactive and flexible charting library for mobile.<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cas.org.uk\/publications\/locked-out-smartphone-deficit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Locked Out: The Smartphone Deficit | Citizens Advice Scotland<\/a>\u00a0 &#8211; excellent report about how many people are smartphone only, and the issues they face<br\/><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.usejournal.com\/wordpress-is-at-a-crossroads-133638714a52\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress is at a Crossroads \u2013 Noteworthy &#8211; The Journal Blog<\/a>\u00a0&#8211; interesting Gutenberg perspective<br\/><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/bubble.is\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Visual Programming | Bubble<\/a>\u00a0&#8211; a web app for visually building web apps &#8211; should I fear for my job?<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.webdesignmuseum.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Web Design Museum<\/a>\u00a0&#8211; this did the rounds several times &#8211; web nostalgia!<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/streamlineicons.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Streamline 3.0 \u2013 The World&#8217;s Largest Icon Library<\/a>\u00a0 &#8211; given that I do a lot of UI design these days, the hefty introductory discount on this massive icon set was attractive.<\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kateraworth.com\/animations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist | Kate Raworth<\/a>\u00a0 &#8211; Interesting economic ideas &#8211; not sure we can make it work.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/novathemes.beyondco.de\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nova Theme Generator<\/a>\u00a0&#8211; Laravel Nova looks great.

Just putting simple data into a database and pulling simple data out again!&#8221;. And you&#8217;re right. That&#8217;s exactly what it is. But doing it in a structured way for a given niche is where the value is here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding structure to data means you can do interesting things with it. For example, I can automatically display today&#8217;s meal from the menus and meals lists on the website now, without anyone having to update the website!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that schools are the only places where making data more structured can help. I want to get SchoolBot in front of some users and schools and see what they make of it. If it&#8217;s useful, then maybe there are other places we can build!<\/p>\n",

Just putting simple data into a database and pulling simple data out again!&#8221;. And you&#8217;re right. That&#8217;s exactly what it is. But doing it in a structured way for a given niche is where the value is here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding structure to data means you can do interesting things with it. For example, I can automatically display today&#8217;s meal from the menus and meals lists on the website now, without anyone having to update the website!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that schools are the only places where making data more structured can help. I want to get SchoolBot in front of some users and schools and see what they make of it. If it&#8217;s useful, then maybe there are other places we can build!<\/p>\n",

This totally isn&#8217;t their fault! They don&#8217;t know what they don&#8217;t know. And my job is to educate and guide them in the right direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This lead me to thinking I should do a &#8220;WordPress Website Drivers License&#8221; course that covers some of the hidden aspects of running a website and helps people understand not only what they need to do, but why they need to do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It <em>could<\/em> be generic, rather than WordPress specific. But focussing on WordPress would give me a chance to talk about tools and settings that are specific to that platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a flip side to this though: why does WordPress, out of the box, have so many basic security and performance problems that require initial lockdown? Sure, some &#8220;features&#8221; of WordPress are wide open to abuse if you can get an admin login, but we could limit the attack vectors; we could close some of the holes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surely simple brute force protection\/rate limiting, two-factor auth (or password-less login), not-having-a-user-called-admin, page caching, and perhaps even testing SPF records are solved problems now? So why do I have to add these in myself to protect people that I work with?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yes, I know that some of these things exist and may be merged into WordPress core in future. But until they are, it&#8217;s not just the editing experience that puts WordPress behind the likes of SquareSpace and Shopify.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Often people come to me with a simple &#8220;Can you tweak this thing on my website?&#8221; and when I get a login I end up fixing basic security and performance and privacy things. This totally isn&#8217;t their fault! They don&#8217;t know what they don&#8217;t know. And my job is to educate and guide them in the right direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This lead me to thinking I should do a &#8220;WordPress Website Drivers License&#8221; course that covers some of the hidden aspects of running a website and helps people understand not only what they need to do, but why they need to do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It <em>could<\/em> be generic, rather than WordPress specific. But focussing on WordPress would give me a chance to talk about tools and settings that are specific to that platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a flip side to this though: why does WordPress, out of the box, have so many basic security and performance problems that require initial lockdown? Sure, some &#8220;features&#8221; of WordPress are wide open to abuse if you can get an admin login, but we could limit the attack vectors; we could close some of the holes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surely simple brute force protection\/rate limiting, two-factor auth (or password-less login), not-having-a-user-called-admin, page caching, and perhaps even testing SPF records are solved problems now? So why do I have to add these in myself to protect people that I work with?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yes, I know that some of these things exist and may be merged into WordPress core in future. But until they are, it&#8217;s not just the editing experience that puts WordPress behind the likes of SquareSpace and Shopify.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>In the web development world there&#8217;s been a load of discussion about learning\/knowing CSS, the cascade, CSS-in-JSS vs CSS-in-err-CSS recently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve largely not taken part mostly because I see these things as tools: you use the one that works for you and your project, and no one is right or wrong &#8211; you&#8217;re allowed your opinion (but do express is kindly, please).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that learning the cascade isn&#8217;t something you should do (if you work on the web, it&#8217;s probably <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">helpful<\/span> to <a href=\"https:\/\/hankchizljaw.io\/wrote\/css-specifity-and-the-cascade\/\">understand the cascade<\/a>), and it isn&#8217;t saying that you should avoid work by just lazily doing whatever you&#8217;ve done in the past because it worked then and it should work now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d say that learning CSS is easy and learning CSS-in-JS is easy; what&#8217;s hard is learning how to decide what is the best tool to use on your project. This is the difference between knowledge (which is easily gained) &#8211; and wisdom (which is gained over years of work and much trial and error).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway&#8230;the whole thing ended up with <a href=\"https:\/\/toots.hankchizljaw.io\/@hankchizljaw\">someone<\/a>\u00a0suggesting to me that &#8220;the title &#8216;front-end developer&#8217; is pretty much synonymous with React now.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This got me thinking. Because a &#8220;front-end&#8221; developer used to be someone who made layouts and designs in code. They did HTML and CSS with some JavaScript sprinkles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, because front-end can include any of the popular JS frameworks, the description of that role has significantly changed and now includes doing routing, data storage and manipulation, interfacing with (and creating) APIs and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When discussing this with someone else it was suggested that &#8220;all developer jobs are full stack now&#8221; and that&#8217;s because all the stuff that used to happen in the &#8220;back-end&#8221; can, and frequently does, now happen in the browser.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so our <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2014\/11\/job-titles\/\">job titles<\/a>\u00a0are all messed up. I think we need some new ones that better distinguish between the disciplines of web and application development. Along the lines of &#8220;visual developer&#8221; and &#8220;data developer&#8221;. Hopefully you get my meaning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s easier to switch languages (i.e. I&#8217;d probably be fine writing data-processing algorithms in JavaScript if I wanted to, but I&#8217;m not really into animation or advanced typography and font-handling techniques) than to switch disciplines (i.e. to go from being a data geek to being an animation geek).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we need terms that better describe our disciplines. I&#8217;m happy to take your suggestions in the comments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case&#8230;I love my self-proclaimed job title of &#8220;Creator &#8211; Engineer &#8211; Advisor&#8221;. It perfectly sums up what I do without tying me to any particular discipline or technology! So why not make your own, like I did?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>In the web development world there&#8217;s been a load of discussion about learning\/knowing CSS, the cascade, CSS-in-JSS vs CSS-in-err-CSS recently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve largely not taken part mostly because I see these things as tools: you use the one that works for you and your project, and no one is right or wrong &#8211; you&#8217;re allowed your opinion (but do express is kindly, please).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that learning the cascade isn&#8217;t something you should do (if you work on the web, it&#8217;s probably <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">helpful<\/span> to <a href=\"https:\/\/hankchizljaw.io\/wrote\/css-specifity-and-the-cascade\/\">understand the cascade<\/a>), and it isn&#8217;t saying that you should avoid work by just lazily doing whatever you&#8217;ve done in the past because it worked then and it should work now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d say that learning CSS is easy and learning CSS-in-JS is easy; what&#8217;s hard is learning how to decide what is the best tool to use on your project. This is the difference between knowledge (which is easily gained) &#8211; and wisdom (which is gained over years of work and much trial and error).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway&#8230;the whole thing ended up with <a href=\"https:\/\/toots.hankchizljaw.io\/@hankchizljaw\">someone<\/a>\u00a0suggesting to me that &#8220;the title &#8216;front-end developer&#8217; is pretty much synonymous with React now.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This got me thinking. Because a &#8220;front-end&#8221; developer used to be someone who made layouts and designs in code. They did HTML and CSS with some JavaScript sprinkles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, because front-end can include any of the popular JS frameworks, the description of that role has significantly changed and now includes doing routing, data storage and manipulation, interfacing with (and creating) APIs and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When discussing this with someone else it was suggested that &#8220;all developer jobs are full stack now&#8221; and that&#8217;s because all the stuff that used to happen in the &#8220;back-end&#8221; can, and frequently does, now happen in the browser.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so our <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2014\/11\/job-titles\/\">job titles<\/a>\u00a0are all messed up. I think we need some new ones that better distinguish between the disciplines of web and application development. Along the lines of &#8220;visual developer&#8221; and &#8220;data developer&#8221;. Hopefully you get my meaning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s easier to switch languages (i.e. I&#8217;d probably be fine writing data-processing algorithms in JavaScript if I wanted to, but I&#8217;m not really into animation or advanced typography and font-handling techniques) than to switch disciplines (i.e. to go from being a data geek to being an animation geek).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we need terms that better describe our disciplines. I&#8217;m happy to take your suggestions in the comments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case&#8230;I love my self-proclaimed job title of &#8220;Creator &#8211; Engineer &#8211; Advisor&#8221;. It perfectly sums up what I do without tying me to any particular discipline or technology! So why not make your own, like I did?<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p><em>Aside before I begin: Some of what I\u2019ve been writing lately has been inspired by work I\u2019ve done for clients or help I\u2019ve given to people I know. I\u2019m writing up the lessons learned to try to help others (and my future self) avoid the same pitfalls. So this is observation and information, not criticism. If you think anything I write up might be about you and you don\u2019t like what I wrote, please let me know and I\u2019ll fix things. Thanks!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re making a new website for your organisation or company (or for yourself!), it\u2019s kinda trendy to use abstract language that doesn\u2019t actually reflect what you do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be a problem. Especially if you rely on search engines like Google to send people to your website from search results. And DOUBLY especially if your business name itself doesn\u2019t mention what or where you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a problem because search engines are trying to identify who you are and what you\u2019re about, and if you\u2019re too abstract in your language and content then you won\u2019t appear in the right searches.<br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m actually guilty of having a vague company name myself. My company is \u201cOikos Digital Ltd\u201d which, while <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/about\/\">a clever name<\/a>, doesn\u2019t describe in English any of what I do. So I\u2019m very careful to have my website set up with a big title saying \u201cweb development and technology consultancy for charities, communities and small businesses\u201d and I try to talk about those things a lot on my website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As another, made-up example, let\u2019s say you ran a bakery in Bath. You\u2019ve decided to call it \u201cRisen\u201d. Your marketing agency has suggested you use the tagline \u201cFresh \/ Tasty \/ Treats\u201d. Your website is at risen.co.uk (don\u2019t go there &#8211; I made it up &#8211; I can\u2019t be held responsible for what you actually see), and it has lots of shallow-depth-of-field photos of beautiful cakes topped with sparkly buttercream, and rustic loaves dusted in stoneground flour, and it talks a lot about craft sponges and cup-cakes, artisan icing techniques, and hand-crafted sourdough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google may well put you in search results for these things you mention. But you\u2019ve neglected to mention that you\u2019re a bakery&#8230;in Bath. So if someone does a search for \u201cBakeries in Bath\u201d you may not be found.<br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, while it may seem incredibly boring to do so, it\u2019s actually quite helpful to talk about what you do, and, if you have a physical shop or office or venue, to talk about where you are too. It helps people find you, and when people arrive on your website, they know exactly what they are looking at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This process of making your website\u2019s content help you appear in search results is called \u201cSearch Engine Optimisaiton\u201d, or \u201cSEO\u201d for short. It&#8217;s a big, scary subject, and lots of people will try to sell you lots of expensive services and tools to help you do it well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the basics are simple: Make it clear who you are, what you do, where you are. Talk about those things. Put those things in headings and titles to show they are important. If you know how, include them in meta tags for descriptions and titles too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, my imaginary bakery (this is making me hungry!) may want to be found in searches for \u201cfresh treats\u201d or \u201cartisan sourdough\u201d. Maybe that\u2019s a strategy you\u2019ve chosen. But if you\u2019re an average local business wanting to attract local people then you probably want something less obscure.<br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A trendy website is no good if no one is going to find it. Trendy, abstract, modernist marketing is great, and you can still use some of that, but be careful what you write: you may need to be boring to be found!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br\/><\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>Aside before I begin: Some of what I\u2019ve been writing lately has been inspired by work I\u2019ve done for clients or help I\u2019ve given to people I know. I\u2019m writing up the lessons learned to try to help others (and my future self) avoid the same pitfalls. So this is observation and information, not criticism. If you think anything I write up might be about you and you don\u2019t like what I wrote, please let me know and I\u2019ll fix things. Thanks!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re making a new website for your organisation or company (or for yourself!), it\u2019s kinda trendy to use abstract language that doesn\u2019t actually reflect what you do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be a problem. Especially if you rely on search engines like Google to send people to your website from search results. And DOUBLY especially if your business name itself doesn\u2019t mention what or where you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a problem because search engines are trying to identify who you are and what you\u2019re about, and if you\u2019re too abstract in your language and content then you won\u2019t appear in the right searches.<br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m actually guilty of having a vague company name myself. My company is \u201cOikos Digital Ltd\u201d which, while <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/about\/\">a clever name<\/a>, doesn\u2019t describe in English any of what I do. So I\u2019m very careful to have my website set up with a big title saying \u201cweb development and technology consultancy for charities, communities and small businesses\u201d and I try to talk about those things a lot on my website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As another, made-up example, let\u2019s say you ran a bakery in Bath. You\u2019ve decided to call it \u201cRisen\u201d. Your marketing agency has suggested you use the tagline \u201cFresh \/ Tasty \/ Treats\u201d. Your website is at risen.co.uk (don\u2019t go there &#8211; I made it up &#8211; I can\u2019t be held responsible for what you actually see), and it has lots of shallow-depth-of-field photos of beautiful cakes topped with sparkly buttercream, and rustic loaves dusted in stoneground flour, and it talks a lot about craft sponges and cup-cakes, artisan icing techniques, and hand-crafted sourdough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google may well put you in search results for these things you mention. But you\u2019ve neglected to mention that you\u2019re a bakery&#8230;in Bath. So if someone does a search for \u201cBakeries in Bath\u201d you may not be found.<br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, while it may seem incredibly boring to do so, it\u2019s actually quite helpful to talk about what you do, and, if you have a physical shop or office or venue, to talk about where you are too. It helps people find you, and when people arrive on your website, they know exactly what they are looking at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This process of making your website\u2019s content help you appear in search results is called \u201cSearch Engine Optimisaiton\u201d, or \u201cSEO\u201d for short. It&#8217;s a big, scary subject, and lots of people will try to sell you lots of expensive services and tools to help you do it well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the basics are simple: Make it clear who you are, what you do, where you are. Talk about those things. Put those things in headings and titles to show they are important. If you know how, include them in meta tags for descriptions and titles too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, my imaginary bakery (this is making me hungry!) may want to be found in searches for \u201cfresh treats\u201d or \u201cartisan sourdough\u201d. Maybe that\u2019s a strategy you\u2019ve chosen. But if you\u2019re an average local business wanting to attract local people then you probably want something less obscure.<br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A trendy website is no good if no one is going to find it. Trendy, abstract, modernist marketing is great, and you can still use some of that, but be careful what you write: you may need to be boring to be found!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br\/><\/p>\n",

But the presence of an actual password that I used to use made them seem very real.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. Two things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1) If you get a message like this, it will probably go to your spam box, but if it doesn&#8217;t, then don&#8217;t be scared. It&#8217;s fake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2) Did you know that there are databases on the internet of &#8220;leaked&#8221; email addresses and passwords? You can check if your email has ever been leaked\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/haveibeenpwned.com\/\">here<\/a>\u00a0and, if you&#8217;re willing to risk typing your password into a box on someone else&#8217;s website, you can see if you&#8217;re password has ever been leaked <a href=\"https:\/\/haveibeenpwned.com\/Passwords\">here<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The existence of my email address and an (old) password in these leaked databases explains how I got these messages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you DO get an email like this, or see one in your spam email box, and you still use that password. Then I suggest you immediately stop using that password and change it wherever it&#8217;s used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re response to that is &#8220;But I use it everywhere&#8221; then even more reason to log in everywhere and change it. Try to use different passwords on different websites and apps if you can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) have some brilliant built-in tools for managing passwords, generating and saving random passwords for you, remembering them so you don&#8217;t have to. So try to use those if you can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if you want to be super-advanced try one of the password managers like <a href=\"https:\/\/1password.com\/\">1Password<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lastpass.com\/\">LastPass<\/a>. I&#8217;ve made <a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/2017\/09\/online-security-generating-using-passwords-password-managers\/\">a video<\/a> that shows you how that works (once it&#8217;s set up it actually makes logging in to things both EASIER and MORE SECURE!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, ASK ME if you have any questions about this.<\/p>\n",

You can check if your email has ever been leaked\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/haveibeenpwned.com\/\">here<\/a>\u00a0and, if you&#8217;re willing to risk typing your password into a box on someone else&#8217;s website, you can see if you&#8217;re password has ever been leaked <a href=\"https:\/\/haveibeenpwned.com\/Passwords\">here<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The existence of my email address and an (old) password in these leaked databases explains how I got these messages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you DO get an email like this, or see one in your spam email box, and you still use that password. Then I suggest you immediately stop using that password and change it wherever it&#8217;s used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re response to that is &#8220;But I use it everywhere&#8221; then even more reason to log in everywhere and change it. Try to use different passwords on different websites and apps if you can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) have some brilliant built-in tools for managing passwords, generating and saving random passwords for you, remembering them so you don&#8217;t have to. So try to use those if you can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if you want to be super-advanced try one of the password managers like <a href=\"https:\/\/1password.com\/\">1Password<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lastpass.com\/\">LastPass<\/a>. I&#8217;ve made <a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/2017\/09\/online-security-generating-using-passwords-password-managers\/\">a video<\/a> that shows you how that works (once it&#8217;s set up it actually makes logging in to things both EASIER and MORE SECURE!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, ASK ME if you have any questions about this.<\/p>\n",
        "excerpt": "<p>Yesterday I looked in the spam box in my email account, and found that there were some messages in there that had an old, out-of-date password in the subject line. These were quite scary-looking messages trying to blackmail me. But the presence of an actual password that I used to use made them seem very [&hellip;]<\/p>\n",

            },
            "content": {
                "rendered": "\n<p>In Swindon at the moment there is this brilliant &#8220;game&#8221; called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/beatthestreet.me\/swindon\">Beat the Street<\/a>\u201d intended to get people out and about and walking and cycling. They have put more than 170 boxes around the town, strapped to lampposts, and they have given out thousands of fobs and cards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way the &#8220;game&#8221; works is that you tap a box with your fob\/card, and then for each subsequent box you tap (within an hour of the previous box) you get 10 points added. Players can be part of a team, so the school, fitness clubs, and businesses of the town are all competing for prizes &#8211; in and some cases the competition is hot!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been amazing to see loads of people out and about playing &#8211; and exercising! I will surely write more blogs about both the social and technical aspects of Beat the Street in the near future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve been thinking: what will we do when this ends in late October? I might miss having to check in at the boxes. Is there some way we can &#8220;reset&#8221; the points and continue the game?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s be clear &#8211; the physicality is a huge part of what has made this a success. For kids, being able to have a key-ring like fob in their posession, and being able to tap it on a physical box, and have that box light up and flash in recognition really makes the game. And, the engagement on social media from the Beat the Street team has been brilliant (and I applaud everything they have done here).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;equally, anyone with a tech-head (like me) knows that the vast majority of people tapping will have these smart, connected, location-aware devices with them as they travel around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the natural thinking progression is: could we create a virtual version of the game?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for me, the question is: how hard are the basics here? Especially with the mobile device part. And how much fun can we have finding out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today I just tinkered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The basic premise<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I&#8217;ve not fully thought this through. But on the front end at least, the idea is that you could have a mobile-friendly website with a big button on it. You have a stored list of virtual &#8220;box&#8221; locations. And when you approach a location and stand within a few metres of it, the button turns green and activates, and you can &#8220;check in&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notes before we begin:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Yes, this app has been built a zillion times before. But never by ME! So let me have some fun, will you?<\/li><li>This is all vanilla JavaScript with no libraries. It&#8217;s messy and hacked together in half an hour. Of course it can be better! I&#8217;m just tinkering!<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Getting location<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting location in the browser is pretty easy. You need HTTPS to do it, but with that on you just follow the pretty simple <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/API\/Geolocation_API\">Geolocation API<\/a> and do:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(geoSuccess, geoError);<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>where <code>geoSuccess<\/code>&nbsp;and <code>geoError<\/code>&nbsp;are functions that take a location parameter. Or you can use:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(geoSuccess, geoError);<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>to watch the position and fire the callback when the position changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A button<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you need a button. This is easy to make. I won&#8217;t bore you with the fine details of HTML and CSS (because if you&#8217;re reading this it&#8217;s likely you know them anyway), but I just used:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;button&gt;This is a button&lt;\/button&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And then<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;style&gt;\n  button {\n    font-size: 32px;\n    background-color: #ffbdbd \/* Pale red *\/\n    padding: 1rem 2rem;\n    border: 0 none;\n    outline: none;\n    border-radius: 8px;\n  }\n  button.active {\n    background-color: #ccffda; \/* Pale green *\/\n  }\n&lt;\/style&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Showing the location<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To help with finding coordinates of &#8220;boxes&#8221; and generally for figuring this stuff out, I decided I wanted the current location to show. So I added a container for the location result:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;div id=\"result\"&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>and then just created the <code>geoSuccess<\/code>&nbsp;function, which gets called when the location is found, and have it put the location in this container:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>var result = document.getElementById('result');\nfunction geoSuccess(position) {\n  result.innerHTML='You are at ' +\n                    position.coords.latitude.toFixed(9) +\n                    ', ' + position.coords.longitude.toFixed(9);\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Turning the button green\/how big IS the earth?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OK. Now the &#8220;fun&#8221; bit. We need to work out if we are close to a &#8220;box&#8221;. But how close should we be?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could try to work out if were within a circle around the &#8220;box&#8221; point. But that involves more maths than I want to do right now. Let&#8217;s go with an estimate of just &#8220;within X metres east\/west and X metres north\/south&#8221;. This, I THINK, means you have to be within a square box around the &#8220;box&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Co-ordinates are given in&#8230;what&#8230;degrees I guess? So how big is a degree?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wikipedia says that the earth&#8217;s circumference is&nbsp;40,075.017km around the equator (40,075,017m) and&nbsp;40007.86km around the poles (40,007,860m).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we divide by 360, we get&nbsp;111319.49167m per degree of longitude (east\/west) and&nbsp;111132.94444m per degree of latitude (north\/south).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s make things easy and say we&#8217;re happy with an 11m box around our &#8220;box&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s how close you have to be to be able to &#8220;check in&#8221;.&nbsp; So 11m is about 0.0001 degrees in both directions. I&#8217;m sure someone will point out something about elevation and the curvature of the earth, but it&#8217;s good enough for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than start with a list of boxes, lets just start with one location that activates the button. So all I need is some latitude and longitude I want to get close enough to in order to activate the button.&nbsp; Once I have this I can update my <code>geoSuccess<\/code> function:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>var boxLong = &lt;some co-ordinate&gt;;\nvar boxLat = &lt;some co-ordinate&gt;;\nvar result = document.getElementById('result');\nvar button = document.querySelector('button');\n\nfunction geoSuccess(position) {\n  result.innerHTML='You are at ' +\n                    position.coords.latitude.toFixed(9) +\n                    ', ' + position.coords.longitude.toFixed(9);\n  if (Math.abs(boxLong - position.coords.longitude) &lt; 0.0001 &amp;&amp;\n      Math.abs(boxLat - position.coords.latitude) &lt; 0.0001) {\n    button.classList.add('active');\n  } else {\n    button.classList.remove('active');\n  }\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, of course, this is just one coordinate. In reality you&#8217;re going to want to loop or map over a load of coordinates and find if you&#8217;re close to any of them. But this is the basics of a working system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve taken these basics and added some better styling and added a little to them to make a simple \u201capp\u201d. You can walk along and place a box in your current location using a button. The &#8220;check in&#8221; button is then green until you&#8217;re 11m (0.0001 degrees!) away when it turns red. It turns green again when you back inside the 11m range.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here it is in action (with annotations):<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/beats-me.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4238\" width=\"270\" height=\"480\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>OK. So this is just a bit of fun. But it&#8217;s the basis of something quite interesting: you could do a virtual beat-the-street style game using people&#8217;s smartphones to check in to virtual boxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can have a play at:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/zapthemap.com\/\">https:\/\/zapthemap.com\/<\/a> (It&#8217;s evolved a lot since this post!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>YES, yes, yes. This is (relatively) trivial to hack by simulating your location in a web browser. You wouldn&#8217;t want to run any kind of genuinely competitive real game using it. But it could form the basis of some friendly competition or some kind of personal game with yourself. I dunno.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it was fun, and surprisingly easy, to get this far.<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Beat the Street &#8211; tinkering with a virtual version of the game",
        "content": "\n<p>In Swindon at the moment there is this brilliant &#8220;game&#8221; called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/beatthestreet.me\/swindon\">Beat the Street<\/a>\u201d intended to get people out and about and walking and cycling. They have put more than 170 boxes around the town, strapped to lampposts, and they have given out thousands of fobs and cards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way the &#8220;game&#8221; works is that you tap a box with your fob\/card, and then for each subsequent box you tap (within an hour of the previous box) you get 10 points added. Players can be part of a team, so the school, fitness clubs, and businesses of the town are all competing for prizes &#8211; in and some cases the competition is hot!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been amazing to see loads of people out and about playing &#8211; and exercising! I will surely write more blogs about both the social and technical aspects of Beat the Street in the near future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve been thinking: what will we do when this ends in late October? I might miss having to check in at the boxes. Is there some way we can &#8220;reset&#8221; the points and continue the game?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s be clear &#8211; the physicality is a huge part of what has made this a success. For kids, being able to have a key-ring like fob in their posession, and being able to tap it on a physical box, and have that box light up and flash in recognition really makes the game. And, the engagement on social media from the Beat the Street team has been brilliant (and I applaud everything they have done here).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;equally, anyone with a tech-head (like me) knows that the vast majority of people tapping will have these smart, connected, location-aware devices with them as they travel around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the natural thinking progression is: could we create a virtual version of the game?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for me, the question is: how hard are the basics here? Especially with the mobile device part. And how much fun can we have finding out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today I just tinkered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The basic premise<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I&#8217;ve not fully thought this through. But on the front end at least, the idea is that you could have a mobile-friendly website with a big button on it. You have a stored list of virtual &#8220;box&#8221; locations. And when you approach a location and stand within a few metres of it, the button turns green and activates, and you can &#8220;check in&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notes before we begin:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Yes, this app has been built a zillion times before. But never by ME! So let me have some fun, will you?<\/li><li>This is all vanilla JavaScript with no libraries. It&#8217;s messy and hacked together in half an hour. Of course it can be better! I&#8217;m just tinkering!<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Getting location<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting location in the browser is pretty easy. You need HTTPS to do it, but with that on you just follow the pretty simple <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/API\/Geolocation_API\">Geolocation API<\/a> and do:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(geoSuccess, geoError);<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>where <code>geoSuccess<\/code>&nbsp;and <code>geoError<\/code>&nbsp;are functions that take a location parameter. Or you can use:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(geoSuccess, geoError);<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>to watch the position and fire the callback when the position changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A button<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you need a button. This is easy to make. I won&#8217;t bore you with the fine details of HTML and CSS (because if you&#8217;re reading this it&#8217;s likely you know them anyway), but I just used:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;button&gt;This is a button&lt;\/button&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And then<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;style&gt;\n  button {\n    font-size: 32px;\n    background-color: #ffbdbd \/* Pale red *\/\n    padding: 1rem 2rem;\n    border: 0 none;\n    outline: none;\n    border-radius: 8px;\n  }\n  button.active {\n    background-color: #ccffda; \/* Pale green *\/\n  }\n&lt;\/style&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Showing the location<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To help with finding coordinates of &#8220;boxes&#8221; and generally for figuring this stuff out, I decided I wanted the current location to show. So I added a container for the location result:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;div id=\"result\"&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>and then just created the <code>geoSuccess<\/code>&nbsp;function, which gets called when the location is found, and have it put the location in this container:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>var result = document.getElementById('result');\nfunction geoSuccess(position) {\n  result.innerHTML='You are at ' +\n                    position.coords.latitude.toFixed(9) +\n                    ', ' + position.coords.longitude.toFixed(9);\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Turning the button green\/how big IS the earth?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OK. Now the &#8220;fun&#8221; bit. We need to work out if we are close to a &#8220;box&#8221;. But how close should we be?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could try to work out if were within a circle around the &#8220;box&#8221; point. But that involves more maths than I want to do right now. Let&#8217;s go with an estimate of just &#8220;within X metres east\/west and X metres north\/south&#8221;. This, I THINK, means you have to be within a square box around the &#8220;box&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Co-ordinates are given in&#8230;what&#8230;degrees I guess? So how big is a degree?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wikipedia says that the earth&#8217;s circumference is&nbsp;40,075.017km around the equator (40,075,017m) and&nbsp;40007.86km around the poles (40,007,860m).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we divide by 360, we get&nbsp;111319.49167m per degree of longitude (east\/west) and&nbsp;111132.94444m per degree of latitude (north\/south).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s make things easy and say we&#8217;re happy with an 11m box around our &#8220;box&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s how close you have to be to be able to &#8220;check in&#8221;.&nbsp; So 11m is about 0.0001 degrees in both directions. I&#8217;m sure someone will point out something about elevation and the curvature of the earth, but it&#8217;s good enough for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than start with a list of boxes, lets just start with one location that activates the button. So all I need is some latitude and longitude I want to get close enough to in order to activate the button.&nbsp; Once I have this I can update my <code>geoSuccess<\/code> function:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>var boxLong = &lt;some co-ordinate&gt;;\nvar boxLat = &lt;some co-ordinate&gt;;\nvar result = document.getElementById('result');\nvar button = document.querySelector('button');\n\nfunction geoSuccess(position) {\n  result.innerHTML='You are at ' +\n                    position.coords.latitude.toFixed(9) +\n                    ', ' + position.coords.longitude.toFixed(9);\n  if (Math.abs(boxLong - position.coords.longitude) &lt; 0.0001 &amp;&amp;\n      Math.abs(boxLat - position.coords.latitude) &lt; 0.0001) {\n    button.classList.add('active');\n  } else {\n    button.classList.remove('active');\n  }\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, of course, this is just one coordinate. In reality you&#8217;re going to want to loop or map over a load of coordinates and find if you&#8217;re close to any of them. But this is the basics of a working system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve taken these basics and added some better styling and added a little to them to make a simple \u201capp\u201d. You can walk along and place a box in your current location using a button. The &#8220;check in&#8221; button is then green until you&#8217;re 11m (0.0001 degrees!) away when it turns red. It turns green again when you back inside the 11m range.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here it is in action (with annotations):<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/beats-me.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4238\" width=\"270\" height=\"480\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>OK. So this is just a bit of fun. But it&#8217;s the basis of something quite interesting: you could do a virtual beat-the-street style game using people&#8217;s smartphones to check in to virtual boxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can have a play at:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/zapthemap.com\/\">https:\/\/zapthemap.com\/<\/a> (It&#8217;s evolved a lot since this post!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>YES, yes, yes. This is (relatively) trivial to hack by simulating your location in a web browser. You wouldn&#8217;t want to run any kind of genuinely competitive real game using it. But it could form the basis of some friendly competition or some kind of personal game with yourself. I dunno.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it was fun, and surprisingly easy, to get this far.<\/p>\n",
