Sorry for taking so long to getting round to it.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">About 4,000 years ago&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the LORD descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, the whole mountain trembled violently, and the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder. Then Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him.  The LORD descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain&#8230;And God spoke all these words:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cI am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall have no other gods before me.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cRemember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien within your gates&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>\u201cHonor your father and your mother&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not murder.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not commit adultery.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not steal.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not covet &#8230; anything that belongs to your neighbor.\u201d <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear&#8230;<\/p>\n<p> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">This year&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><\/span>The internet was awash with gossip because the Joseph Rowntree Foundation had descended upon it. The news stories were served up from it and the internet trembled in anticipation at the announcement of their latest social research findings, and the sound of the journalists grew louder and louder. Then the journalists spoke and the voice of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation answered it.  The Joseph Rowntree Foundation descended to the internet and sent their press release to the news web sites&#8230;and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation spoke all these words:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I am the Jospeh Rowntree Foundation, who has surveyed 3,500 people, and have revealed a strong sense of unease about some of the changes shaping British society:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#8220;you shall build stronger communities;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not be selfish;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not be greedy consumers;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall have good moral values;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall have strong families;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not make victims of young people; and they shall not perpetrate anti-social behaviour;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not comsume too much drugs and alcohol;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall strive to remove poverty and inequality;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall be tolerant and inclusive of foreigners; and they shall respect you;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not partake in crime and violence.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>When the people saw the research report and heard the radio reports and read the newspaper commentators, they trembled with fear.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Nothing Changes<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I hope you get the point.  The lists have their differences, but it seems that &#8220;social evils&#8221; have changed little since the time of the Israelites wandering in the desert.<\/p>\n<p>As a Christian, I despair slightly.  God gave these commands in order to protect His people, to help them.  Jesus summed the laws that God gave as &#8216;<span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.&#8217; and &#8220;Love your neighbour as yourself&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Have we not learned?  And what will it take for God to get the point across to his people, the whole world?<\/p>\n<p><\/span>&#8220;Blessed are they whose ways are blameless, who walk according to the law of the LORD. Blessed are they who keep his statutes and seek him with all their heart.&#8221;<\/p>\n",

The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, the whole mountain trembled violently, and the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder. Then Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him.  The LORD descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain&#8230;And God spoke all these words:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cI am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall have no other gods before me.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cRemember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien within your gates&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>\u201cHonor your father and your mother&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not murder.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not commit adultery.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not steal.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not covet &#8230; anything that belongs to your neighbor.\u201d <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear&#8230;<\/p>\n<p> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">This year&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><\/span>The internet was awash with gossip because the Joseph Rowntree Foundation had descended upon it. The news stories were served up from it and the internet trembled in anticipation at the announcement of their latest social research findings, and the sound of the journalists grew louder and louder. Then the journalists spoke and the voice of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation answered it.  The Joseph Rowntree Foundation descended to the internet and sent their press release to the news web sites&#8230;and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation spoke all these words:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I am the Jospeh Rowntree Foundation, who has surveyed 3,500 people, and have revealed a strong sense of unease about some of the changes shaping British society:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#8220;you shall build stronger communities;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not be selfish;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not be greedy consumers;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall have good moral values;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall have strong families;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not make victims of young people; and they shall not perpetrate anti-social behaviour;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not comsume too much drugs and alcohol;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall strive to remove poverty and inequality;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall be tolerant and inclusive of foreigners; and they shall respect you;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not partake in crime and violence.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>When the people saw the research report and heard the radio reports and read the newspaper commentators, they trembled with fear.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Nothing Changes<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I hope you get the point.  The lists have their differences, but it seems that &#8220;social evils&#8221; have changed little since the time of the Israelites wandering in the desert.<\/p>\n<p>As a Christian, I despair slightly.  God gave these commands in order to protect His people, to help them.  Jesus summed the laws that God gave as &#8216;<span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.&#8217; and &#8220;Love your neighbour as yourself&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Have we not learned?

But how do they perform?<\/p>\n<p>Opinions vary a lot, I&#8217;ve seen claims that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>they fall off at the slightest lump in the road;<\/li>\n<li>they stay on through all conditions;<\/li>\n<li>they&#8217;re fine for keeping you dry but shouldn&#8217;t be used in groups as the person behind will get drenched;<\/li>\n<li>they&#8217;re useless in heavy rain but OK for a light sprinkling;<\/li>\n<li>they&#8217;re not as good as real mudguards for keeping you dry;<\/li>\n<li>they&#8217;re a perfectly good replacement for normal guards and a very clever invention.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I guess I&#8217;ve had mine for two or three weeks now, through a fairly wet July and a couple of hundred miles of all-weather commuting and I will hereafter join with those who sing their praises!<\/p>\n<p>They were easy to fit and I used the &#8220;temporary fittings&#8221; so I could easily take them off if I didn&#8217;t like them.  However, the rubber fittings you see in the photo have done me proud, holding the fenders on with little movement through some of Swindon&#8217;s roughest roads.  The extra fittings for blade-style front forks are clever too, allowing secure attachment to oddly shaped aero forks, and they come with &#8220;permanent&#8221; fixings in the form of some cable-ties too.<\/p>\n<p>Riding with them is fine and you hardly notice them there.  There is an occasional squeak when you go over a bump and the blade rubs on the tyre, but a little careful alignment (by tweaking the position of the fittings slightly) mostly fixes this.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a pretty wet July so far and so they&#8217;ve had plenty of rain to cope with and I must say, they do a great job!  I&#8217;ve not had any spray come up at me and, unlike the previous crud catchers, the front blade follows the wheel, protecting me even on corners.  I have no experience of group riding so can&#8217;t make any claim about the guy behind me getting drenched.  I might have to go with the pro&#8217;s with their experience of that, however, glancing back, I can&#8217;t see much spray coming up at all!<\/p>\n<p>My only complaint so far is that you can bash them when track-standing.  You need to be careful to keep your foot out of the way when turning the front wheel a lot.  Somehow the difference is only a few centimeters, but it is a BIG difference.  Even so, when I have knocked the in this way, they&#8217;ve stayed on.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m really pleased with my blades.  If you&#8217;re thinking of buying some I would heartily recommend them.<\/p>\n<p>Now where&#8217;s those permanent fixings?<\/p>\n",

After my sister gave me some <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiggle.co.uk\/\">Wiggle<\/a> vouchers for my birthday (thanks Sarah), I have now bought some and so thought I ought to chip in to the debate.<\/div>\n<p>First of all, for those not in the know, what are Race Blades?  Well, they are clip-on mud guards for road bikes that do not require eyelets to screw into or clearance between the brake calipers and the tyres.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m an all weather commuter (and rapidly becoming an all-weather trainer too) and Fuzzy, my Felt Road Bike, doesn&#8217;t have either eyelets or mudguard clearance.  So when I got him I kitted him out with some &#8220;Crud Catcher&#8221; type mud guards.

But how do they perform?<\/p>\n<p>Opinions vary a lot, I&#8217;ve seen claims that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>they fall off at the slightest lump in the road;<\/li>\n<li>they stay on through all conditions;<\/li>\n<li>they&#8217;re fine for keeping you dry but shouldn&#8217;t be used in groups as the person behind will get drenched;<\/li>\n<li>they&#8217;re useless in heavy rain but OK for a light sprinkling;<\/li>\n<li>they&#8217;re not as good as real mudguards for keeping you dry;<\/li>\n<li>they&#8217;re a perfectly good replacement for normal guards and a very clever invention.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I guess I&#8217;ve had mine for two or three weeks now, through a fairly wet July and a couple of hundred miles of all-weather commuting and I will hereafter join with those who sing their praises!<\/p>\n<p>They were easy to fit and I used the &#8220;temporary fittings&#8221; so I could easily take them off if I didn&#8217;t like them.  However, the rubber fittings you see in the photo have done me proud, holding the fenders on with little movement through some of Swindon&#8217;s roughest roads.  The extra fittings for blade-style front forks are clever too, allowing secure attachment to oddly shaped aero forks, and they come with &#8220;permanent&#8221; fixings in the form of some cable-ties too.<\/p>\n<p>Riding with them is fine and you hardly notice them there.  There is an occasional squeak when you go over a bump and the blade rubs on the tyre, but a little careful alignment (by tweaking the position of the fittings slightly) mostly fixes this.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a pretty wet July so far and so they&#8217;ve had plenty of rain to cope with and I must say, they do a great job!  I&#8217;ve not had any spray come up at me and, unlike the previous crud catchers, the front blade follows the wheel, protecting me even on corners.  I have no experience of group riding so can&#8217;t make any claim about the guy behind me getting drenched.  I might have to go with the pro&#8217;s with their experience of that, however, glancing back, I can&#8217;t see much spray coming up at all!<\/p>\n<p>My only complaint so far is that you can bash them when track-standing.  You need to be careful to keep your foot out of the way when turning the front wheel a lot.  Somehow the difference is only a few centimeters, but it is a BIG difference.  Even so, when I have knocked the in this way, they&#8217;ve stayed on.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m really pleased with my blades.  If you&#8217;re thinking of buying some I would heartily recommend them.<\/p>\n<p>Now where&#8217;s those permanent fixings?<\/p>\n",

For those that don&#8217;t know what this means, I basically led the music for a church service; I picked the songs, did a little bit of arranging, made sure everyone knew what they were doing, organised the rehersal and introduced and led the songs themselves.  It&#8217;s important that this wasn&#8217;t something great that I did, I love my God and it was all about getting other people to connect with Him and show their adoration for Him.  But it was an important event for me too, so I mention it here state that it went well and that I enjoyed it, and then I leave it.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><br \/>Life is good!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>I quoted from the Bible&#8217;s book called &#8220;Exodus&#8221; only yesterday &#8211; here&#8217;s a bit again from the 10 commandments: &#8220;You shall have no other gods before me.  You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to see what this might mean in modern times.  We try to turn it into idolising things like wealth, fame, or work, and I&#8217;m sure that these are things we need to be careful not to become the focus of our lives, but somehow it doesn&#8217;t quite seem the same.  These don&#8217;t feel like Gods somehow.<\/p>\n<p>There are people out there that really do have other &#8220;Gods&#8221;.  Maybe they worship mother earth, or the rain gods, or the sun gods.  Lots of gods have been created to symbolise things that we can&#8217;t control and people ask them to control the things that we can&#8217;t control.  If I sacrifice a lamb to the rain God maybe he will send the rain we need for our crops?  Is our scorching weather and drought because I&#8217;ve been a bad person and the weather Gods are looking down on me<\/p>\n<p>As a new gardener lots of things start to take over your life.  Weather is one of them.  And it&#8217;s getting personal!  Who&#8217;s in control of all this, and how do I get them to send the weather I need?!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s annoying when it doesn&#8217;t rain.  I fear drought and our one 120l water butt will only last us a week or so.  But it&#8217;s also annoying when it&#8217;s cold, or cloudy.  Our plants love water, but they love heat and light too. <\/p>\n<p>Gardening really puts you in a position where you depend on the weather.  And it feels sometimes like it&#8217;s having a go at you.  I can clearly see how people saw drought and floods as punishment, prayed for rain, or for it to stop raining.  I can understand the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anthropomorphic\">anthropomorphisation<\/a> of nature.  I can understand the relationship that people have had with the elements.<\/p>\n<p>I can understand why these people had weather Gods, and that, somehow, makes the commandment all the more powerful.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not a 7-day creationist, but I love the imagery of the creation story in the book of Genesis in the Bible.  A book which clearly asserts that God, the God of Israel, and now the God of the world, made everything and has it all in his hands.  I love the little details intended to dispell the myths of other Gods, such as the storytellers throwaway comment that &#8220;He also made the stars&#8221; (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?book_id=1&amp;chapter=1&amp;verse=16&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse\">Gen 1:16<\/a>) &#8211; you know, just while He was at it, might as well make a few little stars too.<\/p>\n<p>And Jesus confirms both his deity and his power over nature in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Matthew%208:23-27;&amp;version=31;\">calming of the storm<\/a> and other such miracles.<\/p>\n<p>So, I have a new understanding of other Gods.  But I also have a continued faith in the one true God.<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Gardening and Gods",
        "content": "<p>I quoted from the Bible&#8217;s book called &#8220;Exodus&#8221; only yesterday &#8211; here&#8217;s a bit again from the 10 commandments: &#8220;You shall have no other gods before me.  You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to see what this might mean in modern times.  We try to turn it into idolising things like wealth, fame, or work, and I&#8217;m sure that these are things we need to be careful not to become the focus of our lives, but somehow it doesn&#8217;t quite seem the same.  These don&#8217;t feel like Gods somehow.<\/p>\n<p>There are people out there that really do have other &#8220;Gods&#8221;.  Maybe they worship mother earth, or the rain gods, or the sun gods.  Lots of gods have been created to symbolise things that we can&#8217;t control and people ask them to control the things that we can&#8217;t control.  If I sacrifice a lamb to the rain God maybe he will send the rain we need for our crops?  Is our scorching weather and drought because I&#8217;ve been a bad person and the weather Gods are looking down on me<\/p>\n<p>As a new gardener lots of things start to take over your life.  Weather is one of them.  And it&#8217;s getting personal!  Who&#8217;s in control of all this, and how do I get them to send the weather I need?!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s annoying when it doesn&#8217;t rain.  I fear drought and our one 120l water butt will only last us a week or so.  But it&#8217;s also annoying when it&#8217;s cold, or cloudy.  Our plants love water, but they love heat and light too. <\/p>\n<p>Gardening really puts you in a position where you depend on the weather.  And it feels sometimes like it&#8217;s having a go at you.  I can clearly see how people saw drought and floods as punishment, prayed for rain, or for it to stop raining.  I can understand the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anthropomorphic\">anthropomorphisation<\/a> of nature.  I can understand the relationship that people have had with the elements.<\/p>\n<p>I can understand why these people had weather Gods, and that, somehow, makes the commandment all the more powerful.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not a 7-day creationist, but I love the imagery of the creation story in the book of Genesis in the Bible.  A book which clearly asserts that God, the God of Israel, and now the God of the world, made everything and has it all in his hands.  I love the little details intended to dispell the myths of other Gods, such as the storytellers throwaway comment that &#8220;He also made the stars&#8221; (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?book_id=1&amp;chapter=1&amp;verse=16&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse\">Gen 1:16<\/a>) &#8211; you know, just while He was at it, might as well make a few little stars too.<\/p>\n<p>And Jesus confirms both his deity and his power over nature in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Matthew%208:23-27;&amp;version=31;\">calming of the storm<\/a> and other such miracles.<\/p>\n<p>So, I have a new understanding of other Gods.  But I also have a continued faith in the one true God.<\/p>\n",

I only found out about this at the weekend and it started on Monday.  The idea is to incentivise people to go and ride a bike for 10 minutes or 1 mile, by running a workplace competition, giving spot prizes to individuals who enter, and team prizes to the companies\/departments who get the highest percentage of staff on a bike!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really clever and seems to have lots of good backing.  They&#8217;ve sent me a goodie bag of lollipops, cycle computers, lights, keyrings, reflective strips and puncture repair kits, and have generally been very helpful in promoting it around the office.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Everyday Cycling<\/p>\n<p><\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.everydaycycling.com\/\">Everyday Cycling<\/a> have also just released more community features, like groups, blogs, messages and rankings.

I only found out about this at the weekend and it started on Monday.  The idea is to incentivise people to go and ride a bike for 10 minutes or 1 mile, by running a workplace competition, giving spot prizes to individuals who enter, and team prizes to the companies\/departments who get the highest percentage of staff on a bike!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really clever and seems to have lots of good backing.

We\u2019ve also stated the \u201csuggested searches\u201d that Cuil came up with as we typed, and what we actually thought we might get.<\/p>\n<p>We didn\u2019t have time (and we\u2019re not THAT sad) to do a complete comparison of Google, Yahoo, MSN and others, so we\u2019ve simply compared the results to those given with Google &#8211; it seems appropriate given the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 1 &#8211; \u201cWhat would Jesus Do?\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well\u2026what would he?  (For those that don&#8217;t know this was a cheesy Christian slogan used to remind people to ask the question themselves when making decisions &#8211; it was probably a good idea until someone got into printing it on merchandise galore &#8211; keyrings, wrist bands, etc).<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What would jesus buy<\/li>\n<li>What would jesus drive<\/li>\n<li>What would jesus eat<\/li>\n<li>what would jesus do<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: WWJD merchandise, or possibly a site actually stating some things that Jesus did.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: What would Jesus Buy (www.wwjbmovie.com)<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lots of references to the film above<\/li>\n<li>Christian weight loss: What would Jesus Eat?<\/li>\n<li>What would Jesus shave with?<\/li>\n<li>The Church of Stop Shopping (presumably related to the movie?)<\/li>\n<li>www.wwjd.com (we didn\u2019t follow the link and have no idea what it is)<\/li>\n<li>Listed Categories (to narrow your search): \u201cWorld Championship Wrestling Alumni\u201d and \u201cAmerican Professional Wrestlers\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What Would Jesus Do on Wikipedia<\/li>\n<li>WWJD merchandise at www.whatwouldjesusdo.com<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Result: Wrestling??? Seriously, we\u2019re NOT making this up!!!  Google wins by a clear mile.  Cuil gets 1 out of 5 for entertainment value only.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 2: \u201cThe Bible\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Can Cuil find me a Good Book?<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Bible (yay!  First hit!)<\/li>\n<li>History of the Bible<\/li>\n<li>How to Read the Bible<\/li>\n<li>The Bible Code<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Links to online bibles, or possibly reference articles explaining what the Bible is.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result:Track and Field News: The Bible of the Sport since 1948<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigating the Bible II<\/li>\n<li>bible.crosswalk.com (an actual Bible!)<\/li>\n<li>The Bible Society<\/li>\n<li>A few other random bible-related things, none of which seem very important<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says: www.biblegateway.com &#8211; everyone\u2019s favourite online bible!<\/p>\n<p>Result: Cuil gets closer but is again blown away by Google.  2 out of 5 for effort!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 3: Lalbagh Indian Cuisine<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u2026because even the faithful like a good curry now and then!<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lalbagh Fort<\/li>\n<li>Lalbagh Road<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Web page of my favourite local Indian takeaway, local directory entries and some reviews.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: Correct listing on donowdo.com (What\u2019s that then?)<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local newspaper reviews<\/li>\n<li>Other fairly random listings<\/li>\n<li>Category: Kings of Mysore<\/li>\n<li>Wikipedia article on Culture of Bangalore<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says: The Lalbagh Website, Yell and Thompson directory entries, and reviews of the intended, and other restaurants called \u201cLalbagh\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Result: Again, I got the information I needed, but a link to the restaurant\u2019s own web site didn\u2019t make the front page.  2 out of 5 again.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 4: \u201cCuil\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Can it find itself? And will Google list their new competitor?<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>None &#8211; though by this point I wasn\u2019t getting any suggested searches at all &#8211; perhaps the system was overloaded?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Cuil home page, lots of news articles from today about the launch.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: Properties for sale in Cuil Mhuine, Ireland on Properazzi.com<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>References to what appears to be a music album or a band called \u201cChase around the Windmill\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Books, and area guides relating to several places whose name includes the word \u201cCuil\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Categories: Towns and Villages in Sligo, French Cuisine, Local Breads, Lochaber, and Glens of Scotland.<\/li>\n<li>I also noticed that Cuil returned 121,578 results, compared to Google\u2019s \u201cabout 718,000? &#8211; I\u2019m open to the possibility that less is more in this case.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says: News results for Cuil from Information Week and 819 related articles. Cuil Homepage.<\/p>\n<p>Result: What?  They\u2019re not their own top search result?  Zero!!!!<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Test 5: \u201cHelp\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Maybe Cuil is a new breed of search engine and I\u2019m expecting the wrong sort of results.  Perhaps there\u2019s a help page?<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Still no suggested results at all.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Cuil help page.  Err\u2026not sure what else.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: This is really REALLY true.  I got a page back that said: \u201cNo results because of high load\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nothing<\/li>\n<li>Zip<\/li>\n<li>Zilch<\/li>\n<li>Not a sausage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>www.help.com &#8211; seems reasonable<\/li>\n<li>BBC Help (www.bbc.co.uk\/help)<\/li>\n<li>Ingenta Connect Help (???)<\/li>\n<li>Google Help (which is, of course, the equivalent of what we wanted)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Result: Another zero I\u2019m afraid.  An overloaded service is no service at all!<\/p>\n<p><strong>In conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve done our best to show you how this new search engine performs.  We\u2019ll leave you to make up your own mind from our results.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree they\u2019re a great help!<\/p>\n<p>We give Cuil a grand total of 4 out of a possible 25 points!<\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t think Google need worry too much.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Tuesday Update:<\/p>\n<p>The service is back up.

I&#8217;ve spent some time tonight on a post which I hope he doesn&#8217;t mind me cross-posting here.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8211;<\/p>\n<p>You may, like me, have noticed the latest big thing on the Internet\u2026a new search engine set up by some ex-Google employees at www.cuil.com (pronounced Cuil).<\/p>\n<p>We have conducted an extensive review of Cuil\u2019s search functionality (OK, we did a few searches, almost at random) and hereby bring you the definitive, Christian-themed review of this new tool.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve run a number of test searches, analysed the results and graded them out of 5.  We\u2019ve also stated the \u201csuggested searches\u201d that Cuil came up with as we typed, and what we actually thought we might get.<\/p>\n<p>We didn\u2019t have time (and we\u2019re not THAT sad) to do a complete comparison of Google, Yahoo, MSN and others, so we\u2019ve simply compared the results to those given with Google &#8211; it seems appropriate given the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 1 &#8211; \u201cWhat would Jesus Do?\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well\u2026what would he?  (For those that don&#8217;t know this was a cheesy Christian slogan used to remind people to ask the question themselves when making decisions &#8211; it was probably a good idea until someone got into printing it on merchandise galore &#8211; keyrings, wrist bands, etc).<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What would jesus buy<\/li>\n<li>What would jesus drive<\/li>\n<li>What would jesus eat<\/li>\n<li>what would jesus do<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: WWJD merchandise, or possibly a site actually stating some things that Jesus did.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: What would Jesus Buy (www.wwjbmovie.com)<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lots of references to the film above<\/li>\n<li>Christian weight loss: What would Jesus Eat?<\/li>\n<li>What would Jesus shave with?<\/li>\n<li>The Church of Stop Shopping (presumably related to the movie?)<\/li>\n<li>www.wwjd.com (we didn\u2019t follow the link and have no idea what it is)<\/li>\n<li>Listed Categories (to narrow your search): \u201cWorld Championship Wrestling Alumni\u201d and \u201cAmerican Professional Wrestlers\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What Would Jesus Do on Wikipedia<\/li>\n<li>WWJD merchandise at www.whatwouldjesusdo.com<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Result: Wrestling??? Seriously, we\u2019re NOT making this up!!!  Google wins by a clear mile.  Cuil gets 1 out of 5 for entertainment value only.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 2: \u201cThe Bible\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Can Cuil find me a Good Book?<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Bible (yay!  First hit!)<\/li>\n<li>History of the Bible<\/li>\n<li>How to Read the Bible<\/li>\n<li>The Bible Code<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Links to online bibles, or possibly reference articles explaining what the Bible is.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result:Track and Field News: The Bible of the Sport since 1948<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigating the Bible II<\/li>\n<li>bible.crosswalk.com (an actual Bible!)<\/li>\n<li>The Bible Society<\/li>\n<li>A few other random bible-related things, none of which seem very important<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says: www.biblegateway.com &#8211; everyone\u2019s favourite online bible!<\/p>\n<p>Result: Cuil gets closer but is again blown away by Google.  2 out of 5 for effort!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 3: Lalbagh Indian Cuisine<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u2026because even the faithful like a good curry now and then!<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lalbagh Fort<\/li>\n<li>Lalbagh Road<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Web page of my favourite local Indian takeaway, local directory entries and some reviews.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: Correct listing on donowdo.com (What\u2019s that then?)<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local newspaper reviews<\/li>\n<li>Other fairly random listings<\/li>\n<li>Category: Kings of Mysore<\/li>\n<li>Wikipedia article on Culture of Bangalore<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says: The Lalbagh Website, Yell and Thompson directory entries, and reviews of the intended, and other restaurants called \u201cLalbagh\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Result: Again, I got the information I needed, but a link to the restaurant\u2019s own web site didn\u2019t make the front page.  2 out of 5 again.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 4: \u201cCuil\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Can it find itself? And will Google list their new competitor?<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>None &#8211; though by this point I wasn\u2019t getting any suggested searches at all &#8211; perhaps the system was overloaded?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Cuil home page, lots of news articles from today about the launch.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: Properties for sale in Cuil Mhuine, Ireland on Properazzi.com<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>References to what appears to be a music album or a band called \u201cChase around the Windmill\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Books, and area guides relating to several places whose name includes the word \u201cCuil\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Categories: Towns and Villages in Sligo, French Cuisine, Local Breads, Lochaber, and Glens of Scotland.<\/li>\n<li>I also noticed that Cuil returned 121,578 results, compared to Google\u2019s \u201cabout 718,000? &#8211; I\u2019m open to the possibility that less is more in this case.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says: News results for Cuil from Information Week and 819 related articles. Cuil Homepage.<\/p>\n<p>Result: What?  They\u2019re not their own top search result?  Zero!!!!<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Test 5: \u201cHelp\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Maybe Cuil is a new breed of search engine and I\u2019m expecting the wrong sort of results.  Perhaps there\u2019s a help page?<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Still no suggested results at all.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Cuil help page.  Err\u2026not sure what else.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: This is really REALLY true.  I got a page back that said: \u201cNo results because of high load\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nothing<\/li>\n<li>Zip<\/li>\n<li>Zilch<\/li>\n<li>Not a sausage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>www.help.com &#8211; seems reasonable<\/li>\n<li>BBC Help (www.bbc.co.uk\/help)<\/li>\n<li>Ingenta Connect Help (???)<\/li>\n<li>Google Help (which is, of course, the equivalent of what we wanted)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Result: Another zero I\u2019m afraid.  An overloaded service is no service at all!<\/p>\n<p><strong>In conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve done our best to show you how this new search engine performs.  We\u2019ll leave you to make up your own mind from our results.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree they\u2019re a great help!<\/p>\n<p>We give Cuil a grand total of 4 out of a possible 25 points!<\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t think Google need worry too much.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Tuesday Update:<\/p>\n<p>The service is back up.  Searching for &#8220;help&#8221; didn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>Oddly, though searching for &#8220;Cuil&#8221; on Cuil.com gave random results, searching for &#8220;Google&#8221; on Cuil.com gave lots of links to Google&#8217;s sites.  Weird!<\/p>\n",

One of the boons of this has been watching the inspiring little comments of an old Bathonian friend of mine.<\/p>\n<p>My friend (I won&#8217;t name him unless he reads this and decides he would like me to) is&#8230;well&#8230;I don&#8217;t really know what he does now.  I think he used to work for the Institute of Physics or something, as a web designer, and he seems to have continued in a similar line of work.  And now, in the absence of anyone else, he&#8217;s my personal guru for all things web design, Web 2.0, blogs, social networking and so on.  I guess he inspires my inner-geek.<\/p>\n<p>And I do have a part of me that thrives on this stuff.  I love the interesting ways that people make innovative use of technology to achieve useful, and sometimes beautiful things.  Here are some other little web-based things that I&#8217;ve come across since following this person:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/last.fm\">last.fm<\/a> &#8211; great way to discover new music<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mycyclinglog.com\">mycyclinglog.com<\/a> &#8211; my current bike logger<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/identi.ca\">identi.ca<\/a> &#8211; open alternative to Twitter<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/ping.fm\">ping.fm<\/a> &#8211; update multiple statuses\/micro-blogs from one place<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opera.com\">Opera<\/a> &#8211; a rediscovery of the old alternative web-browser<\/p>\n<p>But not just those practical things.  My curiosity about the way people are using the web to communicate and interact has been roused.  I&#8217;m intrigued how people are creating web sites that are simple, functional and well-designed.  Things not only of purpose but of beauty.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m feeling behind and afraid though.  I barely know Java and have heard only rumours of Ajax, let alone other &#8220;next big things&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve been toying with client-side scripting, servlets, application frameworks, but not digging deep.  I have an excellent grounding in Computer Science and an inquisitive mind, but there&#8217;s so much to learn and I don&#8217;t have time enough to invest to satisfy my curiosity, let alone learn anything of much use.  And where would I start?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m afraid because of security, the nature of my online identity. I&#8217;m generally very open, as readers of this blog would know, but there&#8217;s stuff that I don&#8217;t want out there on the internet (mostly about other people and work, but sometimes about me).  Can I throw myself into the online world of sharing so much with so many in safety?  Do I want <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brightkite.com\">BrightKite.com<\/a> telling everyone where I am all the time?<\/p>\n<p>And there&#8217;s the issue of time.  My feed list in <a href=\"http:\/\/reader.google.com\">Google Reader<\/a> continues to grow and reading, as well as writing, is a chore.  Could I read the Twitter entries of more than about 20 people and have a real life too?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also uncertain about who to take on the journey with me.  In many ways I&#8217;m a long way ahead of my peers and I&#8217;d love to be able to introduce others to my personal world of customised web sites, RSS and Atom feeds, alternative browsers and web presence because I think these things are useful tools.  But would they get it?  How confusing is it to a non techie?  There are so many places to be with new networks and tools appearing all the time. If I can barely keep up, how will they?<\/p>\n<p>I think the web is an exciting, fun, and hugely creative place to be at the moment.  Yet it&#8217;s a big place.  A scary place.  A confusing place.  An ever-changing and unknown place.<\/p>\n<p>My online interaction with the friend I mentioned above is a fine example of how the web can bring together people with a common cause or interest.  It can be a very negative place, but it can be inspiring and friendly too.  With my friend&#8217;s help I hope to continue to be a part of this strange world, and to introduce others to it, and maybe, one day, to be responsible for a small part of it.<\/p>\n",

One of the boons of this has been watching the inspiring little comments of an old Bathonian friend of mine.<\/p>\n<p>My friend (I won&#8217;t name him unless he reads this and decides he would like me to) is&#8230;well&#8230;I don&#8217;t really know what he does now.  I think he used to work for the Institute of Physics or something, as a web designer, and he seems to have continued in a similar line of work.  And now, in the absence of anyone else, he&#8217;s my personal guru for all things web design, Web 2.0, blogs, social networking and so on.  I guess he inspires my inner-geek.<\/p>\n<p>And I do have a part of me that thrives on this stuff.  I love the interesting ways that people make innovative use of technology to achieve useful, and sometimes beautiful things.  Here are some other little web-based things that I&#8217;ve come across since following this person:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/last.fm\">last.fm<\/a> &#8211; great way to discover new music<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mycyclinglog.com\">mycyclinglog.com<\/a> &#8211; my current bike logger<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/identi.ca\">identi.ca<\/a> &#8211; open alternative to Twitter<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/ping.fm\">ping.fm<\/a> &#8211; update multiple statuses\/micro-blogs from one place<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opera.com\">Opera<\/a> &#8211; a rediscovery of the old alternative web-browser<\/p>\n<p>But not just those practical things.  My curiosity about the way people are using the web to communicate and interact has been roused.  I&#8217;m intrigued how people are creating web sites that are simple, functional and well-designed.  Things not only of purpose but of beauty.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m feeling behind and afraid though.  I barely know Java and have heard only rumours of Ajax, let alone other &#8220;next big things&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve been toying with client-side scripting, servlets, application frameworks, but not digging deep.  I have an excellent grounding in Computer Science and an inquisitive mind, but there&#8217;s so much to learn and I don&#8217;t have time enough to invest to satisfy my curiosity, let alone learn anything of much use.  And where would I start?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m afraid because of security, the nature of my online identity. I&#8217;m generally very open, as readers of this blog would know, but there&#8217;s stuff that I don&#8217;t want out there on the internet (mostly about other people and work, but sometimes about me).  Can I throw myself into the online world of sharing so much with so many in safety?  Do I want <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brightkite.com\">BrightKite.com<\/a> telling everyone where I am all the time?<\/p>\n<p>And there&#8217;s the issue of time.  My feed list in <a href=\"http:\/\/reader.google.com\">Google Reader<\/a> continues to grow and reading, as well as writing, is a chore.  Could I read the Twitter entries of more than about 20 people and have a real life too?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also uncertain about who to take on the journey with me.  In many ways I&#8217;m a long way ahead of my peers and I&#8217;d love to be able to introduce others to my personal world of customised web sites, RSS and Atom feeds, alternative browsers and web presence because I think these things are useful tools.  But would they get it?  How confusing is it to a non techie?  There are so many places to be with new networks and tools appearing all the time. If I can barely keep up, how will they?<\/p>\n<p>I think the web is an exciting, fun, and hugely creative place to be at the moment.  Yet it&#8217;s a big place.  A scary place.  A confusing place.  An ever-changing and unknown place.<\/p>\n<p>My online interaction with the friend I mentioned above is a fine example of how the web can bring together people with a common cause or interest.  It can be a very negative place, but it can be inspiring and friendly too.  With my friend&#8217;s help I hope to continue to be a part of this strange world, and to introduce others to it, and maybe, one day, to be responsible for a small part of it.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>I&#8217;ve had my HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) that I got for my cycle training for about 6 weeks now so it&#8217;s time I did a bit of a write up.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Why Bother?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>First of all, why bother with an HRM?  (If you haven&#8217;t spotted already I&#8217;m the kind of person that thinks a LOT and so my process of purchasing a new gadget is usually a long and drawn out one that involved justifying my spend and lots of research on the options before actually spending any cash)<\/p>\n<p>Well, I&#8217;ve been cycling more and more and longer distances and spending longer in the saddle.  Unfortunately for me I&#8217;m the kind of person who naturally pushes myself to my physical limit.  I need no encouragement to go faster or harder, I&#8217;m always trying to go as hard and fast as I can.  This, it turns out, is not good for you.  And you can increase aerobic capacity (fitness) by training in the right zones.<\/p>\n<p>So I wanted an HRM to encourage me to ride at a reasonable pace, so as to:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Not knacker myself out on longer rides.<\/li>\n<li>Help actually improve my fitness and endurance.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Makes sense.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A bit about Training Zones<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not expert but it goes something like this.<\/p>\n<p>Any training programme recommends spending time at different heart rate &#8220;zones&#8221;, which are percentages of your MHR (maximum heart rate).  It is generally considered that there are 5 zones called various things depending on who you ask but something like:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rest\/low activity<\/li>\n<li>Recovery<\/li>\n<li>Aerobic<\/li>\n<li>Anaerobic<\/li>\n<li>Maximum<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It turns out that I was spending most of my time in Anaerobic or maximum.  No wonder I was getting tired!<\/p>\n<p>The theory goes that spending time at Zone 3 increases aerobic capacity and endurance, Zone 4 builds strength, and zone 5 is for, well, sprinting and hill climbing.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Why the Garmin?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>There are plenty of HRMs on the market.  I chose the Garmin Forerunner 50 because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It didn&#8217;t look rubbish<\/li>\n<li>It was reasonably priced (relatively)<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s a watch so I can use it for running\/gym work as well as on the bike (I had considered a bike computer with built in HRM but dismissed this idea as lesss flexible)<\/li>\n<li>It has all the features I need.<\/li>\n<li>It has a data storage function that can wirelessly upload to Garmin software.  (I&#8217;m a bit obsessive about how fast\/far I&#8217;ve gone &#8211; now I can track my heart rate too!)<\/li>\n<li>It has the option to link to a foot pod (pedometer) and a bike sensor to expand its functionality.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Is it any good?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The HRM is fine!  Does what it says on the tin.  I&#8217;ve had a BIT of interferance from the bike computer on one ride, suggesting that it doesn&#8217;t use a coded signal (this would allow the watch to only count wireless pulses from the HRM), but it&#8217;s only been tempremental the once.  You need to make the chest sensors wet for it to work well too!<\/p>\n<p>The sensor takes a bit of getting used to but is comfortable.  I imagine that this is true of any monitor.<\/p>\n<p>The watch is a little bulky but not too un-cool.  If you have small arms it might look a bit silly.  The display is clear and large.  Turning your wrist slightly to look at the numbers while on the bike is a bit annoying.  In some ways I wish I&#8217;d got an integrated bike computer\/HRM, but I chose not to and that&#8217;s the price I pay.  It&#8217;s not too much of a problem though.<\/p>\n<p>The warning alarm that tells you if you&#8217;re outside of your (configurable) training zone is plenty loud and annoying enough.  In hindsight I&#8217;d like two different alarms, one to say I&#8217;m a little over and one to say I&#8217;m REALLY over.<\/p>\n<p>I read one review that suggested that the instructions weren&#8217;t that good and I tend to agree, I&#8217;ve found a lot out just by playing and button-pushing.<\/p>\n<p>Data storage and transfer works well and is very simple.  You can review some of the data on the watch itself but after upload to the Garmin software you can see detailed graphs (data is, I think, every 5 seconds).  The software really wants you to be using a more expensive GPS device and functionality is limited when just using the Forerunner 50.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a little annoying in that the HRM can&#8217;t take into account your circumstances.  If you&#8217;re pounding uphill, or in traffic, or trying to keep good up pace on a busy road, or fighting a headwind, you need to be pushing a bit to stay safe, or to get where you&#8217;re going and having the watch beep at you every 5 seconds doesn&#8217;t help.  Perhaps a mute button would be useful?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Has it worked?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>YES!  Well, I think so.  It&#8217;s certainly slowed me down as my MyCyclingLog.com stats show.  This is frustrating at times, like when you find your training zone only allows you to do 12mph uphill into a slight wind.  But I recover quicker and feel better after long rides and evidence would seem to show that I&#8217;m getting fitter.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s helped me &#8220;tune in&#8221; to my body a bit, know where I&#8217;m pushing too hard and where I could go harder &#8211; even without the watch now!  And as time has gone on and I&#8217;ve done more long rides at lower pace, I seem to be able to go faster for the same heart rate &#8211; evidence that my fitness is improving after only a few weeks?  I hope so!<\/p>\n<p>So, despite the few things that niggle me about it, I&#8217;ve found the experience pretty good and would recommend an HRM as a training tool for anyone doing regular lengthly exercise.  And the Forerunner 50 is a fine place to start!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Update: <\/span>Bizarrely, just today, BikeRadar published <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/fitness\/article\/technique-get-faster-by-riding-slowly-17447\">this article about training zones<\/a> and getting fitter by riding slower.  They&#8217;ve renumbered the zones slightly but it&#8217;s the same theory.  And it is only a theory &#8211; some of the commentors there disagree with that theory too!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;ve had my HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) that I got for my cycle training for about 6 weeks now so it&#8217;s time I did a bit of a write up.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Why Bother?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>First of all, why bother with an HRM?  (If you haven&#8217;t spotted already I&#8217;m the kind of person that thinks a LOT and so my process of purchasing a new gadget is usually a long and drawn out one that involved justifying my spend and lots of research on the options before actually spending any cash)<\/p>\n<p>Well, I&#8217;ve been cycling more and more and longer distances and spending longer in the saddle.  Unfortunately for me I&#8217;m the kind of person who naturally pushes myself to my physical limit.  I need no encouragement to go faster or harder, I&#8217;m always trying to go as hard and fast as I can.  This, it turns out, is not good for you.  And you can increase aerobic capacity (fitness) by training in the right zones.<\/p>\n<p>So I wanted an HRM to encourage me to ride at a reasonable pace, so as to:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Not knacker myself out on longer rides.<\/li>\n<li>Help actually improve my fitness and endurance.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Makes sense.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A bit about Training Zones<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not expert but it goes something like this.<\/p>\n<p>Any training programme recommends spending time at different heart rate &#8220;zones&#8221;, which are percentages of your MHR (maximum heart rate).  It is generally considered that there are 5 zones called various things depending on who you ask but something like:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rest\/low activity<\/li>\n<li>Recovery<\/li>\n<li>Aerobic<\/li>\n<li>Anaerobic<\/li>\n<li>Maximum<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It turns out that I was spending most of my time in Anaerobic or maximum.  No wonder I was getting tired!<\/p>\n<p>The theory goes that spending time at Zone 3 increases aerobic capacity and endurance, Zone 4 builds strength, and zone 5 is for, well, sprinting and hill climbing.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Why the Garmin?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>There are plenty of HRMs on the market.  I chose the Garmin Forerunner 50 because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It didn&#8217;t look rubbish<\/li>\n<li>It was reasonably priced (relatively)<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s a watch so I can use it for running\/gym work as well as on the bike (I had considered a bike computer with built in HRM but dismissed this idea as lesss flexible)<\/li>\n<li>It has all the features I need.<\/li>\n<li>It has a data storage function that can wirelessly upload to Garmin software.  (I&#8217;m a bit obsessive about how fast\/far I&#8217;ve gone &#8211; now I can track my heart rate too!)<\/li>\n<li>It has the option to link to a foot pod (pedometer) and a bike sensor to expand its functionality.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Is it any good?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The HRM is fine!  Does what it says on the tin.  I&#8217;ve had a BIT of interferance from the bike computer on one ride, suggesting that it doesn&#8217;t use a coded signal (this would allow the watch to only count wireless pulses from the HRM), but it&#8217;s only been tempremental the once.  You need to make the chest sensors wet for it to work well too!<\/p>\n<p>The sensor takes a bit of getting used to but is comfortable.  I imagine that this is true of any monitor.<\/p>\n<p>The watch is a little bulky but not too un-cool.  If you have small arms it might look a bit silly.  The display is clear and large.  Turning your wrist slightly to look at the numbers while on the bike is a bit annoying.  In some ways I wish I&#8217;d got an integrated bike computer\/HRM, but I chose not to and that&#8217;s the price I pay.  It&#8217;s not too much of a problem though.<\/p>\n<p>The warning alarm that tells you if you&#8217;re outside of your (configurable) training zone is plenty loud and annoying enough.  In hindsight I&#8217;d like two different alarms, one to say I&#8217;m a little over and one to say I&#8217;m REALLY over.<\/p>\n<p>I read one review that suggested that the instructions weren&#8217;t that good and I tend to agree, I&#8217;ve found a lot out just by playing and button-pushing.<\/p>\n<p>Data storage and transfer works well and is very simple.  You can review some of the data on the watch itself but after upload to the Garmin software you can see detailed graphs (data is, I think, every 5 seconds).  The software really wants you to be using a more expensive GPS device and functionality is limited when just using the Forerunner 50.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a little annoying in that the HRM can&#8217;t take into account your circumstances.  If you&#8217;re pounding uphill, or in traffic, or trying to keep good up pace on a busy road, or fighting a headwind, you need to be pushing a bit to stay safe, or to get where you&#8217;re going and having the watch beep at you every 5 seconds doesn&#8217;t help.  Perhaps a mute button would be useful?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Has it worked?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>YES!  Well, I think so.  It&#8217;s certainly slowed me down as my MyCyclingLog.com stats show.  This is frustrating at times, like when you find your training zone only allows you to do 12mph uphill into a slight wind.  But I recover quicker and feel better after long rides and evidence would seem to show that I&#8217;m getting fitter.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s helped me &#8220;tune in&#8221; to my body a bit, know where I&#8217;m pushing too hard and where I could go harder &#8211; even without the watch now!  And as time has gone on and I&#8217;ve done more long rides at lower pace, I seem to be able to go faster for the same heart rate &#8211; evidence that my fitness is improving after only a few weeks?  I hope so!<\/p>\n<p>So, despite the few things that niggle me about it, I&#8217;ve found the experience pretty good and would recommend an HRM as a training tool for anyone doing regular lengthly exercise.  And the Forerunner 50 is a fine place to start!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Update: <\/span>Bizarrely, just today, BikeRadar published <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/fitness\/article\/technique-get-faster-by-riding-slowly-17447\">this article about training zones<\/a> and getting fitter by riding slower.  They&#8217;ve renumbered the zones slightly but it&#8217;s the same theory.  And it is only a theory &#8211; some of the commentors there disagree with that theory too!<\/p>\n",

Hey, I lead an exciting life!!! \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been pretty wet lately.  And pretty unpredictably wet.  (&#8220;Welcome to England&#8221; I hear you cry&#8230;indeed!)  This has caused me some interesting problems like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do I pack my wet weather gear when it&#8217;s looking dry?<\/li>\n<li>Do I leave the office when it&#8217;s raining, or wait for it to clear up?<\/li>\n<li>Do I don my wet weather gear, if I have it, before doing my commute?<\/li>\n<li>How do I manage the problem of wet kit when I&#8217;ve been caught out and had a soaking?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Inspiring stuff&#8230;I know!  (&#8220;Yawn&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been thinking about expanding my wet weather wardrobe.  But in which direction?<\/p>\n<p>Mostly my top-half is fine.  I have a waterproof cycling jacket (but, oh for a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiggle.co.uk\/p\/Cycle\/7\/Gore_Countdown_II_Waterproof_Jacket\/5360030061\/\">Gore-Tex\u00aePaclite\u00aeShell<\/a> &#8211; anyone care to donate me \u00a3130?), and your head just gets wet, that&#8217;s fine.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is shoes, socks, shorts and overtrousers.  My overtrousers aren&#8217;t cycling-specific and send water straight down into my shoes or over-shoes.  Without them my shorts get sodden and I&#8217;d still get wet shoes.  This might not be a bad thing if I had spare shorts.  My summer gloves also get soaked and I don&#8217;t have spares.  The upshot of all this is that I&#8217;ve been getting wet, and my kit hasn&#8217;t had time to dry out.<\/p>\n<p>And decent wet-weather kit isn&#8217;t cheap.  So what do I invest in?  Do I go for spare shorts?  Or proper over trousers?  Do I get a second pair of gloves, or put up with them as they&#8217;re not too bad to wear when wet.  What about waterproof socks?  Shoes?  3\/4 length overshorts?<\/p>\n<p>Hmm&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I claim that cycling is great in lots of ways, but kitting yourself out can be an expensive chore!<\/p>\n",

Hey, I lead an exciting life!!! \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been pretty wet lately.  And pretty unpredictably wet.  (&#8220;Welcome to England&#8221; I hear you cry&#8230;indeed!)  This has caused me some interesting problems like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do I pack my wet weather gear when it&#8217;s looking dry?<\/li>\n<li>Do I leave the office when it&#8217;s raining, or wait for it to clear up?<\/li>\n<li>Do I don my wet weather gear, if I have it, before doing my commute?<\/li>\n<li>How do I manage the problem of wet kit when I&#8217;ve been caught out and had a soaking?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Inspiring stuff&#8230;I know!  (&#8220;Yawn&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been thinking about expanding my wet weather wardrobe.  But in which direction?<\/p>\n<p>Mostly my top-half is fine.  I have a waterproof cycling jacket (but, oh for a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiggle.co.uk\/p\/Cycle\/7\/Gore_Countdown_II_Waterproof_Jacket\/5360030061\/\">Gore-Tex\u00aePaclite\u00aeShell<\/a> &#8211; anyone care to donate me \u00a3130?), and your head just gets wet, that&#8217;s fine.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is shoes, socks, shorts and overtrousers.  My overtrousers aren&#8217;t cycling-specific and send water straight down into my shoes or over-shoes.  Without them my shorts get sodden and I&#8217;d still get wet shoes.  This might not be a bad thing if I had spare shorts.  My summer gloves also get soaked and I don&#8217;t have spares.  The upshot of all this is that I&#8217;ve been getting wet, and my kit hasn&#8217;t had time to dry out.<\/p>\n<p>And decent wet-weather kit isn&#8217;t cheap.  So what do I invest in?  Do I go for spare shorts?  Or proper over trousers?  Do I get a second pair of gloves, or put up with them as they&#8217;re not too bad to wear when wet.  What about waterproof socks?  Shoes?  3\/4 length overshorts?<\/p>\n<p>Hmm&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I claim that cycling is great in lots of ways, but kitting yourself out can be an expensive chore!<\/p>\n",
        "excerpt": "<p>Another, fairly dull, cycling-related post I&#8217;m afraid. More on the garden, slugs, harvesting, music and other stuff to come when I have some time. If that&#8217;s not a tempting proposition that&#8217;ll make you bookmark my blog then I don&#8217;t know what will. Hey, I lead an exciting life!!! \ud83d\ude09 It&#8217;s been pretty wet lately.
