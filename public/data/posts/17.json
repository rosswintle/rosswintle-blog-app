And these notes are from <a href=\"https:\/\/robbell.podbean.com\/e\/kristin-hanggi-and-natalie-roy-are-just-getting-started\/\">an interview he did with two other people<\/a> who I think you should take with a pinch of salt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;I&#8217;m intrigued by different forms of spirituality at the moment. These people had some really interesting things to say about how spirituality works with creativity, and on creativity in general.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">On listening to other people because THEIR ideas might be the right ones<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n\t<p>There are other ways to know things. One vision that&#8217;s trying to come through. I&#8217;m being open enough to see it and interpret it. Sometimes the divine whispers answers in\u00a0<em>other peoples&#8217; heads<\/em>. So I have to listen well enough because it might come through someone else. Especially the people who are like: that person&#8217;s vision is not my vision&#8230; The people who seem to be the greatest obstacle to you getting your thing done are actually the people where you pause and listen.\u00a0<\/p><cite>At about 11:00 &#8211; 12:00<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As Rob Bell would say:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n\t<p>Everyone is your teacher!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Making regardless of the outcome<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n\t<p>You create something.

Once you start asking &#8220;Why?&#8221; you&#8217;re going to talk yourself out of it&#8230;people ask &#8220;Why does the planet need this?&#8221;&#8230;if it&#8217;s in you, it&#8217;s supposed to be made, just go with that.

You need to go all in. They aren&#8217;t intended to be mashed up with traditional HTML page reloads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I then tried to work out how to use the Axios HTTP client library to do my delete action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And was that easy?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well&#8230;hmm&#8230;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Axios\/AJAX thing was actually pretty simple. I&#8217;ll give you that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I was then faced with the propsect of having to delete the <code>thing<\/code>\u00a0from my list of things stored as data in the top-level component instance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the problem with this is that this data is a nested array that comes from PHP via JSON.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I know some people complain that PHP arrays are trying to be all things to all men, but from a developer happiness point of view they are pretty nice and I&#8217;ve got very used to their flexibility and ease of use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But getting them from PHP into JS isn&#8217;t so simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my case I have a list of things for each day of the week. But not every day needs a list. So I can have:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">[<br\/>  1 => [<br\/>          'thing1',<br\/>          'thing2'<br\/>  ],<br\/>  3 => [<br\/>          'thing3',<br\/>          'thing4'<br\/>  ]<br\/>]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can have this in JavaScript too. Sort of.\u00a0 JavaScript doesn&#8217;t like the gaps &#8211; note in the image below the <code>empty<\/code>\u00a0slots and the length:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3778\" width=\"316\" height=\"84\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08.png 632w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08-300x80.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08-600x159.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;to get between PHP and JS we generally use JSON as a kind of intermediate format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And JSON doesn&#8217;t have arrays with indexes. JSON arrays have no specific indices. They always start at zero and subsequent elements are indexed with the next integer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to get around this, PHP&#8217;s <code>json_encode()<\/code>\u00a0function works out if the PHP array is compatible with JSON. If it is then it spits out a JSON array. And if it isn&#8217;t then it spits out a JSON OBJECT!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a valid JSON array &#8211; zero-indexed and all sequential keys:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">> $a = [ 0 => 'a', 1 => 'b' ];<br\/>> echo json_encode( $a );<br\/>[\"a\",\"b\"]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a non-JSON compatible array:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">> $b = [ 1 => 'a', 2 => 'b' ];<br\/>> echo json_encode( $b );<br\/>{\"1\":\"a\",\"2\":\"b\"}<br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Fun! Now I note that you can add the <code>JSON_FORCE_OBJECT<\/code>\u00a0flag to always convert PHP arrays to JSON objects, even if they are JSON-array compatible. But for the most part, you sometime get an array in JSON, and you sometimes get an object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And my list of things, not being JSON-array compatible, was being spat out as an object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s my issue: JavaScript objects aren&#8217;t really iterable. You can&#8217;t easily loop over them. I mean, yes, you can get the keys, and you can use <code>for...of<\/code>\u00a0or <code>for...in<\/code>\u00a0or something. But sometimes you&#8217;ll get properties you don&#8217;t want (such as a Vue <code>__ob__<\/code>\u00a0observer property) and&#8230;well&#8230;objects just aren&#8217;t really intended to be used in this way. Objects are objects, not lists or arrays.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what to do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I could use <code>JSON_FORCE_OBJECT<\/code>\u00a0and treat ALL my arrays as objects and deal with it. That would probably be OK. But then I&#8217;m stuck using objects for lists of things in JS and that&#8217;s not right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or I could try to make all my PHP arrays JSON compatible. So my list would be zero-indexed and sequential, like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">[<br\/>  0 => [],<br\/>  1 => [<br\/>    'thing1',<br\/>    'thing2'<br\/>  ],<br\/>  2 => [],<br\/>  3 => [<br\/>    'thing3',<br\/>    'thing4'<br\/>  ]<br\/>]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>But enforcing this inside PHP doesn&#8217;t seem like the right thing to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or I could try to find a way to convert JSON objects that only have numeric keys back into JS arrays. But that still has issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, I think, is a major pain point and frustration for me.\u00a0 Once my data is in the right places and in the right types of data structure, I know what I&#8217;m doing and can work quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But moving data between the different parts of these multi-part systems is hard to get right. And doing it in a scalable and maintainable way is even harder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday I also had problems with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JavaScript scope<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>How how how How HOW do\u00a0I pass a variable to a lexically-out-of-scope callback, like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">function deleteThingFromData( thingToDelete ) {<br\/>  newData = _.mapValues( data, myOutOfScopeCallback );<br\/>  data = newData;<br\/>}<br\/><br\/>function myOutOfScopeCallback( dataItem ) {<br\/>  \/\/ Needs access to thingToDelete!<br\/>}<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">this<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>this is perpetually not my friend. Nothing in programming should be called <code>this<\/code>, especially when its meaning can vary so wildly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday I got caught by the fact that <code>this<\/code>\u00a0inside an arrow function is different to <code>this<\/code>\u00a0with a normal function.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#learnToLoveJs<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, my delete now works (YAY!), and I&#8217;m still motivated to #learnToLoveJS, but gosh it&#8217;s hard work.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/06\/adding-a-delete-link-to-a-vue-component-representing-a-laravel-model\/\">Yesterday<\/a> I was struggling with getting Vue components to do non-AJAXy things and wondering why on earth this was so difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conclusion I came to, with the help of some good people on Twitter, is that if you&#8217;re using a component-based reactive framework like Vue, you don&#8217;t want to be half-hearted about it. You need to go all in. They aren&#8217;t intended to be mashed up with traditional HTML page reloads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I then tried to work out how to use the Axios HTTP client library to do my delete action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And was that easy?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well&#8230;hmm&#8230;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Axios\/AJAX thing was actually pretty simple. I&#8217;ll give you that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I was then faced with the propsect of having to delete the <code>thing<\/code>\u00a0from my list of things stored as data in the top-level component instance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the problem with this is that this data is a nested array that comes from PHP via JSON.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I know some people complain that PHP arrays are trying to be all things to all men, but from a developer happiness point of view they are pretty nice and I&#8217;ve got very used to their flexibility and ease of use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But getting them from PHP into JS isn&#8217;t so simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my case I have a list of things for each day of the week. But not every day needs a list. So I can have:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">[<br\/>  1 => [<br\/>          'thing1',<br\/>          'thing2'<br\/>  ],<br\/>  3 => [<br\/>          'thing3',<br\/>          'thing4'<br\/>  ]<br\/>]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can have this in JavaScript too. Sort of.\u00a0 JavaScript doesn&#8217;t like the gaps &#8211; note in the image below the <code>empty<\/code>\u00a0slots and the length:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3778\" width=\"316\" height=\"84\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08.png 632w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08-300x80.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08-600x159.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;to get between PHP and JS we generally use JSON as a kind of intermediate format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And JSON doesn&#8217;t have arrays with indexes. JSON arrays have no specific indices. They always start at zero and subsequent elements are indexed with the next integer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to get around this, PHP&#8217;s <code>json_encode()<\/code>\u00a0function works out if the PHP array is compatible with JSON. If it is then it spits out a JSON array. And if it isn&#8217;t then it spits out a JSON OBJECT!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a valid JSON array &#8211; zero-indexed and all sequential keys:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">> $a = [ 0 => 'a', 1 => 'b' ];<br\/>> echo json_encode( $a );<br\/>[\"a\",\"b\"]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a non-JSON compatible array:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">> $b = [ 1 => 'a', 2 => 'b' ];<br\/>> echo json_encode( $b );<br\/>{\"1\":\"a\",\"2\":\"b\"}<br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Fun! Now I note that you can add the <code>JSON_FORCE_OBJECT<\/code>\u00a0flag to always convert PHP arrays to JSON objects, even if they are JSON-array compatible. But for the most part, you sometime get an array in JSON, and you sometimes get an object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And my list of things, not being JSON-array compatible, was being spat out as an object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s my issue: JavaScript objects aren&#8217;t really iterable. You can&#8217;t easily loop over them. I mean, yes, you can get the keys, and you can use <code>for...of<\/code>\u00a0or <code>for...in<\/code>\u00a0or something. But sometimes you&#8217;ll get properties you don&#8217;t want (such as a Vue <code>__ob__<\/code>\u00a0observer property) and&#8230;well&#8230;objects just aren&#8217;t really intended to be used in this way. Objects are objects, not lists or arrays.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what to do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I could use <code>JSON_FORCE_OBJECT<\/code>\u00a0and treat ALL my arrays as objects and deal with it. That would probably be OK. But then I&#8217;m stuck using objects for lists of things in JS and that&#8217;s not right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or I could try to make all my PHP arrays JSON compatible. So my list would be zero-indexed and sequential, like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">[<br\/>  0 => [],<br\/>  1 => [<br\/>    'thing1',<br\/>    'thing2'<br\/>  ],<br\/>  2 => [],<br\/>  3 => [<br\/>    'thing3',<br\/>    'thing4'<br\/>  ]<br\/>]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>But enforcing this inside PHP doesn&#8217;t seem like the right thing to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or I could try to find a way to convert JSON objects that only have numeric keys back into JS arrays. But that still has issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, I think, is a major pain point and frustration for me.\u00a0 Once my data is in the right places and in the right types of data structure, I know what I&#8217;m doing and can work quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But moving data between the different parts of these multi-part systems is hard to get right. And doing it in a scalable and maintainable way is even harder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday I also had problems with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JavaScript scope<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>How how how How HOW do\u00a0I pass a variable to a lexically-out-of-scope callback, like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">function deleteThingFromData( thingToDelete ) {<br\/>  newData = _.mapValues( data, myOutOfScopeCallback );<br\/>  data = newData;<br\/>}<br\/><br\/>function myOutOfScopeCallback( dataItem ) {<br\/>  \/\/ Needs access to thingToDelete!<br\/>}<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">this<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>this is perpetually not my friend. Nothing in programming should be called <code>this<\/code>, especially when its meaning can vary so wildly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday I got caught by the fact that <code>this<\/code>\u00a0inside an arrow function is different to <code>this<\/code>\u00a0with a normal function.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#learnToLoveJs<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, my delete now works (YAY!), and I&#8217;m still motivated to #learnToLoveJS, but gosh it&#8217;s hard work.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>This very much falls into the category of &#8220;things that must surely be easier&#8221;. So let me know in the comments if it is actually easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, I&#8217;m tinkering with Vue and Laravel. I have a Vue component that represents a Laravel model object. I note that the component has a hierarchy of parent components.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In it&#8217;s simplest form it looks like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }}<br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ]<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I want to add a delete button that will fire a request off to Laravel to delete the model and the redirect back to the model index.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it looks something like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ]<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And we need to work out what the HREF should be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I COULD create a &#8220;GET&#8221; route for this. But let&#8217;s try and keep it RESTful\/resourceful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A delete request should really use the DELETE HTTP method.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we need to add a little hidden form to make this work and submit that on click:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"delete\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ]<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>OK. Getting there. Now I need to get the <code>deleteUrl<\/code>\u00a0into the action property of the form. But this is a Vue component, not something in Blade that I can use Laravel methods in; I can&#8217;t do something like <code>{{ action('SomeController@destroy') }}<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I confess, at this point, I took a bit of a shortcut and just coded this as a computed property with a hard-coded base URL and making use of the thing&#8217;s ID:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"delete\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ],<br\/>    computed: {<br\/>      deleteUrl: function () {<br\/>        return '\/admin\/things\/' <strong>+ <\/strong>this.thingData.id;<br\/>      }<br\/>    }<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Hmm. This is not simple is it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we need to trigger the form submission when the delete link is clicked. To do that we need to identify the components form element and submit it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with adding a method and calling that method on click:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\" @click=\"deleteThing\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"delete\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ],<br\/>    computed: {<br\/>      deleteUrl: function () {<br\/>        return '\/admin\/things\/' <strong>+ <\/strong>this.thingData.id;<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    methods: {<br\/>      deleteThing: function( ev ) {<br\/>        ev.preventDefault();<br\/>        \/\/ What now?<br\/>      }<br\/>    }<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230;how do we track down the form element we need to submit? A bit of Googling shows that I can use\u00a0<code>this.$el<\/code>\u00a0in JavaScript to get my component, and I can <code>getElementsByTagName('form')<\/code>\u00a0from there. So here&#8217;s the method:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">methods<strong>: <\/strong>{<br\/>  deleteThing<strong>: <\/strong>function ( event ) {<br\/>    event.preventDefault();<br\/>    this.$el.getElementsByTagName('form')[0].submit();<br\/>  }<br\/>}<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now this will fail because we don&#8217;t have a CSRF token. Yes, Laravel kindly adds this as a header to all AJAX requests made using Axios. But with a straight form submission I&#8217;ll need to add the token.\u00a0 This is easy in Blade, you just add <code>@csrf<\/code>\u00a0and go and make yourself a celebratory cup of coffee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in a component?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I can&#8217;t find any Laravel cleverness that somehow automatically gives you some kind of global token in Vue that you can use in any component.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I COULD pass it down through my component hierarchy as props, but that seems messy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A better way would be to have it as some kind of global state\/prop that I can use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One method for doing this is to add an <a href=\"https:\/\/vuejs.org\/v2\/cookbook\/adding-instance-properties.html\">Instance Property<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel DOES give you a head start in having an HTML meta element in the <code>&lt;head><\/code> that has the CSRF token in it. So that&#8217;s helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can the set a Vue instance property in our top-level app.js like so:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">\/\/ Add the token<br\/>Vue.prototype.$token <strong>= <\/strong>document.head.querySelector('meta[name=\"csrf-token\"]').content;<br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>I could not then find a way to directly reference this in my components template. So I had to pull it into the components <code>data<\/code>\u00a0and then bind that to a new hidden input in the form:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\" @click=\"deleteThing\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"delete\"><br\/>      &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_token\" :value=\"token\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ],<br\/>    data: function () {<br\/>      return {<br\/>        token: this.$token<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    computed: {<br\/>      deleteUrl: function () {<br\/>        return '\/admin\/things\/' <strong>+ <\/strong>this.thingData.id;<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    methods: {<br\/>      deleteThing: function( ev ) {<br\/>        ev.preventDefault();<br\/>        this.$el.getElementsByTagName('form')[0].submit();<br\/>      }<br\/>    }<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and, hang on, one final thing&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>method=\"delete\"<\/code>\u00a0on a <code>form<\/code> rarely works, so you need to fake it with a <code>post<\/code>\u00a0request and another input.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the final code:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\" @click=\"deleteThing\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"post\"><br\/>      &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_token\" :value=\"token\"><br\/>      &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_method\" value=\"DELETE\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ],<br\/>    data: function () {<br\/>      return {<br\/>        token: this.$token<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    computed: {<br\/>      deleteUrl: function () {<br\/>        return '\/admin\/things\/' <strong>+ <\/strong>this.thingData.id;<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    methods: {<br\/>      deleteThing: function( ev ) {<br\/>        ev.preventDefault();<br\/>        this.$el.getElementsByTagName('form')[0].submit();<br\/>      }<br\/>    }<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Phew!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really&#8230;what did I miss here? This is SO complicated. There HAS to be a better way.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>This very much falls into the category of &#8220;things that must surely be easier&#8221;. So let me know in the comments if it is actually easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, I&#8217;m tinkering with Vue and Laravel. I have a Vue component that represents a Laravel model object. I note that the component has a hierarchy of parent components.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In it&#8217;s simplest form it looks like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }}<br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ]<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I want to add a delete button that will fire a request off to Laravel to delete the model and the redirect back to the model index.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it looks something like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ]<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And we need to work out what the HREF should be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I COULD create a &#8220;GET&#8221; route for this. But let&#8217;s try and keep it RESTful\/resourceful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A delete request should really use the DELETE HTTP method.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we need to add a little hidden form to make this work and submit that on click:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"delete\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ]<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>OK. Getting there. Now I need to get the <code>deleteUrl<\/code>\u00a0into the action property of the form. But this is a Vue component, not something in Blade that I can use Laravel methods in; I can&#8217;t do something like <code>{{ action('SomeController@destroy') }}<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I confess, at this point, I took a bit of a shortcut and just coded this as a computed property with a hard-coded base URL and making use of the thing&#8217;s ID:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"delete\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ],<br\/>    computed: {<br\/>      deleteUrl: function () {<br\/>        return '\/admin\/things\/' <strong>+ <\/strong>this.thingData.id;<br\/>      }<br\/>    }<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Hmm. This is not simple is it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we need to trigger the form submission when the delete link is clicked. To do that we need to identify the components form element and submit it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with adding a method and calling that method on click:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\" @click=\"deleteThing\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"delete\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ],<br\/>    computed: {<br\/>      deleteUrl: function () {<br\/>        return '\/admin\/things\/' <strong>+ <\/strong>this.thingData.id;<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    methods: {<br\/>      deleteThing: function( ev ) {<br\/>        ev.preventDefault();<br\/>        \/\/ What now?<br\/>      }<br\/>    }<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230;how do we track down the form element we need to submit? A bit of Googling shows that I can use\u00a0<code>this.$el<\/code>\u00a0in JavaScript to get my component, and I can <code>getElementsByTagName('form')<\/code>\u00a0from there. So here&#8217;s the method:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">methods<strong>: <\/strong>{<br\/>  deleteThing<strong>: <\/strong>function ( event ) {<br\/>    event.preventDefault();<br\/>    this.$el.getElementsByTagName('form')[0].submit();<br\/>  }<br\/>}<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now this will fail because we don&#8217;t have a CSRF token. Yes, Laravel kindly adds this as a header to all AJAX requests made using Axios. But with a straight form submission I&#8217;ll need to add the token.\u00a0 This is easy in Blade, you just add <code>@csrf<\/code>\u00a0and go and make yourself a celebratory cup of coffee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in a component?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I can&#8217;t find any Laravel cleverness that somehow automatically gives you some kind of global token in Vue that you can use in any component.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I COULD pass it down through my component hierarchy as props, but that seems messy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A better way would be to have it as some kind of global state\/prop that I can use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One method for doing this is to add an <a href=\"https:\/\/vuejs.org\/v2\/cookbook\/adding-instance-properties.html\">Instance Property<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel DOES give you a head start in having an HTML meta element in the <code>&lt;head><\/code> that has the CSRF token in it. So that&#8217;s helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can the set a Vue instance property in our top-level app.js like so:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">\/\/ Add the token<br\/>Vue.prototype.$token <strong>= <\/strong>document.head.querySelector('meta[name=\"csrf-token\"]').content;<br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>I could not then find a way to directly reference this in my components template. So I had to pull it into the components <code>data<\/code>\u00a0and then bind that to a new hidden input in the form:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\" @click=\"deleteThing\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"delete\"><br\/>      &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_token\" :value=\"token\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ],<br\/>    data: function () {<br\/>      return {<br\/>        token: this.$token<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    computed: {<br\/>      deleteUrl: function () {<br\/>        return '\/admin\/things\/' <strong>+ <\/strong>this.thingData.id;<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    methods: {<br\/>      deleteThing: function( ev ) {<br\/>        ev.preventDefault();<br\/>        this.$el.getElementsByTagName('form')[0].submit();<br\/>      }<br\/>    }<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and, hang on, one final thing&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>method=\"delete\"<\/code>\u00a0on a <code>form<\/code> rarely works, so you need to fake it with a <code>post<\/code>\u00a0request and another input.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the final code:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\" @click=\"deleteThing\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"post\"><br\/>      &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_token\" :value=\"token\"><br\/>      &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_method\" value=\"DELETE\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ],<br\/>    data: function () {<br\/>      return {<br\/>        token: this.$token<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    computed: {<br\/>      deleteUrl: function () {<br\/>        return '\/admin\/things\/' <strong>+ <\/strong>this.thingData.id;<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    methods: {<br\/>      deleteThing: function( ev ) {<br\/>        ev.preventDefault();<br\/>        this.$el.getElementsByTagName('form')[0].submit();<br\/>      }<br\/>    }<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Phew!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really&#8230;what did I miss here?

Yes. I admit it. Early in my coding career I got to use SPARK Ada and the SPARK Examiner and it left its mark.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ada, for those that don&#8217;t know, is a curious programming language. Pascal-like, clunky, verbose, typed. But I was brought up on Pascal so I got on with it quite nicely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SPARK Ada is a subset of Ada that removes, well, all the dangerous stuff. It&#8217;s a subset that lets you prove properties about your code, such as whether or not you it will go beyond the bounds of an array, or whether you have loop invariants. And all before you even run it through a compiler.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This checking is called &#8220;static analysis&#8221;.\u00a0 Remember that &#8211; you&#8217;ll need it later!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rules of SPARK make coding in it even more verbose than with standard Ada. It&#8217;s strongly typed so all type conversions are explicit. Arrays have fixed types and bounds. All variables and data structures are of a known size.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;it gloriously eliminated huge swathes of potential run-time error conditions without even needing to write tests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Web development<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ada, as far as I know, isn&#8217;t used on the web (someone will prove me wrong, I&#8217;m sure). I mostly write PHP and JavaScript which, if you do things wrong, have a habit of making it up as you go along.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve used various text editors and IDE&#8217;s in my web development career.\u00a0 Notepad++, Aptana Studio, Sublime Text, and more recently PHPStorm and VS Code.\u00a0 VS Code recently replaced PHPStorm as the main tool I use for coding small projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a number of PHP extensions installed in VS Code, including Intelliphense, and I somehow thought that the editor and extensions would be clever enough to at least let me know if a variable I was using was undeclared or something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230;well&#8230;here&#8217;s some code I wrote today in VS Code:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"548\" height=\"170\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-16.57.32.png\" alt=\"Code snipper in VS code with a subtle error\" class=\"wp-image-3531\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-16.57.32.png 548w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-16.57.32-300x93.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Spot the deliberate error. It&#8217;s subtle. It&#8217;s on the second line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This code actually worked with a human-initiated &#8220;integration test&#8221; on the front end. This is because of a WordPress quirk whereby, further down the stack, <code>get_post( null )<\/code>\u00a0actually returns the current post, and it just so happened that the only place I called this method was in some code inside a loop where there was a current post, and the current post&#8217;s ID was always the same as the <code>$related_to_id<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway &#8211; I blame my text editor for this. How is an error of this sort not reported by my text editor, or by PHP, or anywhere?!\u00a0 This is exactly the sort of thing that a computer is really good at detecting, but a human is not (unless you are <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hellofromTonya\/status\/994600056266412032\">Tonya<\/a> &#8211; THANK YOU!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I discovered that I kinda take static analysis for granted, and miss it when it&#8217;s not there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After some research, it seems that setting up useful static analysis in VS Code is non-trivial (again, correct me if I&#8217;m wrong). But PHPStorm has some of this baked right into it&#8217;s core.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not SPARK Ada-level static analysis. But this is my computer doing what it&#8217;s best at: automating stuff that humans are bad at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"488\" height=\"175\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-17.09.20.png\" alt=\"Code snippet in PHPStorm with the same error, but with the error underlined!\" class=\"wp-image-3532\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-17.09.20.png 488w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-17.09.20-300x108.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ve gone running back to it.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>In which I lament my own utter incompetence, but also switch back from VS Code to PHPStorm in a flash and cry over programming languages<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been spoiled. Yes. I admit it. Early in my coding career I got to use SPARK Ada and the SPARK Examiner and it left its mark.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ada, for those that don&#8217;t know, is a curious programming language. Pascal-like, clunky, verbose, typed. But I was brought up on Pascal so I got on with it quite nicely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SPARK Ada is a subset of Ada that removes, well, all the dangerous stuff. It&#8217;s a subset that lets you prove properties about your code, such as whether or not you it will go beyond the bounds of an array, or whether you have loop invariants. And all before you even run it through a compiler.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This checking is called &#8220;static analysis&#8221;.\u00a0 Remember that &#8211; you&#8217;ll need it later!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rules of SPARK make coding in it even more verbose than with standard Ada. It&#8217;s strongly typed so all type conversions are explicit. Arrays have fixed types and bounds. All variables and data structures are of a known size.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;it gloriously eliminated huge swathes of potential run-time error conditions without even needing to write tests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Web development<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ada, as far as I know, isn&#8217;t used on the web (someone will prove me wrong, I&#8217;m sure). I mostly write PHP and JavaScript which, if you do things wrong, have a habit of making it up as you go along.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve used various text editors and IDE&#8217;s in my web development career.\u00a0 Notepad++, Aptana Studio, Sublime Text, and more recently PHPStorm and VS Code.\u00a0 VS Code recently replaced PHPStorm as the main tool I use for coding small projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a number of PHP extensions installed in VS Code, including Intelliphense, and I somehow thought that the editor and extensions would be clever enough to at least let me know if a variable I was using was undeclared or something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230;well&#8230;here&#8217;s some code I wrote today in VS Code:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"548\" height=\"170\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-16.57.32.png\" alt=\"Code snipper in VS code with a subtle error\" class=\"wp-image-3531\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-16.57.32.png 548w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-16.57.32-300x93.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Spot the deliberate error. It&#8217;s subtle. It&#8217;s on the second line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This code actually worked with a human-initiated &#8220;integration test&#8221; on the front end. This is because of a WordPress quirk whereby, further down the stack, <code>get_post( null )<\/code>\u00a0actually returns the current post, and it just so happened that the only place I called this method was in some code inside a loop where there was a current post, and the current post&#8217;s ID was always the same as the <code>$related_to_id<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway &#8211; I blame my text editor for this. How is an error of this sort not reported by my text editor, or by PHP, or anywhere?!\u00a0 This is exactly the sort of thing that a computer is really good at detecting, but a human is not (unless you are <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hellofromTonya\/status\/994600056266412032\">Tonya<\/a> &#8211; THANK YOU!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I discovered that I kinda take static analysis for granted, and miss it when it&#8217;s not there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After some research, it seems that setting up useful static analysis in VS Code is non-trivial (again, correct me if I&#8217;m wrong). But PHPStorm has some of this baked right into it&#8217;s core.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not SPARK Ada-level static analysis. But this is my computer doing what it&#8217;s best at: automating stuff that humans are bad at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"488\" height=\"175\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-17.09.20.png\" alt=\"Code snippet in PHPStorm with the same error, but with the error underlined!\" class=\"wp-image-3532\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-17.09.20.png 488w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-17.09.20-300x108.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ve gone running back to it.<\/p>\n",

I develop software. I have written software that helps aircraft fly! So I kinda know how computers work and how to make computers safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying the current paper based voting system isn&#8217;t flawed. There surely are ways that it could be exploited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT the thing about the current system is that it&#8217;s INCREDIBLY simple. You enter a room. You put a mark on a piece of paper. That goes in a sealed box. The boxes are all accounted for. The boxes are opened under scrutiny and the marked bits of paper are counted in public, under scrutiny from anyone that wants to see it happening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you wanted to you could wait outside (or presumably inside) the polling station and then follow your vote, in the box, to the count, and watch all the votes from your box being counted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if it&#8217;s tampered with there is usually a trail &#8211; a way to see how it was tampered with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This system is SO simple and transparent that I could explain it to my six year old and he would probably understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we know what this system&#8217;s flaws are and they have been mitigated over many years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Software<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>e-Voting introduces software. So let&#8217;s talk about software.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Software is INCREDIBLY complex. It&#8217;s very difficult to prove the properties of. It&#8217;s very difficult to show that it does what it should without error. It&#8217;s likely to have multiple flaws, any of which could be an exploitable security issue. You don&#8217;t know what it does. You don&#8217;t know how it works. You have no idea how trustworthy it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple, 1-decimal-place arithmetic is pretty easy, right? A computer should be able to do that accurately in micro seconds, right?

So let&#8217;s talk about the internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The internet is made up of millions of devices. You don&#8217;t know what they are. You don&#8217;t know WHERE they are. You don&#8217;t know what they do. You don&#8217;t know what software they are running. You don&#8217;t know what flaws they have.

And this comes with apologies to my mum, who retweeted this poll and made it appear in my Facebook and subsequently got a passionate rant from her son. She&#8217;s awesome and I totally\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f her! But it&#8217;s a good excuse to get people thinking about this&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\">\n    <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today&#39;s poll: It&#39;s local elections in parts of the UK tomorrow. Turnout&#39;s are rarely high. Is it time for optional secure digital home voting for all (or on application like postal votes)? Or is the effort needed to go to vote booth useful filtering?<br><br>What&#39;s CLOSEST to ur view?<\/p>&mdash; Martin Lewis (@MartinSLewis) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MartinSLewis\/status\/991599938365739013?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 2, 2018<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a software developer. I develop software. I have written software that helps aircraft fly! So I kinda know how computers work and how to make computers safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying the current paper based voting system isn&#8217;t flawed. There surely are ways that it could be exploited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT the thing about the current system is that it&#8217;s INCREDIBLY simple. You enter a room. You put a mark on a piece of paper. That goes in a sealed box. The boxes are all accounted for. The boxes are opened under scrutiny and the marked bits of paper are counted in public, under scrutiny from anyone that wants to see it happening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you wanted to you could wait outside (or presumably inside) the polling station and then follow your vote, in the box, to the count, and watch all the votes from your box being counted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if it&#8217;s tampered with there is usually a trail &#8211; a way to see how it was tampered with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This system is SO simple and transparent that I could explain it to my six year old and he would probably understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we know what this system&#8217;s flaws are and they have been mitigated over many years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Software<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>e-Voting introduces software. So let&#8217;s talk about software.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Software is INCREDIBLY complex. It&#8217;s very difficult to prove the properties of. It&#8217;s very difficult to show that it does what it should without error. It&#8217;s likely to have multiple flaws, any of which could be an exploitable security issue. You don&#8217;t know what it does. You don&#8217;t know how it works. You have no idea how trustworthy it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple, 1-decimal-place arithmetic is pretty easy, right? A computer should be able to do that accurately in micro seconds, right? Well, here is a picture of my web browser adding 0.1 and 0.2:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"344\" height=\"132\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-02-at-22.19.12.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3472\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-02-at-22.19.12.png 344w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-02-at-22.19.12-300x115.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px\" \/>\n    <figcaption>Computers, huh?<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I could explain how this is caused by a lack of precision in the JavaScript implementation of binary floating point arithmetic, but it&#8217;s unlikely that would make any sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it makes the point that when you think you&#8217;re simply adding 0.1 and 0.2, some incredibly complex things that you don&#8217;t understand are happening under the bonnet of your computer to make that happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s make a deal, then: if you can tell me what happens when you click the &#8220;Vote&#8221; button, then you can keep the idea of an electronic vote!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Internet<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And you want to send votes over the internet. So let&#8217;s talk about the internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The internet is made up of millions of devices. You don&#8217;t know what they are. You don&#8217;t know WHERE they are. You don&#8217;t know what they do. You don&#8217;t know what software they are running. You don&#8217;t know what flaws they have. You can&#8217;t take them apart and inspect what&#8217;s going on inside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A casino was <a href=\"https:\/\/thehackernews.com\/2018\/04\/iot-hacking-thermometer.html\">recently hacked into because it had an internet-connected thermometer in an aquarium in the lobby<\/a>. Hackers used this as an entry point to the casino&#8217;s private network and downloaded a database of gamblers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you really want a cobbled-together system of frankly-who-knows-what sending your vote to the authorities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But we have internet banking? Surely if that&#8217;s safe and reliable and trustworthy&#8230;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.moneysavingexpert.com\/news\/banking\/2018\/05\/40000-complain-over-tsb-meltdown---and-bosses-still-cant-say-when-itll-be-fixed\">Ahem&#8230;\ufeff<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Irony notice: that article linked above is on the website owned by the man who ran the Twitter poll)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Democracy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And to top it all, the government, and particularly local government, know precious little about how anything computer related works. Until a few years ago the local transport people sent informational emails with hundreds of people visibly cc&#8217;d in them. I wouldn&#8217;t trust them to even set a secure password on their own systems!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not long ago our NHS systems were infected with a program that locked them, encrypted them and threatened to delete all the data on them unless a ransom was paid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cambridge Analytica thing has proven that democracy is too important to allow it to be interfered with by software and algorithms that we don&#8217;t understand and that can be exploited in ways that we did not expect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230;maybe I convinced you, can we keep marks on bits of trees, please!?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if I didn&#8217;t, here&#8217;s 8 minutes of a fellow University of York Alumnus who is equally passionate about the topic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube\">\n    <iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/w3_0x6oaDmI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/figure>\n",

                "rendered": "<p><em>I&#8217;m using Test Driven Development (TDD) for the first (and second) time on a couple of side projects. I <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/01\/testing-out-tdd-initial-thoughts\/\">wrote up some of my really early thoughts<\/a> on the process before, but here are some further reflections on the process and issues I&#8217;ve come across.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Assurance is good!<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s great having my test suite able to tell me that I&#8217;ve not broken any core functionality. The flexibility that this gives me to change the structure of my code (&#8220;re-factoring&#8221; they call it) without changing what it does is great, and the confidence I have when adding new functionality is wonderful.<\/p>\n<h2>A mindset change is (possibly) coming<\/h2>\n<p>I mentioned in <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/01\/testing-out-tdd-initial-thoughts\/\">the previous TDD article<\/a> that I was thinking ahead a little as I coded and was wondering where to store those thoughts about what this thing will need to do in the future. And this is still a problem.<\/p>\n<p>But I can see a slight change of mindset happening. I can see how I might be starting to think more in terms of features and functions as I write, and less in terms of data.<\/p>\n<p>To explain, let&#8217;s take and example. I&#8217;m (stupidly) <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/about-kownter\/\">attempting to build my own analytics<\/a>. In its very basic form this has &#8220;sites&#8221; and &#8220;views&#8221; and each view belongs to a site. But in future I can see that I would want multiple users and the ability to assign sites to users.<\/p>\n<p>In the past I&#8217;d have got all hung up on making this ALL work together &#8211; define all my data structures, create my routes, and then build out all my models and controllers to make it all hang together. But with TDD I&#8217;ve taken <a href=\"https:\/\/course.testdrivenlaravel.com\/\">Adam<\/a>&#8216;s approach from his course, and got right down to the core of what this application does &#8211; sites and views &#8211; and written my tests for those things and built them up in code.<\/p>\n<p>So, right now, I have a working system with none of the complexity of users and site ownership.<\/p>\n<p>I still have the issue of not knowing where to store my thoughts about future functionality. So for example, I might have a <code class=\"code-inline\">sites_can_be_displayed<\/code> test, but in future I will need:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"code-inline\">a_user_can_see_their_own_sites<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code class=\"code-inline\">a_user_can_not_see_other_peoples_sites<\/code><\/li>\n<li>and <code class=\"code-inline\">a_guest_can_not_see_any_sites<\/code><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So what then happens to my <code class=\"code-inline\">sites_can_be_displayed<\/code> test? Will that still work? Do I still need it? Do I need to review all my existing tests when I make a change? Or will this test break somehow when I add the new functionality in, prompting me to update or remove the it? Tricky.<\/p>\n<p>I can also see that there might be overhead in building a feature at a time. If I anticipate features and build multiple features at the same time, I can get the benefit of knowing how it ALL hangs together from the start. Doing things a feature at a time might introduce inefficiencies that need to be re-factored away. Of course, having the tests helps with re-factoring, but it&#8217;s still overhead.<\/p>\n<h2>Redirects as responses<\/h2>\n<p>I realised quite early on that testing for HTTP responses in HTTP tests was good. You could test for exceptions as Jeffrey Way does on <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/lets-build-a-forum-with-laravel\/\">his Laracasts TDD course<\/a>, but I&#8217;m not quite there yet. But checking for an appropriate response has been helpful.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;you do need to understand what responses you should be getting. When building out user registration responses, for example, I forgot that Laravel redirects to somewhere immediately after registration. So my test call to:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$response = $this-&gt;post('\/register', &#x5B;\r\n'name' =&gt; 'Testy McTesterson',\r\n'email' =&gt; 'test@example.com',\r\n'password' =&gt; 'blahblah',\r\n'password_confirmation' =&gt; 'blahblah',\r\n] );\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>didn&#8217;t get a 200 response &#8211; my:<\/p>\n<p><code>$response-&gt;assertStatus(200);<\/code><\/p>\n<p>failed, it got a redirect instead! So I needed to&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><code>$response-&gt;assertRedirect('some_path');<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Note that I also got caught out by the default password length check and forgot that this also redirects me back to the register page rather than giving me an HTTP error status.<\/p>\n<p>(Aside: yes, I will use factories at some point)<\/p>\n<p>And all this registration form testing leads to&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>How much should I test?<\/h2>\n<p>One question I had as I went along is: How much should I test at this point?<\/p>\n<p>Should I be testing the default password length check? The registration process at all? Can I just assume that this works?<\/p>\n<p>I think I decided that I should test critical and\/or customised parts &#8211; so I test user registration as that could contain custom fields or parameters that could change, but not login as that&#8217;s pretty much out of the box and doesn&#8217;t really modify any data in the system.<\/p>\n<h2>from() on form requests<\/h2>\n<p>The failed registration also raised another issue. The redirect it created uses the <code class=\"code-inline\">back()<\/code> method (I assume) to send you back to the page you filled the form in on. This, in turn, makes use of the referer header. Which I wasn&#8217;t sending.<\/p>\n<p>So even when I&#8217;d written my <code class=\"code-inline\">assertRedirect()<\/code>, it was failing, because my <code class=\"code-inline\">$this-&gt;post()<\/code> request wasn&#8217;t sending a referer. So this relatively simple form-submitting test tripped me up in quite a few ways.<\/p>\n<p>The fix for this was to use the <code class=\"code-inline\">from()<\/code> method to set the referrer &#8211; so the request in this test is actually:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$response = $this-&gt;from('\/register')-&gt;post('\/register', &#x5B;\r\n  'name' =&gt; 'Testy McTesterson',\r\n  'email' =&gt; 'test@example.com',\r\n  'password' =&gt; 'blah',\r\n  'password_confirmation' =&gt; 'blahblah',\r\n] );\r\n<\/pre>\n<h2>CSRFs and middleware<\/h2>\n<p>As I was writing the form submission test I thought: &#8220;But there&#8217;s a CSRF check. How do I pass that in my request?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And, well, it turns out CSRF checks are disabled in the test suite which makes things a whole load easier.<\/p>\n<p>But should I be bothered by this? Shouldn&#8217;t I be testing that <code class=\"code-inline\">submitting_a_form_without_a_valid_csrf_token_fails<\/code>? How do I know if I&#8217;m supposed to test this or not? Where do I go to find this out?<\/p>\n<h2>Laravel release notes<\/h2>\n<p>In attempting to find out if I should test CSRF checks I found (probably via some forum threads, I don&#8217;t remember) the <code class=\"code-inline\">withoutMiddleware<\/code> trait that you could use. This, it turns out, <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.2\/testing#disabling-middleware\">is optional up to Laravel 5.2<\/a>, but it&#8217;s not &#8211; according to the docs &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.6\/testing\">in the latest version of Laravel<\/a> (5.6 at writing).<\/p>\n<p>My instinct, when I found a thing that was documented in 5.2, but not 5.6 was to look for <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.6\/releases\">release notes<\/a> for Laravel saying what has changed. But the <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.6\/releases\">latest release notes page<\/a> doesn&#8217;t show any historical release notes.<\/p>\n<p>This turns out to be stupidity on my part and you just need to use the version selector to view past release notes (e.g. <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.3\/releases\">these<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>And in any case, the release notes turned out not to mention the <code class=\"code-inline\">withoutMiddleware<\/code> change.<\/p>\n<p>I guess the release notes can&#8217;t detail every tiny little thing that&#8217;s different, and not finding the release notes was kinda my own fault, but it was just another tiny little thing that piled on top of all the other things I was confused about and got in the way of my learning. But I was expecting the documentation to answer my question and it didn&#8217;t seem to exist and when I did find it it didn&#8217;t answer my question. Grrrr.<\/p>\n<h2>On getting to MVP slower and the value of TDD<\/h2>\n<p>On the face of it, getting to MVP is harder and slower. You write a test for a feature, and then build the feature. But in doing that you realise you need to spawn other tests for the same feature. E.g. <code class=\"code-inline\">user_can_create_thing<\/code> might lead to <code class=\"code-inline\">a_new_thing_has_a_default_state_of_x<\/code> or <code class=\"code-inline\">a_guest_can_not_create_a_thing<\/code> or <code class=\"code-inline\">a_thing_must_have_a_unique_name<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Writing all these tests for the simple feature that you just built helps you refine the feature, sure. But it slows you down.<\/p>\n<p>Or does it? Is this just because I\u2019m learning? Will it speed me up later? Is this not really a good process for small side projects?<\/p>\n<p>I think what I&#8217;ve come to realise is that there is an initial outlay\/investment in getting your test suite off the ground. Those initial tests for simple stuff like creating a user are things that you will do on lots of projects. You&#8217;ll write factories for data early on and use them again and again in your future tests.<\/p>\n<p>So for a relatively small side-project this overhead represents a significant part of the work and probably doesn&#8217;t get you much payback as you won&#8217;t run the tests as much.<\/p>\n<p>But for a large project, the testing overhead is smaller and the value of the tests is much greater. So it will feel more worthwhile.<\/p>\n<h2>Where I&#8217;m at<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m enjoying using TDD, but, as I just mentioned, for the small things I&#8217;m building with it, it feels like a lot of effort.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;this is serving me well for the future. I HAVE to build these small projects using it because without them I won&#8217;t have confidence that I can use TDD on the larger projects that may come along.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not a 100% convert to either the <a href=\"https:\/\/course.testdrivenlaravel.com\/\">Wathan Way<\/a> or the <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/lets-build-a-forum-with-laravel\/\">Jeffrey Way<\/a> (the Way Way?) of TDD and I think they&#8217;d both say I should be pragmatic and thoughtful in my approach anyway rather than religiously following either of their approaches.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m being pulled up short a bit on unit testing too &#8211; this is something I need to delve into more. Currently most of my tests are feature\/HTTP tests. And unit tests feel a bit like:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$test = x;\r\n$this-&gt;assertEquals(x, $test);\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>I mean, not quite like that &#8211; it&#8217;s an extreme example. But you get the idea. And I&#8217;m sure I feel this way because I&#8217;m testing the wrong things. So still plenty to learn.<\/p>\n<p>Leave your TTD tips and tricks and wisdom for me and others below. Thanks!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><em>I&#8217;m using Test Driven Development (TDD) for the first (and second) time on a couple of side projects. I <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/01\/testing-out-tdd-initial-thoughts\/\">wrote up some of my really early thoughts<\/a> on the process before, but here are some further reflections on the process and issues I&#8217;ve come across.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Assurance is good!<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s great having my test suite able to tell me that I&#8217;ve not broken any core functionality. The flexibility that this gives me to change the structure of my code (&#8220;re-factoring&#8221; they call it) without changing what it does is great, and the confidence I have when adding new functionality is wonderful.<\/p>\n<h2>A mindset change is (possibly) coming<\/h2>\n<p>I mentioned in <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/01\/testing-out-tdd-initial-thoughts\/\">the previous TDD article<\/a> that I was thinking ahead a little as I coded and was wondering where to store those thoughts about what this thing will need to do in the future. And this is still a problem.<\/p>\n<p>But I can see a slight change of mindset happening. I can see how I might be starting to think more in terms of features and functions as I write, and less in terms of data.<\/p>\n<p>To explain, let&#8217;s take and example. I&#8217;m (stupidly) <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/about-kownter\/\">attempting to build my own analytics<\/a>. In its very basic form this has &#8220;sites&#8221; and &#8220;views&#8221; and each view belongs to a site. But in future I can see that I would want multiple users and the ability to assign sites to users.<\/p>\n<p>In the past I&#8217;d have got all hung up on making this ALL work together &#8211; define all my data structures, create my routes, and then build out all my models and controllers to make it all hang together. But with TDD I&#8217;ve taken <a href=\"https:\/\/course.testdrivenlaravel.com\/\">Adam<\/a>&#8216;s approach from his course, and got right down to the core of what this application does &#8211; sites and views &#8211; and written my tests for those things and built them up in code.<\/p>\n<p>So, right now, I have a working system with none of the complexity of users and site ownership.<\/p>\n<p>I still have the issue of not knowing where to store my thoughts about future functionality. So for example, I might have a <code class=\"code-inline\">sites_can_be_displayed<\/code> test, but in future I will need:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"code-inline\">a_user_can_see_their_own_sites<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code class=\"code-inline\">a_user_can_not_see_other_peoples_sites<\/code><\/li>\n<li>and <code class=\"code-inline\">a_guest_can_not_see_any_sites<\/code><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So what then happens to my <code class=\"code-inline\">sites_can_be_displayed<\/code> test? Will that still work? Do I still need it? Do I need to review all my existing tests when I make a change? Or will this test break somehow when I add the new functionality in, prompting me to update or remove the it? Tricky.<\/p>\n<p>I can also see that there might be overhead in building a feature at a time. If I anticipate features and build multiple features at the same time, I can get the benefit of knowing how it ALL hangs together from the start. Doing things a feature at a time might introduce inefficiencies that need to be re-factored away. Of course, having the tests helps with re-factoring, but it&#8217;s still overhead.<\/p>\n<h2>Redirects as responses<\/h2>\n<p>I realised quite early on that testing for HTTP responses in HTTP tests was good. You could test for exceptions as Jeffrey Way does on <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/lets-build-a-forum-with-laravel\/\">his Laracasts TDD course<\/a>, but I&#8217;m not quite there yet. But checking for an appropriate response has been helpful.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;you do need to understand what responses you should be getting. When building out user registration responses, for example, I forgot that Laravel redirects to somewhere immediately after registration. So my test call to:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$response = $this-&gt;post('\/register', &#x5B;\r\n'name' =&gt; 'Testy McTesterson',\r\n'email' =&gt; 'test@example.com',\r\n'password' =&gt; 'blahblah',\r\n'password_confirmation' =&gt; 'blahblah',\r\n] );\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>didn&#8217;t get a 200 response &#8211; my:<\/p>\n<p><code>$response-&gt;assertStatus(200);<\/code><\/p>\n<p>failed, it got a redirect instead! So I needed to&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><code>$response-&gt;assertRedirect('some_path');<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Note that I also got caught out by the default password length check and forgot that this also redirects me back to the register page rather than giving me an HTTP error status.<\/p>\n<p>(Aside: yes, I will use factories at some point)<\/p>\n<p>And all this registration form testing leads to&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>How much should I test?<\/h2>\n<p>One question I had as I went along is: How much should I test at this point?<\/p>\n<p>Should I be testing the default password length check? The registration process at all? Can I just assume that this works?<\/p>\n<p>I think I decided that I should test critical and\/or customised parts &#8211; so I test user registration as that could contain custom fields or parameters that could change, but not login as that&#8217;s pretty much out of the box and doesn&#8217;t really modify any data in the system.<\/p>\n<h2>from() on form requests<\/h2>\n<p>The failed registration also raised another issue. The redirect it created uses the <code class=\"code-inline\">back()<\/code> method (I assume) to send you back to the page you filled the form in on. This, in turn, makes use of the referer header. Which I wasn&#8217;t sending.<\/p>\n<p>So even when I&#8217;d written my <code class=\"code-inline\">assertRedirect()<\/code>, it was failing, because my <code class=\"code-inline\">$this-&gt;post()<\/code> request wasn&#8217;t sending a referer. So this relatively simple form-submitting test tripped me up in quite a few ways.<\/p>\n<p>The fix for this was to use the <code class=\"code-inline\">from()<\/code> method to set the referrer &#8211; so the request in this test is actually:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$response = $this-&gt;from('\/register')-&gt;post('\/register', &#x5B;\r\n  'name' =&gt; 'Testy McTesterson',\r\n  'email' =&gt; 'test@example.com',\r\n  'password' =&gt; 'blah',\r\n  'password_confirmation' =&gt; 'blahblah',\r\n] );\r\n<\/pre>\n<h2>CSRFs and middleware<\/h2>\n<p>As I was writing the form submission test I thought: &#8220;But there&#8217;s a CSRF check. How do I pass that in my request?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And, well, it turns out CSRF checks are disabled in the test suite which makes things a whole load easier.<\/p>\n<p>But should I be bothered by this? Shouldn&#8217;t I be testing that <code class=\"code-inline\">submitting_a_form_without_a_valid_csrf_token_fails<\/code>? How do I know if I&#8217;m supposed to test this or not? Where do I go to find this out?<\/p>\n<h2>Laravel release notes<\/h2>\n<p>In attempting to find out if I should test CSRF checks I found (probably via some forum threads, I don&#8217;t remember) the <code class=\"code-inline\">withoutMiddleware<\/code> trait that you could use. This, it turns out, <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.2\/testing#disabling-middleware\">is optional up to Laravel 5.2<\/a>, but it&#8217;s not &#8211; according to the docs &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.6\/testing\">in the latest version of Laravel<\/a> (5.6 at writing).<\/p>\n<p>My instinct, when I found a thing that was documented in 5.2, but not 5.6 was to look for <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.6\/releases\">release notes<\/a> for Laravel saying what has changed. But the <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.6\/releases\">latest release notes page<\/a> doesn&#8217;t show any historical release notes.<\/p>\n<p>This turns out to be stupidity on my part and you just need to use the version selector to view past release notes (e.g. <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.3\/releases\">these<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>And in any case, the release notes turned out not to mention the <code class=\"code-inline\">withoutMiddleware<\/code> change.<\/p>\n<p>I guess the release notes can&#8217;t detail every tiny little thing that&#8217;s different, and not finding the release notes was kinda my own fault, but it was just another tiny little thing that piled on top of all the other things I was confused about and got in the way of my learning. But I was expecting the documentation to answer my question and it didn&#8217;t seem to exist and when I did find it it didn&#8217;t answer my question. Grrrr.<\/p>\n<h2>On getting to MVP slower and the value of TDD<\/h2>\n<p>On the face of it, getting to MVP is harder and slower. You write a test for a feature, and then build the feature. But in doing that you realise you need to spawn other tests for the same feature. E.g. <code class=\"code-inline\">user_can_create_thing<\/code> might lead to <code class=\"code-inline\">a_new_thing_has_a_default_state_of_x<\/code> or <code class=\"code-inline\">a_guest_can_not_create_a_thing<\/code> or <code class=\"code-inline\">a_thing_must_have_a_unique_name<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Writing all these tests for the simple feature that you just built helps you refine the feature, sure. But it slows you down.<\/p>\n<p>Or does it? Is this just because I\u2019m learning? Will it speed me up later? Is this not really a good process for small side projects?<\/p>\n<p>I think what I&#8217;ve come to realise is that there is an initial outlay\/investment in getting your test suite off the ground. Those initial tests for simple stuff like creating a user are things that you will do on lots of projects. You&#8217;ll write factories for data early on and use them again and again in your future tests.<\/p>\n<p>So for a relatively small side-project this overhead represents a significant part of the work and probably doesn&#8217;t get you much payback as you won&#8217;t run the tests as much.<\/p>\n<p>But for a large project, the testing overhead is smaller and the value of the tests is much greater. So it will feel more worthwhile.<\/p>\n<h2>Where I&#8217;m at<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m enjoying using TDD, but, as I just mentioned, for the small things I&#8217;m building with it, it feels like a lot of effort.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;this is serving me well for the future. I HAVE to build these small projects using it because without them I won&#8217;t have confidence that I can use TDD on the larger projects that may come along.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not a 100% convert to either the <a href=\"https:\/\/course.testdrivenlaravel.com\/\">Wathan Way<\/a> or the <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/lets-build-a-forum-with-laravel\/\">Jeffrey Way<\/a> (the Way Way?) of TDD and I think they&#8217;d both say I should be pragmatic and thoughtful in my approach anyway rather than religiously following either of their approaches.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m being pulled up short a bit on unit testing too &#8211; this is something I need to delve into more. Currently most of my tests are feature\/HTTP tests. And unit tests feel a bit like:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$test = x;\r\n$this-&gt;assertEquals(x, $test);\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>I mean, not quite like that &#8211; it&#8217;s an extreme example. But you get the idea. And I&#8217;m sure I feel this way because I&#8217;m testing the wrong things. So still plenty to learn.<\/p>\n<p>Leave your TTD tips and tricks and wisdom for me and others below. Thanks!<\/p>\n",
