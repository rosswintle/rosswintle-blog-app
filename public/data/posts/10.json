Sally got two top-price tickets to the musical Chicago!<\/p>\n<p>Sally loves the film version of this, I quite like it myself, and we both wanted to see it &#8220;Live&#8221;.  So, yesterday, off we went to London (luckily she chose to go with me), for a fun day out.<\/p>\n<p>As part of the present I&#8217;d bought the CD of the soundtrack too.  The film and the CD are, as you would expect highly polished, well produced, with dazzling effects, stunning performances from all the artists, and plenty of razzmatazz and razzle-dazzle.<\/p>\n<p>We love the music, which is lively and varied and really captures the mood of 1920&#8217;s America.<\/p>\n<p>Did the stage show live up to the promise of the film and soundtrack?<\/p>\n<p>Well, yes!  But they we&#8217;re very different.  The show was&#8230;well&#8230;I guess it was more of a show.  It was less polished but it knew that and made up for it by being slightly tongue-in-cheek.  The show girl scene portrayed in the movie as sleazy and sensational, came across in the show as slightly silly &#8211; more Blackpool Pier than Chicago!<\/p>\n<p>The stage was less sophisticated than I was expecting.  It was quite a basic set up but with the band on platforms behind a limited stage space.  The musicians were very prominent and played a big part in the show.  There was even some clever interaction between the cast, the band and the conductor, which worked very well.  The music was brilliant and I thought the band were just as much stars as the cast were.<\/p>\n<p>It was highly entertaining and, while not worthy of a standing ovation, very well performed by some very fit, strong and talented people who can dance, act, sing, climb, and do acrobatics &#8211; usually more than one at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>All in all it was well worth going to see.  The excellent soundtrack (bar the last few tracks which are modern songs &#8220;based on&#8221; the story) will be revived occasionally I&#8217;m sure, but, as is my experience with most musical soundtracks, won&#8217;t be an often-heard CD.  The film, however, will be watched again and again on dull evenings that need a bit of livening up.<\/p>\n",

Sally got two top-price tickets to the musical Chicago!<\/p>\n<p>Sally loves the film version of this, I quite like it myself, and we both wanted to see it &#8220;Live&#8221;.  So, yesterday, off we went to London (luckily she chose to go with me), for a fun day out.<\/p>\n<p>As part of the present I&#8217;d bought the CD of the soundtrack too.  The film and the CD are, as you would expect highly polished, well produced, with dazzling effects, stunning performances from all the artists, and plenty of razzmatazz and razzle-dazzle.<\/p>\n<p>We love the music, which is lively and varied and really captures the mood of 1920&#8217;s America.<\/p>\n<p>Did the stage show live up to the promise of the film and soundtrack?<\/p>\n<p>Well, yes!  But they we&#8217;re very different.  The show was&#8230;well&#8230;I guess it was more of a show.  It was less polished but it knew that and made up for it by being slightly tongue-in-cheek.  The show girl scene portrayed in the movie as sleazy and sensational, came across in the show as slightly silly &#8211; more Blackpool Pier than Chicago!<\/p>\n<p>The stage was less sophisticated than I was expecting.  It was quite a basic set up but with the band on platforms behind a limited stage space.  The musicians were very prominent and played a big part in the show.  There was even some clever interaction between the cast, the band and the conductor, which worked very well.  The music was brilliant and I thought the band were just as much stars as the cast were.<\/p>\n<p>It was highly entertaining and, while not worthy of a standing ovation, very well performed by some very fit, strong and talented people who can dance, act, sing, climb, and do acrobatics &#8211; usually more than one at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>All in all it was well worth going to see.  The excellent soundtrack (bar the last few tracks which are modern songs &#8220;based on&#8221; the story) will be revived occasionally I&#8217;m sure, but, as is my experience with most musical soundtracks, won&#8217;t be an often-heard CD.  The film, however, will be watched again and again on dull evenings that need a bit of livening up.<\/p>\n",

We listen to the radio quite a lot and it&#8217;s been annoying us that we get bad reception in the new house.<\/p>\n<p>But DAB radio&#8217;s are expensive and we&#8217;ve questioned the value.  Several of our friends have them though &#8211; a surprising number in fact! &#8211; and with moving out of London meaning we get less access to stations like XFM that we like, we decided to look into them a bit more closely.<\/p>\n<p>I, with my techie hat on, was looking for features.  We like the &#8220;live pause and rewind&#8221; on our Sky+ box, and I was hoping to get that functionality in the radio too &#8211; should be simple enough you would think.  I also wanted to be able to plug an iPod into it &#8211; preferable through a line-in socket.  Sally, with her aesthetics hat on (we&#8217;re a good team) wouldn&#8217;t let me get a cheap, plastic-looking one &#8211; preferring the slightly vintage look of the Pure and Robert&#8217;s models.<\/p>\n<p>We tested the water by getting a cheap (\u00a335) Roberts clock radio.  A lot of our listening is done in bed as we attempt to wake up, so this seemed like a good way to try it out.  And&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I was astonished!<\/p>\n<p>I thought we&#8217;d get poor reception, with it constantly breaking up.  But, no.  DAB, here in Swindon at least, is crystal clear.  We get a good range of stations.  The sound quality is excellent.  And the radios are incredibly easy to use &#8211; I don&#8217;t say that lightly by the way, but you literally plug it in and it works with barely a button press.<\/p>\n<p>We were SO impressed that we almost immediately went to Amazon and spent a lot more money on a Pure Evoke 1S for the kitchen.  Which is equally easy to use, crystal clear, well built, has most of the technical features I wanted (not live pause and rewind &#8211; surprisingly few models had this!), and looks the business.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d happily evangelise DAB radio to anyone.  If you&#8217;re thinking you have reason to switch &#8211; do it!<\/p>\n<p>I still think the receivers aren&#8217;t particularly good value but in this case I&#8217;m happy to pay the premium for being a fairly-early adopter.  Perhaps prices will come down as take-up increases?  Or maybe the signal is sufficiently poor on other places to limit its take up.  I guess only time will tell.<\/p>\n",

We listen to the radio quite a lot and it&#8217;s been annoying us that we get bad reception in the new house.<\/p>\n<p>But DAB radio&#8217;s are expensive and we&#8217;ve questioned the value.  Several of our friends have them though &#8211; a surprising number in fact! &#8211; and with moving out of London meaning we get less access to stations like XFM that we like, we decided to look into them a bit more closely.<\/p>\n<p>I, with my techie hat on, was looking for features.  We like the &#8220;live pause and rewind&#8221; on our Sky+ box, and I was hoping to get that functionality in the radio too &#8211; should be simple enough you would think.  I also wanted to be able to plug an iPod into it &#8211; preferable through a line-in socket.  Sally, with her aesthetics hat on (we&#8217;re a good team) wouldn&#8217;t let me get a cheap, plastic-looking one &#8211; preferring the slightly vintage look of the Pure and Robert&#8217;s models.<\/p>\n<p>We tested the water by getting a cheap (\u00a335) Roberts clock radio.  A lot of our listening is done in bed as we attempt to wake up, so this seemed like a good way to try it out.  And&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I was astonished!<\/p>\n<p>I thought we&#8217;d get poor reception, with it constantly breaking up.  But, no.  DAB, here in Swindon at least, is crystal clear.  We get a good range of stations.  The sound quality is excellent.  And the radios are incredibly easy to use &#8211; I don&#8217;t say that lightly by the way, but you literally plug it in and it works with barely a button press.<\/p>\n<p>We were SO impressed that we almost immediately went to Amazon and spent a lot more money on a Pure Evoke 1S for the kitchen.  Which is equally easy to use, crystal clear, well built, has most of the technical features I wanted (not live pause and rewind &#8211; surprisingly few models had this!), and looks the business.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d happily evangelise DAB radio to anyone.  If you&#8217;re thinking you have reason to switch &#8211; do it!<\/p>\n<p>I still think the receivers aren&#8217;t particularly good value but in this case I&#8217;m happy to pay the premium for being a fairly-early adopter.  Perhaps prices will come down as take-up increases?  Or maybe the signal is sufficiently poor on other places to limit its take up.  I guess only time will tell.<\/p>\n",

Still&#8230;let&#8217;s give it a go.<\/p>\n<p>Week 1 of the new year&#8217;s challenge.  Learn a popular song every week for a year.<\/p>\n<p>There were various discussions about which to do first, but I&#8217;ve decided on Sally&#8217;s suggestion of The Pogues&#8217; &#8220;A Fairytale of New York&#8221;.  Pretty simple music, mostly Gs, Ds and As with a few Bm&#8217;s, but with some interesting words.  It helps that the words kind of tell a story as it&#8217;s easier to remember.<\/p>\n<p>The choice of a male\/female duet may probe interesting too.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve actually spent more time trying to learn the words than the music.  That will have to change.  The problem is that it&#8217;s one of those songs that I&#8217;ve heard a million time and I think I know some of the words from what they sound like.  e.g. I always thought the chorus bit was:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The wise and the unwise singing (something) were singing going (something)&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>when it&#8217;s actually<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The boys of the NYPD choir were singing Galway Bay&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>which makes a LOT more sense.<\/p>\n<p>In other &#8220;52 songs&#8221; news, I&#8217;ve using technology to help me!  I&#8217;ve started downloading some popular tracks from iTunes at 79p each.  I&#8217;m going to create a &#8220;52 songs&#8221; playlist to help me along, and I have a folder for keeping the tabs (guitar chord music) in.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway&#8230;off to learn the music!  Report back &#8211; and a new song! &#8211; at the end of the week.<\/p>\n",

Still&#8230;let&#8217;s give it a go.<\/p>\n<p>Week 1 of the new year&#8217;s challenge.  Learn a popular song every week for a year.<\/p>\n<p>There were various discussions about which to do first, but I&#8217;ve decided on Sally&#8217;s suggestion of The Pogues&#8217; &#8220;A Fairytale of New York&#8221;.  Pretty simple music, mostly Gs, Ds and As with a few Bm&#8217;s, but with some interesting words.  It helps that the words kind of tell a story as it&#8217;s easier to remember.<\/p>\n<p>The choice of a male\/female duet may probe interesting too.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve actually spent more time trying to learn the words than the music.  That will have to change.  The problem is that it&#8217;s one of those songs that I&#8217;ve heard a million time and I think I know some of the words from what they sound like.  e.g. I always thought the chorus bit was:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The wise and the unwise singing (something) were singing going (something)&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>when it&#8217;s actually<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The boys of the NYPD choir were singing Galway Bay&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>which makes a LOT more sense.<\/p>\n<p>In other &#8220;52 songs&#8221; news, I&#8217;ve using technology to help me!  I&#8217;ve started downloading some popular tracks from iTunes at 79p each.  I&#8217;m going to create a &#8220;52 songs&#8221; playlist to help me along, and I have a folder for keeping the tabs (guitar chord music) in.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway&#8230;off to learn the music!  Report back &#8211; and a new song! &#8211; at the end of the week.<\/p>\n",

Booooo!<\/p>\n<p>They seem confined to the loft above our extension and the wall cavities.  After calling the council and hearing that it would take up to 5 working days to get back to us, we put poisoned bait down and this didn&#8217;t initially seem to help.<\/p>\n<p>The man from the council came today though.   He was a very helpful little Yorkshire man, who&#8217;s been doing the job of pest control for about 5 years &#8211; though I sense he could actually &#8220;smell a rat&#8221; if required &#8211; probably at a hundred paces.<\/p>\n<p>He identified where they are probably coming in and out (rats have to get food and water, and there ain&#8217;t none of that in our loft), and put down lots&#8230;LOTS more bait.  We&#8217;ll have to wait and see what happens.  &#8220;They&#8217;re wild animals&#8221;, he said, and their behaviour is not predictable.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, they&#8217;ve chewed our electric cables, tripping out our electricity, and subsequently causing us to have a non-functioning boiler.  No electric, ho heating.<\/p>\n<p>The fuse panel has several fuses and an RCD device.  The RCD was what was tripping and this takes out the whole panel.  Again, after a few phone calls and chats with other people, we worked out that our fuse box is completely incorrectly labelled, ran around the house flicking fuses and switches until we knew which fuse did what, and have isloated the upstairs lighting circuit (which is why we think it&#8217;s caused by the rats nibbling cables).<\/p>\n<p>So, we now have rats, and no upstairs lights, but our heating and other electrics are back on.<\/p>\n<p>If that wasn&#8217;t enough.  I&#8217;ve done my back in (so I&#8217;m off the bike&#8230;AGAIN!), we have a leaky connection at the end of our washing machine inlet hose, which had caused a big puddle to form in our utility room, and our oven broke just before we had 6 people coming for new year (the timer switch, which has to be on for the oven to be on, had burnt out its contacts).<\/p>\n<p>The joys of owning a house!!!  Can 2008 have had a worse start??  (Well, yes, we could be in Kenya, which is in a right state at the moment &#8211; our problems are kinda put into perspective when you watch the news at the moment).<\/p>\n",

Booooo!<\/p>\n<p>They seem confined to the loft above our extension and the wall cavities.  After calling the council and hearing that it would take up to 5 working days to get back to us, we put poisoned bait down and this didn&#8217;t initially seem to help.<\/p>\n<p>The man from the council came today though.   He was a very helpful little Yorkshire man, who&#8217;s been doing the job of pest control for about 5 years &#8211; though I sense he could actually &#8220;smell a rat&#8221; if required &#8211; probably at a hundred paces.<\/p>\n<p>He identified where they are probably coming in and out (rats have to get food and water, and there ain&#8217;t none of that in our loft), and put down lots&#8230;LOTS more bait.  We&#8217;ll have to wait and see what happens.  &#8220;They&#8217;re wild animals&#8221;, he said, and their behaviour is not predictable.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, they&#8217;ve chewed our electric cables, tripping out our electricity, and subsequently causing us to have a non-functioning boiler.  No electric, ho heating.<\/p>\n<p>The fuse panel has several fuses and an RCD device.  The RCD was what was tripping and this takes out the whole panel.  Again, after a few phone calls and chats with other people, we worked out that our fuse box is completely incorrectly labelled, ran around the house flicking fuses and switches until we knew which fuse did what, and have isloated the upstairs lighting circuit (which is why we think it&#8217;s caused by the rats nibbling cables).<\/p>\n<p>So, we now have rats, and no upstairs lights, but our heating and other electrics are back on.<\/p>\n<p>If that wasn&#8217;t enough.  I&#8217;ve done my back in (so I&#8217;m off the bike&#8230;AGAIN!), we have a leaky connection at the end of our washing machine inlet hose, which had caused a big puddle to form in our utility room, and our oven broke just before we had 6 people coming for new year (the timer switch, which has to be on for the oven to be on, had burnt out its contacts).<\/p>\n<p>The joys of owning a house!!!  Can 2008 have had a worse start??  (Well, yes, we could be in Kenya, which is in a right state at the moment &#8211; our problems are kinda put into perspective when you watch the news at the moment).<\/p>\n",

Mostly joyful with the marriage of two good friends in London and good time spent with our old London church family.<\/p>\n<p>On Saturday I woke up feeling very tired and like I was fighting something off.  I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d make it through the wedding ceremony, but did , and was then prayed for and, praise the LORD, felt a whole load better.<\/p>\n<p>My back got better later in the week, and then has been suddenly and worryingly worse again today.  The pain has stopped being muscular and now feels like a sharp, nerve-type pain.  I was literally in tears with pain earlier.<\/p>\n<p>But time with the St Simons church family is always time of being inspired and challenged.  The focus of the weekend for me was putting God first.   I had some amazing conversations about this with people, heard amazing stories about how people have put God first, listened to God and followed what he&#8217;s telling them to do.  People who seem to have discovered (or are discovering) that when you really put God first, the other things sort themselves out.<\/p>\n<p>Even the sermon this morning, from the first chapter of the book of Jonah, was about putting aside &#8220;idols&#8221; to do what God wants us to do.  It was a real theme.<\/p>\n<p>I could write lots but God was very present this weekend.  I&#8217;m inspired to pray more, to listen to God more, to talk more openly about what God is doing, and about my faith.  The people of St Simon&#8217;s are so outward focussed, so keen to share what God is doing (and he&#8217;s doing lots).  I take courage from that.  And I&#8217;ve had some good times of prayer with others this weekend where the LORD has already spoken.<\/p>\n<p>So despite my physical ailments, lots to give thanks for.  I feel joyful despite my pain.  I have plenty of theological meat to chew on (anyone want to study the book of James with me?).  I have lots to get on and do too.<\/p>\n<p>The LORD is good and I pray today for J &amp; A who got married, that he will bless them with each other as much as I have been blessed with my own, beautiful, loving wife.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>A mixed weekend.  Mostly joyful with the marriage of two good friends in London and good time spent with our old London church family.<\/p>\n<p>On Saturday I woke up feeling very tired and like I was fighting something off.  I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d make it through the wedding ceremony, but did , and was then prayed for and, praise the LORD, felt a whole load better.<\/p>\n<p>My back got better later in the week, and then has been suddenly and worryingly worse again today.  The pain has stopped being muscular and now feels like a sharp, nerve-type pain.  I was literally in tears with pain earlier.<\/p>\n<p>But time with the St Simons church family is always time of being inspired and challenged.  The focus of the weekend for me was putting God first.   I had some amazing conversations about this with people, heard amazing stories about how people have put God first, listened to God and followed what he&#8217;s telling them to do.  People who seem to have discovered (or are discovering) that when you really put God first, the other things sort themselves out.<\/p>\n<p>Even the sermon this morning, from the first chapter of the book of Jonah, was about putting aside &#8220;idols&#8221; to do what God wants us to do.  It was a real theme.<\/p>\n<p>I could write lots but God was very present this weekend.  I&#8217;m inspired to pray more, to listen to God more, to talk more openly about what God is doing, and about my faith.  The people of St Simon&#8217;s are so outward focussed, so keen to share what God is doing (and he&#8217;s doing lots).  I take courage from that.  And I&#8217;ve had some good times of prayer with others this weekend where the LORD has already spoken.<\/p>\n<p>So despite my physical ailments, lots to give thanks for.  I feel joyful despite my pain.  I have plenty of theological meat to chew on (anyone want to study the book of James with me?).  I have lots to get on and do too.<\/p>\n<p>The LORD is good and I pray today for J &amp; A who got married, that he will bless them with each other as much as I have been blessed with my own, beautiful, loving wife.<\/p>\n",
