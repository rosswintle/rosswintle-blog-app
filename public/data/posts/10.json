Here&#8217;s how!<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that I have built my own personal Messenger \u201cbot\u201d for school information called SchoolBot.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But at some point I\u2019d love for it to be more public, to get people to test it, to get some feedback from more normal people than I to see if it\u2019s really, actually useful, or just a toy for me to play with.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So I created a test instance for \u201cSpringfield Elementary\u201d with the aim of allowing others to try it out.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I don\u2019t want to make this thing public to everyone &#8211; but I do want people to be able to find it and give controlled access to it to test it out. But HOW does this work?<\/p>\r\n<p>The way that Facebook Messenger bots use apps and pages and which users are allowed to use which things when you\u2019re in test\/development mode is REALLY confusing. But I think I\u2019ve figured it out.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The component parts<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2018m building SchoolBot with BotMan &#8211; a Laravel-based chatbot framework. This forms the ultimate back-end for the bot.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At the \u201cfront end\u201d of this system is a page that you message through Facebook Messenger.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And a Facebook App connects the page to the BotMan back-end, passing messages between the two.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Private, published, dev, live and all the roles!<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The two Facebook components &#8211; the app and the page &#8211; both have a status. The page can be Published or Unpublished. The app can be in development mode, or live mode.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Development Apps vs Live Apps<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Development apps are only usable by those users that have been added with an app role.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To allow anyone to use your app you need to make the app live. To get your app live can be quite tricky as you may need to submit it for review, and this requires all sorts of things like privacy policies and maybe organisational verification. (This is a GOOD thing! It prevents random apps stealing all your data!!)<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So if you want to just do some testing before you apply for review, or if you\u2019re waiting to go through the review process you\u2019ll be stuck in development mode.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Published vs Unpublished pages<\/h3>\r\n<p>Unpublished pages won&#8217;t be found in search and can only be seen by and interacted with by those users that have been added with a page role.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Page roles<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A published page can be searched for and discovered by anyone. But an unpublished page can only be seen and used by people who have a Page Role.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Page Roles are a bit annoying because there isn\u2019t a role that lets someone just see and use an unpublished page. The lowest level is \u201cAnalyst\u201d which \u201cCan see which admin created a post or comment and view Insights.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">App Roles<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>App Roles are better because you can actually give people a \u201cTester\u201d role. BUT&#8230;App Roles are annoying for test users because they have to use the developer.facebook.com developer portal to accept their role and the whole thing is a bit scary if they\u2019ve not seen it before.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Putting it together<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So I have my Page which talks to my BotMan through my App. I\u2019ve connected them all together (this is a whole other post worth of stuff) and now I\u2019m wanting to bring in some people to test it the Messenger bot. What do we have to do?:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Page can be published or unpublished. Just bear in mind that it\u2019s harder for people to find if it\u2019s unpublished &#8211; you\u2019ll probably have to send them a link.<\/li>\r\n<li>IF the Page is unpublished then the test users will need to be added with a Page Role, the lowest of which is \u201cAnalyst\u201d. And then you\u2019ll have to send them the link to the page too because it won&#8217;t be found in search.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>They should then be able to Message the page once you set up a \u201cSend Message\u201d button on the page. But their message won\u2019t get to the Bot because they aren\u2019t allowed to use the app part that relays the message. So&#8230;<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You need to go to the developer portal and add them as a &#8220;Tester&#8221;. This will send them an invite but they&#8217;ll need to log in to the developer portal themselves to accept it.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>Done!<\/h2>\r\n<p>With that all done, the person should be able to send a message to the page, have it relayed to the bot by the app, and the have the responses relayed back too.<\/p>\r\n<p>It&#8217;s not massively easy, and it&#8217;s definitely not clear. But you CAN have test users for your Messenger bot in this way.<\/p>\r\n<p>YAY!<\/p>\r\n",

        "content": "\r\n<p><em>It&#8217;s not massively easy, and it&#8217;s definitely not clear. But you CAN have test users for your Messenger bot. Here&#8217;s how!<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that I have built my own personal Messenger \u201cbot\u201d for school information called SchoolBot.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But at some point I\u2019d love for it to be more public, to get people to test it, to get some feedback from more normal people than I to see if it\u2019s really, actually useful, or just a toy for me to play with.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So I created a test instance for \u201cSpringfield Elementary\u201d with the aim of allowing others to try it out.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I don\u2019t want to make this thing public to everyone &#8211; but I do want people to be able to find it and give controlled access to it to test it out. But HOW does this work?<\/p>\r\n<p>The way that Facebook Messenger bots use apps and pages and which users are allowed to use which things when you\u2019re in test\/development mode is REALLY confusing. But I think I\u2019ve figured it out.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The component parts<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2018m building SchoolBot with BotMan &#8211; a Laravel-based chatbot framework. This forms the ultimate back-end for the bot.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At the \u201cfront end\u201d of this system is a page that you message through Facebook Messenger.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And a Facebook App connects the page to the BotMan back-end, passing messages between the two.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Private, published, dev, live and all the roles!<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The two Facebook components &#8211; the app and the page &#8211; both have a status. The page can be Published or Unpublished. The app can be in development mode, or live mode.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Development Apps vs Live Apps<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Development apps are only usable by those users that have been added with an app role.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To allow anyone to use your app you need to make the app live. To get your app live can be quite tricky as you may need to submit it for review, and this requires all sorts of things like privacy policies and maybe organisational verification. (This is a GOOD thing! It prevents random apps stealing all your data!!)<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So if you want to just do some testing before you apply for review, or if you\u2019re waiting to go through the review process you\u2019ll be stuck in development mode.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Published vs Unpublished pages<\/h3>\r\n<p>Unpublished pages won&#8217;t be found in search and can only be seen by and interacted with by those users that have been added with a page role.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Page roles<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A published page can be searched for and discovered by anyone. But an unpublished page can only be seen and used by people who have a Page Role.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Page Roles are a bit annoying because there isn\u2019t a role that lets someone just see and use an unpublished page. The lowest level is \u201cAnalyst\u201d which \u201cCan see which admin created a post or comment and view Insights.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">App Roles<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>App Roles are better because you can actually give people a \u201cTester\u201d role. BUT&#8230;App Roles are annoying for test users because they have to use the developer.facebook.com developer portal to accept their role and the whole thing is a bit scary if they\u2019ve not seen it before.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Putting it together<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So I have my Page which talks to my BotMan through my App. I\u2019ve connected them all together (this is a whole other post worth of stuff) and now I\u2019m wanting to bring in some people to test it the Messenger bot. What do we have to do?:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Page can be published or unpublished. Just bear in mind that it\u2019s harder for people to find if it\u2019s unpublished &#8211; you\u2019ll probably have to send them a link.<\/li>\r\n<li>IF the Page is unpublished then the test users will need to be added with a Page Role, the lowest of which is \u201cAnalyst\u201d. And then you\u2019ll have to send them the link to the page too because it won&#8217;t be found in search.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>They should then be able to Message the page once you set up a \u201cSend Message\u201d button on the page. But their message won\u2019t get to the Bot because they aren\u2019t allowed to use the app part that relays the message. So&#8230;<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You need to go to the developer portal and add them as a &#8220;Tester&#8221;. This will send them an invite but they&#8217;ll need to log in to the developer portal themselves to accept it.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>Done!<\/h2>\r\n<p>With that all done, the person should be able to send a message to the page, have it relayed to the bot by the app, and the have the responses relayed back too.<\/p>\r\n<p>It&#8217;s not massively easy, and it&#8217;s definitely not clear. But you CAN have test users for your Messenger bot in this way.<\/p>\r\n<p>YAY!<\/p>\r\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p><em>I&#8217;m sure you all know that the rules about how websites use cookies have changed a bit over the last few years. This post explains my current setup for cookie consents and analytics on WordPress sites.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Update: This post is still worth reading to work through the issue, but there is now <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/gdpr-cookie-compliance\/\">a free plugin that seems to do everything<\/a> all in one without any additional hand-coding required. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Firstly: Do you need analytics?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I start explaining HOW I set up cookie consent for analytics, it&#8217;s worth asking yourself: &#8220;Do I need analytics?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of my clients run small websites and feel like they should have analytics, but can&#8217;t often articulate why, and using a big analytics provider like Google Analytics or WordPress&#8217;s Jetpack Stats could mean that your users are being unnecessarily tracked and that personally identifiable data could be being shipped outside the EU.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analytics may or may not be private\/anonymous enough to avoid GDPR (this seems debatable still) but the starting point should be that you don&#8217;t have them installed, and only add them when you have a clear plan for using them and an up to date privacy policy that you understand and actually implement. Remember that a policy should reflect what you do rather than being a document of what you aspire to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do you need Google Analytics?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people default to wanting Google Analytics as it&#8217;s the tool that they&#8217;ve heard of and used before. But as well as thinking about Google&#8217;s tracking and privacy, it&#8217;s worth considering that Google Analytics is a HUGE piece of software that does enormous amounts of things that you probably don&#8217;t need or even understand, and it&#8217;s very complicated as a result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last few years a number of other, simpler, privacy-focussed analytics tools have sprung up, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/usefathom.com\/\">Fathom<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/simpleanalytics.com\/\">Simple Analytics<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ticksel.com\/\">Ticksel<\/a>. Some of these don&#8217;t use cookies at all, or have cookie-free options. They cost, but if both your analytics and your users are important to you then maybe it&#8217;s worth a small amount each month to get a good service?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">OK, you want Google Analytics. What next?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;ve decided you&#8217;re happy with Google Analytics (I&#8217;ll call it GA from here on), and &#8211; here&#8217;s a little checklist before you get started:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You have good reason to want to collect this data about people visiting your website and will regularly make use of the information in constructive ways.<\/li><li>You don&#8217;t mind the complexity and possible user tracking issues.<\/li><li>You&#8217;re happy with the <a href=\"https:\/\/marketingplatform.google.com\/about\/analytics\/terms\/gb\/\">terms of service<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/privacy.google.com\/businesses\/processorterms\/\">data processing terms<\/a>.<\/li><li>You have a privacy policy that explains what data you collect, why you collect it and what you do with it, including passing it to Google.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you need to be aware that GA uses cookies and that these are &#8220;non-essential&#8221; cookies and that <a href=\"https:\/\/ico.org.uk\/for-organisations\/guide-to-pecr\/guidance-on-the-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies\/\">the rules<\/a> now state that you must get consent from users before you use the cookies. Consent can not be assumed!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(This is my interpretation. I am not a lawyer. This is not legal advice. I can not be held responsible for anything that happens as a result of you taking action based on this article. Seek your own legal advice should you need it.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK. Now we&#8217;re good. So how do I set up cookie consent and analytics on my WordPress website?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choosing a plugin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a developer with time on your hands you could probably build your own thing, but I went and tried some of the popular cookie consent plugins to see if any did what I wanted. My needs were:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Can be configured to load scripts only once consent is given<\/li><li>Reloads page after consent is given, preserving the referrer<\/li><li>Is clear about the difference between necessary and non-necessary cookies<\/li><li>Can be styled and have texts, buttons and links changed<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I confess that I stopped looking when I found one that fulfilled my criteria. That plugin is <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/cookie-law-info\/\">GDPR Cookie Consent<\/a> by Webtoffee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Configuring the plugin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the steps that I take to configure the plugin &#8211; you should determine your own set of options but here&#8217;s mine:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Go to GDPR Cookie Consent in the WordPress Dashboard.<\/li><li>Work through the General -&gt; Cookie Bar options, changing any that you want.<\/li><li>Turn the Show Again Tab off in General -&gt; Show Again Tab &#8211; I&#8217;ve decided that I don&#8217;t need this and it&#8217;s intrusive.<\/li><li>In General -&gt; Other I set &#8220;Reload after accept button click&#8221; to &#8220;Yes&#8221; to allow the page to reload after cookies are accepted. I&#8217;ve checked that the referrer header is preserved. <\/li><li>In &#8220;Customise Cookie Bar&#8221; I tailor the message &#8211; specifically I make this refer to the privacy policy and include a <code>[cookie_link]<\/code> shortcode. I also REMOVE the <code>[cookie_settings]<\/code> link because I don&#8217;t depend on these for enabling the non-necessary cookies. More on this later.<\/li><li>I tailor the colours in Customise Cookie Bar, and each of the sub-panels of &#8220;Customise buttons&#8221;<\/li><li>On Customise Buttons -&gt; Read More Link I also set the URL or Page to be the Privacy Policy page<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it for settings. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I skip the Cookie List and Policy Generator in the GDRP Cookie Consent plugins, assuming that the privacy policy has already been written, but you may want to pay these features some attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you need to actually add the Google Analytics code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally I thought I&#8217;d do this in the &#8220;Non-necessary cookie&#8221; setting bit in the plugin BUT I thought that the &#8220;Accept&#8221; button would turn on all Non-necessary cookies, but it doesn&#8217;t! To turn on non-necessary cookies a website visitor needs to use the cookie settings option, and change a toggle. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this bit didn&#8217;t work:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><s>Because we want this to only load when cookies are accepted, I add this in the Non-necessary cookie settings of the plugin.<\/s><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><s>Set &#8220;Enable Non-necessary cookie&#8221; to &#8220;Yes&#8221; if it&#8217;s not already.<\/s><\/li><li><s>Set &#8220;Default state&#8221; to &#8220;Disabled&#8221;<\/s><\/li><li><s>I leave the default description. But you should review it and confirm it&#8217;s OK.<\/s><\/li><li><s>You can then choose to add your script tag to the header or footer.<\/s><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><s>You&#8217;ll need to visit Google Analytics to get your script code. And Google ask for it to be the first thing in the header, but that&#8217;s probably unrealistic here. Add it, <code>&lt;script&gt;<\/code> tags and all to the &#8220;HEAD&#8221; section.<\/s><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My next thought was to add a code snippet to my theme&#8217;s <code>functions.php<\/code> that detected the &#8220;Accepted&#8221; cookie and loaded the analytics in the header. The code looked like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n\/**\n * Include Google Analytics in the head only if the viewed_cookie_policy cookies is set\n * This cookie is set by the GDPR Cookie Consent plugin once cookies are accepted\n *\/\nadd_action('wp_head', 'mytheme_google_analytics');\nfunction mytheme_google_analytics() {\n\tif (isset($_COOKIE&#x5B;'viewed_cookie_policy'])) {\n\t\t?&gt;\n\t\t&lt;!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics --&gt;\n\t\t&lt;script async src=&quot;https:\/\/www.googletagmanager.com\/gtag\/js?id=UA-XXXXXXXXX-1&quot;&gt;&lt;\/script&gt;\n\t\t&lt;script&gt;\n\t\t  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || &#x5B;];\n\t\t  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n\t\t  gtag('js', new Date());\n\n\t\t  gtag('config', 'UA-XXXXXXXXXX-1');\n\t\t&lt;\/script&gt;\n\t\t&lt;?php\n\t}\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>The problem with THIS code is that if you&#8217;re doing page caching it won&#8217;t work. You could try fragment caching but that&#8217;s pretty hard to set up on most hosting setups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my next and final step was to print the GA code from the theme, but just move the logic into the JavaScript. This needed a bit of wrangling to create the Tag Manager script tag but it wasn&#8217;t too hard. This is my final PHP code &#8211; be sure to replace both instances of UA-XXXXXXXXX-1 with your own GA property ID.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nadd_action('wp_head', 'mytheme_google_analytics');\nfunction mytheme_google_analytics() {\n\t?&gt;\n\t&lt;script&gt;\n\t\tif (document.cookie.indexOf(&quot;viewed_cookie_policy=&quot;) &gt;= 0) {\n\t\t\tvar analyticsScriptTag = document.createElement('script');\n\t\t\tanalyticsScriptTag.async=true;\n\t\t\tanalyticsScriptTag.src=&quot;https:\/\/www.googletagmanager.com\/gtag\/js?id=UA-XXXXXXXXX-1&quot;;\n\t\t\tdocument.head.prepend(analyticsScriptTag);\n\n\t\t\twindow.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || &#x5B;];\n\t\t\tfunction gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n\t  \t\tgtag('js', new Date());\n\t  \t\tgtag('config', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-1');\n\t  \t}\n\t&lt;\/script&gt;\n\t&lt;?php\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And yes, you could, and probably should, put this in a plugin to preserve the functionality across theme changes. I&#8217;ll work on a good way to do that sometime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s probably a good idea to clear any caches and CDNs you may have too just to make sure your changes get out there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AND, if you want to test this, make sure you use a private browsing window and turn off any tracking blockers you might have. I&#8217;m using Firefox and it&#8217;s blocking is pretty strong these days. Clicking &#8220;Accept&#8221; may reload the page and enable cookies, but it&#8217;s also possible you&#8217;re not sending page hits to GA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"885\" height=\"44\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screenshot-2019-11-15-at-13.08.39.png\" alt=\"Dev tools console showing Google Analytics being blocked.\" class=\"wp-image-8798\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screenshot-2019-11-15-at-13.08.39.png 885w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screenshot-2019-11-15-at-13.08.39-300x15.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screenshot-2019-11-15-at-13.08.39-768x38.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px\" \/><figcaption>Consult the dev tools console if it&#8217;s not working!

I know, there&#8217;s a lot to consider here, but I finish just by saying that all these new rules are a GOOD THING. Yes, the internet is still working out the best ways of adhering to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But protecting your website visitors from tracking, collecting only the information you will need and use about them, keeping their personal data private, and being transparent about what data you collect and how you use it are all positive steps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These things are sometimes annoying &#8211; and I hope I&#8217;ve chosen a solution here that isn&#8217;t too annoying &#8211; but they not only protect your website visitors as they browse the web, they protect YOU from it too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope this was helpful.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>I&#8217;m sure you all know that the rules about how websites use cookies have changed a bit over the last few years. This post explains my current setup for cookie consents and analytics on WordPress sites.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Update: This post is still worth reading to work through the issue, but there is now <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/gdpr-cookie-compliance\/\">a free plugin that seems to do everything<\/a> all in one without any additional hand-coding required. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Firstly: Do you need analytics?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I start explaining HOW I set up cookie consent for analytics, it&#8217;s worth asking yourself: &#8220;Do I need analytics?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of my clients run small websites and feel like they should have analytics, but can&#8217;t often articulate why, and using a big analytics provider like Google Analytics or WordPress&#8217;s Jetpack Stats could mean that your users are being unnecessarily tracked and that personally identifiable data could be being shipped outside the EU.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analytics may or may not be private\/anonymous enough to avoid GDPR (this seems debatable still) but the starting point should be that you don&#8217;t have them installed, and only add them when you have a clear plan for using them and an up to date privacy policy that you understand and actually implement. Remember that a policy should reflect what you do rather than being a document of what you aspire to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do you need Google Analytics?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people default to wanting Google Analytics as it&#8217;s the tool that they&#8217;ve heard of and used before. But as well as thinking about Google&#8217;s tracking and privacy, it&#8217;s worth considering that Google Analytics is a HUGE piece of software that does enormous amounts of things that you probably don&#8217;t need or even understand, and it&#8217;s very complicated as a result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last few years a number of other, simpler, privacy-focussed analytics tools have sprung up, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/usefathom.com\/\">Fathom<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/simpleanalytics.com\/\">Simple Analytics<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ticksel.com\/\">Ticksel<\/a>. Some of these don&#8217;t use cookies at all, or have cookie-free options. They cost, but if both your analytics and your users are important to you then maybe it&#8217;s worth a small amount each month to get a good service?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">OK, you want Google Analytics. What next?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;ve decided you&#8217;re happy with Google Analytics (I&#8217;ll call it GA from here on), and &#8211; here&#8217;s a little checklist before you get started:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You have good reason to want to collect this data about people visiting your website and will regularly make use of the information in constructive ways.<\/li><li>You don&#8217;t mind the complexity and possible user tracking issues.<\/li><li>You&#8217;re happy with the <a href=\"https:\/\/marketingplatform.google.com\/about\/analytics\/terms\/gb\/\">terms of service<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/privacy.google.com\/businesses\/processorterms\/\">data processing terms<\/a>.<\/li><li>You have a privacy policy that explains what data you collect, why you collect it and what you do with it, including passing it to Google.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you need to be aware that GA uses cookies and that these are &#8220;non-essential&#8221; cookies and that <a href=\"https:\/\/ico.org.uk\/for-organisations\/guide-to-pecr\/guidance-on-the-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies\/\">the rules<\/a> now state that you must get consent from users before you use the cookies. Consent can not be assumed!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(This is my interpretation. I am not a lawyer. This is not legal advice. I can not be held responsible for anything that happens as a result of you taking action based on this article. Seek your own legal advice should you need it.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK. Now we&#8217;re good. So how do I set up cookie consent and analytics on my WordPress website?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choosing a plugin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a developer with time on your hands you could probably build your own thing, but I went and tried some of the popular cookie consent plugins to see if any did what I wanted. My needs were:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Can be configured to load scripts only once consent is given<\/li><li>Reloads page after consent is given, preserving the referrer<\/li><li>Is clear about the difference between necessary and non-necessary cookies<\/li><li>Can be styled and have texts, buttons and links changed<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I confess that I stopped looking when I found one that fulfilled my criteria. That plugin is <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/cookie-law-info\/\">GDPR Cookie Consent<\/a> by Webtoffee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Configuring the plugin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the steps that I take to configure the plugin &#8211; you should determine your own set of options but here&#8217;s mine:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Go to GDPR Cookie Consent in the WordPress Dashboard.<\/li><li>Work through the General -&gt; Cookie Bar options, changing any that you want.<\/li><li>Turn the Show Again Tab off in General -&gt; Show Again Tab &#8211; I&#8217;ve decided that I don&#8217;t need this and it&#8217;s intrusive.<\/li><li>In General -&gt; Other I set &#8220;Reload after accept button click&#8221; to &#8220;Yes&#8221; to allow the page to reload after cookies are accepted. I&#8217;ve checked that the referrer header is preserved. <\/li><li>In &#8220;Customise Cookie Bar&#8221; I tailor the message &#8211; specifically I make this refer to the privacy policy and include a <code>[cookie_link]<\/code> shortcode. I also REMOVE the <code>[cookie_settings]<\/code> link because I don&#8217;t depend on these for enabling the non-necessary cookies. More on this later.<\/li><li>I tailor the colours in Customise Cookie Bar, and each of the sub-panels of &#8220;Customise buttons&#8221;<\/li><li>On Customise Buttons -&gt; Read More Link I also set the URL or Page to be the Privacy Policy page<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it for settings. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I skip the Cookie List and Policy Generator in the GDRP Cookie Consent plugins, assuming that the privacy policy has already been written, but you may want to pay these features some attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you need to actually add the Google Analytics code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally I thought I&#8217;d do this in the &#8220;Non-necessary cookie&#8221; setting bit in the plugin BUT I thought that the &#8220;Accept&#8221; button would turn on all Non-necessary cookies, but it doesn&#8217;t! To turn on non-necessary cookies a website visitor needs to use the cookie settings option, and change a toggle. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this bit didn&#8217;t work:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><s>Because we want this to only load when cookies are accepted, I add this in the Non-necessary cookie settings of the plugin.<\/s><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><s>Set &#8220;Enable Non-necessary cookie&#8221; to &#8220;Yes&#8221; if it&#8217;s not already.<\/s><\/li><li><s>Set &#8220;Default state&#8221; to &#8220;Disabled&#8221;<\/s><\/li><li><s>I leave the default description. But you should review it and confirm it&#8217;s OK.<\/s><\/li><li><s>You can then choose to add your script tag to the header or footer.<\/s><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><s>You&#8217;ll need to visit Google Analytics to get your script code. And Google ask for it to be the first thing in the header, but that&#8217;s probably unrealistic here. Add it, <code>&lt;script&gt;<\/code> tags and all to the &#8220;HEAD&#8221; section.<\/s><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My next thought was to add a code snippet to my theme&#8217;s <code>functions.php<\/code> that detected the &#8220;Accepted&#8221; cookie and loaded the analytics in the header. The code looked like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n\/**\n * Include Google Analytics in the head only if the viewed_cookie_policy cookies is set\n * This cookie is set by the GDPR Cookie Consent plugin once cookies are accepted\n *\/\nadd_action('wp_head', 'mytheme_google_analytics');\nfunction mytheme_google_analytics() {\n\tif (isset($_COOKIE&#x5B;'viewed_cookie_policy'])) {\n\t\t?&gt;\n\t\t&lt;!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics --&gt;\n\t\t&lt;script async src=&quot;https:\/\/www.googletagmanager.com\/gtag\/js?id=UA-XXXXXXXXX-1&quot;&gt;&lt;\/script&gt;\n\t\t&lt;script&gt;\n\t\t  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || &#x5B;];\n\t\t  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n\t\t  gtag('js', new Date());\n\n\t\t  gtag('config', 'UA-XXXXXXXXXX-1');\n\t\t&lt;\/script&gt;\n\t\t&lt;?php\n\t}\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>The problem with THIS code is that if you&#8217;re doing page caching it won&#8217;t work. You could try fragment caching but that&#8217;s pretty hard to set up on most hosting setups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my next and final step was to print the GA code from the theme, but just move the logic into the JavaScript. This needed a bit of wrangling to create the Tag Manager script tag but it wasn&#8217;t too hard. This is my final PHP code &#8211; be sure to replace both instances of UA-XXXXXXXXX-1 with your own GA property ID.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nadd_action('wp_head', 'mytheme_google_analytics');\nfunction mytheme_google_analytics() {\n\t?&gt;\n\t&lt;script&gt;\n\t\tif (document.cookie.indexOf(&quot;viewed_cookie_policy=&quot;) &gt;= 0) {\n\t\t\tvar analyticsScriptTag = document.createElement('script');\n\t\t\tanalyticsScriptTag.async=true;\n\t\t\tanalyticsScriptTag.src=&quot;https:\/\/www.googletagmanager.com\/gtag\/js?id=UA-XXXXXXXXX-1&quot;;\n\t\t\tdocument.head.prepend(analyticsScriptTag);\n\n\t\t\twindow.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || &#x5B;];\n\t\t\tfunction gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n\t  \t\tgtag('js', new Date());\n\t  \t\tgtag('config', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-1');\n\t  \t}\n\t&lt;\/script&gt;\n\t&lt;?php\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And yes, you could, and probably should, put this in a plugin to preserve the functionality across theme changes. I&#8217;ll work on a good way to do that sometime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s probably a good idea to clear any caches and CDNs you may have too just to make sure your changes get out there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AND, if you want to test this, make sure you use a private browsing window and turn off any tracking blockers you might have. I&#8217;m using Firefox and it&#8217;s blocking is pretty strong these days. Clicking &#8220;Accept&#8221; may reload the page and enable cookies, but it&#8217;s also possible you&#8217;re not sending page hits to GA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"885\" height=\"44\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screenshot-2019-11-15-at-13.08.39.png\" alt=\"Dev tools console showing Google Analytics being blocked.\" class=\"wp-image-8798\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screenshot-2019-11-15-at-13.08.39.png 885w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screenshot-2019-11-15-at-13.08.39-300x15.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screenshot-2019-11-15-at-13.08.39-768x38.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px\" \/><figcaption>Consult the dev tools console if it&#8217;s not working!

I know, there&#8217;s a lot to consider here, but I finish just by saying that all these new rules are a GOOD THING. Yes, the internet is still working out the best ways of adhering to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But protecting your website visitors from tracking, collecting only the information you will need and use about them, keeping their personal data private, and being transparent about what data you collect and how you use it are all positive steps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These things are sometimes annoying &#8211; and I hope I&#8217;ve chosen a solution here that isn&#8217;t too annoying &#8211; but they not only protect your website visitors as they browse the web, they protect YOU from it too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope this was helpful.<\/p>\n",

I was really going to get going with Press Ups again, but that\u2019s fallen by the wayside because of illness and having to prioritise paid work. But I also wonder how much of that me procrastinating because my brain thinks I\u2019ve already done it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Save you announcements for when you are DONE!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How much of my work is tied to my self worth?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/pca.st\/episode\/d29cbe2e-9f3b-4362-927d-0cc94d0d6b2f\">Episode 50 of Paul Jarvis and Kaleigh Moor\u2019s Creative Class podcast<\/a> was good too &#8211; they talked about mental health, and it was really valuable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think a lot of freelancers could learn from the paragraph:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>How much of my work is tied to my self worth? It\u2019s normal to want validation, but don\u2019t have yourself on it entirely.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What if there isn\u2019t a path?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same episode, Paul talked about being asked for long term goals and how sometimes &#8211; especially when he\u2019s struggling &#8211; he isn\u2019t focussed on the long term goals he\u2019s focussed on doing what he has to do today, in the moment. Sometimes he knows what he has to do in the present, right now, and the focus is on doing that and not worrying about the bigger goals and the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve had some difficult weeks of late, and this idea that \u201cdoing the stuff of today is enough\u201d has really helped me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know there are some bigger goals, and they are good, but they also seem unattainable at times. So sometimes, doing what I have to do today is enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve been ill. My kids have been ill and I\u2019ve had to look after them. It\u2019s been a month of not getting much done. But I\u2019ve had to accept that. I\u2019ve had to accept that I didn\u2019t walk much along The Path today, but what I did today was enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What have you learned?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m grateful for all the podcasts and videos and articles. There is a lot of good knowledge being passed around in the world. These things have helped me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder what has helped you lately? Leave your own wisdom learned in the comments.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I was on a beautiful walk in rural Devon the other week and I was listening to some podcasts and several things stood out to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Doing is better than telling!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Taylor Orwell &#8211; the creator of Laravel &#8211; is currently using his \u201cLaravel Snippet\u201d podcast to share lessons he\u2019s learned while developing software products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/pca.st\/episode\/1c9b4f48-e8bc-4ff0-9fe5-0a819bc24fb7\">Episode 17 on \u201cMotivation and Discipline\u201d<\/a> had a lot of good take-aways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The background to this is that I have several side products that could become paid products in one way or another, and I\u2019m constantly trying to push them forward and test the water to see which to run with the most.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Taylor said (paraphrased): \u201cDon\u2019t announce that you are going to do something &#8211; just do it!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apparently there is some research that shows that, to your brain, announcing something gives the same sense of completion as actually doing it, and so removes your motivation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve been really guilty of this with side projects of late. I was really going to get going with Press Ups again, but that\u2019s fallen by the wayside because of illness and having to prioritise paid work. But I also wonder how much of that me procrastinating because my brain thinks I\u2019ve already done it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Save you announcements for when you are DONE!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How much of my work is tied to my self worth?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/pca.st\/episode\/d29cbe2e-9f3b-4362-927d-0cc94d0d6b2f\">Episode 50 of Paul Jarvis and Kaleigh Moor\u2019s Creative Class podcast<\/a> was good too &#8211; they talked about mental health, and it was really valuable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think a lot of freelancers could learn from the paragraph:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>How much of my work is tied to my self worth? It\u2019s normal to want validation, but don\u2019t have yourself on it entirely.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What if there isn\u2019t a path?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same episode, Paul talked about being asked for long term goals and how sometimes &#8211; especially when he\u2019s struggling &#8211; he isn\u2019t focussed on the long term goals he\u2019s focussed on doing what he has to do today, in the moment. Sometimes he knows what he has to do in the present, right now, and the focus is on doing that and not worrying about the bigger goals and the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve had some difficult weeks of late, and this idea that \u201cdoing the stuff of today is enough\u201d has really helped me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know there are some bigger goals, and they are good, but they also seem unattainable at times. So sometimes, doing what I have to do today is enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve been ill. My kids have been ill and I\u2019ve had to look after them. It\u2019s been a month of not getting much done. But I\u2019ve had to accept that. I\u2019ve had to accept that I didn\u2019t walk much along The Path today, but what I did today was enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What have you learned?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m grateful for all the podcasts and videos and articles. There is a lot of good knowledge being passed around in the world. These things have helped me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder what has helped you lately? Leave your own wisdom learned in the comments.<\/p>\n",

These are definitely becoming fortnight-notes!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the second of two parts of a 4-week catchup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m still mostly working my charity microsite build &#8211; this has rumbled on a bit as some changes to the design I was given have come up as content has been added and people try out the site in a real interactive web browser. It&#8217;s all good!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also been working on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A Laravel project that got resurrected for some changes. I&#8217;ve been haggling to try and get some support time into the budget for this (seriously &#8211; if you build a web app or substantial website, it needs maintaining!) and going back to work on three-year-old tech turned out to be problematic. Less (CSS) wouldn&#8217;t compile because an old npm dependency didn&#8217;t exist any more so I had to update from the old Laravel Elixir to Laravel Mix and then Laravel wasn&#8217;t working on my updated local PHP7.2 environment, so I had to update Laravel&#8230;and so on. Anyway, it&#8217;s all up to date now and we&#8217;ve added the changes that the client wanted.<\/li><li>I had to add a new taxonomy and some filters to a WordPress site that I built and look after for a brilliant inter-generational arts charity.<\/li><li>I did a review of a BuddyPress\/bbPress site for a big national charity that I have worked for before &#8211; this may turn into a website re-development with huge simplifications!<\/li><li>Continued slow work with a small local charity here in Swindon on an arts project that they&#8217;ve been working on.<\/li><li>Helping a small charity work through some email issues they were having &#8211; initially it looked like they may have been hacked and I was quite concerned for them, but we dug around and I ended up having to to a lot of explaining technical stuff in layman&#8217;s language. But we got there in the end and everything was safe and well.<\/li><li>And I did some work and had a meeting about a brilliant but secret thing that I can&#8217;t announce here.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been one of those periods of work where lots of gnarly, tricky stuff has come in and, not wanting to blow my own trumpet too much but&#8230;, my experience and skills, attention to detail and downright annoying tenacity in fixing things &#8220;Properly&#8221; have meant I&#8217;ve had to get really stuck in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=8751&amp;action=edit\">CV tips from someone who\u2019s not applied for a job for many years<\/a>: I did a review of someone&#8217;s CV  a few weeks back. I&#8217;m NOT in HR and I&#8217;ve not been recruited or done  recruitment for a while, but I have opinions having done a fair bit before. At the time, I did a Twitter thread on it with my tips, but you prompted me to put the tips into a blog post. Maybe this is helpful for someone? Just don&#8217;t blame me if you don&#8217;t get a job!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This week I learned<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A few things!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Induction hobs and new cookers are actually awesome and at the very least way better than the 13-year-old gas-and-single-oven thing you had before that just broke. And also, you need 68.5 cm from the top of your hob to the thing above it! Who knew?! (Clearly not the people who installed the 13-year-old gas hob into this kitchen before we moved in!)<\/li><li> There&#8217;s this page that exists (and several others like it) that should let you manage your personalised ad preferences for 169 web-tracking and advertising companies. But the majority of them don&#8217;t seem to work. Including Facebook and Google. Deliberate?! <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/nYfm9HvCmt?amp=1\">http:\/\/youronlinechoices.com<\/a>  (From <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tumblr.com\/privacy\/en_eu\">Tumblr&#8217;s privacy policy<\/a>) <\/li><li>&#8220;The element returned by <code>querySelector<\/code> is not dynamically updated because a copy is made and returned, while that returned by <code>getElementByxx<\/code> is a reference so reflects the element when it is used&#8221; &#8211; A JavaScript thing I didn&#8217;t know I didn&#8217;t know from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JanelBrandon12\/status\/1188113048550162433?s=20\">Janel Brandon<\/a><\/li><li>I knew that <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.new\">docs.new<\/a> creates a new Google Doc and <a href=\"https:\/\/sheets.new\">sheets.new<\/a> creates a new Google Sheet, but now software developers can do more with <code>.new<\/code> domains, like <a href=\"https:\/\/github.new\/\">github.new<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/repo.new\/\">repo.new<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.new\">gist.new<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Toolbox<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I often come across discussions about time tracking. Years ago, before I was even freelance, I realised the need for decent time tracking and worked with Freckle (now called <a href=\"https:\/\/nokotime.com\/\">Noko<\/a>) and it was fine in its very limited free version.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years as a freelancer I&#8217;ve tried various options:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/toggl.com\/\">Toggl<\/a>, which has a great free plan and good apps<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/usethyme.com\/\">Thyme<\/a>, which is cool, indie and cheap, but quite limited<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freeagent.com\/\">FreeAgent<\/a>, the timer built into my accounting software, which seems like a good idea, but needs me to be permanently logged into my accounting software<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of these tools are just too limited for my use with multiple projects across multiple clients with different rates and types of billing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getharvest.com\/\">Harvest<\/a> though. It is the little fluffy nectar-collecting knees of the bees. Even though I don&#8217;t use it for invoicing these days, its reporting is brilliant and keeps me using it. I can slice and dice my time and money however I want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The apps for both MacOS and iOS are superb.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s fast and well built and a joy to use. Yes, it&#8217;s expensive, but it&#8217;s an essential tool for my business and I highly recommend it. BUT&#8230;if you need something simpler then it may be too much, so give Toggle a whirl as a decent alternative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time Machine<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a brilliant Tweet from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/chrisachard\">Chris Achard<\/a> the other day giving an overview of how DNS works:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Confused by DNS Records?

These are definitely becoming fortnight-notes!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the second of two parts of a 4-week catchup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m still mostly working my charity microsite build &#8211; this has rumbled on a bit as some changes to the design I was given have come up as content has been added and people try out the site in a real interactive web browser. It&#8217;s all good!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also been working on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A Laravel project that got resurrected for some changes. I&#8217;ve been haggling to try and get some support time into the budget for this (seriously &#8211; if you build a web app or substantial website, it needs maintaining!) and going back to work on three-year-old tech turned out to be problematic. Less (CSS) wouldn&#8217;t compile because an old npm dependency didn&#8217;t exist any more so I had to update from the old Laravel Elixir to Laravel Mix and then Laravel wasn&#8217;t working on my updated local PHP7.2 environment, so I had to update Laravel&#8230;and so on. Anyway, it&#8217;s all up to date now and we&#8217;ve added the changes that the client wanted.<\/li><li>I had to add a new taxonomy and some filters to a WordPress site that I built and look after for a brilliant inter-generational arts charity.<\/li><li>I did a review of a BuddyPress\/bbPress site for a big national charity that I have worked for before &#8211; this may turn into a website re-development with huge simplifications!<\/li><li>Continued slow work with a small local charity here in Swindon on an arts project that they&#8217;ve been working on.<\/li><li>Helping a small charity work through some email issues they were having &#8211; initially it looked like they may have been hacked and I was quite concerned for them, but we dug around and I ended up having to to a lot of explaining technical stuff in layman&#8217;s language. But we got there in the end and everything was safe and well.<\/li><li>And I did some work and had a meeting about a brilliant but secret thing that I can&#8217;t announce here.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been one of those periods of work where lots of gnarly, tricky stuff has come in and, not wanting to blow my own trumpet too much but&#8230;, my experience and skills, attention to detail and downright annoying tenacity in fixing things &#8220;Properly&#8221; have meant I&#8217;ve had to get really stuck in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=8751&amp;action=edit\">CV tips from someone who\u2019s not applied for a job for many years<\/a>: I did a review of someone&#8217;s CV  a few weeks back. I&#8217;m NOT in HR and I&#8217;ve not been recruited or done  recruitment for a while, but I have opinions having done a fair bit before. At the time, I did a Twitter thread on it with my tips, but you prompted me to put the tips into a blog post. Maybe this is helpful for someone? Just don&#8217;t blame me if you don&#8217;t get a job!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This week I learned<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A few things!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Induction hobs and new cookers are actually awesome and at the very least way better than the 13-year-old gas-and-single-oven thing you had before that just broke. And also, you need 68.5 cm from the top of your hob to the thing above it! Who knew?! (Clearly not the people who installed the 13-year-old gas hob into this kitchen before we moved in!)<\/li><li> There&#8217;s this page that exists (and several others like it) that should let you manage your personalised ad preferences for 169 web-tracking and advertising companies. But the majority of them don&#8217;t seem to work. Including Facebook and Google. Deliberate?! <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/nYfm9HvCmt?amp=1\">http:\/\/youronlinechoices.com<\/a>  (From <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tumblr.com\/privacy\/en_eu\">Tumblr&#8217;s privacy policy<\/a>) <\/li><li>&#8220;The element returned by <code>querySelector<\/code> is not dynamically updated because a copy is made and returned, while that returned by <code>getElementByxx<\/code> is a reference so reflects the element when it is used&#8221; &#8211; A JavaScript thing I didn&#8217;t know I didn&#8217;t know from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JanelBrandon12\/status\/1188113048550162433?s=20\">Janel Brandon<\/a><\/li><li>I knew that <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.new\">docs.new<\/a> creates a new Google Doc and <a href=\"https:\/\/sheets.new\">sheets.new<\/a> creates a new Google Sheet, but now software developers can do more with <code>.new<\/code> domains, like <a href=\"https:\/\/github.new\/\">github.new<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/repo.new\/\">repo.new<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.new\">gist.new<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Toolbox<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I often come across discussions about time tracking. Years ago, before I was even freelance, I realised the need for decent time tracking and worked with Freckle (now called <a href=\"https:\/\/nokotime.com\/\">Noko<\/a>) and it was fine in its very limited free version.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years as a freelancer I&#8217;ve tried various options:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/toggl.com\/\">Toggl<\/a>, which has a great free plan and good apps<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/usethyme.com\/\">Thyme<\/a>, which is cool, indie and cheap, but quite limited<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freeagent.com\/\">FreeAgent<\/a>, the timer built into my accounting software, which seems like a good idea, but needs me to be permanently logged into my accounting software<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of these tools are just too limited for my use with multiple projects across multiple clients with different rates and types of billing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getharvest.com\/\">Harvest<\/a> though. It is the little fluffy nectar-collecting knees of the bees. Even though I don&#8217;t use it for invoicing these days, its reporting is brilliant and keeps me using it. I can slice and dice my time and money however I want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The apps for both MacOS and iOS are superb.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s fast and well built and a joy to use. Yes, it&#8217;s expensive, but it&#8217;s an essential tool for my business and I highly recommend it. BUT&#8230;if you need something simpler then it may be too much, so give Toggle a whirl as a decent alternative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time Machine<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a brilliant Tweet from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/chrisachard\">Chris Achard<\/a> the other day giving an overview of how DNS works:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Confused by DNS Records? A, CNAME, ALIAS&#8230;<br><br>Me too ? <br><br>Let&#39;s change that! (cheatsheet at the end)<br><br>?

And so a while back I started making https:\/\/dns-explained.com. It&#8217;s not quite complete, there&#8217;s some paths through it that I want to add, plus a glossary, and I want to add some illustrations too. Maybe that will come one day. But for the time being it exists as my own primer on how DNS works!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pins: things I read and remembered<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I bookmarked these two weeks:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Brought to you with <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/pinboard.in\"><em>pinboard.in<\/em><\/a><em> and my <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/sync-pinboard\/\"><em>Sync Pinboard<\/em><\/a><em> plugin)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-sync-pinboard-pins\"><ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/coadec.com\/news\/no-deal-a-guide-for-startups\/\">No Deal: A Guide for Startups | Coadec<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>What it says on the tin &#8211; a No-deal Brexit guide for startups.

                "rendered": "\n<p>Someone recently asked me for CV advice. When this happens I usually get passed a dull, monotonous document.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;ve not had to be recruited or do recruitment for years. So I may not have valid advice, but here&#8217;s a couple of simple things that I think most people can to do make their CV better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use structure<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Headings, font sizes, and formatting for emphasis can all break up a monotonous document. Use a bigger text size for the important stuff to catch people&#8217;s attention. But don&#8217;t go overboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use bullet points and even columns to give it some structure and group information together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe even add a photo or other image, or just inject some colour?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don&#8217;t be passive.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Claim what you&#8217;ve done!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not: &#8220;Contributed to&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;Developed&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;Worked with&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But: &#8220;*I* contributed to&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;*I* developed&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;*I* worked with&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a simple change, but it brings the document alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use your skills to bring it alive.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re a designer? DESIGN IT! Add some custom illustration, or something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re a web developer? Make a web version of it (have a print version too &#8211; HR may need it!) Add JS sprinkles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re a professional crafter? Send your CV in cross-stitch! (OK, maybe not, but you get the idea).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get creative! BUT&#8230; not TOO creative. You want to stand out, but this remains a professional summary of your work. There&#8217;s a balance to be found.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An example: My CV<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I say, my CV is ancient. But I tried to make it personal, stand out, easy to read, and not just a monotonous list of things I have done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m NOT looking for a job, but see what you think: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/Y8vTKTll9E?amp=1\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/cv\/cv.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CV Tools &#8211; they may help<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that there are a ton of templates that you can download and make use of that are better than just creating your own from scratch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are also, nowadays, online services that help you write a nice-looking CV, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/enhancv.com\/\">Enhancv<\/a>. These cost though, so if you can afford it, go for your life. Otherwise, perhaps they will serve as inspiration for your own &#8220;design&#8221;.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Someone recently asked me for CV advice. When this happens I usually get passed a dull, monotonous document.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;ve not had to be recruited or do recruitment for years. So I may not have valid advice, but here&#8217;s a couple of simple things that I think most people can to do make their CV better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use structure<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Headings, font sizes, and formatting for emphasis can all break up a monotonous document. Use a bigger text size for the important stuff to catch people&#8217;s attention. But don&#8217;t go overboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use bullet points and even columns to give it some structure and group information together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe even add a photo or other image, or just inject some colour?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don&#8217;t be passive.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Claim what you&#8217;ve done!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not: &#8220;Contributed to&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;Developed&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;Worked with&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But: &#8220;*I* contributed to&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;*I* developed&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;*I* worked with&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a simple change, but it brings the document alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use your skills to bring it alive.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re a designer? DESIGN IT! Add some custom illustration, or something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re a web developer? Make a web version of it (have a print version too &#8211; HR may need it!) Add JS sprinkles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re a professional crafter? Send your CV in cross-stitch! (OK, maybe not, but you get the idea).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get creative! BUT&#8230; not TOO creative. You want to stand out, but this remains a professional summary of your work. There&#8217;s a balance to be found.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An example: My CV<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I say, my CV is ancient. But I tried to make it personal, stand out, easy to read, and not just a monotonous list of things I have done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m NOT looking for a job, but see what you think: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/Y8vTKTll9E?amp=1\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/cv\/cv.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CV Tools &#8211; they may help<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that there are a ton of templates that you can download and make use of that are better than just creating your own from scratch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are also, nowadays, online services that help you write a nice-looking CV, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/enhancv.com\/\">Enhancv<\/a>. These cost though, so if you can afford it, go for your life. Otherwise, perhaps they will serve as inspiration for your own &#8220;design&#8221;.<\/p>\n",

Sometimes, life just gets in the way of creativity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s the first of two parts of a 4-week catchup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m still working my charity microsite build. I&#8217;ve also been working on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>continued modifications to a website that I look after for a national charity<\/li><li>final tweaks to a small database and data-importer that was being built into a WordPress site that I look after<\/li><li>more dealing with a client site that got a proper, targetted DDoS attack. The clean-up and fall-out from that has taken a while as we have restored the hosting setup and ensured the site is protected in future.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also been thinking a LOT about future work, if and how to turn side-projects into products, and how to shape my business in the year to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/10\/tech-note-checking-the-integrity-of-npm-modules\/\">Tech Note: Checking the integrity of npm modules<\/a>: This was a little something I discovered while reviewing an automatic security patch on a GitHub project. Worth jotting down for future reference.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This week I learned<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.2 has a feature that emails the admin email address of a site when a PHP error occurs. I&#8217;m often invited to help people change or mend broken websites, and when I&#8217;m doing work of this sort, it&#8217;s useful to see the error messages that get sent. But changing the admin email address is tricky because you have to confirm it when it changes, and this would be additional and unwanted work for the client I&#8217;m working for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this week I learned that you can change the email address without modifying the site admin address. <a href=\"https:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/core\/2019\/04\/16\/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2\/#comment-35780\">A comment on the post announcing the feature<\/a> tells you how.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Toolbox<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve just finished my accounts and so I thought I&#8217;d mention that I use FreeAgent for my accounting. It&#8217;s super software &#8211; fast, responsive, feature packed. It does bookkeeping, accounts preparation, tax returns, invoicing, time-tracking, payroll, P60&#8217;s and a whole load of other things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s fairly expensive, but worth it. And I get it free anyway through a NatWest business bank account &#8211; it was worth the pain of doing the bank account switch just to save the money on the FreeAgent account!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t use all the features. But the at-a-glance overview of how my business is money-wise is really incredibly helpful. Worth checking out of you run your own business and want a decent way to manage the finances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time Machine<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a thing online recently where someone had discovered a bash\/terminal\/command line shortcut for moving the cursor to the start or end of the line. Things like this often fall into the category of &#8220;things you don&#8217;t know you don&#8217;t know&#8221;. So here&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/12\/command-line-shortcuts-a-cheatsheet\/\">a super collection of Tweets that I collated a while back<\/a> from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/climagic\">@climagic<\/a> with some super-helpful command-line shortcuts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pins: things I read and remembered<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I bookmarked these two weeks:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Brought to you with <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/pinboard.in\"><em>pinboard.in<\/em><\/a><em> and my <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/sync-pinboard\/\"><em>Sync Pinboard<\/em><\/a><em> plugin)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-sync-pinboard-pins\"><ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freecodecamp.org\/news\/the-react-handbook-b71c27b0a795\/\">The React Handbook<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>Free Learn React eBook &#8211; claims to teach you 80% of what you need to know in 20% of the time.<\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2019\/oct\/13\/the-link-between-stress-and-depression-and-the-10-simple-words-that-could-help?CMP=share_btn_tw\">The link between stress and depression \u2026 and the 10 simple words that could help | Society | The Guardian<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>Excellent read with some science and practical tips on stress and depression<\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/wip.chat\/\">WIP<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>Interesting maker community with public goals\/tasks and accountability.<\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/otter.ai\/\">Otter Voice Meeting Notes &#8211; Otter.ai<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>Audio transcription app\/service for meeting notes &#8211; can&#8217;t think I would want a WHOLE meeting transcribed, but could be useful<\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/designcode.io\/\">Design+Code &#8211; Learn to design and code React and Swift apps<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>Code Courses I&#8217;ve not seen before<\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/minimalanalytics.com\/\">Minimal Google Analytics Snippet | Minimal Analytics<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>Minimal, simple, cookie-free, Google Analytics snippet.

        "content": "\n<p>I&#8217;m still way behind with weeknotes &#8211; partly I&#8217;m still dealing with the fallout of some big emergency hosting and support stuff that came in, but also I&#8217;ve been ill with a cold that went on for WEEKS, and both my kids had a sickness bug. Sometimes, life just gets in the way of creativity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s the first of two parts of a 4-week catchup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m still working my charity microsite build. I&#8217;ve also been working on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>continued modifications to a website that I look after for a national charity<\/li><li>final tweaks to a small database and data-importer that was being built into a WordPress site that I look after<\/li><li>more dealing with a client site that got a proper, targetted DDoS attack. The clean-up and fall-out from that has taken a while as we have restored the hosting setup and ensured the site is protected in future.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also been thinking a LOT about future work, if and how to turn side-projects into products, and how to shape my business in the year to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/10\/tech-note-checking-the-integrity-of-npm-modules\/\">Tech Note: Checking the integrity of npm modules<\/a>: This was a little something I discovered while reviewing an automatic security patch on a GitHub project. Worth jotting down for future reference.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This week I learned<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.2 has a feature that emails the admin email address of a site when a PHP error occurs. I&#8217;m often invited to help people change or mend broken websites, and when I&#8217;m doing work of this sort, it&#8217;s useful to see the error messages that get sent. But changing the admin email address is tricky because you have to confirm it when it changes, and this would be additional and unwanted work for the client I&#8217;m working for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this week I learned that you can change the email address without modifying the site admin address. <a href=\"https:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/core\/2019\/04\/16\/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2\/#comment-35780\">A comment on the post announcing the feature<\/a> tells you how.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Toolbox<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve just finished my accounts and so I thought I&#8217;d mention that I use FreeAgent for my accounting. It&#8217;s super software &#8211; fast, responsive, feature packed. It does bookkeeping, accounts preparation, tax returns, invoicing, time-tracking, payroll, P60&#8217;s and a whole load of other things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s fairly expensive, but worth it. And I get it free anyway through a NatWest business bank account &#8211; it was worth the pain of doing the bank account switch just to save the money on the FreeAgent account!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t use all the features. But the at-a-glance overview of how my business is money-wise is really incredibly helpful. Worth checking out of you run your own business and want a decent way to manage the finances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time Machine<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a thing online recently where someone had discovered a bash\/terminal\/command line shortcut for moving the cursor to the start or end of the line. Things like this often fall into the category of &#8220;things you don&#8217;t know you don&#8217;t know&#8221;. So here&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/12\/command-line-shortcuts-a-cheatsheet\/\">a super collection of Tweets that I collated a while back<\/a> from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/climagic\">@climagic<\/a> with some super-helpful command-line shortcuts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pins: things I read and remembered<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I bookmarked these two weeks:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Brought to you with <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/pinboard.in\"><em>pinboard.in<\/em><\/a><em> and my <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/sync-pinboard\/\"><em>Sync Pinboard<\/em><\/a><em> plugin)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-sync-pinboard-pins\"><ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freecodecamp.org\/news\/the-react-handbook-b71c27b0a795\/\">The React Handbook<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>Free Learn React eBook &#8211; claims to teach you 80% of what you need to know in 20% of the time.<\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2019\/oct\/13\/the-link-between-stress-and-depression-and-the-10-simple-words-that-could-help?CMP=share_btn_tw\">The link between stress and depression \u2026 and the 10 simple words that could help | Society | The Guardian<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>Excellent read with some science and practical tips on stress and depression<\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/wip.chat\/\">WIP<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>Interesting maker community with public goals\/tasks and accountability.<\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/otter.ai\/\">Otter Voice Meeting Notes &#8211; Otter.ai<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>Audio transcription app\/service for meeting notes &#8211; can&#8217;t think I would want a WHOLE meeting transcribed, but could be useful<\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/designcode.io\/\">Design+Code &#8211; Learn to design and code React and Swift apps<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>Code Courses I&#8217;ve not seen before<\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/minimalanalytics.com\/\">Minimal Google Analytics Snippet | Minimal Analytics<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>Minimal, simple, cookie-free, Google Analytics snippet.

It told me that there was an automatically-generated pull request waiting for me on a project I&#8217;ve not touched in a while that fixed a critical security vulnerability in a dependency &#8211; in this case the very popular &#8220;lodash&#8221; library.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"691\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot_2019-10-21_at_20_21_52-1024x691.jpg\" alt=\"Screengrab of email from Github\" class=\"wp-image-8716\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot_2019-10-21_at_20_21_52-1024x691.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot_2019-10-21_at_20_21_52-300x203.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot_2019-10-21_at_20_21_52-768x518.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot_2019-10-21_at_20_21_52.jpg 1754w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is pretty neat! Thanks dependabot! (You can read more about automatic security updating in GitHub <a href=\"https:\/\/help.github.com\/en\/github\/managing-security-vulnerabilities\/configuring-automated-security-fixes\">here<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I trust nothing, especially computers. So I went looking at the pull request to see what it had done. Here&#8217;s the update to my <code>package.lock<\/code> file:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"540\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot-2019-10-21-at-20.25.45-1024x540.png\" alt=\"Screen grab of diff to package.lock file\" class=\"wp-image-8717\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot-2019-10-21-at-20.25.45-1024x540.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot-2019-10-21-at-20.25.45-300x158.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot-2019-10-21-at-20.25.45-768x405.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Just a simple minor version number bump and updated hash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, the hash is a special code that&#8217;s generated from all the files in the package. This code is always the same for the same set of files, and so I can test if the files I have are the same as the files that npm says I should have by generating the hash from my files and comparing it against the specified hash value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If, for some reason, the hash of my files is different then I have different files and something might have been hacked and I should be very wary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2015\/07\/highly-sensitive\/\">highly sensitive<\/a> perfectionist in me wanted to know that dependabot had given me the right hash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding the npm package&#8217;s hash<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.npmjs.com\/verifying-the-pgp-signature-for-a-package-from-the-npm-public-registry\">This article<\/a> explains the process. But basically you go to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>https:\/\/registry.npmjs.org\/[npm package name]<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives you back some JSON.  In Chrome I have an extension that pretty-prints JSON, but this is in Firefox which I think has JSON formatting built in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to follow the JSON path through:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>version<\/code><\/li><li>the version you want the hash for<\/li><li><code>dist<\/code><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you will see the <code>integrity<\/code> value. This is the hash!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"764\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot-2019-10-21-at-20.37.13-1024x764.png\" alt=\"Screen grab of npm registry JSON data with the relevant hash value highlighted\" class=\"wp-image-8718\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot-2019-10-21-at-20.37.13-1024x764.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot-2019-10-21-at-20.37.13-300x224.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot-2019-10-21-at-20.37.13-768x573.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot-2019-10-21-at-20.37.13.png 1786w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I can compare this value to the one in the pull request and be assured that, actually, I can trust the bot this time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But will I next time?!<\/p>\n",

It told me that there was an automatically-generated pull request waiting for me on a project I&#8217;ve not touched in a while that fixed a critical security vulnerability in a dependency &#8211; in this case the very popular &#8220;lodash&#8221; library.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"691\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot_2019-10-21_at_20_21_52-1024x691.jpg\" alt=\"Screengrab of email from Github\" class=\"wp-image-8716\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot_2019-10-21_at_20_21_52-1024x691.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot_2019-10-21_at_20_21_52-300x203.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot_2019-10-21_at_20_21_52-768x518.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot_2019-10-21_at_20_21_52.jpg 1754w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is pretty neat! Thanks dependabot! (You can read more about automatic security updating in GitHub <a href=\"https:\/\/help.github.com\/en\/github\/managing-security-vulnerabilities\/configuring-automated-security-fixes\">here<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I trust nothing, especially computers. So I went looking at the pull request to see what it had done. Here&#8217;s the update to my <code>package.lock<\/code> file:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"540\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot-2019-10-21-at-20.25.45-1024x540.png\" alt=\"Screen grab of diff to package.lock file\" class=\"wp-image-8717\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot-2019-10-21-at-20.25.45-1024x540.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot-2019-10-21-at-20.25.45-300x158.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot-2019-10-21-at-20.25.45-768x405.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Just a simple minor version number bump and updated hash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, the hash is a special code that&#8217;s generated from all the files in the package. This code is always the same for the same set of files, and so I can test if the files I have are the same as the files that npm says I should have by generating the hash from my files and comparing it against the specified hash value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If, for some reason, the hash of my files is different then I have different files and something might have been hacked and I should be very wary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2015\/07\/highly-sensitive\/\">highly sensitive<\/a> perfectionist in me wanted to know that dependabot had given me the right hash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding the npm package&#8217;s hash<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.npmjs.com\/verifying-the-pgp-signature-for-a-package-from-the-npm-public-registry\">This article<\/a> explains the process. But basically you go to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>https:\/\/registry.npmjs.org\/[npm package name]<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives you back some JSON.  In Chrome I have an extension that pretty-prints JSON, but this is in Firefox which I think has JSON formatting built in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to follow the JSON path through:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>version<\/code><\/li><li>the version you want the hash for<\/li><li><code>dist<\/code><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you will see the <code>integrity<\/code> value. This is the hash!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"764\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot-2019-10-21-at-20.37.13-1024x764.png\" alt=\"Screen grab of npm registry JSON data with the relevant hash value highlighted\" class=\"wp-image-8718\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot-2019-10-21-at-20.37.13-1024x764.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot-2019-10-21-at-20.37.13-300x224.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot-2019-10-21-at-20.37.13-768x573.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Screenshot-2019-10-21-at-20.37.13.png 1786w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I can compare this value to the one in the pull request and be assured that, actually, I can trust the bot this time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But will I next time?!<\/p>\n",

HUGE thanks to Elliott Richmond for putting this on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also took part in a productivity challenge last week in <a href=\"https:\/\/amandaappiagyei.com\/\">Amanda Appiagyei<\/a>&#8216;s Facebook community group. I see a lot of coaches marketing their wares and services and I&#8217;ve always liked Amanda&#8217;s unpretentious and genuinely helpful approach that seems to focus on YOU. She&#8217;s very generous with her time and experience too. Her productivity challenge was really helpful for me.

I was interviewed a while ago by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/keithdevon\">Keith Devon<\/a> for his <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/\">Pricing WP podcast<\/a>. We talked about pricing in the charity sector, my thoughts on his conversations with Jonathan Stark about value-based pricing and some general stuff about how my business work. Hopefully <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/episodes\/a-conversation-with-ross-wintle\">the interview<\/a> is interesting.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This week I learned<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The government are extending the clamp down on IR35 contracting rules. If you do contract or freelance work you probably need to be aware of this. Some links to follow to find out more:<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.personneltoday.com\/hr\/barclays-and-others-urge-contractors-to-go-paye\/\">https:\/\/www.personneltoday.com\/hr\/barclays-and-others-urge-contractors-to-go-paye\/<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/guidance\/check-employment-status-for-tax\">https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/guidance\/check-employment-status-for-tax<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.itcontracting.com\/ir35-small-company-exemption\/\">https:\/\/www.itcontracting.com\/ir35-small-company-exemption\/<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunch.co.uk\/knowledge\/tax\/what-to-do-if-hmrc-ask-for-proof-of-your-employment-ir35-status\/\">https:\/\/www.crunch.co.uk\/knowledge\/tax\/what-to-do-if-hmrc-ask-for-proof-of-your-employment-ir35-status\/<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Toolbox<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, native MySQL database tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use WordPress and PHP a lot it&#8217;s likely that at some point you&#8217;ve had to modify stuff in a database, and PHPMyAdmin is a tool that is really widely used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But setting up locally &#8211; or setting up your own install of it on a server &#8211; can be a bit of a pain. And I&#8217;ve always struggled to get to grips with the security of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for a while I&#8217;ve been using <a href=\"https:\/\/sequelpro.com\/\">SequelPro<\/a> as a desktop client for managing databases. After using PHPMyAdmin it took a bit of getting used to but I now much prefer using a native Mac app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it seems to have fallen by the wayside a bit. I was getting annoying errors from it and chatter in the dev communities I&#8217;m in is that is has kinda died a death (this may not be true, but it seems to be).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I looked into alternatives as and when found them. Initially <a href=\"https:\/\/tableplus.com\/\">Table Plus<\/a>, which was recommended by Laravel creator Taylor Otwell. Table Plus isn&#8217;t free, but isn&#8217;t expensive either. It connects to a range of different databases, not just MySQL\/MariaDB, which is great, but I found the interface clunky. Annoying tiny things, but enough to drive me mad with frequent use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then discovered <a href=\"https:\/\/www.araelium.com\/querious\">Querious<\/a>, which also isn&#8217;t free, but isn&#8217;t expensive either. It feels more like a souped-up modern version of SequelPro and the interface just felt much more solid to me. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve settled on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SequelPro is in the trashcan. I will miss typing &#8220;pancakes&#8221; into Alfred. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time Machine<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about my work and products and side projects and lately AND about school communications. So here&#8217;s a little write up of my SchoolBot chatbot\/school-CMS\/parent information system project. If you know of a tech-savvy, forward thinking school that might want to try this out do let me know or put me in touch.

I see a lot of coaches marketing their wares and services and I&#8217;ve always liked Amanda&#8217;s unpretentious and genuinely helpful approach that seems to focus on YOU.

If you need business skills, ideas or coaching look her up!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>No real posts this week, but <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/episodes\/a-conversation-with-ross-wintle\">I was on a podcast<\/a>! I was interviewed a while ago by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/keithdevon\">Keith Devon<\/a> for his <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/\">Pricing WP podcast<\/a>. We talked about pricing in the charity sector, my thoughts on his conversations with Jonathan Stark about value-based pricing and some general stuff about how my business work. Hopefully <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/episodes\/a-conversation-with-ross-wintle\">the interview<\/a> is interesting.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This week I learned<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The government are extending the clamp down on IR35 contracting rules. If you do contract or freelance work you probably need to be aware of this. Some links to follow to find out more:<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.personneltoday.com\/hr\/barclays-and-others-urge-contractors-to-go-paye\/\">https:\/\/www.personneltoday.com\/hr\/barclays-and-others-urge-contractors-to-go-paye\/<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/guidance\/check-employment-status-for-tax\">https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/guidance\/check-employment-status-for-tax<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.itcontracting.com\/ir35-small-company-exemption\/\">https:\/\/www.itcontracting.com\/ir35-small-company-exemption\/<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunch.co.uk\/knowledge\/tax\/what-to-do-if-hmrc-ask-for-proof-of-your-employment-ir35-status\/\">https:\/\/www.crunch.co.uk\/knowledge\/tax\/what-to-do-if-hmrc-ask-for-proof-of-your-employment-ir35-status\/<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Toolbox<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, native MySQL database tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use WordPress and PHP a lot it&#8217;s likely that at some point you&#8217;ve had to modify stuff in a database, and PHPMyAdmin is a tool that is really widely used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But setting up locally &#8211; or setting up your own install of it on a server &#8211; can be a bit of a pain. And I&#8217;ve always struggled to get to grips with the security of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for a while I&#8217;ve been using <a href=\"https:\/\/sequelpro.com\/\">SequelPro<\/a> as a desktop client for managing databases. After using PHPMyAdmin it took a bit of getting used to but I now much prefer using a native Mac app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it seems to have fallen by the wayside a bit. I was getting annoying errors from it and chatter in the dev communities I&#8217;m in is that is has kinda died a death (this may not be true, but it seems to be).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I looked into alternatives as and when found them. Initially <a href=\"https:\/\/tableplus.com\/\">Table Plus<\/a>, which was recommended by Laravel creator Taylor Otwell. Table Plus isn&#8217;t free, but isn&#8217;t expensive either. It connects to a range of different databases, not just MySQL\/MariaDB, which is great, but I found the interface clunky. Annoying tiny things, but enough to drive me mad with frequent use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then discovered <a href=\"https:\/\/www.araelium.com\/querious\">Querious<\/a>, which also isn&#8217;t free, but isn&#8217;t expensive either. It feels more like a souped-up modern version of SequelPro and the interface just felt much more solid to me. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve settled on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SequelPro is in the trashcan. I will miss typing &#8220;pancakes&#8221; into Alfred. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time Machine<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about my work and products and side projects and lately AND about school communications. So here&#8217;s a little write up of my SchoolBot chatbot\/school-CMS\/parent information system project. If you know of a tech-savvy, forward thinking school that might want to try this out do let me know or put me in touch.

I also did two hosting moves and worked on some updates to another client&#8217;s site. Not a hugely exciting week to be honest.

There&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/press_ups\/\">Twitter<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pressupswp\/\">Facebook<\/a> too. Deciding to revive what is essentially a video tutorial project when fighting off a heavy cold wasn&#8217;t my best idea ever.

An amazing audio and video editor that works by transcribing text and letting you edit that text &#8211; as you edit the text, it edits the video\/audio for you. I tried it out. It seems legit and has a free plan. Really incredible tech. Their intro video is AMAZING. (Note: I&#8217;m <strong>not<\/strong> an ambassador or on commission or anything)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Toolbox<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about <a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\">Bear Notes<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I write EVERYTHING down. I&#8217;m data-hoarder. And so I need a good note-taking app. One that lets me write quickly, sync to the cloud, organise and search my notes. I want:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Either cross-platform, or good ability to export should I need to. MacOS and iOS apps with cloud sync are a must.<\/li><li>Tagging &#8211; I prefer this to simple folders.<\/li><li>Search &#8211; fast with relevant results<\/li><li>Markdown editing &#8211; this is my fastest way to write, I want to stay on my keyboard and am willing to learn shortcuts or formatting tags to make this work.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, I do NOT care about:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Publishing or sharing notes. I&#8217;ll use other tools for this.<\/li><li>Fancy user interfaces and text formatting tools<\/li><li>Import from other tools or integration with other services<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For a long time I dabbled with Evernote and SimpleNote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evernote was always WAY to complicated and expensive. I couldn&#8217;t fathom the user interface which got in the way, and folders, tagging and search were somehow confusing. It should have been the bomb and I know some people put their whole lives in it, but it just didn&#8217;t work for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SimpleNote was great &#8211; it did tagging and search brilliantly, let me JUST WRITE NOTES, but its text formatting fell short. I don&#8217;t want too much, but SimpleNote had too little. I could write Markdown in it, but it didn&#8217;t help me to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, about three years ago, <a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\">Bear<\/a> launched. I think I got on board with the Beta, but then was more than happy to pay for a pro subscription. It&#8217;s AMAZING!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Native Markdown editing<\/li><li>Sync across Apple devices<\/li><li>Fast, decent search<\/li><li>Clever tagging and tag indexing<\/li><li>Brilliant apps<\/li><li>A clever formatting toolbar that helps you write Markdown<\/li><li>A whole host of other neat little touches<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The only real downside is that it only really works on Apple&#8217;s platform. There&#8217;s ongoing talk of a web-based version, which would be cool if it happened. I would miss it if I ever ditched my Mac and iPhone though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A super tool. Not for everyone. But perfect for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time Machine<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A while ago I wrote a post that did a critique of a fairly well-known &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Bob Martin post. It took me ages to write and publish it, partly because&#8230;well&#8230;who am I to critique someone as legendary as Uncle Bob? But I felt my background working in safety-critical software engineering game me an alternative view. And I was pretty pleased with how it turned out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-ross-wintle\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"efpDB1KYZC\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/not-all-software-development-processes-are-equal\/\">Not all software development processes are equal<\/a><\/blockquote><iframe title=\"&#8220;Not all software development processes are equal&#8221; &#8212; Ross Wintle\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/not-all-software-development-processes-are-equal\/embed\/#?secret=efpDB1KYZC\" data-secret=\"efpDB1KYZC\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pins: things I read and remembered<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I bookmarked this week:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Brought to you with <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/pinboard.in\"><em>pinboard.in<\/em><\/a><em> and my <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/sync-pinboard\/\"><em>Sync Pinboard<\/em><\/a><em> plugin)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-sync-pinboard-pins\"><ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/flowxo.com\/\">AI Online Chatbot Software, Live Chat on Websites &#8211; Flow XO<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span><\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rareloop.com\/posts\/is-your-online-payment-workflow-ready-for-sca\/\">s your online payment workflow ready for SCA?<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>Good article on SCA payment changes<\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/learnui.design\/blog\/4-rules-intuitive-ux.html\">4 Rules for Intuitive UX \u2013 Learn UI Design<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>A GREAT article with some fantastic tactical UI\/UX tips.

There&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/press_ups\/\">Twitter<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pressupswp\/\">Facebook<\/a> too. Deciding to revive what is essentially a video tutorial project when fighting off a heavy cold wasn&#8217;t my best idea ever. But we&#8217;ll see where it goes.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/im-back-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8676\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/im-back-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/im-back-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/im-back-768x768.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/im-back-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/im-back.png 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This week I learned<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.descript.com\/\">Descript<\/a> exists! An amazing audio and video editor that works by transcribing text and letting you edit that text &#8211; as you edit the text, it edits the video\/audio for you. I tried it out. It seems legit and has a free plan. Really incredible tech. Their intro video is AMAZING. (Note: I&#8217;m <strong>not<\/strong> an ambassador or on commission or anything)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Toolbox<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about <a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\">Bear Notes<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I write EVERYTHING down. I&#8217;m data-hoarder. And so I need a good note-taking app. One that lets me write quickly, sync to the cloud, organise and search my notes. I want:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Either cross-platform, or good ability to export should I need to. MacOS and iOS apps with cloud sync are a must.<\/li><li>Tagging &#8211; I prefer this to simple folders.<\/li><li>Search &#8211; fast with relevant results<\/li><li>Markdown editing &#8211; this is my fastest way to write, I want to stay on my keyboard and am willing to learn shortcuts or formatting tags to make this work.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, I do NOT care about:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Publishing or sharing notes. I&#8217;ll use other tools for this.<\/li><li>Fancy user interfaces and text formatting tools<\/li><li>Import from other tools or integration with other services<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For a long time I dabbled with Evernote and SimpleNote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evernote was always WAY to complicated and expensive. I couldn&#8217;t fathom the user interface which got in the way, and folders, tagging and search were somehow confusing. It should have been the bomb and I know some people put their whole lives in it, but it just didn&#8217;t work for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SimpleNote was great &#8211; it did tagging and search brilliantly, let me JUST WRITE NOTES, but its text formatting fell short. I don&#8217;t want too much, but SimpleNote had too little. I could write Markdown in it, but it didn&#8217;t help me to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, about three years ago, <a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\">Bear<\/a> launched. I think I got on board with the Beta, but then was more than happy to pay for a pro subscription. It&#8217;s AMAZING!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Native Markdown editing<\/li><li>Sync across Apple devices<\/li><li>Fast, decent search<\/li><li>Clever tagging and tag indexing<\/li><li>Brilliant apps<\/li><li>A clever formatting toolbar that helps you write Markdown<\/li><li>A whole host of other neat little touches<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The only real downside is that it only really works on Apple&#8217;s platform. There&#8217;s ongoing talk of a web-based version, which would be cool if it happened. I would miss it if I ever ditched my Mac and iPhone though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A super tool. Not for everyone. But perfect for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time Machine<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A while ago I wrote a post that did a critique of a fairly well-known &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Bob Martin post. It took me ages to write and publish it, partly because&#8230;well&#8230;who am I to critique someone as legendary as Uncle Bob? But I felt my background working in safety-critical software engineering game me an alternative view. And I was pretty pleased with how it turned out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-ross-wintle\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"efpDB1KYZC\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/not-all-software-development-processes-are-equal\/\">Not all software development processes are equal<\/a><\/blockquote><iframe title=\"&#8220;Not all software development processes are equal&#8221; &#8212; Ross Wintle\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/not-all-software-development-processes-are-equal\/embed\/#?secret=efpDB1KYZC\" data-secret=\"efpDB1KYZC\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pins: things I read and remembered<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I bookmarked this week:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Brought to you with <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/pinboard.in\"><em>pinboard.in<\/em><\/a><em> and my <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/sync-pinboard\/\"><em>Sync Pinboard<\/em><\/a><em> plugin)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-sync-pinboard-pins\"><ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/flowxo.com\/\">AI Online Chatbot Software, Live Chat on Websites &#8211; Flow XO<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span><\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rareloop.com\/posts\/is-your-online-payment-workflow-ready-for-sca\/\">s your online payment workflow ready for SCA?<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>Good article on SCA payment changes<\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/learnui.design\/blog\/4-rules-intuitive-ux.html\">4 Rules for Intuitive UX \u2013 Learn UI Design<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>A GREAT article with some fantastic tactical UI\/UX tips.

As one of the main components of SchoolBot is a chatbot, I&#8217;d wondered if I could build a chatbot to explain what SchoolBot does. An hour or so later and I had done just that. The conversation needs to be developed, but it works nicely: https:\/\/schoolbot.co.uk<\/li><li>Related: <strong>I did NOT get involved in school comms<\/strong>! There was NOT <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/giuliavmerlo\/status\/1171084332246716417\">a conversation on Twitter<\/a> about service design and user experience of school stuff that resulted in me trying to DO something to pull people together to make some kind of framework to help schools improve communications with parents.<\/li><li>I signed up for <a href=\"https:\/\/doaction.org\/event\/cheltenham-2019\/\">the Cheltenham do_action charity hackathon<\/a> on 4th October.

We&#8217;re well back into the swing of new-term things now, but last week I was hit by a heavy cold so I have been a bit slow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve mostly been continuing my charity microsite build. There&#8217;s been a few other small bits of support I&#8217;ve been working on. But it&#8217;s mostly build, build, build in HTML\/CSS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the side I&#8217;ve been doing a few interesting things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Made a simple chatbot framework in about 100 lines of vanilla JS<\/strong> &#8211; for ages I&#8217;ve been wanting to work on the &#8220;marketing&#8221; and explanatory side of my SchoolBot Parent Information System. As one of the main components of SchoolBot is a chatbot, I&#8217;d wondered if I could build a chatbot to explain what SchoolBot does. An hour or so later and I had done just that. The conversation needs to be developed, but it works nicely: https:\/\/schoolbot.co.uk<\/li><li>Related: <strong>I did NOT get involved in school comms<\/strong>! There was NOT <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/giuliavmerlo\/status\/1171084332246716417\">a conversation on Twitter<\/a> about service design and user experience of school stuff that resulted in me trying to DO something to pull people together to make some kind of framework to help schools improve communications with parents.<\/li><li>I signed up for <a href=\"https:\/\/doaction.org\/event\/cheltenham-2019\/\">the Cheltenham do_action charity hackathon<\/a> on 4th October. They still need some designers, so sign up if that&#8217;s you and you fancy giving back some work to local charities.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/09\/wordpress-fixing-shortcodes-that-enqueue-javascript-when-used-in-acf-fields\/\">WordPress: Fixing shortcodes that enqueue JavaScript when used in ACF fields<\/a> &#8211; a quick WordPress technical note<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This week I learned<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Blackcurrant Lemsips are WAY nicer than the lemon ones. ?<\/li><li>The <a href=\"http:\/\/focos.me\/\">Focos app for iOS<\/a> takes pictures with no depth information and uses machine learning to add depth information, giving you depth of field\/bokeh type stuff, and the ability to add virtual lighting.
