Bother&#8230;now I need to find more interesting things to say!]<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve said a lot over the last week-and-a-bit about the nitty-gritty of getting around this town of mine on two wheels, how I deal with it, and what I&#8217;ve learned that might be useful to others.<\/p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s the biggest and best tip of all.\u00a0 Despite all that I&#8217;ve said, despite the rain and wind and bad driving and darkness and sweat and punctures and buying expensive bikes and gear and potholes and messing up the routine to find you arrive at work with two shirts but no underwear&#8230;despite all that&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>ENJOY IT!!!<\/p>\n<p>Yes, cycling is <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">sometimes<\/span> lots of bad things, and I hope that my &#8220;tips&#8221; and experiences might help some of you deal with that.<\/p>\n<p>But mostly, cycling is an exhilarating, fun, healthy, life-enhancing, life-lengthening, sociable, environmentally friendly, fast, cheap, and trendy way to travel.<\/p>\n<p>Can I make it even more good than that?\u00a0 Here&#8217;s some final tips:<\/p>\n<p>Be nice to people: greet other cyclists, encourage and acknowledge good driving.<\/p>\n<p>Be &#8220;good&#8221;: obey the law, be gracious, give others room as well as expecting it.<\/p>\n<p>Be safe: keep your bike in good nick, make sure you&#8217;re visible, get training and advice &#8211; it&#8217;s not expensive, don&#8217;t deliberately put yourself in danger because a motorist is gonna hate himself if he hits you.<\/p>\n<p>Smile: show that you&#8217;re enjoying yourself &#8211; maybe you&#8217;ll get a smile back sometimes!<\/p>\n<p>And, as my first tip said, just do it: get on your bike, get good at cycling, have fun, and share your love of it.\u00a0 The more of us there are they better it will be.<\/p>\n",

Bother&#8230;now I need to find more interesting things to say!]<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve said a lot over the last week-and-a-bit about the nitty-gritty of getting around this town of mine on two wheels, how I deal with it, and what I&#8217;ve learned that might be useful to others.<\/p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s the biggest and best tip of all.\u00a0 Despite all that I&#8217;ve said, despite the rain and wind and bad driving and darkness and sweat and punctures and buying expensive bikes and gear and potholes and messing up the routine to find you arrive at work with two shirts but no underwear&#8230;despite all that&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>ENJOY IT!!!<\/p>\n<p>Yes, cycling is <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">sometimes<\/span> lots of bad things, and I hope that my &#8220;tips&#8221; and experiences might help some of you deal with that.<\/p>\n<p>But mostly, cycling is an exhilarating, fun, healthy, life-enhancing, life-lengthening, sociable, environmentally friendly, fast, cheap, and trendy way to travel.<\/p>\n<p>Can I make it even more good than that?\u00a0 Here&#8217;s some final tips:<\/p>\n<p>Be nice to people: greet other cyclists, encourage and acknowledge good driving.<\/p>\n<p>Be &#8220;good&#8221;: obey the law, be gracious, give others room as well as expecting it.<\/p>\n<p>Be safe: keep your bike in good nick, make sure you&#8217;re visible, get training and advice &#8211; it&#8217;s not expensive, don&#8217;t deliberately put yourself in danger because a motorist is gonna hate himself if he hits you.<\/p>\n<p>Smile: show that you&#8217;re enjoying yourself &#8211; maybe you&#8217;ll get a smile back sometimes!<\/p>\n<p>And, as my first tip said, just do it: get on your bike, get good at cycling, have fun, and share your love of it.\u00a0 The more of us there are they better it will be.<\/p>\n",

I don&#8217;t know if anyone&#8217;s ever understood my &#8220;glare, frown and nearly-pinched thumb and forefinger&#8221; gesture to be the intended message of &#8220;that gap was too small&#8221;, but trying can&#8217;t be a bad thing&#8230;can it?<\/p>\n<p>[Perhaps someone out there has a dictionary of standard cycling gestures?\u00a0 Perhaps someone should make one?]<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve never given anyone a talking to about their driving, but if I did so it would be informative rather than angry.\u00a0 Compare:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Sorry mate, but you overtook a bit close there, and it was pretty dangerous for me.\u00a0 Can you leave cyclists a bit more room in future please?&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>with (remember this is a family blog now&#8230;):<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You stupid idiot! What the heck do you think you were doing? I had no space and you nearly hit me!\u00a0 Take some driving lessons or something!!!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I suppose the closest I came was writing an email to the Library service after nearly being hit by the mobile library.\u00a0 The response to my polite email was, as hoped, apologetic and informed, rather than confrontational.\u00a0 Hopefully something was learned!<\/p>\n<h3>In the Car<\/h3>\n<p>Being in a car is a good place to learn and to teach about cycle safety too.\u00a0 A close relative of mine, who I love my  to bits, has a 4&#215;4, and I&#8217;ve had to tell him more than once, when a passenger in his big car, that he passed a cyclist WAY to close for comfort.\u00a0 He doesn&#8217;t realise, yet, how dangerous it is.\u00a0 I ensure that he&#8217;s learning that bikes need as much space as cars.<\/p>\n<p>My tip would be to try and do the following when  driving or being driven:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Point out cyclists to others and make sure that you\/they give room.<\/li>\n<li>Note stupid\/dangerous cycling behaviour and remember not to do those things when you&#8217;re on two wheels.<\/li>\n<li>Set the standard &#8211; do the things that you would have drivers do, and tell your passengers why you&#8217;re doing them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Sharing Experiences<\/h3>\n<p>Again&#8230;communicate what&#8217;s good, and what&#8217;s bad.\u00a0 Writing a blog is a bit extreme, but yes, part of my writing about cycling is to try to communicate with both cyclists and drivers about what it&#8217;s like to be a cyclist on the roads of Swindon.<\/p>\n<p>But how about talking with friends, family, colleagues, about your experiences?\u00a0 If I have a close shave, I&#8217;ll quite often chat about it in the office and make sure people know that overtaking and then turning left or overtaking at a junction or whatever is dangerous for the cyclist.<\/p>\n<p>Those incidents can serve as practical examples for others.<\/p>\n<p>Talk about the good stuff too&#8230;&#8221;everyone gave me lots of room on the way in today, it made my ride so much safer&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps talking about your cycling, telling your stories from two wheels and sharing your experiences will make the roads a little bit safer.\u00a0 Tony Blair&#8217;s theme was &#8220;Thiiiiings can only get betteeeeerrrrrr&#8221;.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s hope they do!<\/p>\n",

I don&#8217;t know if anyone&#8217;s ever understood my &#8220;glare, frown and nearly-pinched thumb and forefinger&#8221; gesture to be the intended message of &#8220;that gap was too small&#8221;, but trying can&#8217;t be a bad thing&#8230;can it?<\/p>\n<p>[Perhaps someone out there has a dictionary of standard cycling gestures?\u00a0 Perhaps someone should make one?]<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve never given anyone a talking to about their driving, but if I did so it would be informative rather than angry.\u00a0 Compare:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Sorry mate, but you overtook a bit close there, and it was pretty dangerous for me.\u00a0 Can you leave cyclists a bit more room in future please?&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>with (remember this is a family blog now&#8230;):<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You stupid idiot! What the heck do you think you were doing? I had no space and you nearly hit me!\u00a0 Take some driving lessons or something!!!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I suppose the closest I came was writing an email to the Library service after nearly being hit by the mobile library.\u00a0 The response to my polite email was, as hoped, apologetic and informed, rather than confrontational.\u00a0 Hopefully something was learned!<\/p>\n<h3>In the Car<\/h3>\n<p>Being in a car is a good place to learn and to teach about cycle safety too.\u00a0 A close relative of mine, who I love my  to bits, has a 4&#215;4, and I&#8217;ve had to tell him more than once, when a passenger in his big car, that he passed a cyclist WAY to close for comfort.\u00a0 He doesn&#8217;t realise, yet, how dangerous it is.\u00a0 I ensure that he&#8217;s learning that bikes need as much space as cars.<\/p>\n<p>My tip would be to try and do the following when  driving or being driven:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Point out cyclists to others and make sure that you\/they give room.<\/li>\n<li>Note stupid\/dangerous cycling behaviour and remember not to do those things when you&#8217;re on two wheels.<\/li>\n<li>Set the standard &#8211; do the things that you would have drivers do, and tell your passengers why you&#8217;re doing them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Sharing Experiences<\/h3>\n<p>Again&#8230;communicate what&#8217;s good, and what&#8217;s bad.\u00a0 Writing a blog is a bit extreme, but yes, part of my writing about cycling is to try to communicate with both cyclists and drivers about what it&#8217;s like to be a cyclist on the roads of Swindon.<\/p>\n<p>But how about talking with friends, family, colleagues, about your experiences?\u00a0 If I have a close shave, I&#8217;ll quite often chat about it in the office and make sure people know that overtaking and then turning left or overtaking at a junction or whatever is dangerous for the cyclist.<\/p>\n<p>Those incidents can serve as practical examples for others.<\/p>\n<p>Talk about the good stuff too&#8230;&#8221;everyone gave me lots of room on the way in today, it made my ride so much safer&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps talking about your cycling, telling your stories from two wheels and sharing your experiences will make the roads a little bit safer.\u00a0 Tony Blair&#8217;s theme was &#8220;Thiiiiings can only get betteeeeerrrrrr&#8221;.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s hope they do!<\/p>\n",

And while I would never advocate any form of road-rage, any inciting of road-rage or anything along those lines, I think it&#8217;s important to be confident on the road as a cyclist and to stand your ground a bit.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Confidence is not something that I can give you tips about.  It&#8217;s something that you&#8217;ll grow into as you do more cycling on the roads.  As you grow in confidence perhaps you can start to try some of what I suggest below.<\/p>\n<p>I should probably point out that the things I mention here are my own style of cycling, and you adopt any of my &#8220;tips&#8221; at your own risk&#8230;very much as you adopt cycling in general at your own risk.  And, of course, I defer to the Highway Code and the road laws of the UK in all matters.<\/p>\n<p>My aim, in &#8220;standing firm&#8221;, is to make sure that other road users around me are aware of my presence, and my rights as a cyclist AS I&#8217;m cycling.<\/p>\n<p>I mostly do this by riding the &#8220;primary position&#8221;.  Not all of the time, but when it&#8217;s appropriate.  This means I&#8217;m not hugging the left-hand kerb, but I&#8217;m a couple or three feet from it.<\/p>\n<p>But there are other occasions too.  At junctions and &#8220;pinch points&#8221; &#8211; where the road narrows or lanes merge &#8211; I do a LOT of looking over my shoulder.  Establishing eye contact with the driver behind says &#8220;I&#8217;m here&#8230;I&#8217;m allowed to be here&#8230;please give me room&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>These techniques should always be combined with obeying the rules of the road and especially with clear signalling well in advance of what you intend to do.<\/p>\n<p>One good example is on my way home there&#8217;s a place where there&#8217;s a nasty sunken drain cover just before a roundabout.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<figure id=\"attachment_470\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-470\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-470 \" title=\"nasty-drain-cover-1\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Location of nasty drain cover\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-1.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-1-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-470\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Location of nasty drain cover<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_471\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-471\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-471\" title=\"nasty-drain-cover-2\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-2.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Nasty Drain Cover - worse than it looks with a nasty sharp back edge.\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-2.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-2-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-471\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nasty Drain Cover - worse than it looks with a nasty sharp back edge.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>To go over it is horrid.  To go left of it forces you down a narrow gap close to the kerb, to go right of it means, pretty much, cycling in the middle of the road.  So I look behind, check for space, and pull into the middle really early on.\u00a0 (I tend not to indicate here as I&#8217;m not turning right at the roundabout&#8230;not sure what I should actually be doing?!). Moving out gives me a pretty good line over the roundabout too!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there are two dangers with the &#8220;Stand Firm&#8221; approach:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The driver ignores you and refuses to give you room<\/strong>.  I only cycle the primary position, or move out if I know it&#8217;s safe.  If something&#8217;s in my way &#8211; or if I&#8217;m in something&#8217;s way &#8211; then I keep well clear, and with experience you&#8217;ll learn to listen and hear what the vehicle behind you might be about to do.  A revving engine as you approach a roundabout means &#8220;get out the way, I&#8217;m coming through!&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Being annoying<\/strong>.  This happens far less than you think. Much as a few bad cyclists get the general cycling population a bad press, so a few bad drivers give the driving population a bad press.\u00a0 Most drivers seem to respond well to cues and signals that I give.\n<p>But standing firm must also be tempered with grace.  Give people room, let people through, acknowledge that cars can go faster than you and let them.  A good example: Temporary traffic lights on a country road.  I&#8217;ve reached them first and stopped and a few cars are behind me.  Pulling away first means that they all want to overtake me on a section of road reduced to one lane.  So I just stop and wave them past.  No dangerous overtaking, no annoyed cyclist, no annoyed drivers.  Everyone wins!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You&#8217;re allowed to be on the road!  If you&#8217;re confident, and if it&#8217;s safe to do so, make sure that others are aware of that.  But be aware that others are on the road too and sometimes, a little give and take works wonders.<\/p>\n<p>[Update &#8211; after writing this I read <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/environment\/ethicallivingblog\/2009\/jul\/11\/bike-blog-road-safety\">an article written by a 12-year-old<\/a> who, after some cycle training, &#8220;managed to make [a double decker bus] that was so much bigger than me slow down while I moved across its path&#8221;.  It seems that my approach &#8211; at least the road positioning, signalling and asserting yourself parts &#8211; is advocated as a part of basic training!]<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>[If you haven&#8217;t already, and are wondering why my cycle commuting tips might be controversial, please read <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/13\/controversial-commute-tips-introduction\/\">the introduction!<\/a>]<\/p>\n<p>This is a tip about cycling character.  And while I would never advocate any form of road-rage, any inciting of road-rage or anything along those lines, I think it&#8217;s important to be confident on the road as a cyclist and to stand your ground a bit.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Confidence is not something that I can give you tips about.  It&#8217;s something that you&#8217;ll grow into as you do more cycling on the roads.  As you grow in confidence perhaps you can start to try some of what I suggest below.<\/p>\n<p>I should probably point out that the things I mention here are my own style of cycling, and you adopt any of my &#8220;tips&#8221; at your own risk&#8230;very much as you adopt cycling in general at your own risk.  And, of course, I defer to the Highway Code and the road laws of the UK in all matters.<\/p>\n<p>My aim, in &#8220;standing firm&#8221;, is to make sure that other road users around me are aware of my presence, and my rights as a cyclist AS I&#8217;m cycling.<\/p>\n<p>I mostly do this by riding the &#8220;primary position&#8221;.  Not all of the time, but when it&#8217;s appropriate.  This means I&#8217;m not hugging the left-hand kerb, but I&#8217;m a couple or three feet from it.<\/p>\n<p>But there are other occasions too.  At junctions and &#8220;pinch points&#8221; &#8211; where the road narrows or lanes merge &#8211; I do a LOT of looking over my shoulder.  Establishing eye contact with the driver behind says &#8220;I&#8217;m here&#8230;I&#8217;m allowed to be here&#8230;please give me room&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>These techniques should always be combined with obeying the rules of the road and especially with clear signalling well in advance of what you intend to do.<\/p>\n<p>One good example is on my way home there&#8217;s a place where there&#8217;s a nasty sunken drain cover just before a roundabout.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<figure id=\"attachment_470\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-470\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-470 \" title=\"nasty-drain-cover-1\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Location of nasty drain cover\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-1.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-1-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-470\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Location of nasty drain cover<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_471\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-471\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-471\" title=\"nasty-drain-cover-2\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-2.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Nasty Drain Cover - worse than it looks with a nasty sharp back edge.\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-2.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-2-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-471\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nasty Drain Cover - worse than it looks with a nasty sharp back edge.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>To go over it is horrid.  To go left of it forces you down a narrow gap close to the kerb, to go right of it means, pretty much, cycling in the middle of the road.  So I look behind, check for space, and pull into the middle really early on.\u00a0 (I tend not to indicate here as I&#8217;m not turning right at the roundabout&#8230;not sure what I should actually be doing?!). Moving out gives me a pretty good line over the roundabout too!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there are two dangers with the &#8220;Stand Firm&#8221; approach:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The driver ignores you and refuses to give you room<\/strong>.  I only cycle the primary position, or move out if I know it&#8217;s safe.  If something&#8217;s in my way &#8211; or if I&#8217;m in something&#8217;s way &#8211; then I keep well clear, and with experience you&#8217;ll learn to listen and hear what the vehicle behind you might be about to do.  A revving engine as you approach a roundabout means &#8220;get out the way, I&#8217;m coming through!&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Being annoying<\/strong>.  This happens far less than you think. Much as a few bad cyclists get the general cycling population a bad press, so a few bad drivers give the driving population a bad press.\u00a0 Most drivers seem to respond well to cues and signals that I give.\n<p>But standing firm must also be tempered with grace.  Give people room, let people through, acknowledge that cars can go faster than you and let them.  A good example: Temporary traffic lights on a country road.  I&#8217;ve reached them first and stopped and a few cars are behind me.  Pulling away first means that they all want to overtake me on a section of road reduced to one lane.  So I just stop and wave them past.  No dangerous overtaking, no annoyed cyclist, no annoyed drivers.  Everyone wins!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You&#8217;re allowed to be on the road!  If you&#8217;re confident, and if it&#8217;s safe to do so, make sure that others are aware of that.  But be aware that others are on the road too and sometimes, a little give and take works wonders.<\/p>\n<p>[Update &#8211; after writing this I read <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/environment\/ethicallivingblog\/2009\/jul\/11\/bike-blog-road-safety\">an article written by a 12-year-old<\/a> who, after some cycle training, &#8220;managed to make [a double decker bus] that was so much bigger than me slow down while I moved across its path&#8221;.  It seems that my approach &#8211; at least the road positioning, signalling and asserting yourself parts &#8211; is advocated as a part of basic training!]<\/p>\n",

You can cycle in jeans, T-shirts, skirts (though, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/environment\/ethicallivingblog\/2009\/jul\/07\/cycling-skirts\">The Guardian&#8217;s own tips on this<\/a>), suits&#8230;in fact, some would argue that <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_Naked_Bike_Ride\">clothing is optional<\/a> for cycling!<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But as regular readers will know, I think that, like a decent bike, some decent cycle clothing makes the whole experience much nicer.  And here&#8217;s why:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sweat &amp; Changing.  Yes, I&#8217;m fortunate to have showers at my workplace, so I can shower and change when I arrive.  Which is actually pretty good because I sweat quite a lot.  But even a warm glow isn&#8217;t particularly pleasant to be in when you arrive at work, so a change of clothes is usually welcome.  And if you&#8217;re going to change anyway, why not change into\/out of some cycle specific clothing.<\/li>\n<li>Comfort.  Cycling involves things like leaning forward and flexing your knees a lot, along with a repetitive up-down motion of your legs, which is not really normal, and everyday clothes aren&#8217;t really cut for that sort of thing. You don&#8217;t wear a jumper when it&#8217;s sunny, or shorts in the snow.  Actually, perhaps you do&#8230;but you get my point.  We&#8217;ve been clever enough to develop different clothes for different seasons and activities.  Cycle-specific clothing is just more comfortable to cycle in.  As for padded pants (my term for cycling shorts)? Well, try them.  They&#8217;re not for everyone, I admit, but I won&#8217;t be going back.<\/li>\n<li>Safety.  It&#8217;s actually the combination of cyclist and driver in me that think this: cyclists should be visible!  Wear something bright so that you stand out from the road.  And when it&#8217;s dark, wear something reflective.  Those lights are great, but they&#8217;re just the start as far as I&#8217;m concerned.<\/li>\n<li>Rain.  You may have noticed the wet stuff that falls from the sky&#8230;it really mucks up a commute.  But don&#8217;t be put off!  With the right kit you can arrive at work with, well, pretty much everything dry but your face.<\/li>\n<li>Wind.  It may seem odd, but I actually prefer cycling in a downpour to cycling in a gale.  Wind can get to you in lots of ways. And my <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/11\/ill-get-my-coat\/\">Gore Windstopper Jacket<\/a> has improved my cycling comfort levels a LOT!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Now, buying all this gear can be expensive right?<\/p>\n<p>Well, yes.  But relative to running a car?  I mean, we&#8217;ve just had the anniversary of buying our car, which means Insurance (\u00a3250), MoT (\u00a3120 with a new exhaust), Service (+ cam belt this time round &#8211; \u00a3400), and then there&#8217;s Vehicle Excise Duty (\u00a3145), depreciation, and consumables (washing, de-icer, washer fluid, etc).  And that&#8217;s before petrol (I reckon I save at least \u00a3250 per year).<\/p>\n<p>If you can afford to do all of that, then, not everyone, I know, but most people with a car can surely afford a decent visible, waterproof jacket?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>[If you haven&#8217;t already, and are wondering why my cycle commuting tips might be controversial, please read <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/13\/controversial-commute-tips-introduction\/\">the introduction!<\/a>]<\/p>\n<p>Yes, yes, yes.  You can cycle in jeans, T-shirts, skirts (though, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/environment\/ethicallivingblog\/2009\/jul\/07\/cycling-skirts\">The Guardian&#8217;s own tips on this<\/a>), suits&#8230;in fact, some would argue that <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_Naked_Bike_Ride\">clothing is optional<\/a> for cycling!<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But as regular readers will know, I think that, like a decent bike, some decent cycle clothing makes the whole experience much nicer.  And here&#8217;s why:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sweat &amp; Changing.  Yes, I&#8217;m fortunate to have showers at my workplace, so I can shower and change when I arrive.  Which is actually pretty good because I sweat quite a lot.  But even a warm glow isn&#8217;t particularly pleasant to be in when you arrive at work, so a change of clothes is usually welcome.  And if you&#8217;re going to change anyway, why not change into\/out of some cycle specific clothing.<\/li>\n<li>Comfort.  Cycling involves things like leaning forward and flexing your knees a lot, along with a repetitive up-down motion of your legs, which is not really normal, and everyday clothes aren&#8217;t really cut for that sort of thing. You don&#8217;t wear a jumper when it&#8217;s sunny, or shorts in the snow.  Actually, perhaps you do&#8230;but you get my point.  We&#8217;ve been clever enough to develop different clothes for different seasons and activities.  Cycle-specific clothing is just more comfortable to cycle in.  As for padded pants (my term for cycling shorts)? Well, try them.  They&#8217;re not for everyone, I admit, but I won&#8217;t be going back.<\/li>\n<li>Safety.  It&#8217;s actually the combination of cyclist and driver in me that think this: cyclists should be visible!  Wear something bright so that you stand out from the road.  And when it&#8217;s dark, wear something reflective.  Those lights are great, but they&#8217;re just the start as far as I&#8217;m concerned.<\/li>\n<li>Rain.  You may have noticed the wet stuff that falls from the sky&#8230;it really mucks up a commute.  But don&#8217;t be put off!  With the right kit you can arrive at work with, well, pretty much everything dry but your face.<\/li>\n<li>Wind.  It may seem odd, but I actually prefer cycling in a downpour to cycling in a gale.  Wind can get to you in lots of ways. And my <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/11\/ill-get-my-coat\/\">Gore Windstopper Jacket<\/a> has improved my cycling comfort levels a LOT!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Now, buying all this gear can be expensive right?<\/p>\n<p>Well, yes.  But relative to running a car?  I mean, we&#8217;ve just had the anniversary of buying our car, which means Insurance (\u00a3250), MoT (\u00a3120 with a new exhaust), Service (+ cam belt this time round &#8211; \u00a3400), and then there&#8217;s Vehicle Excise Duty (\u00a3145), depreciation, and consumables (washing, de-icer, washer fluid, etc).  And that&#8217;s before petrol (I reckon I save at least \u00a3250 per year).<\/p>\n<p>If you can afford to do all of that, then, not everyone, I know, but most people with a car can surely afford a decent visible, waterproof jacket?<\/p>\n",

In some ways my <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/17\/controversial-commute-tips-4-lighten-the-load\/\">last tip<\/a> about leaving some things at work complicates matters because you need to remember what&#8217;s at work and what isn&#8217;t, what needs changing, and so on.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>At first, I&#8217;d often get this wrong, but over time I&#8217;ve developed a routine.  I know what needs to go in my bag on what days.  Some things stay in my bag.   Some things are changed every day, some are changed every week.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;ll need a bit of thought, but with practice &#8220;<em>The Routine<\/em>&#8221; becomes second nature&#8230;until you get an out-of-routine day.  A trip away from the office; a day off on leave, a day working from home.  All of these put you out of step with where things are.<\/p>\n<p>I also recently had a phase of bad Mondays.  Traditionally, Wednesday is my least favourite day of the week (it&#8217;s the furthest point from a weekend), but for a few weeks Mondays were pretty bad.  The things with Monday is lots of weekly things get changed over, and I&#8217;m often thinking too hard about them and forget the daily things.<\/p>\n<p>But establishing a routine is good, will come as you work at it, and makes life easier in the end.<\/p>\n",

Some things are changed every day, some are changed every week.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;ll need a bit of thought, but with practice &#8220;<em>The Routine<\/em>&#8221; becomes second nature&#8230;until you get an out-of-routine day.  A trip away from the office; a day off on leave, a day working from home.  All of these put you out of step with where things are.<\/p>\n<p>I also recently had a phase of bad Mondays.  Traditionally, Wednesday is my least favourite day of the week (it&#8217;s the furthest point from a weekend), but for a few weeks Mondays were pretty bad.  The things with Monday is lots of weekly things get changed over, and I&#8217;m often thinking too hard about them and forget the daily things.<\/p>\n<p>But establishing a routine is good, will come as you work at it, and makes life easier in the end.<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s an area of constant innovation.  Rucksacks, messenger bags, paniers, baskets, even trailers exist.<\/p>\n<p>But I think the key to an easier commute is to reduce the amount that you have to carry.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leave a lock at work.  Locks are heavy.  If you regularly ride to the same place, leave a lock there.<\/li>\n<li>Store spare clothes.  I&#8217;m fortunate enough to have a locker &#8211; depending on what facilities you have this may or may not be practical, but I leave bigger items of clothing at work overnight, change them regularly but not every day, and I have spares in case I get out of routine (see the next post for more on this).  I have a pair of shoes that stays at work.<\/li>\n<li>Where&#8217;s lunch coming from?  We have a small local supermarket where I stock up on fruit and snacks occasionally.  I bring in my main lunch (sandwich, pasta, salad and so on) each day, but other less perishable items are bought in bulk and stored in my drawer.<\/li>\n<li>Duplicates.  If there&#8217;s something that you take to work often, and if you can afford it, buy a duplicate and leave it there.  I do this with things like hay-fever remedies, and sports shoes.<\/li>\n<p>I used to take paniers, but over time, leaving these things at my destination has meant that all I have to carry are a few smaller bits of clothing, a small lunch, and some small valuables, which all fits easily into a small rucksack.<\/p>\n<p>Bag tips: make sure it&#8217;s waterproof and visible!  I use a rucksack cover in a downpour.  These fold up into a tiny size &#8211; but make sure it&#8217;ll make you visible.  &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.respro.com\/products\/urban-commuting\/hi-visibility\/hiviz_hump\/\">Humps<\/a>&#8221; are good for this, they look a bit daft, but I&#8217;d rather look a little silly than get knocked off on a dark, wet night.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>[If you haven&#8217;t already, and are wondering why my cycle commuting tips might be controversial, please read <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/13\/controversial-commute-tips-introduction\/\">the introduction!<\/a>]<\/p>\n<p>So, there ARE ways to carry a load on a bike.  It&#8217;s an area of constant innovation.  Rucksacks, messenger bags, paniers, baskets, even trailers exist.<\/p>\n<p>But I think the key to an easier commute is to reduce the amount that you have to carry.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leave a lock at work.  Locks are heavy.  If you regularly ride to the same place, leave a lock there.<\/li>\n<li>Store spare clothes.  I&#8217;m fortunate enough to have a locker &#8211; depending on what facilities you have this may or may not be practical, but I leave bigger items of clothing at work overnight, change them regularly but not every day, and I have spares in case I get out of routine (see the next post for more on this).  I have a pair of shoes that stays at work.<\/li>\n<li>Where&#8217;s lunch coming from?  We have a small local supermarket where I stock up on fruit and snacks occasionally.  I bring in my main lunch (sandwich, pasta, salad and so on) each day, but other less perishable items are bought in bulk and stored in my drawer.<\/li>\n<li>Duplicates.  If there&#8217;s something that you take to work often, and if you can afford it, buy a duplicate and leave it there.  I do this with things like hay-fever remedies, and sports shoes.<\/li>\n<p>I used to take paniers, but over time, leaving these things at my destination has meant that all I have to carry are a few smaller bits of clothing, a small lunch, and some small valuables, which all fits easily into a small rucksack.<\/p>\n<p>Bag tips: make sure it&#8217;s waterproof and visible!  I use a rucksack cover in a downpour.  These fold up into a tiny size &#8211; but make sure it&#8217;ll make you visible.  &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.respro.com\/products\/urban-commuting\/hi-visibility\/hiviz_hump\/\">Humps<\/a>&#8221; are good for this, they look a bit daft, but I&#8217;d rather look a little silly than get knocked off on a dark, wet night.<\/p>\n",

even though it&#8217;s a Walkman-branded phone, it&#8217;s a lousy media player, and it&#8217;s not an organiser.<\/li>\n<li>My 5th Generation iPod Video is a great media player, but rubbish at doing everything else.<\/li>\n<li>My PalmTungsten (which has had a broken touch-screen for years now) is a great organiser, book reader and note-taker, but again, is rubbish at media and it&#8217;s not a phone.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Maybe some of these really expensive new devices do do ALL of these things well, but I don&#8217;t want to pay \u00a3350+ until I KNOW what I&#8217;m getting.<\/p>\n<h3>Plan&#8230;err&#8230;A?<\/h3>\n<p>So&#8230;I&#8217;ve fallen back to plan A: the iPod Touch.\u00a0 I THINK it will converge as a media player and organiser.\u00a0 It will <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/mobile\/products\/sync.html#p=apple\">sync with Google<\/a>, I can get my study bibles on it (only when online currently, but there&#8217;s an offline app in the pipeline).\u00a0 It will let me browse the web from home and, sometimes, on the move.\u00a0 And rather than spend an extra \u00a3200 on the &#8220;phone&#8221; in &#8220;iPhone&#8221;, my W810 will keep me properly connected when on the go on a \u00a315 tarrif with unlimited 2.5G internet.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an odd choice given that media and games are things I don&#8217;t care about, but I reckon I can make good use of it.<\/p>\n<p>And most of all, it will be really nice to finally get to play with the iPod Touch\/iPhone interface.\u00a0 For me, it&#8217;s not just a useful gadget, but a great <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">toy<\/span>&#8230;and just what I would have liked to have won as a prize!<\/p>\n<h3>A Rotten Apple<\/h3>\n<p>Having decided (and got permission) to buy an iTouch, I went online to get a good deal.\u00a0 Actually, it seems that prices are much of a muchness so, for no real reason other than to try them out, I decided to buy from the Apple Store.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly&#8230;Apple&#8217;s shopping experience isn&#8217;t as good as their user experience.\u00a0 OK, so, the shop is fine, and the device was dispatched quickly&#8230;I guess I can&#8217;t blame Apple.<\/p>\n<p>But they shipped using UPS.\u00a0 And UPS seem to have the WORST distribution network of any courier I&#8217;ve come across in the UK.\u00a0 Our nearest depots are Bristol, Gloucester and Reading&#8230;all about 40 miles away.<\/p>\n<p>Annoyingly, I decided to have this delivered to my home address and, several days later, I&#8217;m still waiting to rendezvous with my new toy, which has been clocking up the miles between Bristol and Swindon.\u00a0 Despite having seen a UPS van leaving my office on Tuesday morning&#8230;probably carrying my parcel!<\/p>\n<p>I shalln&#8217;t be shopping at the Apple Store again!\u00a0 I should just have popped to Asda at lunch and bought one.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well.\u00a0 Hopefully my treat will arrive tomorrow &#8211; expect me to tell you all about it soon!<\/p>\n",

even though it&#8217;s a Walkman-branded phone, it&#8217;s a lousy media player, and it&#8217;s not an organiser.<\/li>\n<li>My 5th Generation iPod Video is a great media player, but rubbish at doing everything else.<\/li>\n<li>My PalmTungsten (which has had a broken touch-screen for years now) is a great organiser, book reader and note-taker, but again, is rubbish at media and it&#8217;s not a phone.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Maybe some of these really expensive new devices do do ALL of these things well, but I don&#8217;t want to pay \u00a3350+ until I KNOW what I&#8217;m getting.<\/p>\n<h3>Plan&#8230;err&#8230;A?<\/h3>\n<p>So&#8230;I&#8217;ve fallen back to plan A: the iPod Touch.\u00a0 I THINK it will converge as a media player and organiser.\u00a0 It will <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/mobile\/products\/sync.html#p=apple\">sync with Google<\/a>, I can get my study bibles on it (only when online currently, but there&#8217;s an offline app in the pipeline).\u00a0 It will let me browse the web from home and, sometimes, on the move.\u00a0 And rather than spend an extra \u00a3200 on the &#8220;phone&#8221; in &#8220;iPhone&#8221;, my W810 will keep me properly connected when on the go on a \u00a315 tarrif with unlimited 2.5G internet.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an odd choice given that media and games are things I don&#8217;t care about, but I reckon I can make good use of it.<\/p>\n<p>And most of all, it will be really nice to finally get to play with the iPod Touch\/iPhone interface.\u00a0 For me, it&#8217;s not just a useful gadget, but a great <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">toy<\/span>&#8230;and just what I would have liked to have won as a prize!<\/p>\n<h3>A Rotten Apple<\/h3>\n<p>Having decided (and got permission) to buy an iTouch, I went online to get a good deal.\u00a0 Actually, it seems that prices are much of a muchness so, for no real reason other than to try them out, I decided to buy from the Apple Store.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly&#8230;Apple&#8217;s shopping experience isn&#8217;t as good as their user experience.\u00a0 OK, so, the shop is fine, and the device was dispatched quickly&#8230;I guess I can&#8217;t blame Apple.<\/p>\n<p>But they shipped using UPS.\u00a0 And UPS seem to have the WORST distribution network of any courier I&#8217;ve come across in the UK.\u00a0 Our nearest depots are Bristol, Gloucester and Reading&#8230;all about 40 miles away.<\/p>\n<p>Annoyingly, I decided to have this delivered to my home address and, several days later, I&#8217;m still waiting to rendezvous with my new toy, which has been clocking up the miles between Bristol and Swindon.\u00a0 Despite having seen a UPS van leaving my office on Tuesday morning&#8230;probably carrying my parcel!<\/p>\n<p>I shalln&#8217;t be shopping at the Apple Store again!\u00a0 I should just have popped to Asda at lunch and bought one.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well.\u00a0 Hopefully my treat will arrive tomorrow &#8211; expect me to tell you all about it soon!<\/p>\n",

If you can afford it, buy yourself a decent bike.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Of course, it doesn&#8217;t REALLY matter.  I&#8217;d rather you rode a knackered (but SAFE, of course) old steed than nothing at all.  But a decent, fit-for-purpose, well-maintained bike makes the whole experience so much better.<\/p>\n<p>Type of bike is, I think, important.  I KNOW that mountain bikes are cool status symbols, but you&#8217;ll mostly be riding on tarmac (unless you have, and choose to use, offroad routes), so get a bike that suited to the road &#8211; a road bike, tourer, or hybrid.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve never regretted buying a not-quite-bottom-of-the-range road bike &#8211; it&#8217;s improved my commuting experience no end.  I bought it for fitness but I love riding it now and it&#8217;s become the workhorse too.  The curved, drop handlebars allow me to get out of the wind, it&#8217;s light and fast, and it flies up hills.<\/p>\n<p>Get mudguards &#8211; you&#8217;ll be riding in the rain too right?  If you need to take luggage (future tips will show how you can reduce the need to carry stuff), then make sure you&#8217;ve got racks, or the screw holes need to attach them.<\/p>\n<p>At the very least, if you insist on using a mountain bike, get some road tyres.  A friend at work announced with great glee this week, that he&#8217;d swapped his knobbly off-road tyres for slicks and, I think the word &#8220;awesome&#8221; was used.  He pedalled, and he went somewhere &#8211; the difference was dramatic!<\/p>\n<p>If a new bike looks expensive then help might be at hand.  If your employer runs a Cycle-to-Work scheme you can get a bike to ride to work on for almost half price and with a 12-month interest free loan. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclescheme.co.uk\/\">CycleScheme Site<\/a> is pretty handy at explaining this &#8211; check it out!<\/p>\n",

If you can afford it, buy yourself a decent bike.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Of course, it doesn&#8217;t REALLY matter.  I&#8217;d rather you rode a knackered (but SAFE, of course) old steed than nothing at all.  But a decent, fit-for-purpose, well-maintained bike makes the whole experience so much better.<\/p>\n<p>Type of bike is, I think, important.  I KNOW that mountain bikes are cool status symbols, but you&#8217;ll mostly be riding on tarmac (unless you have, and choose to use, offroad routes), so get a bike that suited to the road &#8211; a road bike, tourer, or hybrid.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve never regretted buying a not-quite-bottom-of-the-range road bike &#8211; it&#8217;s improved my commuting experience no end.  I bought it for fitness but I love riding it now and it&#8217;s become the workhorse too.  The curved, drop handlebars allow me to get out of the wind, it&#8217;s light and fast, and it flies up hills.<\/p>\n<p>Get mudguards &#8211; you&#8217;ll be riding in the rain too right?  If you need to take luggage (future tips will show how you can reduce the need to carry stuff), then make sure you&#8217;ve got racks, or the screw holes need to attach them.<\/p>\n<p>At the very least, if you insist on using a mountain bike, get some road tyres.  A friend at work announced with great glee this week, that he&#8217;d swapped his knobbly off-road tyres for slicks and, I think the word &#8220;awesome&#8221; was used.  He pedalled, and he went somewhere &#8211; the difference was dramatic!<\/p>\n<p>If a new bike looks expensive then help might be at hand.  If your employer runs a Cycle-to-Work scheme you can get a bike to ride to work on for almost half price and with a 12-month interest free loan. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclescheme.co.uk\/\">CycleScheme Site<\/a> is pretty handy at explaining this &#8211; check it out!<\/p>\n",

Hey, I&#8217;m easing myself into it!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really just to point out that once you start cycling, you&#8217;re not alone, and there&#8217;s lots of help out there from friendly cyclists who have lots of experience.  You&#8217;re reading this, for one thing &#8211; whether or not that&#8217;s a good start I&#8217;m not sure.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s some ideas for where to get help:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local knowledge: find someone in your workplace, or neighbourhood, who cycles.  Find out from them where the cycle routes are (they&#8217;re not always obvious), which places to avoid, and what tips they have that are specific to your town, or workplace.<\/li>\n<li>Your council: though the state of the cycling infrastructure may not show it, you council almost certainly have targets for getting people to use sustainable transport and will have lots of help and resources to get you going.  Our council have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/roadstransport\/cycling.htm\">some online resources<\/a> and a great <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/swindoncycle1.pdf\">cycle routes map<\/a>, and I know the person that writes transport plans in Swindon, and she&#8217;s very helpful.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tfl.gov.uk\/cycling\">Transport for London<\/a> also have some good cycling stuff!<\/li>\n<li>Training: Some towns will have cycle training on offer.  You had driving lessons, so why not riding lessons?  I&#8217;ve not done one, but I&#8217;m certain it would be great for someone new to cycling on the road.  Could start by looking up <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ctc.org.uk\/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=5116\">CTC&#8217;s training page<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Books: Highly recommended is John Franklin&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclecraft.co.uk\/\">Cyclecraft<\/a> &#8211; a hugely respected guide to cycling safely.<\/li>\n<li>The Internet: Don&#8217;t believe everything you read, and you will come across some real cycle geeks who can identify a chain link at 50 yards and clean their spokes with cotton buds, but there&#8217;s a huge community of friendly people who are more than willing to help on the Internet.  Try the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/forums\">forums at BikeRadar<\/a> for starters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Or post a comment here, and see if I or any of my tiny readership can help.<\/p>\n",

Hey, I&#8217;m easing myself into it!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really just to point out that once you start cycling, you&#8217;re not alone, and there&#8217;s lots of help out there from friendly cyclists who have lots of experience.  You&#8217;re reading this, for one thing &#8211; whether or not that&#8217;s a good start I&#8217;m not sure.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s some ideas for where to get help:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local knowledge: find someone in your workplace, or neighbourhood, who cycles.  Find out from them where the cycle routes are (they&#8217;re not always obvious), which places to avoid, and what tips they have that are specific to your town, or workplace.<\/li>\n<li>Your council: though the state of the cycling infrastructure may not show it, you council almost certainly have targets for getting people to use sustainable transport and will have lots of help and resources to get you going.  Our council have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/roadstransport\/cycling.htm\">some online resources<\/a> and a great <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/swindoncycle1.pdf\">cycle routes map<\/a>, and I know the person that writes transport plans in Swindon, and she&#8217;s very helpful.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tfl.gov.uk\/cycling\">Transport for London<\/a> also have some good cycling stuff!<\/li>\n<li>Training: Some towns will have cycle training on offer.  You had driving lessons, so why not riding lessons?  I&#8217;ve not done one, but I&#8217;m certain it would be great for someone new to cycling on the road.  Could start by looking up <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ctc.org.uk\/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=5116\">CTC&#8217;s training page<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Books: Highly recommended is John Franklin&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclecraft.co.uk\/\">Cyclecraft<\/a> &#8211; a hugely respected guide to cycling safely.<\/li>\n<li>The Internet: Don&#8217;t believe everything you read, and you will come across some real cycle geeks who can identify a chain link at 50 yards and clean their spokes with cotton buds, but there&#8217;s a huge community of friendly people who are more than willing to help on the Internet.  Try the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/forums\">forums at BikeRadar<\/a> for starters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Or post a comment here, and see if I or any of my tiny readership can help.<\/p>\n",

Just do it!  Find a bike, leave the car at home, and ride to work.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Seriously.  If you live within about 5 miles of where you work, there&#8217;s very little excuse.  Give it a go!<\/p>\n<p>I remember my first time.  A fine, early-Autumn day, I woke up early, encouraged by a friend who consistently gets to work an hour before I do.  I shoved some clothes into my paniers, donned some stupid-looking shorts, took my shiny new Raleigh hybrid bike from the shed, and rode through town, along the old fit track (a well-used cycle route that runs alongside a dual carriageway), and arrived, quickly and easily, at the office on the edge of town.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t say it was a particularly momentous occasion, I guess it felt quite freeing not to have to use the car, but I don&#8217;t remember being that excited about it.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;d done it.  I&#8217;d shown that I could get to work on two wheels and it wasn&#8217;t difficult.  In some senses it was easier than using the car.  There were good cycle routes, and having a friend who knew the way helped.  There was really nothing not to like.<\/p>\n<p>But this tip also applies to those already commuting by bike.  Keep doing it!  One of the best ways to learn the ups and downs is to get practice and experience.  Try new routes, try someone else&#8217;s bike, try finding innovative solutions to the problems that you face as a cycle commuter.<\/p>\n<p>And if you do&#8230;let me know how it went!<\/p>\n",

Just do it!  Find a bike, leave the car at home, and ride to work.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Seriously.  If you live within about 5 miles of where you work, there&#8217;s very little excuse.  Give it a go!<\/p>\n<p>I remember my first time.  A fine, early-Autumn day, I woke up early, encouraged by a friend who consistently gets to work an hour before I do.  I shoved some clothes into my paniers, donned some stupid-looking shorts, took my shiny new Raleigh hybrid bike from the shed, and rode through town, along the old fit track (a well-used cycle route that runs alongside a dual carriageway), and arrived, quickly and easily, at the office on the edge of town.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t say it was a particularly momentous occasion, I guess it felt quite freeing not to have to use the car, but I don&#8217;t remember being that excited about it.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;d done it.  I&#8217;d shown that I could get to work on two wheels and it wasn&#8217;t difficult.  In some senses it was easier than using the car.  There were good cycle routes, and having a friend who knew the way helped.  There was really nothing not to like.<\/p>\n<p>But this tip also applies to those already commuting by bike.  Keep doing it!  One of the best ways to learn the ups and downs is to get practice and experience.  Try new routes, try someone else&#8217;s bike, try finding innovative solutions to the problems that you face as a cycle commuter.<\/p>\n<p>And if you do&#8230;let me know how it went!<\/p>\n",
