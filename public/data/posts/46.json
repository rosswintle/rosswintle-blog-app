It involved a family, of which I&#8217;ve met the mother once. The father had died; suddenly and way before his time.<\/p>\n<p>I desperately don&#8217;t want to make some kind of political point out of this tragedy. But I do want to tell you what subsequently happened this morning, and how I felt about it. \u00a0I&#8217;m not going to say what I think should be done. You can make your own minds up.<\/p>\n<p>Because of that news, I approached the morning with a renewed sense of the preciousness of life, and of the importance of keeping myself, Isaac, and Sally safe. I&#8217;d already nearly shed a tear or two. My emotions were on edge before the day had properly started.<\/p>\n<p>Despite grey clouds and a wet seat, I buckled Isaac up and, with helmets and lights on, we cycled, the quietest, safest way we know, to nursery.<\/p>\n<p>On the way home, I confess, I&#8217;m a little cavalier because I don&#8217;t have a kid on the back. By which I mean (&#8230;drum roll&#8230;) I cycle (&#8230;here, it&#8217;s coming&#8230;) ON THE ROAD!<\/p>\n<p>Yes. I know. Perhaps that&#8217;s something I need to change.<\/p>\n<p>And today, while on the road, not one but two cars made dangerous overtaking manoeuvres. One as I navigated a small roundabout that exits on to a blind corner frequented by buses. One at a narrow bit of road as another car was coming the other way.<\/p>\n<p>You could sense that both drivers got half way through the manoeuvre before realising something like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Argh, what&#8217;s coming the other way?<\/li>\n<li>Woah, that cyclist is going a bit quicker than I thought!<\/li>\n<li>Gosh, there actually isn&#8217;t really room\/time to do this safely!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s the slight pause in acceleration, a hesitation long enough for me to know that a decision is being made, then the swerve and pull-away once the driver&#8217;s decided that he may as well finish what he started as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>They were big, posh, expensive cars. A BMW and an Audi. It&#8217;s a gross and wholly unscientific generalisation for which the only data I have is my own recollection of previous incidents, but: they usually are.<\/p>\n<p>I stopped. I physically stopped by the side of the road after the second incident. I considered my route, my clothes, my helmet, my bicycle, my road positioning. I considered whether I should be cycling at all.<\/p>\n<p>I turned left, cycled the last few hundred yards home, opened the door, stepped inside, and cried.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m angry and sad.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want that news to one day be about me.<\/p>\n",

It involved a family, of which I&#8217;ve met the mother once. The father had died; suddenly and way before his time.<\/p>\n<p>I desperately don&#8217;t want to make some kind of political point out of this tragedy. But I do want to tell you what subsequently happened this morning, and how I felt about it. \u00a0I&#8217;m not going to say what I think should be done. You can make your own minds up.<\/p>\n<p>Because of that news, I approached the morning with a renewed sense of the preciousness of life, and of the importance of keeping myself, Isaac, and Sally safe. I&#8217;d already nearly shed a tear or two. My emotions were on edge before the day had properly started.<\/p>\n<p>Despite grey clouds and a wet seat, I buckled Isaac up and, with helmets and lights on, we cycled, the quietest, safest way we know, to nursery.<\/p>\n<p>On the way home, I confess, I&#8217;m a little cavalier because I don&#8217;t have a kid on the back. By which I mean (&#8230;drum roll&#8230;) I cycle (&#8230;here, it&#8217;s coming&#8230;) ON THE ROAD!<\/p>\n<p>Yes. I know. Perhaps that&#8217;s something I need to change.<\/p>\n<p>And today, while on the road, not one but two cars made dangerous overtaking manoeuvres. One as I navigated a small roundabout that exits on to a blind corner frequented by buses. One at a narrow bit of road as another car was coming the other way.<\/p>\n<p>You could sense that both drivers got half way through the manoeuvre before realising something like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Argh, what&#8217;s coming the other way?<\/li>\n<li>Woah, that cyclist is going a bit quicker than I thought!<\/li>\n<li>Gosh, there actually isn&#8217;t really room\/time to do this safely!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s the slight pause in acceleration, a hesitation long enough for me to know that a decision is being made, then the swerve and pull-away once the driver&#8217;s decided that he may as well finish what he started as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>They were big, posh, expensive cars. A BMW and an Audi. It&#8217;s a gross and wholly unscientific generalisation for which the only data I have is my own recollection of previous incidents, but: they usually are.<\/p>\n<p>I stopped. I physically stopped by the side of the road after the second incident. I considered my route, my clothes, my helmet, my bicycle, my road positioning. I considered whether I should be cycling at all.<\/p>\n<p>I turned left, cycled the last few hundred yards home, opened the door, stepped inside, and cried.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m angry and sad.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want that news to one day be about me.<\/p>\n",

            "content": {
                "rendered": "<p>Oh dear what has it come to. I&#8217;m writing posts that are specifically &#8220;reviews&#8221; of baby products. What have I become?<\/p>\n<p>In justification, let me give the back story.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">About this time last year I posted <\/span><a style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\" title=\"Reusable\/Cloth Nappies: A Plain English Guide for Dads and Dads-to-be\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2012\/10\/reusablecloth-nappies-a-plain-english-guide-for-dads-and-dad-to-bes\/\">my experiences of reusable nappies<\/a><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">. I bigged up the &#8220;bumGenius&#8221; brand as that&#8217;s what I had experience of. It seemed a little unfair to other cloth nappy companies, and the nice folk at Bambino Mio kindly sent some miosolo All-in-One nappies to use (along with some other handy cloth-nappy accessories), on the basis that I post about my experiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Arguably, waiting was good &#8211; I now have a year&#8217;s experience of using the miosolo&#8217;s. But even so, with apologies to Bambino Mio for being a little late (it&#8217;s been a busy year), here are my thoughts.<\/p>\n<h2>The good stuff<\/h2>\n<p>Things I like about the miosolo:<\/p>\n<p>Generally, in terms of quality and use these are definitely on a par with bumGenius, and they share many of the pros and cons of high-quality, all-in-one (or all-in-two) cloth nappies. The following represent where they are different from the bumGenius nappies that we have and love.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The inner part is attached to the outer part so they don&#8217;t get separated. As someone who pairs my socks and spends hours tracking down the missing parts of toys that come in sets, this is very pleasing as you don&#8217;t end up having outers with no inners.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The Velcro waist fastening is good because it gives you more &#8216;granularity&#8217; in the waist size. However, I prefer poppers still (see the related not-so-good thing below)!<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">They have some fancy features that, once you know how to use them make the washing and stuffing process slightly easier. There&#8217;s a little handle for pulling the dirty inner out, and a thing to aid re-stuffing. But&#8230;again, see the downsides of these below.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>The not-so-good stuff<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The Velcro waist fastening, while giving more flexibility with sizing, has some downsides. We find that they are much easier for a curious child to undo than poppers, and they can stick to other things in the wash. The popper\/Velcro thing is probably a matter of personal taste, one isn&#8217;t better than the other, they&#8217;re just different.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The extra bits for stuffing and washing are confusing. To be honest I was baffled by them at first as there aren&#8217;t instructions that say what they are for (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bambinomio.com\/en\/new-to-reusables\/user-guides\">the website user guides<\/a> are helpful). But even once you know what they do they don&#8217;t help an awful lot. The bumGenius nappies come apart in the wash so you don&#8217;t need to pull the inner out, so the miosolo&#8217;s special loop seems to just compensate for that fact that you do need to pull the inner out before washing. The stuffing aid was quite a help once I knew what to do with it.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The inner is one-size which is quite restrictive. bumGenius comes with two different sizes of inner pad, one of which has poppers to vary its length. Plus you can &#8216;double up&#8217; if you want to. The miosolo&#8217;s only have one inner pad and it&#8217;s a fixed length, which means sometimes your pad is too big and the nappy curls up to try to accommodate it, but this isn&#8217;t a big deal and is made up for by the fact that inners and outers are joined and don&#8217;t get separated and lost.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Summing up<\/h2>\n<p>The bumGenius and the miosolo are both good, high quality, well-designed nappies that will save you money, reduce landfill waste and are actually very easy to use. I&#8217;m sure that had we started out with miosolo&#8217;s we&#8217;d have been just as happy as we are with our bumGenius.<\/p>\n<p>The one thing that really stood out was the friendly and generous nature of the Bambino Mio people. They really are there to help and they&#8217;re full of handy hints and tips. Oh, and, unlike bumGenius, they&#8217;re a UK based company &#8211; that alone may make them worth supporting!<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately there&#8217;s not much in it. Take your pick and enjoy the many benefits of reusable, cloth nappies.<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Bambino Mio miosolo reusable nappy&#8230;err&#8230;review",
        "content": "<p>Oh dear what has it come to. I&#8217;m writing posts that are specifically &#8220;reviews&#8221; of baby products. What have I become?<\/p>\n<p>In justification, let me give the back story.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">About this time last year I posted <\/span><a style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\" title=\"Reusable\/Cloth Nappies: A Plain English Guide for Dads and Dads-to-be\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2012\/10\/reusablecloth-nappies-a-plain-english-guide-for-dads-and-dad-to-bes\/\">my experiences of reusable nappies<\/a><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">. I bigged up the &#8220;bumGenius&#8221; brand as that&#8217;s what I had experience of. It seemed a little unfair to other cloth nappy companies, and the nice folk at Bambino Mio kindly sent some miosolo All-in-One nappies to use (along with some other handy cloth-nappy accessories), on the basis that I post about my experiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Arguably, waiting was good &#8211; I now have a year&#8217;s experience of using the miosolo&#8217;s. But even so, with apologies to Bambino Mio for being a little late (it&#8217;s been a busy year), here are my thoughts.<\/p>\n<h2>The good stuff<\/h2>\n<p>Things I like about the miosolo:<\/p>\n<p>Generally, in terms of quality and use these are definitely on a par with bumGenius, and they share many of the pros and cons of high-quality, all-in-one (or all-in-two) cloth nappies. The following represent where they are different from the bumGenius nappies that we have and love.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The inner part is attached to the outer part so they don&#8217;t get separated. As someone who pairs my socks and spends hours tracking down the missing parts of toys that come in sets, this is very pleasing as you don&#8217;t end up having outers with no inners.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The Velcro waist fastening is good because it gives you more &#8216;granularity&#8217; in the waist size. However, I prefer poppers still (see the related not-so-good thing below)!<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">They have some fancy features that, once you know how to use them make the washing and stuffing process slightly easier. There&#8217;s a little handle for pulling the dirty inner out, and a thing to aid re-stuffing. But&#8230;again, see the downsides of these below.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>The not-so-good stuff<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The Velcro waist fastening, while giving more flexibility with sizing, has some downsides. We find that they are much easier for a curious child to undo than poppers, and they can stick to other things in the wash. The popper\/Velcro thing is probably a matter of personal taste, one isn&#8217;t better than the other, they&#8217;re just different.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The extra bits for stuffing and washing are confusing. To be honest I was baffled by them at first as there aren&#8217;t instructions that say what they are for (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bambinomio.com\/en\/new-to-reusables\/user-guides\">the website user guides<\/a> are helpful). But even once you know what they do they don&#8217;t help an awful lot. The bumGenius nappies come apart in the wash so you don&#8217;t need to pull the inner out, so the miosolo&#8217;s special loop seems to just compensate for that fact that you do need to pull the inner out before washing. The stuffing aid was quite a help once I knew what to do with it.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The inner is one-size which is quite restrictive. bumGenius comes with two different sizes of inner pad, one of which has poppers to vary its length. Plus you can &#8216;double up&#8217; if you want to. The miosolo&#8217;s only have one inner pad and it&#8217;s a fixed length, which means sometimes your pad is too big and the nappy curls up to try to accommodate it, but this isn&#8217;t a big deal and is made up for by the fact that inners and outers are joined and don&#8217;t get separated and lost.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Summing up<\/h2>\n<p>The bumGenius and the miosolo are both good, high quality, well-designed nappies that will save you money, reduce landfill waste and are actually very easy to use. I&#8217;m sure that had we started out with miosolo&#8217;s we&#8217;d have been just as happy as we are with our bumGenius.<\/p>\n<p>The one thing that really stood out was the friendly and generous nature of the Bambino Mio people. They really are there to help and they&#8217;re full of handy hints and tips. Oh, and, unlike bumGenius, they&#8217;re a UK based company &#8211; that alone may make them worth supporting!<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately there&#8217;s not much in it. Take your pick and enjoy the many benefits of reusable, cloth nappies.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>You may have noticed a couple of &#8220;random&#8221; photos on this blog recently. \u00a0This is because I&#8217;ve been trying out a&#8230;hmm&#8230;clever?&#8230;service called <a title=\"PressGram\" href=\"http:\/\/pressgr.am\/\">PressGram<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>PressGram is a service and iOS app that was Kickstarter-funded and that attempts to mimic the features of something like Instagram, but with automatic posting to WordPress blogs, and a policy of NOT own or use your photos. By which I think they mean wanting to use them in any other way than for the purpose of running the PressGram &#8220;social network&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>While I&#8217;m not a hugely visual person, I like the idea of Instagram, but I don&#8217;t like the fact that it&#8217;s owned by Facebook (a service that I have a minimal presence on) and I don&#8217;t like what they might do with my photos; Facebooks terms allow your images to be used in adverts, for example. And, I believe, they don&#8217;t just have these permissions, but they actively do these kinds of things.<\/p>\n<p>You can read about PressGram in their <a title=\"About - PressGram\" href=\"http:\/\/blog.pressgr.am\/about\/\">about page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While I <em>kind-of<\/em> get the PressGram mission and objectives and I support the notion of an app like this, a few things have bothered me about it.<\/p>\n<h3>Understanding<\/h3>\n<p>I confess that I didn&#8217;t back PressGram on KickStarter because I didn&#8217;t quite understand what it did. \u00a0Was it just an app that published photos to WordPress and had nice filters? Or did it do something more?<\/p>\n<p>Now that PressGram is out (and has been around for a while), I understand that it&#8217;s a social network based around your photos, with discovery, liking, commenting, etc. \u00a0So it&#8217;s more than just an upload-to-WordPress app.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s also not clear where your photos end up. \u00a0Or why you&#8217;d need to publish them to WordPress if they&#8217;re also on the PressGram network.<\/p>\n<p>I think that what PressGram is, and why it&#8217;s needed, is proving hard to communicate succinctly. \u00a0I&#8217;d certainly struggle to be an advocate for it. I think it does too many things and is confusing as a result.<\/p>\n<h3>Terms<\/h3>\n<p>PressGram, and it&#8217;s creator, has a great goal in letting you maintain ownership, control, and page-views of\/for your content: your photos! \u00a0But, this is confused by its terms of service which grant PressGram &#8220;a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>This is pretty standard terminology and I guess it&#8217;s required for any service that is publishing your content on the web using an app. You MUST grant this right in order for something like PressGram to serve its most basic purposes. And the term is clarified as being &#8220;solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting your Content in the app&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>But this section of the terms jars a little when you&#8217;re signing up for a service that&#8217;s main selling point is that it lets you keep ownership of your content. I truly believe that they let you keep your content, and won&#8217;t sell it, or use it for any other purposes than making the app work, but the legal words they need to use to achieve that still give them great power.<\/p>\n<p>Plus: &#8220;Pressgram reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any part of this Agreement. It is your responsibility to check this Agreement periodically for changes.&#8221; For a service that prides itself on it&#8217;s legal rules, this also seems a little unfair.<\/p>\n<h3>Sustainability<\/h3>\n<p>I was surprised to find that PressGram didn&#8217;t use MY web hosting to display my images. \u00a0From what I gather they are first uploaded from the phone app to Amazon S3 cloud-based storage, and then from there to my WordPress blog(s). \u00a0And a copy is kept on the Amazon storage.<\/p>\n<p>This means that John Saddington, PressGram&#8217;s founder and creator, is paying to store all of the PressGram images on Amazon S3. \u00a0And that number of images will grow and grow over time. What I don&#8217;t understand is how PressGram will sustain itself. There&#8217;s talk of getting some kind of funding, and of in-app purchases. And John is aware of this business problem. But I&#8217;m not convinced that he&#8217;s solved it or got a sustainable business plan. I do find myself wondering if PressGram will last<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, John&#8217;s done a great job of building the app and the community &#8211; it&#8217;s a huge achievement and his heart is totally in the right place, and I&#8217;ll probably up my usage of the PressGram app because it&#8217;s a brilliant way to post simple images to this blog (look out for more photos!). But I not convinced, yet, about what PressGram is, why it&#8217;s needed, and how long it will last.<\/p>\n<p>Is anyone else using it? What do you think?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>You may have noticed a couple of &#8220;random&#8221; photos on this blog recently. \u00a0This is because I&#8217;ve been trying out a&#8230;hmm&#8230;clever?&#8230;service called <a title=\"PressGram\" href=\"http:\/\/pressgr.am\/\">PressGram<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>PressGram is a service and iOS app that was Kickstarter-funded and that attempts to mimic the features of something like Instagram, but with automatic posting to WordPress blogs, and a policy of NOT own or use your photos. By which I think they mean wanting to use them in any other way than for the purpose of running the PressGram &#8220;social network&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>While I&#8217;m not a hugely visual person, I like the idea of Instagram, but I don&#8217;t like the fact that it&#8217;s owned by Facebook (a service that I have a minimal presence on) and I don&#8217;t like what they might do with my photos; Facebooks terms allow your images to be used in adverts, for example. And, I believe, they don&#8217;t just have these permissions, but they actively do these kinds of things.<\/p>\n<p>You can read about PressGram in their <a title=\"About - PressGram\" href=\"http:\/\/blog.pressgr.am\/about\/\">about page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While I <em>kind-of<\/em> get the PressGram mission and objectives and I support the notion of an app like this, a few things have bothered me about it.<\/p>\n<h3>Understanding<\/h3>\n<p>I confess that I didn&#8217;t back PressGram on KickStarter because I didn&#8217;t quite understand what it did. \u00a0Was it just an app that published photos to WordPress and had nice filters? Or did it do something more?<\/p>\n<p>Now that PressGram is out (and has been around for a while), I understand that it&#8217;s a social network based around your photos, with discovery, liking, commenting, etc. \u00a0So it&#8217;s more than just an upload-to-WordPress app.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s also not clear where your photos end up. \u00a0Or why you&#8217;d need to publish them to WordPress if they&#8217;re also on the PressGram network.<\/p>\n<p>I think that what PressGram is, and why it&#8217;s needed, is proving hard to communicate succinctly. \u00a0I&#8217;d certainly struggle to be an advocate for it. I think it does too many things and is confusing as a result.<\/p>\n<h3>Terms<\/h3>\n<p>PressGram, and it&#8217;s creator, has a great goal in letting you maintain ownership, control, and page-views of\/for your content: your photos! \u00a0But, this is confused by its terms of service which grant PressGram &#8220;a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>This is pretty standard terminology and I guess it&#8217;s required for any service that is publishing your content on the web using an app. You MUST grant this right in order for something like PressGram to serve its most basic purposes. And the term is clarified as being &#8220;solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting your Content in the app&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>But this section of the terms jars a little when you&#8217;re signing up for a service that&#8217;s main selling point is that it lets you keep ownership of your content. I truly believe that they let you keep your content, and won&#8217;t sell it, or use it for any other purposes than making the app work, but the legal words they need to use to achieve that still give them great power.<\/p>\n<p>Plus: &#8220;Pressgram reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any part of this Agreement. It is your responsibility to check this Agreement periodically for changes.&#8221; For a service that prides itself on it&#8217;s legal rules, this also seems a little unfair.<\/p>\n<h3>Sustainability<\/h3>\n<p>I was surprised to find that PressGram didn&#8217;t use MY web hosting to display my images. \u00a0From what I gather they are first uploaded from the phone app to Amazon S3 cloud-based storage, and then from there to my WordPress blog(s). \u00a0And a copy is kept on the Amazon storage.<\/p>\n<p>This means that John Saddington, PressGram&#8217;s founder and creator, is paying to store all of the PressGram images on Amazon S3. \u00a0And that number of images will grow and grow over time. What I don&#8217;t understand is how PressGram will sustain itself. There&#8217;s talk of getting some kind of funding, and of in-app purchases. And John is aware of this business problem. But I&#8217;m not convinced that he&#8217;s solved it or got a sustainable business plan. I do find myself wondering if PressGram will last<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, John&#8217;s done a great job of building the app and the community &#8211; it&#8217;s a huge achievement and his heart is totally in the right place, and I&#8217;ll probably up my usage of the PressGram app because it&#8217;s a brilliant way to post simple images to this blog (look out for more photos!). But I not convinced, yet, about what PressGram is, why it&#8217;s needed, and how long it will last.<\/p>\n<p>Is anyone else using it? What do you think?<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<h2>Conversations about Code<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had a couple of great conversations lately about coding, languages and teaching people to code. \u00a0The latter conversation was on the back of <a title=\"CodeAcademy\" href=\"http:\/\/www.codecademy.com\/\">CodeAcademy<\/a> launching an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2013\/dec\/09\/codecademy-hour-of-code-iphone-app\">&#8220;Hour of Code&#8221; app<\/a> that aims to teach the basics of programming to anyone with a smartphone (iOS only at present, I believe, sorry!).<\/p>\n<p>Now, I actually think CodeAcademy is a great resource with a great mission: making learning to code easy! \u00a0But, I think CodeAcademy&#8217;s approach, and in particular, the focus on JavaScript (which is, in my opinion, a bad language to learn to code in), isn&#8217;t great. \u00a0And the app version has some serious flaws.<\/p>\n<p>(I&#8217;m keen to point out at this point that this is <em>opinion<\/em>, and that I have a particular, very formal background in software engineering on which those opinions are based. Other opinions may also be valid!)<\/p>\n<h2>Examples<\/h2>\n<p>To demonstrate these flaws, I had a conversation with someone older than me who&#8217;s done no coding. \u00a0I explained, in very basic terms, a particular aspect of why I dislike JavaScript as a language to learn to code. \u00a0It went something like this.<\/p>\n<p>In coding, there are different types of things. \u00a0There is the number 2, and there is the text representing the number 2.<\/p>\n<p>The number two is written like this:<\/p>\n<p>2<\/p>\n<p>This is actually a number.<\/p>\n<p>Here is another number:<\/p>\n<p>4<\/p>\n<p>You can do maths with numbers. \u00a0So you can add numbers together:<\/p>\n<p>2 + 4 = 6<\/p>\n<p>Now. \u00a0In most programming languages you can also write 2 with quotes around it, like this:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;2&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is not a number. \u00a0This is called a &#8220;string&#8221;. \u00a0<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Strings are just text &#8211; they can contain any symbols: letters, numbers, dollar signs, etc. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s like the old &#8220;Ceci n&#8217;est pas une pipe&#8221; thing. <a title=\"The Treachery of Images - Wikipedia\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Treachery_of_Images\">Magritte&#8217;s painting of a pipe<\/a>. \u00a0It&#8217;s not actually a pipe, it&#8217;s just a painting of a pipe. \u00a0This is not the number two, it&#8217;s a textual version of the number 2.<\/p>\n<p>We can have a string with a letter in:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;a&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Or we can have a string with several letters and\/or numbers:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;abc123&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And, conveniently, you can join strings together. \u00a0Oddly, in some languages, you use the + sign to do this:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;abc&#8221; + &#8220;123&#8221; = &#8220;abc123&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So. Let&#8217;s do some &#8220;addition&#8221; and see what we get.<\/p>\n<p>2 + 4 = 6<\/p>\n<p>but<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;2&#8221; + &#8220;4&#8221; = &#8220;24&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>remember these have quotes around them and so they are strings, not numbers. \u00a0+ joins them together, rather than adding them. \u00a0So we can also do:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;2&#8221; + &#8220;a&#8221; = &#8220;2a&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Hope you&#8217;re still with me.<\/p>\n<p>To the conundrum then. \u00a0What is this?:<\/p>\n<p>2 + &#8220;a&#8221; = ?<\/p>\n<p>When I put this to said older person who has no coding experience he said &#8220;It&#8217;s not allowed&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>And, in my opinion, he&#8217;s right. \u00a0This shouldn&#8217;t be allowed. It should print an error message and force you to correct it.<\/p>\n<p>There are other opinions. \u00a0Some would say that, clearly, this should be:<\/p>\n<p>2 + &#8220;a&#8221; = &#8220;2a&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In this case it&#8217;s assumed that the language will convert the number 2 from a number into a string and then do the joining.<\/p>\n<p>But assumptions are bad. \u00a0If you assume that then do you assume the same thing happens with two numbers?<\/p>\n<p>2 + 2 = &#8220;22&#8221; ?<\/p>\n<p>Clearly that&#8217;s an exaggeration, because it&#8217;s so simple. The intention there is clearly to do addition.<\/p>\n<p>But what about something even ever-so-slightly more complex like:<\/p>\n<p>2 + 2 + &#8220;a&#8221; =?<\/p>\n<p>Is this:<\/p>\n<p>2 + 2 + &#8220;a&#8221; = 4 + a = &#8220;4a&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>or<\/p>\n<p>2 + 2 + &#8220;a&#8221; = 2 + &#8220;2a&#8221; = &#8220;22a&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Note to coders: yes, we can learn something from trying this. We can learn type casting\/coercion, and we can learn operator precedence. My point is that we shouldn&#8217;t have to. \u00a0Code should be clear and meaningful, not ambiguous. \u00a0We should teach people to understand the code that they write, and it&#8217;s much easier to teach that if the code that they write is correct and meaningful.<\/p>\n<p>So it kind of pained me to see an ambiguous example of hugely ambiguous code in CodeAcademy&#8217;s app. \u00a0The image below is a screen shot:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-11-08.09.06.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1716\" alt=\"CodeAcademy App Bad Code\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-11-08.09.06-200x300.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-11-08.09.06-200x300.png 200w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-11-08.09.06.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the code (I&#8217;ve filled in the minus symbol that is the correct answer to the question):<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;var currentYear = 2013;&lt;\/span&gt;\r\n\r\nvar moonLandingYear = 1969;\r\n\r\nprint(&quot;The first landing was &quot; + currentYear - moonLandingYear + &quot; years ago&quot;);\r\n\r\n<\/pre>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">This has introduced an extra concept: the = sign is used to save a value. \u00a0So when you see &#8220;var currentYear = 2013&#8221; that means &#8220;store the value 2013 using the name currentYear&#8221;. \u00a0The code can then get the value 2013 back by asking for currentYear. Note that currentYear and moonLandingYear are numbers, not strings; they are 2013, not &#8220;2013&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now, this code example isn&#8217;t JavaScript, but it looks a lot like it. The question is, what gets printed? \u00a0What is the result of &#8220;adding&#8221; the combination of strings and numbers:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\n&quot;The first landing was &quot; + currentYear - moonLandingYear + &quot; years ago&quot;\r\n\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Option 1: Assume that the subtract is done first and the resulting number automatically converted to a string and joined with the rest<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\n&quot;The first landing was &quot; + currentYear - moonLandingYear + &quot; years ago&quot;\r\n\r\n=\u00a0&quot;The first landing was &quot; + 2013 - 1969 + &quot; years ago&quot;\r\n\r\n=\u00a0&quot;The first landing was &quot; + 44 + &quot; years ago&quot;\r\n\r\n=\u00a0&quot;The first landing was 44 years ago&quot;\r\n\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>This seems correct. But is it what the code actually does? \u00a0There&#8217;s another possible interpretation.<\/p>\n<p>Option 2: Assume that we process the + symbols from left to right (as you do in maths), converting numbers to strings as you go:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\n&quot;The first landing was &quot; + currentYear - moonLandingYear + &quot; years ago&quot;\r\n\r\n=\u00a0&quot;The first landing was &quot; + 2013 - 1969 + &quot; years ago&quot;\r\n\r\n=\u00a0&quot;The first landing was 2013&quot; - 1969 + &quot; years ago&quot; = ....?\r\n\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Oh.<\/p>\n<p>Hang on.<\/p>\n<p>We know that the plus sign joins two strings together. \u00a0But what does the minus sign do with a string?<\/p>\n<p>It turns out that not only is this a really bad code example. But if you convert it into actual JavaScript you don&#8217;t get the intended result. You get the rather odd output of &#8220;NaN years ago&#8221;. \u00a0This is because a string minus a number is a special thing called &#8220;Not a Number&#8221;, or &#8220;NaN&#8221; for short.<\/p>\n<p>Here it is in practice:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/jsfiddle.net\/8Xs4Q\/\">http:\/\/jsfiddle.net\/8Xs4Q\/<\/a>\u00a0&#8211; you can click the &#8220;Run&#8221; button at the top as many times as you like to run the code, which is in the bottom-left box, and see what gets printed in the pop-up box.<\/p>\n<h2>Why is this so bad?<\/h2>\n<p>Well, aside from the fact that CodeAcademy&#8217;s examples are broken&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>JavaScript is a neat, easy-to-use, very forgiving language. In some ways it&#8217;s ideal for learning to code because it&#8217;s installed on pretty much everyone&#8217;s PC as part of their web browser. \u00a0Just hit the F12 key, click &#8220;Console&#8221; and you can write JavaScript. And in the right hands it&#8217;s a very powerful language too. I don&#8217;t deny these things.<\/p>\n<p>But!&#8230;it&#8217;s SO easy to write the wrong code in JavaScript. It doesn&#8217;t tell you when you&#8217;ve made a basic error. \u00a0YES, yes you CAN learn by making mistakes and finding out what you did wrong. But is it not better to teach people not to make those mistakes in the first place? \u00a0To use a language that points out your mistakes clearly rather than one which makes assumptions about what you mean and carries on regardless?<\/p>\n<p>Code should be easy to understand, it should communicate the correct meaning to both the computer AND the reader. \u00a0The reader shouldn&#8217;t need a detailed understanding of operator precedence and type coercion to understand what&#8217;s going on in their first ever hour of coding.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not a perfect coder &#8211; no one is. I don&#8217;t do all the things in code that I think people should do all the time. But real-world projects have contraints that mean sometimes you have to work a bit quicker, deliver something to a deadline or budget.<\/p>\n<p>But I do think we should <em>teach<\/em> people to write code that&#8217;s meaningful and understandable. We should teach people to write code where it&#8217;s clear what the code does, not dependant on assumptions about the language or some deeper understanding. \u00a0It&#8217;s my opinion that neither JavaScript nor CodeAcademy&#8217;s new app are good tools for doing that. \u00a0Which is a shame, because I LOVE the CodeAcademy concept. Heck, if you&#8217;re interested in learning to code, it&#8217;s better than anywhere else to get self-taught. \u00a0Ignore my ranting and <a href=\"http:\/\/codeacademy.com\" target=\"_blank\">go and do something&#8230;errr&#8230;interesting<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Dr. Kelso: Sweetheart, I think you&#039;re confusing interesting with boring.\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/L4p-Osvw3sQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h2>Conversations about Code<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had a couple of great conversations lately about coding, languages and teaching people to code. \u00a0The latter conversation was on the back of <a title=\"CodeAcademy\" href=\"http:\/\/www.codecademy.com\/\">CodeAcademy<\/a> launching an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2013\/dec\/09\/codecademy-hour-of-code-iphone-app\">&#8220;Hour of Code&#8221; app<\/a> that aims to teach the basics of programming to anyone with a smartphone (iOS only at present, I believe, sorry!).<\/p>\n<p>Now, I actually think CodeAcademy is a great resource with a great mission: making learning to code easy! \u00a0But, I think CodeAcademy&#8217;s approach, and in particular, the focus on JavaScript (which is, in my opinion, a bad language to learn to code in), isn&#8217;t great. \u00a0And the app version has some serious flaws.<\/p>\n<p>(I&#8217;m keen to point out at this point that this is <em>opinion<\/em>, and that I have a particular, very formal background in software engineering on which those opinions are based. Other opinions may also be valid!)<\/p>\n<h2>Examples<\/h2>\n<p>To demonstrate these flaws, I had a conversation with someone older than me who&#8217;s done no coding. \u00a0I explained, in very basic terms, a particular aspect of why I dislike JavaScript as a language to learn to code. \u00a0It went something like this.<\/p>\n<p>In coding, there are different types of things. \u00a0There is the number 2, and there is the text representing the number 2.<\/p>\n<p>The number two is written like this:<\/p>\n<p>2<\/p>\n<p>This is actually a number.<\/p>\n<p>Here is another number:<\/p>\n<p>4<\/p>\n<p>You can do maths with numbers. \u00a0So you can add numbers together:<\/p>\n<p>2 + 4 = 6<\/p>\n<p>Now. \u00a0In most programming languages you can also write 2 with quotes around it, like this:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;2&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is not a number. \u00a0This is called a &#8220;string&#8221;. \u00a0<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Strings are just text &#8211; they can contain any symbols: letters, numbers, dollar signs, etc. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s like the old &#8220;Ceci n&#8217;est pas une pipe&#8221; thing. <a title=\"The Treachery of Images - Wikipedia\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Treachery_of_Images\">Magritte&#8217;s painting of a pipe<\/a>. \u00a0It&#8217;s not actually a pipe, it&#8217;s just a painting of a pipe. \u00a0This is not the number two, it&#8217;s a textual version of the number 2.<\/p>\n<p>We can have a string with a letter in:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;a&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Or we can have a string with several letters and\/or numbers:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;abc123&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And, conveniently, you can join strings together. \u00a0Oddly, in some languages, you use the + sign to do this:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;abc&#8221; + &#8220;123&#8221; = &#8220;abc123&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So. Let&#8217;s do some &#8220;addition&#8221; and see what we get.<\/p>\n<p>2 + 4 = 6<\/p>\n<p>but<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;2&#8221; + &#8220;4&#8221; = &#8220;24&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>remember these have quotes around them and so they are strings, not numbers. \u00a0+ joins them together, rather than adding them. \u00a0So we can also do:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;2&#8221; + &#8220;a&#8221; = &#8220;2a&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Hope you&#8217;re still with me.<\/p>\n<p>To the conundrum then. \u00a0What is this?:<\/p>\n<p>2 + &#8220;a&#8221; = ?<\/p>\n<p>When I put this to said older person who has no coding experience he said &#8220;It&#8217;s not allowed&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>And, in my opinion, he&#8217;s right. \u00a0This shouldn&#8217;t be allowed. It should print an error message and force you to correct it.<\/p>\n<p>There are other opinions. \u00a0Some would say that, clearly, this should be:<\/p>\n<p>2 + &#8220;a&#8221; = &#8220;2a&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In this case it&#8217;s assumed that the language will convert the number 2 from a number into a string and then do the joining.<\/p>\n<p>But assumptions are bad. \u00a0If you assume that then do you assume the same thing happens with two numbers?<\/p>\n<p>2 + 2 = &#8220;22&#8221; ?<\/p>\n<p>Clearly that&#8217;s an exaggeration, because it&#8217;s so simple. The intention there is clearly to do addition.<\/p>\n<p>But what about something even ever-so-slightly more complex like:<\/p>\n<p>2 + 2 + &#8220;a&#8221; =?<\/p>\n<p>Is this:<\/p>\n<p>2 + 2 + &#8220;a&#8221; = 4 + a = &#8220;4a&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>or<\/p>\n<p>2 + 2 + &#8220;a&#8221; = 2 + &#8220;2a&#8221; = &#8220;22a&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Note to coders: yes, we can learn something from trying this. We can learn type casting\/coercion, and we can learn operator precedence. My point is that we shouldn&#8217;t have to. \u00a0Code should be clear and meaningful, not ambiguous. \u00a0We should teach people to understand the code that they write, and it&#8217;s much easier to teach that if the code that they write is correct and meaningful.<\/p>\n<p>So it kind of pained me to see an ambiguous example of hugely ambiguous code in CodeAcademy&#8217;s app. \u00a0The image below is a screen shot:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-11-08.09.06.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1716\" alt=\"CodeAcademy App Bad Code\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-11-08.09.06-200x300.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-11-08.09.06-200x300.png 200w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/2013-12-11-08.09.06.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the code (I&#8217;ve filled in the minus symbol that is the correct answer to the question):<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5;&quot;&gt;var currentYear = 2013;&lt;\/span&gt;\r\n\r\nvar moonLandingYear = 1969;\r\n\r\nprint(&quot;The first landing was &quot; + currentYear - moonLandingYear + &quot; years ago&quot;);\r\n\r\n<\/pre>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">This has introduced an extra concept: the = sign is used to save a value. \u00a0So when you see &#8220;var currentYear = 2013&#8221; that means &#8220;store the value 2013 using the name currentYear&#8221;. \u00a0The code can then get the value 2013 back by asking for currentYear. Note that currentYear and moonLandingYear are numbers, not strings; they are 2013, not &#8220;2013&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now, this code example isn&#8217;t JavaScript, but it looks a lot like it. The question is, what gets printed? \u00a0What is the result of &#8220;adding&#8221; the combination of strings and numbers:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\n&quot;The first landing was &quot; + currentYear - moonLandingYear + &quot; years ago&quot;\r\n\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Option 1: Assume that the subtract is done first and the resulting number automatically converted to a string and joined with the rest<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\n&quot;The first landing was &quot; + currentYear - moonLandingYear + &quot; years ago&quot;\r\n\r\n=\u00a0&quot;The first landing was &quot; + 2013 - 1969 + &quot; years ago&quot;\r\n\r\n=\u00a0&quot;The first landing was &quot; + 44 + &quot; years ago&quot;\r\n\r\n=\u00a0&quot;The first landing was 44 years ago&quot;\r\n\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>This seems correct. But is it what the code actually does? \u00a0There&#8217;s another possible interpretation.<\/p>\n<p>Option 2: Assume that we process the + symbols from left to right (as you do in maths), converting numbers to strings as you go:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: plain; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n\r\n&quot;The first landing was &quot; + currentYear - moonLandingYear + &quot; years ago&quot;\r\n\r\n=\u00a0&quot;The first landing was &quot; + 2013 - 1969 + &quot; years ago&quot;\r\n\r\n=\u00a0&quot;The first landing was 2013&quot; - 1969 + &quot; years ago&quot; = ....?\r\n\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Oh.<\/p>\n<p>Hang on.<\/p>\n<p>We know that the plus sign joins two strings together. \u00a0But what does the minus sign do with a string?<\/p>\n<p>It turns out that not only is this a really bad code example. But if you convert it into actual JavaScript you don&#8217;t get the intended result. You get the rather odd output of &#8220;NaN years ago&#8221;. \u00a0This is because a string minus a number is a special thing called &#8220;Not a Number&#8221;, or &#8220;NaN&#8221; for short.<\/p>\n<p>Here it is in practice:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/jsfiddle.net\/8Xs4Q\/\">http:\/\/jsfiddle.net\/8Xs4Q\/<\/a>\u00a0&#8211; you can click the &#8220;Run&#8221; button at the top as many times as you like to run the code, which is in the bottom-left box, and see what gets printed in the pop-up box.<\/p>\n<h2>Why is this so bad?<\/h2>\n<p>Well, aside from the fact that CodeAcademy&#8217;s examples are broken&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>JavaScript is a neat, easy-to-use, very forgiving language. In some ways it&#8217;s ideal for learning to code because it&#8217;s installed on pretty much everyone&#8217;s PC as part of their web browser. \u00a0Just hit the F12 key, click &#8220;Console&#8221; and you can write JavaScript. And in the right hands it&#8217;s a very powerful language too. I don&#8217;t deny these things.<\/p>\n<p>But!&#8230;it&#8217;s SO easy to write the wrong code in JavaScript. It doesn&#8217;t tell you when you&#8217;ve made a basic error. \u00a0YES, yes you CAN learn by making mistakes and finding out what you did wrong. But is it not better to teach people not to make those mistakes in the first place? \u00a0To use a language that points out your mistakes clearly rather than one which makes assumptions about what you mean and carries on regardless?<\/p>\n<p>Code should be easy to understand, it should communicate the correct meaning to both the computer AND the reader. \u00a0The reader shouldn&#8217;t need a detailed understanding of operator precedence and type coercion to understand what&#8217;s going on in their first ever hour of coding.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not a perfect coder &#8211; no one is. I don&#8217;t do all the things in code that I think people should do all the time. But real-world projects have contraints that mean sometimes you have to work a bit quicker, deliver something to a deadline or budget.<\/p>\n<p>But I do think we should <em>teach<\/em> people to write code that&#8217;s meaningful and understandable. We should teach people to write code where it&#8217;s clear what the code does, not dependant on assumptions about the language or some deeper understanding. \u00a0It&#8217;s my opinion that neither JavaScript nor CodeAcademy&#8217;s new app are good tools for doing that. \u00a0Which is a shame, because I LOVE the CodeAcademy concept. Heck, if you&#8217;re interested in learning to code, it&#8217;s better than anywhere else to get self-taught. \u00a0Ignore my ranting and <a href=\"http:\/\/codeacademy.com\" target=\"_blank\">go and do something&#8230;errr&#8230;interesting<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Dr. Kelso: Sweetheart, I think you&#039;re confusing interesting with boring.\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/L4p-Osvw3sQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>I engaged with the Foodbanks debate on social media a little the other week. I wanted to say a couple of things that are slightly too long for a tweet on the topic.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing I read was lots of statuses from people denouncing their MPs for not voting to investigate the increased use of Foodbanks. I had seen that my MP was on the list of \u2018no\u2019 voters, but before criticising him I wanted to be sure of what I was criticising him for. So I looked up the motion.<\/p>\n<p>Most of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.theyworkforyou.com\/debates\/?id=2013-12-18b.806.0&amp;s=Foodbanks#g806.2\">the motion<\/a>\u00a0was great. I heartily agreed with it. But the final part is basically a shopping list of Labour policies. The Tories would never vote for this. In fact, I wonder if the motion was deliberately constructed to make the Tories vote no.<\/p>\n<p>Such a political strategy seems pretty self-defeating to me. It may make the Tories look nasty, but it achieves nothing for the good of the country.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong. I think this is an important issue and I want to see it investigated, and I think the Conservatives\u2019 behaviour during the debate, if reported accurately, was disgraceful. But I don\u2019t think that the motion put forward achieved much other than political posturing.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth reading about the nature of the \u2018<a href=\"http:\/\/neilbrighton.typepad.com\/distinct_reflections\/2013\/12\/politics-of-foodbanksdebate.html\">Opposition day debate<\/a>\u2019<\/p>\n<p>The second thing is that\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/politics\/2013\/dec\/21\/iain-duncan-smith-food-banks-charities\">this article<\/a>\u00a0infuriates me.<\/p>\n<p>It claims that Iain Duncan Smith refused to meet with the Trussell Trust, the organisation that supports most of the UKs Foodbanks because he thinks that they are political and looking for publicity. There\u2019s also people saying that the increase in foodbank use is simply because more foodbanks exist.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s address that latter point first. Even if it is true, we\u2019re still left with the fact that 600,000 people have needed food from a foodbank. It\u2019s this not an appalling number? Should we not be finding out why this is and doing something about it?<\/p>\n<p>The Trussell Trust then. I\u2019ve had a quite long work meeting with the Trussell Trust. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m actually allowed to say that, but I did. And here are my impressions of them:<\/p>\n<p><em>It should be noted that these are purely my opinions of them based on that meeting rather than any official position that they&#8217;ve taken.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>They are one of the most humble and least political and publicity-seeking organisations I\u2019ve come across. It appears to me that they would rather they weren\u2019t growing. They would probably rather they didn\u2019t exist at all. They are, from what I can tell, a-political; supporting no one party. They have some interesting statistics that may help governments analyse poverty and the effects of political decisions. But they are not affiliated with a party or \u2018side\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>I, personally, think that IDS is stupid not to want to meet with them and I\u2019m pretty angry that he\u2019s referred to them in this way.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I engaged with the Foodbanks debate on social media a little the other week. I wanted to say a couple of things that are slightly too long for a tweet on the topic.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing I read was lots of statuses from people denouncing their MPs for not voting to investigate the increased use of Foodbanks. I had seen that my MP was on the list of \u2018no\u2019 voters, but before criticising him I wanted to be sure of what I was criticising him for. So I looked up the motion.<\/p>\n<p>Most of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.theyworkforyou.com\/debates\/?id=2013-12-18b.806.0&amp;s=Foodbanks#g806.2\">the motion<\/a>\u00a0was great. I heartily agreed with it. But the final part is basically a shopping list of Labour policies. The Tories would never vote for this. In fact, I wonder if the motion was deliberately constructed to make the Tories vote no.<\/p>\n<p>Such a political strategy seems pretty self-defeating to me. It may make the Tories look nasty, but it achieves nothing for the good of the country.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong. I think this is an important issue and I want to see it investigated, and I think the Conservatives\u2019 behaviour during the debate, if reported accurately, was disgraceful. But I don\u2019t think that the motion put forward achieved much other than political posturing.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth reading about the nature of the \u2018<a href=\"http:\/\/neilbrighton.typepad.com\/distinct_reflections\/2013\/12\/politics-of-foodbanksdebate.html\">Opposition day debate<\/a>\u2019<\/p>\n<p>The second thing is that\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/politics\/2013\/dec\/21\/iain-duncan-smith-food-banks-charities\">this article<\/a>\u00a0infuriates me.<\/p>\n<p>It claims that Iain Duncan Smith refused to meet with the Trussell Trust, the organisation that supports most of the UKs Foodbanks because he thinks that they are political and looking for publicity. There\u2019s also people saying that the increase in foodbank use is simply because more foodbanks exist.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s address that latter point first. Even if it is true, we\u2019re still left with the fact that 600,000 people have needed food from a foodbank. It\u2019s this not an appalling number? Should we not be finding out why this is and doing something about it?<\/p>\n<p>The Trussell Trust then. I\u2019ve had a quite long work meeting with the Trussell Trust. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m actually allowed to say that, but I did. And here are my impressions of them:<\/p>\n<p><em>It should be noted that these are purely my opinions of them based on that meeting rather than any official position that they&#8217;ve taken.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>They are one of the most humble and least political and publicity-seeking organisations I\u2019ve come across. It appears to me that they would rather they weren\u2019t growing. They would probably rather they didn\u2019t exist at all. They are, from what I can tell, a-political; supporting no one party. They have some interesting statistics that may help governments analyse poverty and the effects of political decisions. But they are not affiliated with a party or \u2018side\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>I, personally, think that IDS is stupid not to want to meet with them and I\u2019m pretty angry that he\u2019s referred to them in this way.<\/p>\n",

Perhaps you should just feel fortunate that I am a person that genuinely tries to engage with the political process.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, Sally and I had an interesting conversation about the fact that The House of Lords seem to be being pretty useful at the moment. Not only are some peers\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-25671064\">getting something done<\/a>\u00a0about the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-24823829\">rubbish lobbying bill<\/a>, but they&#8217;ve also made the entirely sensible decision that\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-25648019\">it shouldn&#8217;t be against the law to be &#8220;annoying&#8221;<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>We were then discussing our dismay with the political process and the fact that it seems to be the House of Lords that are doing the sensible things right now. (Yes, I am well aware that these are just two of a multitude of things that will be passing through the Lords at the moment, I know). And we wondered whether the fact that they were unelected, and therefore not needing to engage in populist politics needed to secure their positions, that they are more likely to do things that are good for the people at large, and in the longer term.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, as @timalmond points out on Twitter:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-cards=\"hidden\" data-partner=\"tweetdeck\">\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\">@magicroundabout<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Anjelica1956\">@Anjelica1956<\/a> But unelected people also have undemocratic power that they can abuse against the people.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Tim Almond (@timalmond) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/timalmond\/statuses\/422006729786683392\">January 11, 2014<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>And he&#8217;s dead right. I&#8217;m not suggesting that a wholly unelected and undemocratic system would work either. But, I don&#8217;t know, it just seems to be bringing some sensibility to proceedings of late!<\/p>\n",

Perhaps you should just feel fortunate that I am a person that genuinely tries to engage with the political process.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, Sally and I had an interesting conversation about the fact that The House of Lords seem to be being pretty useful at the moment. Not only are some peers\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-25671064\">getting something done<\/a>\u00a0about the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-24823829\">rubbish lobbying bill<\/a>, but they&#8217;ve also made the entirely sensible decision that\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-25648019\">it shouldn&#8217;t be against the law to be &#8220;annoying&#8221;<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>We were then discussing our dismay with the political process and the fact that it seems to be the House of Lords that are doing the sensible things right now. (Yes, I am well aware that these are just two of a multitude of things that will be passing through the Lords at the moment, I know). And we wondered whether the fact that they were unelected, and therefore not needing to engage in populist politics needed to secure their positions, that they are more likely to do things that are good for the people at large, and in the longer term.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, as @timalmond points out on Twitter:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-cards=\"hidden\" data-partner=\"tweetdeck\">\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\">@magicroundabout<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Anjelica1956\">@Anjelica1956<\/a> But unelected people also have undemocratic power that they can abuse against the people.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Tim Almond (@timalmond) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/timalmond\/statuses\/422006729786683392\">January 11, 2014<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>And he&#8217;s dead right. I&#8217;m not suggesting that a wholly unelected and undemocratic system would work either. But, I don&#8217;t know, it just seems to be bringing some sensibility to proceedings of late!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>OK. Really old. And REALLY boring now. Oh, and brief disclaimer:\u00a0<em>Heck, what do I know? I&#8217;m not a politician, economist, climate scientist, or anything, I&#8217;m just a guy with a few half-baked ideas<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Labour. Well, let&#8217;s really start with the Conservatives. I&#8217;m not a fan really. Austerity possibly has some merits as a means of fixing the economy. But their constant anti-Robin-Hood, take-from-the-poor-and-give-to-the-rich kind of policies, and the constant bashing of those on benefits without understand those on benefits, is pretty shocking.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, some big Labour politicians came to Swindon today. And all I could really see (on Twitter) them talking about was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/swindonlabour\/status\/421976523688919040\">the price of energy<\/a>, and the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dempsey4labour\/status\/421945129029865472\">price of train fares<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a bit baffled by the energy thing. Energy seems to be provided by a load of companies who compete against one another for customers. And yet, they all seem to raise prices at the same times. Which seems odd. And no one really seems to be doing the under-cutting. They&#8217;re all much of a much-ness, and their prices seem to mostly be influenced by the wholesale cost of energy and the taxes and levies imposed by government. They may well make lots of profit, and that&#8217;s not great from companies that provide public services. I&#8217;m as annoyed as anyone about increasing energy company profits. But that&#8217;s what companies do.<\/p>\n<p>My question then is HOW will Labour go about freezing energy prices. Energy prices are controlled by business, not by government.<\/p>\n<p>I visited their website to find out and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/action.labour.org.uk\/page\/s\/energy-calculator\">it wasn&#8217;t massively helpful<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And anyway. There are problems with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I think global warming is real and that we should be cutting energy costs. If prices go down in real terms then won&#8217;t that discourage us from saving energy?<\/li>\n<li>I think that energy security is a much bigger issue. The cost is irrelevant if there is no supply.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;d much rather see a long-term focus on sustainability, efficiency and reduced use, and energy-security. We&#8217;d have much better control of energy prices in this country if we used less of it, and had our own clean, efficient supply with a surplus we could export. That would be good for health, prices, industry, transport, and the world at large.<\/p>\n<p>Magically fixing train fares and energy costs seem to me to be populist electioneering policies. There are bigger things we need to do that will help both of these issues in the long term. Who&#8217;s going to tackle those things for us?!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>OK. Really old. And REALLY boring now. Oh, and brief disclaimer:\u00a0<em>Heck, what do I know? I&#8217;m not a politician, economist, climate scientist, or anything, I&#8217;m just a guy with a few half-baked ideas<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Labour. Well, let&#8217;s really start with the Conservatives. I&#8217;m not a fan really. Austerity possibly has some merits as a means of fixing the economy. But their constant anti-Robin-Hood, take-from-the-poor-and-give-to-the-rich kind of policies, and the constant bashing of those on benefits without understand those on benefits, is pretty shocking.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, some big Labour politicians came to Swindon today. And all I could really see (on Twitter) them talking about was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/swindonlabour\/status\/421976523688919040\">the price of energy<\/a>, and the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dempsey4labour\/status\/421945129029865472\">price of train fares<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a bit baffled by the energy thing. Energy seems to be provided by a load of companies who compete against one another for customers. And yet, they all seem to raise prices at the same times. Which seems odd. And no one really seems to be doing the under-cutting. They&#8217;re all much of a much-ness, and their prices seem to mostly be influenced by the wholesale cost of energy and the taxes and levies imposed by government. They may well make lots of profit, and that&#8217;s not great from companies that provide public services. I&#8217;m as annoyed as anyone about increasing energy company profits. But that&#8217;s what companies do.<\/p>\n<p>My question then is HOW will Labour go about freezing energy prices. Energy prices are controlled by business, not by government.<\/p>\n<p>I visited their website to find out and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/action.labour.org.uk\/page\/s\/energy-calculator\">it wasn&#8217;t massively helpful<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And anyway. There are problems with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I think global warming is real and that we should be cutting energy costs. If prices go down in real terms then won&#8217;t that discourage us from saving energy?<\/li>\n<li>I think that energy security is a much bigger issue. The cost is irrelevant if there is no supply.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;d much rather see a long-term focus on sustainability, efficiency and reduced use, and energy-security. We&#8217;d have much better control of energy prices in this country if we used less of it, and had our own clean, efficient supply with a surplus we could export. That would be good for health, prices, industry, transport, and the world at large.<\/p>\n<p>Magically fixing train fares and energy costs seem to me to be populist electioneering policies. There are bigger things we need to do that will help both of these issues in the long term. Who&#8217;s going to tackle those things for us?!<\/p>\n",
