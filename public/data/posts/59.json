But it has been a revelation to me that it\u2019s possible for people to just breeze through life ignoring how that thing is made, or why that thing doesn\u2019t comply with the rules, or the fact that that apostrophe isn\u2019t in the right place, or what others might think of what they do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week I have been struggling with a company who do important legal and regulatory stuff for Oikos. I will not name names, and I will not list the catalogue of small errors that have beset the process. But I really do find myself wondering how you get into this kind of field without having a high level of attention to detail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, forgive me if I\u2019m a bit slow sometimes with my work. It sometimes means I\u2019m trying to do something right. Because I\u2019d rather be right than fast.<br\/><\/p>\n",

But it has been a revelation to me that it\u2019s possible for people to just breeze through life ignoring how that thing is made, or why that thing doesn\u2019t comply with the rules, or the fact that that apostrophe isn\u2019t in the right place, or what others might think of what they do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week I have been struggling with a company who do important legal and regulatory stuff for Oikos. I will not name names, and I will not list the catalogue of small errors that have beset the process. But I really do find myself wondering how you get into this kind of field without having a high level of attention to detail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, forgive me if I\u2019m a bit slow sometimes with my work.

And I find a lot of it hard to consume because of the realities of living with small children around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some things that are hard to do when you have small children and are relatively dedicated to helping bring them up:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Wake when your body wants to, or at a correct point in the sleep cycle for waking up nicely<\/li><li>Get a full, uninterrupted night\u2019s sleep<\/li><li>Adopt a consistent morning routine<\/li><li>Adopt a consistent evening routine<\/li><li>Work from home without interruption (unless you have a dedicated space, which even then <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/m3ktsl6_Rpg\">can be invaded<\/a>!)<\/li><li>Have a relaxing holiday<\/li><li>Meditate, pray or do exercise in the home on a regular basis and without a child coming along and asking \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d or \u201cMe have a go?\u201d, jumping on you, pushing you over, making you laugh or otherwise getting in the way<\/li><li>Binge watch anything, or commit to watching anything on TV on a regular basis that isn\u2019t Hey Duggee or The Octonauts<\/li><li>Plan your life to anything like a daily or sub-daily level for any great length of time<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, some of these things can be hugely joyful. Having a 2.5 year old try to join in your yoga or exercise is hilarious. \u00a0And I <del>secretly<\/del> openly love Hey Duggee &#8211; it bright, colourful, happy, charming and so much better than loads of other stuff on TV.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yes, some other far-more-organised parents than I manage to do lots of these things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But gosh it\u2019s hard seeing what others are able to do, or recommend you do, to improve your life when you\u2019re so busy improving the lives of other little people that depend on you.<\/p>\n",

So I guess I should write about what I do!<\/p>\n<p>Some of my bio\u2019s and \u201cAbout\u201d pages are a bit out of date &#8211; I must remedy that. For now, here\u2019s some of the things I\u2019m up to right now.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #23282d; font-size: 1.6em; font-weight: 600;\">Technology<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a software developer who happens to mostly build websites and web applications, because that\u2019s where I can make money making software on a freelance basis in the sector I want to work in. I\u2019d love to do more back-end, data processing, and general coding stuff really.<\/p>\n<p>I mostly develop with WordPress, but also use Laravel and \u00a0other PHP things. WordPress knowledge is pretty deep, and I do some highly technical projects with lots of data wrangling and custom user interface. But I also build small sites for small organisations using page builders.<\/p>\n<p>(Note to page-builder-haters: Yes, really I do! It\u2019s the pragmatic choice for smaller budgets.)<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m proficient in a whole load of the back-end web stack from how CPUs work, through language compilation and execution, right up to server operations and how HTTP works. Though some knowledge will be old and there are some holes in knowledge in some places&#8230;it\u2019s a broad field.<\/p>\n<p>I know JavaScript reasonably well but don\u2019t like it and struggle to see how you would build any significant back-end application with it &#8211; but I know people do! I\u2019ve been trying to #learnToLoveJS, but it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s not my kind of language at all.<\/p>\n<p>I prefer functional, declarative and typed languages. I prefer a language to tell me I got something wrong than to guess what I meant. But also, I never got to running JS as a process outside the browser, so I\u2019m still mostly using it for DOM manipulation in the browser, and stepping it up to doing node.js seems like a big jump to me.<\/p>\n<p>I have a MacBook and an iPhone, but these are tools and I\u2019m not wedded to either of them.<\/p>\n<h2>Work and business<\/h2>\n<p>I run my own company to do my software development, but I also work with groups of other freelancers on larger projects.<\/p>\n<p>Though highly technical, I love working with people and using technology to solve people\u2019s problems.<\/p>\n<p>I do some amount of user interface and user experience work, but I\u2019m not a visual designer and those kinds of \u00a0artistic flourishes are out-sourced.<\/p>\n<p>I care about my work and business a lot, but I\u2019m not set on growth. I have a good flow of work, mostly through recommendations and referrals. It\u2019s a mildly-profitable, bootstrapped business, not a hard-and-fast startup.<\/p>\n<h2>On the side<\/h2>\n<p>I sometimes learn new tech, or practice existing tech, by building small side projects. I have a few of these on the go at any one time. My current focusses are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/about-kownter\/\">Kownter<\/a>: Simple, self-hosted, privacy aware analytics<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/08\/about-schoolbot\/\">SchoolBot<\/a>: a parent information system that started as a chatbot, but will hopefully become more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Life<\/h2>\n<p>I have a wife and two small children; I work flexibly to look after the kids and life mostly revolves around them. I love to cycle &#8211; though I\u2019m mostly just commuting at the moment. We have a large-ish garden that we try to grow stuff in, and we are part of a small local church.<\/p>\n<p>Its a pretty busy life. More on the specifics soon!<\/p>\n",

So I guess I should write about what I do!<\/p>\n<p>Some of my bio\u2019s and \u201cAbout\u201d pages are a bit out of date &#8211; I must remedy that. For now, here\u2019s some of the things I\u2019m up to right now.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #23282d; font-size: 1.6em; font-weight: 600;\">Technology<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a software developer who happens to mostly build websites and web applications, because that\u2019s where I can make money making software on a freelance basis in the sector I want to work in. I\u2019d love to do more back-end, data processing, and general coding stuff really.<\/p>\n<p>I mostly develop with WordPress, but also use Laravel and \u00a0other PHP things. WordPress knowledge is pretty deep, and I do some highly technical projects with lots of data wrangling and custom user interface. But I also build small sites for small organisations using page builders.<\/p>\n<p>(Note to page-builder-haters: Yes, really I do! It\u2019s the pragmatic choice for smaller budgets.)<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m proficient in a whole load of the back-end web stack from how CPUs work, through language compilation and execution, right up to server operations and how HTTP works. Though some knowledge will be old and there are some holes in knowledge in some places&#8230;it\u2019s a broad field.<\/p>\n<p>I know JavaScript reasonably well but don\u2019t like it and struggle to see how you would build any significant back-end application with it &#8211; but I know people do! I\u2019ve been trying to #learnToLoveJS, but it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s not my kind of language at all.<\/p>\n<p>I prefer functional, declarative and typed languages. I prefer a language to tell me I got something wrong than to guess what I meant. But also, I never got to running JS as a process outside the browser, so I\u2019m still mostly using it for DOM manipulation in the browser, and stepping it up to doing node.js seems like a big jump to me.<\/p>\n<p>I have a MacBook and an iPhone, but these are tools and I\u2019m not wedded to either of them.<\/p>\n<h2>Work and business<\/h2>\n<p>I run my own company to do my software development, but I also work with groups of other freelancers on larger projects.<\/p>\n<p>Though highly technical, I love working with people and using technology to solve people\u2019s problems.<\/p>\n<p>I do some amount of user interface and user experience work, but I\u2019m not a visual designer and those kinds of \u00a0artistic flourishes are out-sourced.<\/p>\n<p>I care about my work and business a lot, but I\u2019m not set on growth. I have a good flow of work, mostly through recommendations and referrals. It\u2019s a mildly-profitable, bootstrapped business, not a hard-and-fast startup.<\/p>\n<h2>On the side<\/h2>\n<p>I sometimes learn new tech, or practice existing tech, by building small side projects. I have a few of these on the go at any one time. My current focusses are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/about-kownter\/\">Kownter<\/a>: Simple, self-hosted, privacy aware analytics<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/08\/about-schoolbot\/\">SchoolBot<\/a>: a parent information system that started as a chatbot, but will hopefully become more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Life<\/h2>\n<p>I have a wife and two small children; I work flexibly to look after the kids and life mostly revolves around them. I love to cycle &#8211; though I\u2019m mostly just commuting at the moment. We have a large-ish garden that we try to grow stuff in, and we are part of a small local church.<\/p>\n<p>Its a pretty busy life. More on the specifics soon!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<h3>Because some things on the internet are inexplicably hard to do<\/h3>\n<p>Gosh, what a frustrating afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>This is a case of knowing the individual parts of a task pretty well, but not having put all the parts together in this particular way before.<\/p>\n<p>Today I needed\/wanted to create a simple email sign-up\/opt-in form with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The excellent Elegant Themes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elegantthemes.com\/plugins\/bloom\/\">Bloom email sign-up plugin<\/a>\u00a0(though it could have been pretty much any email sign-up plugin)<\/li>\n<li>A regular MailChimp List<\/li>\n<li>MailChimp groups<\/li>\n<li>MailChimp&#8217;s new GDPR fields<\/li>\n<li>and when I got stuck, <a href=\"http:\/\/wpforms.com\/\">WPForms<\/a> too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I reckon I&#8217;ve combined two of these things together in several different combinations. And I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve done one specific combination of three of them. But never more than that.<\/p>\n<p>And I needed at least four of them. And the GDPR fields in MailChimp are new and, well, let&#8217;s say they seem to have been shoe-horned in in a bit of a hurry.<\/p>\n<p>Now&#8230;let&#8217;s go down the rabbit hole&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Bloom integrates with regular MailChimp, but won&#8217;t let you use groups.\u00a0 To do that you need to use a &#8220;custom HTML form&#8221; in the Bloom opt-in which you copy and paste from MailChimp&#8217;s embedded forms section.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with that is that in a pop-up (we have a good case for using a pop-up, it&#8217;s OK!) is that the GDPR text and fields make the form really long and it won&#8217;t fit nicely on a smaller screen.<\/p>\n<p>So I tried reducing the form to just an email input and a button, and then sending that input to a WPForms form using a URL parameter to autocomplete the email field on the &#8220;full&#8221; form. Great! That works really nicely.<\/p>\n<p>Only&#8230;WPForms doesn&#8217;t send the GDPR opt-in fields. Rats! I assume Gravity Forms won&#8217;t do this either.<\/p>\n<p>So maybe, rather than linking the Bloom opt-in to an on-site form, I&#8217;ll link it to an off-site form. That will work!<\/p>\n<p>Only, I want the subscriber to sign up to a specific group, and it turns out that <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/help\/automatically-add-subscribers-to-a-group-at-signup\/\">you sort-of can&#8217;t have a pre-selected group on MailChimps own, hosted forms<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So what am I left with? Taking a MailChimp embedded form, sticking it in a WordPress page, editing the HTML of the form to make the required group pre-selected and hiding the group selection from the user and linking my Bloom pop-up to that page.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s pretty gross. But it does work.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m hoping that at some point MailChimp&#8217;s API will work nicer with the GDPR fields. It seems to have the ability to send &#8220;marketing_permissions&#8221; with a new subscriber, but it&#8217;s not clear how you get the ID&#8217;s needed to send. When this does work nicely, hopefully WPForms or Bloom or Gravity Forms will integrate with it and let me do this properly.<\/p>\n<p>For now&#8230;making a simple form requires a humongous kludge.<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to the internet, everybody!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h3>Because some things on the internet are inexplicably hard to do<\/h3>\n<p>Gosh, what a frustrating afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>This is a case of knowing the individual parts of a task pretty well, but not having put all the parts together in this particular way before.<\/p>\n<p>Today I needed\/wanted to create a simple email sign-up\/opt-in form with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The excellent Elegant Themes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elegantthemes.com\/plugins\/bloom\/\">Bloom email sign-up plugin<\/a>\u00a0(though it could have been pretty much any email sign-up plugin)<\/li>\n<li>A regular MailChimp List<\/li>\n<li>MailChimp groups<\/li>\n<li>MailChimp&#8217;s new GDPR fields<\/li>\n<li>and when I got stuck, <a href=\"http:\/\/wpforms.com\/\">WPForms<\/a> too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I reckon I&#8217;ve combined two of these things together in several different combinations. And I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve done one specific combination of three of them. But never more than that.<\/p>\n<p>And I needed at least four of them. And the GDPR fields in MailChimp are new and, well, let&#8217;s say they seem to have been shoe-horned in in a bit of a hurry.<\/p>\n<p>Now&#8230;let&#8217;s go down the rabbit hole&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Bloom integrates with regular MailChimp, but won&#8217;t let you use groups.\u00a0 To do that you need to use a &#8220;custom HTML form&#8221; in the Bloom opt-in which you copy and paste from MailChimp&#8217;s embedded forms section.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with that is that in a pop-up (we have a good case for using a pop-up, it&#8217;s OK!) is that the GDPR text and fields make the form really long and it won&#8217;t fit nicely on a smaller screen.<\/p>\n<p>So I tried reducing the form to just an email input and a button, and then sending that input to a WPForms form using a URL parameter to autocomplete the email field on the &#8220;full&#8221; form. Great! That works really nicely.<\/p>\n<p>Only&#8230;WPForms doesn&#8217;t send the GDPR opt-in fields. Rats! I assume Gravity Forms won&#8217;t do this either.<\/p>\n<p>So maybe, rather than linking the Bloom opt-in to an on-site form, I&#8217;ll link it to an off-site form. That will work!<\/p>\n<p>Only, I want the subscriber to sign up to a specific group, and it turns out that <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/help\/automatically-add-subscribers-to-a-group-at-signup\/\">you sort-of can&#8217;t have a pre-selected group on MailChimps own, hosted forms<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So what am I left with? Taking a MailChimp embedded form, sticking it in a WordPress page, editing the HTML of the form to make the required group pre-selected and hiding the group selection from the user and linking my Bloom pop-up to that page.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s pretty gross. But it does work.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m hoping that at some point MailChimp&#8217;s API will work nicer with the GDPR fields. It seems to have the ability to send &#8220;marketing_permissions&#8221; with a new subscriber, but it&#8217;s not clear how you get the ID&#8217;s needed to send. When this does work nicely, hopefully WPForms or Bloom or Gravity Forms will integrate with it and let me do this properly.<\/p>\n<p>For now&#8230;making a simple form requires a humongous kludge.<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to the internet, everybody!<\/p>\n",

But I\u2019m excited because, effectively, I was the visual designer on this and it ACTUALLY LOOKS REALLY NICE!! (Or so I think)<\/li>\n<li>I have two other small Divi-based sites on the go for local organisations\/people. One involves some clever data manipulation and image migration\/import work.<\/li>\n<li>I have a WordPress plugin extension to write to enable custom postcode lookup functionality on a <a href=\"https:\/\/ninjaforms.com\/\">Ninja Form<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>I\u2019m providing ad-hoc support to a number of clients &#8211; mostly WordPress stuff, but sometimes diving into UX, hosting, security, site migrations, domains and DNS, email deliverability, and general IT support.<\/li>\n<li>I\u2019m trying to get an important client email out about the new \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/gutenberg\/\">Gutenberg<\/a>\u201d editor in WordPress (amongst other things) which needs me to edit a screencast video first.<\/li>\n<li>In my spare time I\u2019m building SchoolBot and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/about-kownter\/\">Kownter<\/a> as side projects (amongst other things that have fallen by the wayside), and trying to keep my \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/\">Press Ups<\/a>\u201d video tutorials going too.

And at home, when I\u2019m outside, I\u2019m usually gardening, cycling, walking or doing something else with purpose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this all means that I rarely get to be barefoot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will probably sound like a really odd thing, but I REALLY liked walking around barefoot on the grass and (this will surprise some but&#8230;) the beach on holiday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like things that connect me to the earth. Cycling and gardening means I have to pay attention to weather. Gardening and growing food also puts you very much in touch with the seasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like cooking (even though Sally does most of it) and baking. \u00a0I like the processes of brewing tea and filter coffee. I like the slowness of making sourdough bread which is a thing which, when starter and dough, feels very much \u201calive\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Computers and the internet are great, brilliant, amazing things.

And at home, when I\u2019m outside, I\u2019m usually gardening, cycling, walking or doing something else with purpose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this all means that I rarely get to be barefoot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will probably sound like a really odd thing, but I REALLY liked walking around barefoot on the grass and (this will surprise some but&#8230;) the beach on holiday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like things that connect me to the earth. Cycling and gardening means I have to pay attention to weather. Gardening and growing food also puts you very much in touch with the seasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like cooking (even though Sally does most of it) and baking. \u00a0I like the processes of brewing tea and filter coffee. I like the slowness of making sourdough bread which is a thing which, when starter and dough, feels very much \u201calive\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Computers and the internet are great, brilliant, amazing things. But there\u2019s something special about just feeling the grass beneath your feet.<\/p>\n",

            },
            "content": {
                "rendered": "\n<p>I&#8217;ve always had that temptation to spend extra money on cordless things. But the extra expense has never quite seemed worth it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, battery-powered, cordless things are getting cheaper. And, while I won&#8217;t paint a life of posh, cordless-powered luxury in the Wintle household (because that&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s like at all), I have made some purchases recently that have really helped with getting things done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, I know Lidl do a cordless hammer drill that gets good reviews. But they don&#8217;t stock it very often! (Watch out, they stock the non-hammer-action drill often, but it won&#8217;t do masonry!). So when it DID appear in stock one week I bought one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And not only did I then go and hang a load of things on walls that had been waiting for me to do so for ages, but I also went a bit crazy and creative and made my son a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/04\/i-made-things-a-basketball-hoop\/\">basketball hoop<\/a> on a whim!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freed from the constraints of having to find an appropriate combination of socket, circuit breaker, and extension lead, I could now just grab-and-go. And it was a joy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d had this nagging feeling that I&#8217;d get more done with cordless things. Being able to just pick up a tool and do a job was great. Especially with busy family life where having kids around corded electrical goods is a bit of a hazard for everyone. And it had been proven true. So what next?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, my wife broke her ankle, that&#8217;s what was next. And I was in charge of EVERYTHING for six weeks in the late spring. 2 children. All the cooking. Even carrying cups of tea around the house. I barely had a moment to spare. So anything that would speed up household tasks and let me do little bits here and there rather than committing to huge long sessions of cleaning would be a boon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, one day in Lidl again, I saw they were selling a battery-powered lawn strimmer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s amazing!&#8221;, I thought, &#8220;I can just grab this while the kids are playing in the garden, whizz round a bit of the lawn and keep it from getting too long, all without that incredible hassle of traipsing up and down my long garden with extension leads and stuff. AND it uses the SAME batteries as the drill!!!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was proven right too.\u00a0 Sure, a battery-powered strimmer isn&#8217;t as powerful as a corded one. And it feels a bit plasticky and flimsy. But it really does the job. I grab it and &#8220;mow&#8221; while the kids are playing. I can do 10 or 15 minutes of it at a time and the job gets done in little bursts as a part of daily life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So finally, and this took some convincing and research and waiting for a good deal, but I caved and also bought a cordless vacuum cleaner. These things can be expensive. But I got one for a huge 50% off. And it&#8217;s not perfect, but it has transformed cleaning in our house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s less powerful than our &#8220;big vacuum&#8221;, but this has the benefit that it&#8217;s also much quieter. And it&#8217;s great. We can just grab it, do a room while the kids watch TV or something, and then put it away. So quick and easy and brilliant for a busy family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some problems are people problems and have solutions with people. But sometimes technology really is a help in everyday life. I&#8217;ve loved ditching cables around the house. Are there other appliances I should go cordless with?<\/p>\n",

But the extra expense has never quite seemed worth it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, battery-powered, cordless things are getting cheaper. And, while I won&#8217;t paint a life of posh, cordless-powered luxury in the Wintle household (because that&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s like at all), I have made some purchases recently that have really helped with getting things done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, I know Lidl do a cordless hammer drill that gets good reviews. But they don&#8217;t stock it very often! (Watch out, they stock the non-hammer-action drill often, but it won&#8217;t do masonry!). So when it DID appear in stock one week I bought one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And not only did I then go and hang a load of things on walls that had been waiting for me to do so for ages, but I also went a bit crazy and creative and made my son a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/04\/i-made-things-a-basketball-hoop\/\">basketball hoop<\/a> on a whim!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freed from the constraints of having to find an appropriate combination of socket, circuit breaker, and extension lead, I could now just grab-and-go. And it was a joy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d had this nagging feeling that I&#8217;d get more done with cordless things. Being able to just pick up a tool and do a job was great. Especially with busy family life where having kids around corded electrical goods is a bit of a hazard for everyone. And it had been proven true. So what next?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, my wife broke her ankle, that&#8217;s what was next. And I was in charge of EVERYTHING for six weeks in the late spring. 2 children. All the cooking. Even carrying cups of tea around the house. I barely had a moment to spare. So anything that would speed up household tasks and let me do little bits here and there rather than committing to huge long sessions of cleaning would be a boon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, one day in Lidl again, I saw they were selling a battery-powered lawn strimmer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s amazing!&#8221;, I thought, &#8220;I can just grab this while the kids are playing in the garden, whizz round a bit of the lawn and keep it from getting too long, all without that incredible hassle of traipsing up and down my long garden with extension leads and stuff. AND it uses the SAME batteries as the drill!!!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was proven right too.\u00a0 Sure, a battery-powered strimmer isn&#8217;t as powerful as a corded one. And it feels a bit plasticky and flimsy. But it really does the job. I grab it and &#8220;mow&#8221; while the kids are playing. I can do 10 or 15 minutes of it at a time and the job gets done in little bursts as a part of daily life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So finally, and this took some convincing and research and waiting for a good deal, but I caved and also bought a cordless vacuum cleaner. These things can be expensive. But I got one for a huge 50% off. And it&#8217;s not perfect, but it has transformed cleaning in our house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s less powerful than our &#8220;big vacuum&#8221;, but this has the benefit that it&#8217;s also much quieter. And it&#8217;s great. We can just grab it, do a room while the kids watch TV or something, and then put it away. So quick and easy and brilliant for a busy family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some problems are people problems and have solutions with people. But sometimes technology really is a help in everyday life. I&#8217;ve loved ditching cables around the house. Are there other appliances I should go cordless with?<\/p>\n",

Mostly as a user of WordPress (I\u2019m using it right now!) but also as a developer. And I\u2019m always aware, when thinking about and commenting on Gutenberg, that I\u2019m not a typical user.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there\u2019s this second context, which is: what does everyone else think? Here, I\u2019m often guessing (probably incorrectly) what the typical user might want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also have this other, third role\/context that I think overrides thoughts of \u201cwhat do I want\u201d and \u201cwhat might everyone else want\u201d. That role is WordPress educator and support person. The role where I explain to both the public (sometimes) and to my clients (more often) how to use WordPress, or take questions on how to use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this role, the main question I\u2019m asking is: \u201cHow the heck am I going to explain this to someone else?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ll happily take advice in the comments on how to answer that question.<br\/><\/p>\n",

Mostly as a user of WordPress (I\u2019m using it right now!) but also as a developer. And I\u2019m always aware, when thinking about and commenting on Gutenberg, that I\u2019m not a typical user.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there\u2019s this second context, which is: what does everyone else think? Here, I\u2019m often guessing (probably incorrectly) what the typical user might want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also have this other, third role\/context that I think overrides thoughts of \u201cwhat do I want\u201d and \u201cwhat might everyone else want\u201d. That role is WordPress educator and support person. The role where I explain to both the public (sometimes) and to my clients (more often) how to use WordPress, or take questions on how to use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this role, the main question I\u2019m asking is: \u201cHow the heck am I going to explain this to someone else?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ll happily take advice in the comments on how to answer that question.<br\/><\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>It was a complete joy (and a real honour) to attend a wedding yesterday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attending weddings always reminds me of my own wedding, and especially of the promises that I made to my wonderful wife Sally on that day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those promises are such huge things to say, in public, and (in our case, we believe) in the presence of God. And it\u2019s kind of odd that we rarely remind ourselves of these things (maybe this is just us?).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose anniversarys are celebrations, but maybe we should be better at reminding ourselves of our vows on an ongoing basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was thinking that we are now moving quickly away from the all-our-friends-are-getting-married phase through the all-our-friends-are-having-children phase. We found it hard to name the people who are likely to be bride and groom at the next wedding we attend. So we will be reminded of the wedding vows less often and we shall hear fewer wedding sermons and wedding speeches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weddings are, of course, all about the two people getting married. But they are also useful reminders of the nature of the ongoing, practical, sacrificial, unconditional love that underpins any committed relationship and that has to be worked out through the gritty and unpredictable mess of daily life lived together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here\u2019s a little prompt. If you are married or in a civil partnership (apologies for the topic if you aren\u2019t), why not remind yourself of your vows? Or, if you\u2019ve been married a while, why not even plan to renew your vows in public? It doesn\u2019t have to be a big thing. As well as reminding yourselves of your promises to each other, it might be a reminder to others about what love is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can\u2019t help but feel that that\u2019s something the world needs right now.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>It was a complete joy (and a real honour) to attend a wedding yesterday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attending weddings always reminds me of my own wedding, and especially of the promises that I made to my wonderful wife Sally on that day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those promises are such huge things to say, in public, and (in our case, we believe) in the presence of God. And it\u2019s kind of odd that we rarely remind ourselves of these things (maybe this is just us?).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose anniversarys are celebrations, but maybe we should be better at reminding ourselves of our vows on an ongoing basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was thinking that we are now moving quickly away from the all-our-friends-are-getting-married phase through the all-our-friends-are-having-children phase. We found it hard to name the people who are likely to be bride and groom at the next wedding we attend. So we will be reminded of the wedding vows less often and we shall hear fewer wedding sermons and wedding speeches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weddings are, of course, all about the two people getting married. But they are also useful reminders of the nature of the ongoing, practical, sacrificial, unconditional love that underpins any committed relationship and that has to be worked out through the gritty and unpredictable mess of daily life lived together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here\u2019s a little prompt. If you are married or in a civil partnership (apologies for the topic if you aren\u2019t), why not remind yourself of your vows? Or, if you\u2019ve been married a while, why not even plan to renew your vows in public? It doesn\u2019t have to be a big thing. As well as reminding yourselves of your promises to each other, it might be a reminder to others about what love is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can\u2019t help but feel that that\u2019s something the world needs right now.<\/p>\n",
