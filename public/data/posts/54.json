And the site looks and works great.<\/p>\n<p>This, in the same week that Jeffery Way launched a re-designed <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/\">Laracasts<\/a> site which does actually have photos, but they&#8217;re pretty understated and the focus is on content and graphics, rather than photographic imagery. \u00a0Laracasts is also pretty\u00a0speedy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I note that, as well as a lack of photos, neither of these sites have any social media integration: they have links to profiles, but there&#8217;s no sharing buttons or feed widgets.<\/p>\n<p>Large photos and these social widgets and buttons are great for slowing your site down, and art direction\/photo editing for images on responsive websites is really hard. I love how these sites have really gone to town and simplified and optimised things &#8211; not only using high-tech\u00a0web development tricks, but also using higher level design decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps &#8220;no photos&#8221; is an interesting design challenge for future projects.<\/p>\n",

And the site looks and works great.<\/p>\n<p>This, in the same week that Jeffery Way launched a re-designed <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/\">Laracasts<\/a> site which does actually have photos, but they&#8217;re pretty understated and the focus is on content and graphics, rather than photographic imagery. \u00a0Laracasts is also pretty\u00a0speedy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I note that, as well as a lack of photos, neither of these sites have any social media integration: they have links to profiles, but there&#8217;s no sharing buttons or feed widgets.<\/p>\n<p>Large photos and these social widgets and buttons are great for slowing your site down, and art direction\/photo editing for images on responsive websites is really hard. I love how these sites have really gone to town and simplified and optimised things &#8211; not only using high-tech\u00a0web development tricks, but also using higher level design decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps &#8220;no photos&#8221; is an interesting design challenge for future projects.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>For a long time, many people told me &#8220;you should be a teacher&#8221;. And, I confess, I actually love the idea of teaching people &#8211; but only really if I can\u00a0teach people who want to learn. \u00a0Regular teachers have to teach even those who don&#8217;t want to learn &#8211; and they have my utmost respect because of it (seriously&#8230;school teachers: you have so much respect here!).<\/p>\n<p>So I guess my forays into public speaking at meetups and conferences this year have been a stab at some kind of teaching. But I also set up a challenge to myself to produce <a href=\"http:\/\/press-ups.com\/about-press-ups\/\">some screencast tutorial videos<\/a>\u00a0back in 2015 (which I gave the cheesy name &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/press-ups.com\/\">Press Ups<\/a>&#8220;), and that was useful both as a resource to share with others, and as an exercise for myself in creating such things.<\/p>\n<p>More recently I have, myself, been learning a LOT from screencast tutorials from Jefferey Way&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/\">Laracasts<\/a>\u00a0and Wes Bos&#8217;s many <a href=\"http:\/\/wesbos.com\/courses\/\">JavaScript courses<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So when my attendance at <a href=\"http:\/\/wpbristol.co.uk\/\">my local WordPress meetup<\/a> started to wain due to family commitments and health issues, I started wondering\u00a0if I could contribute answers to questions that had come up at the meetup, in the form of videos.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve had a go at that. First, an attempt at answering the question &#8220;What&#8217;s the difference between WP_Query, query_posts, and get_posts?&#8221;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"VR2C5AHIQr\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/2016\/11\/wordpress-loops-queries-guide-developers\/\">WordPress Loops and Queries &#8211; A guide for developers<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/2016\/11\/wordpress-loops-queries-guide-developers\/embed\/#?secret=VR2C5AHIQr\" data-secret=\"VR2C5AHIQr\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"&#8220;WordPress Loops and Queries &#8211; A guide for developers&#8221; &#8212; Press Ups\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>And then a follow up where I expand on a technique referenced in the first video that I use for structuring code related to post types:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"5t3tUCwN2W\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/2016\/12\/keeping-wordpress-post-types-code-clean-simple-classes\/\">Keeping WordPress post types code clean with simple classes<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/2016\/12\/keeping-wordpress-post-types-code-clean-simple-classes\/embed\/#?secret=5t3tUCwN2W\" data-secret=\"5t3tUCwN2W\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"&#8220;Keeping WordPress post types code clean with simple classes&#8221; &#8212; Press Ups\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve really enjoyed making these. They&#8217;re not perfect, but I&#8217;ve had positive and constructive feedback on them that I&#8217;ve tried to take to heart. And I hope they are really useful for people out there.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not about to be the next Jeffrey Way, or Wes Bos, but I do enjoy making these and have a setup for making them that is steadily improving. So if you have a technical question that you think I might be able to cover in a tutorial, submit a request on the <a href=\"http:\/\/press-ups.com\/suggest\/\">Press Ups suggestions page<\/a>, grab me in a meetup, or drop me a line <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\">on Twitter<\/a>, and I&#8217;ll see if I can help you &#8211; and others &#8211; out. And if you have constructive feedback about any of this, feel free to drop me a line too.<\/p>\n<p>People have stopped saying it of late, but perhaps I should be a teacher after all?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>For a long time, many people told me &#8220;you should be a teacher&#8221;. And, I confess, I actually love the idea of teaching people &#8211; but only really if I can\u00a0teach people who want to learn. \u00a0Regular teachers have to teach even those who don&#8217;t want to learn &#8211; and they have my utmost respect because of it (seriously&#8230;school teachers: you have so much respect here!).<\/p>\n<p>So I guess my forays into public speaking at meetups and conferences this year have been a stab at some kind of teaching. But I also set up a challenge to myself to produce <a href=\"http:\/\/press-ups.com\/about-press-ups\/\">some screencast tutorial videos<\/a>\u00a0back in 2015 (which I gave the cheesy name &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/press-ups.com\/\">Press Ups<\/a>&#8220;), and that was useful both as a resource to share with others, and as an exercise for myself in creating such things.<\/p>\n<p>More recently I have, myself, been learning a LOT from screencast tutorials from Jefferey Way&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/\">Laracasts<\/a>\u00a0and Wes Bos&#8217;s many <a href=\"http:\/\/wesbos.com\/courses\/\">JavaScript courses<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So when my attendance at <a href=\"http:\/\/wpbristol.co.uk\/\">my local WordPress meetup<\/a> started to wain due to family commitments and health issues, I started wondering\u00a0if I could contribute answers to questions that had come up at the meetup, in the form of videos.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve had a go at that. First, an attempt at answering the question &#8220;What&#8217;s the difference between WP_Query, query_posts, and get_posts?&#8221;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"VR2C5AHIQr\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/2016\/11\/wordpress-loops-queries-guide-developers\/\">WordPress Loops and Queries &#8211; A guide for developers<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/2016\/11\/wordpress-loops-queries-guide-developers\/embed\/#?secret=VR2C5AHIQr\" data-secret=\"VR2C5AHIQr\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"&#8220;WordPress Loops and Queries &#8211; A guide for developers&#8221; &#8212; Press Ups\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>And then a follow up where I expand on a technique referenced in the first video that I use for structuring code related to post types:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"5t3tUCwN2W\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/2016\/12\/keeping-wordpress-post-types-code-clean-simple-classes\/\">Keeping WordPress post types code clean with simple classes<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/2016\/12\/keeping-wordpress-post-types-code-clean-simple-classes\/embed\/#?secret=5t3tUCwN2W\" data-secret=\"5t3tUCwN2W\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"&#8220;Keeping WordPress post types code clean with simple classes&#8221; &#8212; Press Ups\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve really enjoyed making these. They&#8217;re not perfect, but I&#8217;ve had positive and constructive feedback on them that I&#8217;ve tried to take to heart. And I hope they are really useful for people out there.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not about to be the next Jeffrey Way, or Wes Bos, but I do enjoy making these and have a setup for making them that is steadily improving. So if you have a technical question that you think I might be able to cover in a tutorial, submit a request on the <a href=\"http:\/\/press-ups.com\/suggest\/\">Press Ups suggestions page<\/a>, grab me in a meetup, or drop me a line <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\">on Twitter<\/a>, and I&#8217;ll see if I can help you &#8211; and others &#8211; out. And if you have constructive feedback about any of this, feel free to drop me a line too.<\/p>\n<p>People have stopped saying it of late, but perhaps I should be a teacher after all?<\/p>\n",

But I have a talk idea that I&#8217;d like to run past people too.<\/p>\n<p>In another post that&#8217;s not written yet, I will talk about how I come across lots of people who start as WordPress users, then tentatively edit themes, and eventually start writing PHP code to change or enhance their websites, without ever getting a proper understanding of the code they are writing.<\/p>\n<p>This seems to be the path of many a WordPress developer. And I recently heard from two very successful WordPress professionals that this was their path, and therefore it is the recommended way to learn WordPress development. I was startled to hear no mention of learning about coding principles as a part of this journey to become a WordPress developer.<\/p>\n<p>I, personally, think that learning coding principles can both help you learn faster, and give you a much greater problem solving ability.<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;I have this brewing idea for a talk &#8211; possibly for WordCamp London, possibly for elsewhere &#8211; that is a <em>very<\/em> quick overview of basic coding principles. For those that already know what these are, I&#8217;d cover things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>variables and types<\/li>\n<li>expressions<\/li>\n<li>conditionals<\/li>\n<li>functions<\/li>\n<li>(the VERY basics of&#8230;) scope<\/li>\n<li>control structures<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In testing the water for this idea I guess I have a few questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is this something you&#8217;d be interested in?<\/li>\n<li>Do you think I&#8217;d be able to cover enough ground in 30 minutes?<\/li>\n<li>Is it a good idea, but one for which a conference talk is the wrong format?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Use the comments to let me know!

        "content": "<p>Yes, it&#8217;s the third of January and I&#8217;m writing a blog post so you&#8217;d be quite entitled to think that I&#8217;ve started some new year&#8217;s resolution to write more and am already three two days behind. \u00a0And, well, that&#8217;s not strictly true, but it is partly true.<\/p>\n<p>What I <em>have<\/em> been doing is putting together some ideas for conference talks for the year. <a href=\"https:\/\/2017.london.wordcamp.org\/2016\/12\/20\/call-for-speakers\/\">Applications<\/a> (and <a href=\"https:\/\/2017.london.wordcamp.org\/tickets\/\">tickets<\/a>) are open for WordCamp London which I&#8217;m hoping to at least attend. But I have a talk idea that I&#8217;d like to run past people too.<\/p>\n<p>In another post that&#8217;s not written yet, I will talk about how I come across lots of people who start as WordPress users, then tentatively edit themes, and eventually start writing PHP code to change or enhance their websites, without ever getting a proper understanding of the code they are writing.<\/p>\n<p>This seems to be the path of many a WordPress developer. And I recently heard from two very successful WordPress professionals that this was their path, and therefore it is the recommended way to learn WordPress development. I was startled to hear no mention of learning about coding principles as a part of this journey to become a WordPress developer.<\/p>\n<p>I, personally, think that learning coding principles can both help you learn faster, and give you a much greater problem solving ability.<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;I have this brewing idea for a talk &#8211; possibly for WordCamp London, possibly for elsewhere &#8211; that is a <em>very<\/em> quick overview of basic coding principles. For those that already know what these are, I&#8217;d cover things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>variables and types<\/li>\n<li>expressions<\/li>\n<li>conditionals<\/li>\n<li>functions<\/li>\n<li>(the VERY basics of&#8230;) scope<\/li>\n<li>control structures<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In testing the water for this idea I guess I have a few questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is this something you&#8217;d be interested in?<\/li>\n<li>Do you think I&#8217;d be able to cover enough ground in 30 minutes?<\/li>\n<li>Is it a good idea, but one for which a conference talk is the wrong format?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Use the comments to let me know! And thanks in advance for your input.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>A belated HAPPY NEW YEAR! I won&#8217;t post a huge review of 2016. And though I have been jotting down some goals for 2017 they are a mix of public and private, so I won&#8217;t share all of those with you either. But there are a few thoughts to share.<\/p>\n<p>2016 was very much a year of transition. A new Wintle made her way into the world, the existing little Wintle went to school. New routines were built up and then torn down to make way for others. We made new friends. We failed to spend much time with old friends (or anyone, really). My life, my work, my faith all evolved in ways. Sometimes dramatically. Sometimes subtly.<\/p>\n<p>Amidst political turmoil and some amount of life change and upheaval there was much to celebrate: Ada; public speaking; becoming proficient with Laravel; graduation from pre-school; our first child turning five, Oikos turning five and so on. It&#8217;s been tricky, but good.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s felt like a year of transition and preparation. 2016 had a definite <em>end<\/em> to it. And 2017 has felt like the\u00a0<em>start<\/em> of something. I mean, new year always does, but this new year had a more definite line drawn under it for us than other years have.<\/p>\n<p>2017 then? Well, it&#8217;s started out with acceptance of things that must be. I don&#8217;t know why. Perhaps it&#8217;s just time to go with the flow a little.\u00a0?<\/p>\n<p>Technically I&#8217;ve been learning something that I&#8217;ve been putting off learning because I don&#8217;t like it. But not liking is no longer a reason any more. It needs to be a bigger part of my toolset. Yes: I&#8217;ve accepted that I need to be a proper JavaScript developer.<\/p>\n<p>So with the help of Wes Bos&#8217;s excellent (free, fun) <a href=\"https:\/\/javascript30.com\/\">JavaScript30<\/a> course and (great value) <a href=\"https:\/\/es6.io\/\">ES6 course<\/a> and Kyle Simpson&#8217;s excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/wordery.com\/search?term=you+don%27t+know+js&amp;oid=1625_1\">You Don&#8217;t Know JS books<\/a> (&lt;- Note: this is an affiliate link) (also note: Kyle is a pragmatic developer &#8211; I like him a LOT), I&#8217;ve been really getting stuck in and adding JS as a top-level skill alongside PHP, WordPress and Laravel.<\/p>\n<p>And personally&#8230;I don&#8217;t know why, but I&#8217;ve been embracing emoji. ?\u00a0 It&#8217;s the new text.<\/p>\n<p>I turn 40 this year. Mid-life crisis?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>A belated HAPPY NEW YEAR! I won&#8217;t post a huge review of 2016. And though I have been jotting down some goals for 2017 they are a mix of public and private, so I won&#8217;t share all of those with you either. But there are a few thoughts to share.<\/p>\n<p>2016 was very much a year of transition. A new Wintle made her way into the world, the existing little Wintle went to school. New routines were built up and then torn down to make way for others. We made new friends. We failed to spend much time with old friends (or anyone, really). My life, my work, my faith all evolved in ways. Sometimes dramatically. Sometimes subtly.<\/p>\n<p>Amidst political turmoil and some amount of life change and upheaval there was much to celebrate: Ada; public speaking; becoming proficient with Laravel; graduation from pre-school; our first child turning five, Oikos turning five and so on. It&#8217;s been tricky, but good.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s felt like a year of transition and preparation. 2016 had a definite <em>end<\/em> to it. And 2017 has felt like the\u00a0<em>start<\/em> of something. I mean, new year always does, but this new year had a more definite line drawn under it for us than other years have.<\/p>\n<p>2017 then? Well, it&#8217;s started out with acceptance of things that must be. I don&#8217;t know why. Perhaps it&#8217;s just time to go with the flow a little.\u00a0?<\/p>\n<p>Technically I&#8217;ve been learning something that I&#8217;ve been putting off learning because I don&#8217;t like it. But not liking is no longer a reason any more. It needs to be a bigger part of my toolset. Yes: I&#8217;ve accepted that I need to be a proper JavaScript developer.<\/p>\n<p>So with the help of Wes Bos&#8217;s excellent (free, fun) <a href=\"https:\/\/javascript30.com\/\">JavaScript30<\/a> course and (great value) <a href=\"https:\/\/es6.io\/\">ES6 course<\/a> and Kyle Simpson&#8217;s excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/wordery.com\/search?term=you+don%27t+know+js&amp;oid=1625_1\">You Don&#8217;t Know JS books<\/a> (&lt;- Note: this is an affiliate link) (also note: Kyle is a pragmatic developer &#8211; I like him a LOT), I&#8217;ve been really getting stuck in and adding JS as a top-level skill alongside PHP, WordPress and Laravel.<\/p>\n<p>And personally&#8230;I don&#8217;t know why, but I&#8217;ve been embracing emoji. ?\u00a0 It&#8217;s the new text.<\/p>\n<p>I turn 40 this year.

I&#8217;ve previously said that I think JavaScript is like the assembler of the web: coding in vanilla JS isn&#8217;t really something you should do because it&#8217;s too easy to get things wrong, so you should have a layer of abstraction on top.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;oddly&#8230;I&#8217;ve actually really got into vanilla JS.<\/p>\n<p>I was thinking about the origin of this and I think it was that I got stuck reading ES6 code, or was baffled by it in the <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/learning-vue-step-by-step\">Laracasts Vue.js tutorials<\/a>. So I started doing <a href=\"https:\/\/es6.io\/\">Wes Bos&#8217;s ES6 tutorials<\/a> (paid but excellent &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/es6-cliffsnotes\">Laracasts also now has an ES6\/ES2015 series<\/a>) and it kinda went from there.<\/p>\n<p>On suggestion from a friend, I got a couple of\u00a0Kyle Simpson\u2019s excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/wordery.com\/search?term=you+don%27t+know+js&#038;oid=1625_1\">You Don\u2019t Know JS books<\/a> (<- Note: affiliate link!), and have got stuck into the first one: Up and Going. Which is short (about 50 pages of real content), but...well.\n\nMy mind has been blown.\n\n\n<h2>JS: Behind the scenes<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m the kinda person that likes to know what&#8217;s going on behind the scenes. And I&#8217;ve never really understood exactly how JavaScript works. And so learning it form first principles is quite revelatory. It&#8217;s actually very different to other languages that I was brought up on in quite a number of ways. So no wonder it always baffled and freaked me out a little.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the quirks\/oddities\/differences that I&#8217;ve discovered along the way.<\/p>\n<h3>Values are typed, variables are not<\/h3>\n<p>Yep. This may seem obvious, but it&#8217;s actually quite a shift of thinking from someone who&#8217;s previously coded in strictly-typed languages. I&#8217;ve never even come across the phrase &#8220;values are typed&#8221; before.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean?<\/p>\n<p>Well, in other languages you have typed variables. So when you declare a variable you give it a type:<\/p>\n<p><code>int age = 0;<\/code><\/p>\n<p>for example. This can be handy because the program can detect when a value that is not an integer is assigned to the variable, which can catch errors. But it&#8217;s also constraining because you can&#8217;t assign, say, a <code>null<\/code>\u00a0or <code>false<\/code>\u00a0value to say that there isn&#8217;t a number yet.<\/p>\n<p>Does it affect how I code? Probably not. But it&#8217;s good to know and understand.<\/p>\n<h3>Equality shenanigans<\/h3>\n<p>On top of type coercion (more below) when doing equality, and issues with comparing references (also see below) there&#8217;s also this list of unusual values and their equal-nesses. \u00a0Some of these are really quite bizarre:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>0 === -0\u00a0\/\/ \u00a0true - what the heck is -0 anyway?<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code>NaN === NaN \/\/ false, because NaN is defined to be unequal to any other value<\/code><\/li>\n<li>and so on<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What does this mean? Well, it&#8217;s just stuff you need to know.<\/p>\n<p>Does it affect how I code? Not in a big way. It may help with debugging when values aren&#8217;t what you expect them to be.\u00a0It&#8217;s knowledge that&#8217;s also helpful for the odd challenges at &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/alf.nu\/ReturnTrue\">return true<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<h3>Objects\/Arrays\/etc are assigned and passed as references<\/h3>\n<p>Forgive me if I don&#8217;t get my terminology exactly right, but &#8220;non-primitive&#8221; values like objects and arrays are passed around as references.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean?<\/p>\n<p>Well, if the same object is assigned to two variables &#8211; which is possible because assignment is of the reference and not a copied value &#8211; then updating one will update the other:<\/p>\n<pre>let a = {\r\n  x: 1,\r\n  y: 2\r\n};\r\nlet b = a;\r\nb.x = 4;\r\nconsole.log(a);\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Logs:<\/p>\n<pre>[object Object] {\r\n  x: 4,\r\n  y: 2\r\n}<\/pre>\n<p>Does it affect how I code? Yes. Stuff like this is REALLY good to know.<\/p>\n<h3>Objects\/Arrays\/etc equality is not by value<\/h3>\n<p>The fact that non-primitives are assigned and passed by reference also means that comparisons are also made on references, not values.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean? So you have:<br \/>\n<code>[1,2,3] == [1,2,3] \/\/ false - they are two different arrays<\/code><br \/>\nAnd also, if you want to copy an array you have to do it via some other means than simple assignment (the ES6 rest\/spread operator helps here).<\/p>\n<p>I also learned that when coerced to a string, arrays are joined with a comma!:<br \/>\n<code>[1,2,3] == \"1,2,3\" \/\/ true!<\/code><br \/>\nDoes this affect how I code?<\/p>\n<p>Yes. Be careful with non-primitives!<\/p>\n<h3>Object wrappers &#8211; e.g. `String` vs `string`<\/h3>\n<p>I confess I still don&#8217;t understand this &#8211; need to do more reading. But:<\/p>\n<pre>typeof(\"a\"); \/\/\u00a0gives \"string\"<\/pre>\n<p>but string values are actually &#8220;wrapped&#8221; by the type <code>String<\/code>. And this &#8220;wrapping&#8221; is also true for all primitive types. \u00a0So you can see this:<\/p>\n<pre>a = new String;\r\n\r\ntypeof(a); \/\/ gives \"object\"\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>I&#8217;m not quite sure what it means yet and I don&#8217;t think it will affect my programming. But who knows what else I&#8217;ll find out?<\/p>\n<h3>Inequality not the same as (symmetric) non-equality &#8211; WHAT?!?!<\/h3>\n<p>This line appears in one of the books and also, at first, confused me:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The ! forms [of equality operators] are of course the symmetric &#8220;not equal&#8221; versions of their counterparts; <em>non-equality<\/em> should not be confused with <em>inequality<\/em>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s later on made&#8230;hmm&#8230;clearer (?) that <em>inequality<\/em> is the greater-than, less-than and so-on conditional operators.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean? Oh. Well. Nothing. It was an interesting interlude though.<\/p>\n<p>Onwards. What else?<\/p>\n<h3>Oh. Equality?<\/h3>\n<p>So with the knowledge that values, not variables, are typed, some other things need to be put into place.<\/p>\n<p>One of which is the equality operators. They aren&#8217;t &#8220;typed equality&#8221; and &#8220;untyped equality&#8221;. They\u00a0are actually compare-without-coercion and compare-with-coercion.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean? Well, it means that understanding the coercion can help you understand how to write correct conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Does this\u00a0affect my code? \u00a0I think so, in subtle ways. It should make things a bit more predictable.<\/p>\n<h3>Hoisting applies to functions too&#8230;sort of?<\/h3>\n<p>I only learned about variable hoisting recently while learning about <code>let<\/code>\u00a0and <code>const<\/code>\u00a0in ES6.<\/p>\n<p>With non-ES6 <code>var<\/code>\u00a0declarations, if you make them in the middle of a scope they are &#8220;hoisted&#8221; to the top of the scope. So when the code is running, the variable exists in an undefined state in the scope until the point of the <code>var<\/code>\u00a0declaration. \u00a0Best explained in an example. Here we use a variable without ever declaring it (you&#8217;ll need to put this in a file and run it, not just type it into the console):<\/p>\n<pre>console.log(x);\r\n\r\n&gt;\u00a0ReferenceError: x is not defined<\/pre>\n<p>Then if we use the variable before later declaring it:<\/p>\n<pre>console.log(x);\r\n\r\nvar x = 4;\r\n\r\n&gt; undefined<\/pre>\n<p>Spot the difference!<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean?<\/p>\n<p>Well not much in reality, though it was good to understand.<\/p>\n<p>What is interesting is that function declaration is also effectively variable declaration, and so functions can be used before they are declared&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;oh&#8230;hang on. \u00a0They&#8217;re hoisted AND DEFINED!:<\/p>\n<pre>foo();\r\n\r\nfunction foo() {\r\n console.log('foo');\r\n}\r\n\r\n&gt; \"foo\"<\/pre>\n<p>That&#8217;s not <code>undefined<\/code>. OK. I&#8217;m curious now. So what happens if I&#8230;:<\/p>\n<pre>bar();\r\n\r\nvar bar = function() {\r\n console.log('bar');\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; TypeError: bar is not a function<\/pre>\n<p>Oh. Well, that&#8217;s not entirely simple then.<\/p>\n<p>Will this affect my code? Probably not, but it&#8217;s good to know how both variables and functions are hoisted, even if the behaviour is slightly different in a way that I don&#8217;t currently understand.<\/p>\n<h3>Initial variable assignment without var makes a global<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;d forgotten this! I used to not use <code>var<\/code>\u00a0at all when declaring variables and was forever accidentally making globals.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean? \u00a0That I&#8217;ve already been on a journey of learning JavaScript long enough that I&#8217;ve forgotten about this.<\/p>\n<p>Will it affect my code? Well, no. But it&#8217;s a good reminder of how far I&#8217;ve come, even before the last few months.<\/p>\n<h2>What do I think of JS now?<\/h2>\n<p>Well so far so geeky. \u00a0Let&#8217;s wrap up.<\/p>\n<p>This almost feels more like research than practical learning. Though I&#8217;m hopeful that learning these things will have very positive practical benefits. I&#8217;m coming to know JavaScript as a fascinating and mis-understood teenager of a language.<\/p>\n<p>I still don&#8217;t like it. I <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2013\/12\/treachery-code\/\">still wouldn&#8217;t want anyone to learn it as a first language<\/a>. In fact, in some ways, understanding it more reinforces this view.<\/p>\n<p>JavaScript is a language of enigma and subtlety. Things are not always what they seem. And choosing to know it deeply is not, actually, something for the beginner coder (or the faint-hearted).<\/p>\n<p>I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed a little tour of some of the subtleties.

        "content": "<h2>I don&#8217;t know JS<\/h2>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve kinda got <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2017\/01\/2016-transition-2017-accepting-the-inevitable\/\">stuck in to learning JavaScript<\/a>. I&#8217;ve previously said that I think JavaScript is like the assembler of the web: coding in vanilla JS isn&#8217;t really something you should do because it&#8217;s too easy to get things wrong, so you should have a layer of abstraction on top.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;oddly&#8230;I&#8217;ve actually really got into vanilla JS.<\/p>\n<p>I was thinking about the origin of this and I think it was that I got stuck reading ES6 code, or was baffled by it in the <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/learning-vue-step-by-step\">Laracasts Vue.js tutorials<\/a>. So I started doing <a href=\"https:\/\/es6.io\/\">Wes Bos&#8217;s ES6 tutorials<\/a> (paid but excellent &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/es6-cliffsnotes\">Laracasts also now has an ES6\/ES2015 series<\/a>) and it kinda went from there.<\/p>\n<p>On suggestion from a friend, I got a couple of\u00a0Kyle Simpson\u2019s excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/wordery.com\/search?term=you+don%27t+know+js&#038;oid=1625_1\">You Don\u2019t Know JS books<\/a> (<- Note: affiliate link!), and have got stuck into the first one: Up and Going. Which is short (about 50 pages of real content), but...well.\n\nMy mind has been blown.\n\n\n<h2>JS: Behind the scenes<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m the kinda person that likes to know what&#8217;s going on behind the scenes. And I&#8217;ve never really understood exactly how JavaScript works. And so learning it form first principles is quite revelatory. It&#8217;s actually very different to other languages that I was brought up on in quite a number of ways. So no wonder it always baffled and freaked me out a little.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the quirks\/oddities\/differences that I&#8217;ve discovered along the way.<\/p>\n<h3>Values are typed, variables are not<\/h3>\n<p>Yep. This may seem obvious, but it&#8217;s actually quite a shift of thinking from someone who&#8217;s previously coded in strictly-typed languages. I&#8217;ve never even come across the phrase &#8220;values are typed&#8221; before.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean?<\/p>\n<p>Well, in other languages you have typed variables. So when you declare a variable you give it a type:<\/p>\n<p><code>int age = 0;<\/code><\/p>\n<p>for example. This can be handy because the program can detect when a value that is not an integer is assigned to the variable, which can catch errors. But it&#8217;s also constraining because you can&#8217;t assign, say, a <code>null<\/code>\u00a0or <code>false<\/code>\u00a0value to say that there isn&#8217;t a number yet.<\/p>\n<p>Does it affect how I code? Probably not. But it&#8217;s good to know and understand.<\/p>\n<h3>Equality shenanigans<\/h3>\n<p>On top of type coercion (more below) when doing equality, and issues with comparing references (also see below) there&#8217;s also this list of unusual values and their equal-nesses. \u00a0Some of these are really quite bizarre:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>0 === -0\u00a0\/\/ \u00a0true - what the heck is -0 anyway?<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code>NaN === NaN \/\/ false, because NaN is defined to be unequal to any other value<\/code><\/li>\n<li>and so on<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What does this mean? Well, it&#8217;s just stuff you need to know.<\/p>\n<p>Does it affect how I code? Not in a big way. It may help with debugging when values aren&#8217;t what you expect them to be.\u00a0It&#8217;s knowledge that&#8217;s also helpful for the odd challenges at &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/alf.nu\/ReturnTrue\">return true<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<h3>Objects\/Arrays\/etc are assigned and passed as references<\/h3>\n<p>Forgive me if I don&#8217;t get my terminology exactly right, but &#8220;non-primitive&#8221; values like objects and arrays are passed around as references.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean?<\/p>\n<p>Well, if the same object is assigned to two variables &#8211; which is possible because assignment is of the reference and not a copied value &#8211; then updating one will update the other:<\/p>\n<pre>let a = {\r\n  x: 1,\r\n  y: 2\r\n};\r\nlet b = a;\r\nb.x = 4;\r\nconsole.log(a);\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Logs:<\/p>\n<pre>[object Object] {\r\n  x: 4,\r\n  y: 2\r\n}<\/pre>\n<p>Does it affect how I code? Yes. Stuff like this is REALLY good to know.<\/p>\n<h3>Objects\/Arrays\/etc equality is not by value<\/h3>\n<p>The fact that non-primitives are assigned and passed by reference also means that comparisons are also made on references, not values.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean? So you have:<br \/>\n<code>[1,2,3] == [1,2,3] \/\/ false - they are two different arrays<\/code><br \/>\nAnd also, if you want to copy an array you have to do it via some other means than simple assignment (the ES6 rest\/spread operator helps here).<\/p>\n<p>I also learned that when coerced to a string, arrays are joined with a comma!:<br \/>\n<code>[1,2,3] == \"1,2,3\" \/\/ true!<\/code><br \/>\nDoes this affect how I code?<\/p>\n<p>Yes. Be careful with non-primitives!<\/p>\n<h3>Object wrappers &#8211; e.g. `String` vs `string`<\/h3>\n<p>I confess I still don&#8217;t understand this &#8211; need to do more reading. But:<\/p>\n<pre>typeof(\"a\"); \/\/\u00a0gives \"string\"<\/pre>\n<p>but string values are actually &#8220;wrapped&#8221; by the type <code>String<\/code>. And this &#8220;wrapping&#8221; is also true for all primitive types. \u00a0So you can see this:<\/p>\n<pre>a = new String;\r\n\r\ntypeof(a); \/\/ gives \"object\"\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>I&#8217;m not quite sure what it means yet and I don&#8217;t think it will affect my programming. But who knows what else I&#8217;ll find out?<\/p>\n<h3>Inequality not the same as (symmetric) non-equality &#8211; WHAT?!?!<\/h3>\n<p>This line appears in one of the books and also, at first, confused me:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The ! forms [of equality operators] are of course the symmetric &#8220;not equal&#8221; versions of their counterparts; <em>non-equality<\/em> should not be confused with <em>inequality<\/em>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s later on made&#8230;hmm&#8230;clearer (?) that <em>inequality<\/em> is the greater-than, less-than and so-on conditional operators.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean? Oh. Well. Nothing. It was an interesting interlude though.<\/p>\n<p>Onwards. What else?<\/p>\n<h3>Oh. Equality?<\/h3>\n<p>So with the knowledge that values, not variables, are typed, some other things need to be put into place.<\/p>\n<p>One of which is the equality operators. They aren&#8217;t &#8220;typed equality&#8221; and &#8220;untyped equality&#8221;. They\u00a0are actually compare-without-coercion and compare-with-coercion.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean? Well, it means that understanding the coercion can help you understand how to write correct conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Does this\u00a0affect my code? \u00a0I think so, in subtle ways. It should make things a bit more predictable.<\/p>\n<h3>Hoisting applies to functions too&#8230;sort of?<\/h3>\n<p>I only learned about variable hoisting recently while learning about <code>let<\/code>\u00a0and <code>const<\/code>\u00a0in ES6.<\/p>\n<p>With non-ES6 <code>var<\/code>\u00a0declarations, if you make them in the middle of a scope they are &#8220;hoisted&#8221; to the top of the scope. So when the code is running, the variable exists in an undefined state in the scope until the point of the <code>var<\/code>\u00a0declaration. \u00a0Best explained in an example. Here we use a variable without ever declaring it (you&#8217;ll need to put this in a file and run it, not just type it into the console):<\/p>\n<pre>console.log(x);\r\n\r\n&gt;\u00a0ReferenceError: x is not defined<\/pre>\n<p>Then if we use the variable before later declaring it:<\/p>\n<pre>console.log(x);\r\n\r\nvar x = 4;\r\n\r\n&gt; undefined<\/pre>\n<p>Spot the difference!<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean?<\/p>\n<p>Well not much in reality, though it was good to understand.<\/p>\n<p>What is interesting is that function declaration is also effectively variable declaration, and so functions can be used before they are declared&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;oh&#8230;hang on. \u00a0They&#8217;re hoisted AND DEFINED!:<\/p>\n<pre>foo();\r\n\r\nfunction foo() {\r\n console.log('foo');\r\n}\r\n\r\n&gt; \"foo\"<\/pre>\n<p>That&#8217;s not <code>undefined<\/code>. OK. I&#8217;m curious now. So what happens if I&#8230;:<\/p>\n<pre>bar();\r\n\r\nvar bar = function() {\r\n console.log('bar');\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; TypeError: bar is not a function<\/pre>\n<p>Oh. Well, that&#8217;s not entirely simple then.<\/p>\n<p>Will this affect my code? Probably not, but it&#8217;s good to know how both variables and functions are hoisted, even if the behaviour is slightly different in a way that I don&#8217;t currently understand.<\/p>\n<h3>Initial variable assignment without var makes a global<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;d forgotten this! I used to not use <code>var<\/code>\u00a0at all when declaring variables and was forever accidentally making globals.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean? \u00a0That I&#8217;ve already been on a journey of learning JavaScript long enough that I&#8217;ve forgotten about this.<\/p>\n<p>Will it affect my code? Well, no. But it&#8217;s a good reminder of how far I&#8217;ve come, even before the last few months.<\/p>\n<h2>What do I think of JS now?<\/h2>\n<p>Well so far so geeky. \u00a0Let&#8217;s wrap up.<\/p>\n<p>This almost feels more like research than practical learning. Though I&#8217;m hopeful that learning these things will have very positive practical benefits. I&#8217;m coming to know JavaScript as a fascinating and mis-understood teenager of a language.<\/p>\n<p>I still don&#8217;t like it. I <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2013\/12\/treachery-code\/\">still wouldn&#8217;t want anyone to learn it as a first language<\/a>. In fact, in some ways, understanding it more reinforces this view.<\/p>\n<p>JavaScript is a language of enigma and subtlety. Things are not always what they seem. And choosing to know it deeply is not, actually, something for the beginner coder (or the faint-hearted).<\/p>\n<p>I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed a little tour of some of the subtleties. I hope that you have learned something new. And I hope that you are encouraged to learn more!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>I had a blast last year at <a href=\"https:\/\/2016.london.wordcamp.org\/\">WordCamp London<\/a> and got some great feedback on <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.tv\/2016\/05\/28\/ross-wintle-user-experience-its-for-everyone\/\">my talk<\/a> &#8211; my first go at big conference speaking. So I was encouraged to apply to speak again at <a href=\"https:\/\/2017.london.wordcamp.org\/\">this year&#8217;s event<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Despite being a highly technical person, I find the idea of doing a technical talk quite hard, and I assume that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">lots<\/span> of technical people apply to speak about technical things at WordCamps. So, as with last year, I&#8217;ve tried to give a technical person&#8217;s view on something non-technical. \u00a0This year: how and why you can use screencasts for user training.<\/p>\n<p>I should clarify a few things about this talk.<\/p>\n<h2>The term &#8220;screencasts&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>OK, naming things is hard. \u00a0I&#8217;ve used the term &#8220;screencasts&#8221; because it&#8217;s kinda trendy. \u00a0The &#8220;screen&#8221; bit of it is fine &#8211; I will be talking about sharing what&#8217;s going on on your screen with others. \u00a0But the &#8220;casts&#8221; part could be interpreted as being like a &#8220;broadcast&#8221;. So\u00a0I want to make clear that I&#8217;ll be talking about private screen recordings that you produce <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">only<\/span> for your clients, more than I will be talking about public screencast training like you might see on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lynda.com\/\">Lynda.com<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wp101.com\/\">WP101<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/\">Laracasts<\/a>, and so on. \u00a0This is not a talk about becoming a public training figure and running public courses &#8211; though I will challenge listeners to give something back to the WordPress community!<\/p>\n<p>So, maybe &#8220;screen recordings&#8221;, or, more generically &#8220;videos&#8221; is more appropriate. But I like &#8220;screencasts&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that I&#8217;ll be covering use of video both with and without narration, and the use of animated GIF&#8217;s. So don&#8217;t worry if you hate the sound of your own voice &#8211; there&#8217;s still some great value tips and tricks in here.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2553\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/screencasts-intro.gif\" alt=\"Screencasts talk intro - animated GIF\" width=\"848\" height=\"637\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Not just &#8220;to train users&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>OK, naming things is hard. I&#8217;ve put &#8220;to train users&#8221; in the title of my talk for brevity, and that&#8217;s a major topic. But actually the uses for screen recordings go beyond training. I&#8217;ll be talking about using screen recordings for customer support, software development, internal communications, and possibly marketing too.<\/p>\n<h2>It&#8217;s not for everyone, but actually, it is for everyone!<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m really aware that I&#8217;m presenting an alternative to in-person training. For me this is a real boon because though happy users are incredibly important to me, software development\u00a0is my main area of expertise and where I bring most value. \u00a0I \u00a0also do most of my work remotely for smaller clients with smaller budgets. So in my world in-person training is expensive and has several drawbacks.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">your<\/span> business makes money from in-person training. And in which case this talk may not be for you. BUT&#8230;hear me out. Because I think that screen-recorded training can make a great addition to personal, face-to-face events. And I&#8217;ll explain why that is the case<\/p>\n<h2>Interested? Let&#8217;s go!<\/h2>\n<p>Sound interesting? Well, if not then maybe something else on <a href=\"https:\/\/2017.london.wordcamp.org\/schedule\/\">the schedule<\/a> does. I&#8217;m really excited at this years range of talks. And the event is being so very thoughtfully organised with accessibility at its core, a creche for parents, and so many brilliant little touches. And if you&#8217;re attending the conference, ask me about the contributor day on the Friday too &#8211; it&#8217;s a brilliant way to be involved in WordPress and far less scary than it actually sounds.<\/p>\n<p>Tickets are&#8230;I still can&#8217;t quite believe it&#8230;just \u00a330! And they&#8217;re selling fast. As I write this there are just 28 left. Go visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/2017.london.wordcamp.org\/tickets\/\">box office<\/a> now! \u00a0And if your nervous or have any questions about WordCamps then drop me a line.<\/p>\n<p>See you there!<\/p>\n",

        "title": "WordCamp London 2017: How and why to use screencasts to train users",
        "content": "<p>I had a blast last year at <a href=\"https:\/\/2016.london.wordcamp.org\/\">WordCamp London<\/a> and got some great feedback on <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.tv\/2016\/05\/28\/ross-wintle-user-experience-its-for-everyone\/\">my talk<\/a> &#8211; my first go at big conference speaking. So I was encouraged to apply to speak again at <a href=\"https:\/\/2017.london.wordcamp.org\/\">this year&#8217;s event<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Despite being a highly technical person, I find the idea of doing a technical talk quite hard, and I assume that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">lots<\/span> of technical people apply to speak about technical things at WordCamps. So, as with last year, I&#8217;ve tried to give a technical person&#8217;s view on something non-technical. \u00a0This year: how and why you can use screencasts for user training.<\/p>\n<p>I should clarify a few things about this talk.<\/p>\n<h2>The term &#8220;screencasts&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>OK, naming things is hard. \u00a0I&#8217;ve used the term &#8220;screencasts&#8221; because it&#8217;s kinda trendy. \u00a0The &#8220;screen&#8221; bit of it is fine &#8211; I will be talking about sharing what&#8217;s going on on your screen with others. \u00a0But the &#8220;casts&#8221; part could be interpreted as being like a &#8220;broadcast&#8221;. So\u00a0I want to make clear that I&#8217;ll be talking about private screen recordings that you produce <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">only<\/span> for your clients, more than I will be talking about public screencast training like you might see on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lynda.com\/\">Lynda.com<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wp101.com\/\">WP101<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/\">Laracasts<\/a>, and so on. \u00a0This is not a talk about becoming a public training figure and running public courses &#8211; though I will challenge listeners to give something back to the WordPress community!<\/p>\n<p>So, maybe &#8220;screen recordings&#8221;, or, more generically &#8220;videos&#8221; is more appropriate. But I like &#8220;screencasts&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that I&#8217;ll be covering use of video both with and without narration, and the use of animated GIF&#8217;s. So don&#8217;t worry if you hate the sound of your own voice &#8211; there&#8217;s still some great value tips and tricks in here.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2553\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/screencasts-intro.gif\" alt=\"Screencasts talk intro - animated GIF\" width=\"848\" height=\"637\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Not just &#8220;to train users&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>OK, naming things is hard. I&#8217;ve put &#8220;to train users&#8221; in the title of my talk for brevity, and that&#8217;s a major topic. But actually the uses for screen recordings go beyond training. I&#8217;ll be talking about using screen recordings for customer support, software development, internal communications, and possibly marketing too.<\/p>\n<h2>It&#8217;s not for everyone, but actually, it is for everyone!<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m really aware that I&#8217;m presenting an alternative to in-person training. For me this is a real boon because though happy users are incredibly important to me, software development\u00a0is my main area of expertise and where I bring most value. \u00a0I \u00a0also do most of my work remotely for smaller clients with smaller budgets. So in my world in-person training is expensive and has several drawbacks.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">your<\/span> business makes money from in-person training. And in which case this talk may not be for you. BUT&#8230;hear me out. Because I think that screen-recorded training can make a great addition to personal, face-to-face events. And I&#8217;ll explain why that is the case<\/p>\n<h2>Interested? Let&#8217;s go!<\/h2>\n<p>Sound interesting? Well, if not then maybe something else on <a href=\"https:\/\/2017.london.wordcamp.org\/schedule\/\">the schedule<\/a> does. I&#8217;m really excited at this years range of talks. And the event is being so very thoughtfully organised with accessibility at its core, a creche for parents, and so many brilliant little touches. And if you&#8217;re attending the conference, ask me about the contributor day on the Friday too &#8211; it&#8217;s a brilliant way to be involved in WordPress and far less scary than it actually sounds.<\/p>\n<p>Tickets are&#8230;I still can&#8217;t quite believe it&#8230;just \u00a330! And they&#8217;re selling fast. As I write this there are just 28 left. Go visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/2017.london.wordcamp.org\/tickets\/\">box office<\/a> now! \u00a0And if your nervous or have any questions about WordCamps then drop me a line.<\/p>\n<p>See you there!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<h1>WordCamp London 2017 Review<\/h1>\n<p>I&#8217;m on the train heading home from WordCamp London 2017 &#8211; the annual London WordPress conference &#8211; and, with the crazy week ahead that I have, I know that if I don&#8217;t write up my thoughts now it will never happen.<\/p>\n<h2>Thanks<\/h2>\n<p>First of all a HUGE thanks to the organising team, volunteers, speakers, sponsors, caterers, venue staff, volunteers (yes &#8211; twice) and organising team (yes &#8211; twice). This event is a huge undertaking. Their dedication is immense and the amount of work they put in is enormous.<\/p>\n<h2>Contributor day<\/h2>\n<p>Contributor day &#8211; the day when people gather to give back to the WordPress project &#8211; was brilliant. I did my first contributor day last year at WordCamp Brighton and loved it.<\/p>\n<p>I spent a fair bit of this day getting development environments working for both myself and other people. This seems like it&#8217;s &#8220;not contributing&#8221; but getting people going is key to future contributions. I reviewed a patch, dug into code to find some information for another contributor and&#8230;yeah&#8230;did some little things that nudged the project along.<\/p>\n<h2>Saturday Talks<\/h2>\n<p>The talks this year were outstanding. I mean, they are every year. But as I was someone who was speaking towards the end of the second day I found myself feeling a bit unworthy as I sat through high-quality session after high-quality session. The talks were hard-hitting, informative, emotional, creative, beautiful, and consistently excellent in both content and delivery.<\/p>\n<p>My Saturday started with Wendie Huis in t Veld explaining the importance of the community and code of conduct, complete with her own tale of acceptance, encouragement and love from the WordPress community. There were more then a few tears in the room. It was extraordinarily brave of Wendie to share this as her first conference talk as the opening conference talk of the event, in her non-native language. Brilliant.<\/p>\n<p>Crispin Read on Object Oriented User Experience had some great ideas on how to take briefs\/requirements and break them down in easy-to-understand ways. I will be applying his ideas to my work as soon as I can.<\/p>\n<p>Heather Burns then took us on a journey of understanding how important our work and roles are in the current political climate. Website creators and owners have the ability to help people, and to harm them. We need to be informed. We need to take action. We need to be brave. Data protection, the GDPR, privacy impact assessments, and ethically dropping tables were all talked about. Challenging, but SO important. I wish the room had been full.<\/p>\n<p>Mik Scarlett explained &#8211; in entertaining and informative fashion &#8211; the importance of accessibility and how we can &#8220;sell it&#8221; as part of our projects. Again, accessibility is something we should all be working into our projects, but it&#8217;s sometime hard to get that &#8220;buy in&#8221;. It&#8217;s challenging, but it&#8217;s the RIGHT thing to do. Mik gave us some great arguments and resources to help us along. And he wished he could have sent us onwards to a practical talk about HOW to do accessibility well afterwards.<\/p>\n<p>Ending with a super-useful panel about diversity and empowerment in the tech industry meant that my day had been full of learning about the difficulty responsibilities that come with building and owning websites. Accessibility, diversity, inclusivity, and privacy are all part of our jobs as website developers and coders. But they are all bigger issues than just the technology: people are involved. And that makes them both all the more important, and all the more difficult to get right.<\/p>\n<h2>Sunday Talks<\/h2>\n<p>The later start on Sunday was appreciated. Especially as my day started with John Blackbourn diving deep into the roles and responsibilities API of WordPress. Technical stuff, but with some brilliant insight from a WordPress core developer.<\/p>\n<p>This was followed by Dave Walker&#8217;s talk &#8220;The WordPress Cartoonist &#8211; A User&#8217;s Perspective&#8221;. Dave was also a new speaker and I thought it was BRILLIANT that he got to share his experiences. He was highly entertaining and can be hugely proud. I love that this community, which mainly revolves around a software tool, not only makes (extra-)ordinary users welcome and puts on an event that they enjoy and get stuff out of, but accepts talks from new people who have a story to tell or knowledge to share. I really hope Dave will speak again.<\/p>\n<p>I missed most of the rest of the Sunday preparing for and recovering from my own talk. Thanks to all who came, you were very gracious about my relatively dull, slide-heavy, fact-pact, thing.<\/p>\n<h2>The People<\/h2>\n<p>The people, the people, the people. A diverse and gentle and welcoming and funny and clever gathering of minds. I made friends. I connected with old friends. We shared stories. We encouraged one another in our work and creative endeavours. It was great to be one of the people.<\/p>\n<h2>The Glowing Feedback<\/h2>\n<p>I love, love, LOVE how the organisers of this event take on feedback from attendees. They genuinely listen, and the work SO hard to make the event accessible and to meet everyone&#8217;s needs.<\/p>\n<p>This year I was particularly thankful for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The excellent Wifi &#8211; I had no issues at all. It was fast and reliable. I hardly noticed it was there. Which is awesome. A big thumbs up.<\/li>\n<li>The lunch organisation. It seems there were issues last year with queueing and so on, but they were totally resolved this year. A well-done high-five for that.<\/li>\n<li>The &#8220;Hello&#8221; tables &#8211; I didn&#8217;t use them, but the idea of a specific area to go to meet people if you&#8217;re on your own was excellent.<\/li>\n<li>The creche and children. I do hope they had a good weekend. It was great to see the creche being well used and families attending at WordCamp.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Some ideas<\/h2>\n<p>I have thought, before, about how standing up and talking to a room full of people isn&#8217;t everyone&#8217;s idea of fun. So how can events like this tap into the wisdom and knowledge wrapped up inside the (many) introverts and sensitive and anxious people who might really fear the stage?<\/p>\n<p>So, two things have sprung to mind:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>WordCamp Radio: We could have pre-recorded audio talks or interviews available somehow to people at the conference. This would allow people to record and edit their contribution. They would have to be OK about their own voice, but they would not have to fear the stage or the live element of public speaking. And they wouldn&#8217;t have to make slides. They could take feedback online, or perhaps have a session in a room where people can ask them questions.<\/li>\n<li>WordCamp Newspaper\/Magazine: A printed publication, available to participants, would be a way to publish written content for those who want to write rather than speak. It would also be great for sponsorship with ad placements available, and sponsored content, and would be a great take-home momento for attendees.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that both of these would require huge effort to produce, but I leave them here on the table and would love to see other ideas about how those uncomfortable with public speaking could share their knowledge.<\/p>\n<h2>Summing up<\/h2>\n<p>Web development, running a business, and being a creator or engineer are all hard things. Events like this are refreshing, energising, inspiring, engaging, informative. Touch points in the year when we share our challenges, find solutions, discover what we didn&#8217;t know we didn&#8217;t know, and find new companions on the journey.<\/p>\n<p>This year&#8217;s event was supremely well-run, full of quality content, and just what I needed as I head into a busy-looking year.<\/p>\n<p>And I couldn&#8217;t end without a special thanks to Jenny Wong who has been lead organiser for two (or possibly three?) years. She puts extraordinary effort into making this event happen. She is bold, decisive, forward thinking and WordCamp London would not be the awesome event that it now is without her dedication and hard work.<\/p>\n<p>May I offer a standing ovation for all who made this event happen.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h1>WordCamp London 2017 Review<\/h1>\n<p>I&#8217;m on the train heading home from WordCamp London 2017 &#8211; the annual London WordPress conference &#8211; and, with the crazy week ahead that I have, I know that if I don&#8217;t write up my thoughts now it will never happen.<\/p>\n<h2>Thanks<\/h2>\n<p>First of all a HUGE thanks to the organising team, volunteers, speakers, sponsors, caterers, venue staff, volunteers (yes &#8211; twice) and organising team (yes &#8211; twice). This event is a huge undertaking. Their dedication is immense and the amount of work they put in is enormous.<\/p>\n<h2>Contributor day<\/h2>\n<p>Contributor day &#8211; the day when people gather to give back to the WordPress project &#8211; was brilliant. I did my first contributor day last year at WordCamp Brighton and loved it.<\/p>\n<p>I spent a fair bit of this day getting development environments working for both myself and other people. This seems like it&#8217;s &#8220;not contributing&#8221; but getting people going is key to future contributions. I reviewed a patch, dug into code to find some information for another contributor and&#8230;yeah&#8230;did some little things that nudged the project along.<\/p>\n<h2>Saturday Talks<\/h2>\n<p>The talks this year were outstanding. I mean, they are every year. But as I was someone who was speaking towards the end of the second day I found myself feeling a bit unworthy as I sat through high-quality session after high-quality session. The talks were hard-hitting, informative, emotional, creative, beautiful, and consistently excellent in both content and delivery.<\/p>\n<p>My Saturday started with Wendie Huis in t Veld explaining the importance of the community and code of conduct, complete with her own tale of acceptance, encouragement and love from the WordPress community. There were more then a few tears in the room. It was extraordinarily brave of Wendie to share this as her first conference talk as the opening conference talk of the event, in her non-native language. Brilliant.<\/p>\n<p>Crispin Read on Object Oriented User Experience had some great ideas on how to take briefs\/requirements and break them down in easy-to-understand ways. I will be applying his ideas to my work as soon as I can.<\/p>\n<p>Heather Burns then took us on a journey of understanding how important our work and roles are in the current political climate. Website creators and owners have the ability to help people, and to harm them. We need to be informed. We need to take action. We need to be brave. Data protection, the GDPR, privacy impact assessments, and ethically dropping tables were all talked about. Challenging, but SO important. I wish the room had been full.<\/p>\n<p>Mik Scarlett explained &#8211; in entertaining and informative fashion &#8211; the importance of accessibility and how we can &#8220;sell it&#8221; as part of our projects. Again, accessibility is something we should all be working into our projects, but it&#8217;s sometime hard to get that &#8220;buy in&#8221;. It&#8217;s challenging, but it&#8217;s the RIGHT thing to do. Mik gave us some great arguments and resources to help us along. And he wished he could have sent us onwards to a practical talk about HOW to do accessibility well afterwards.<\/p>\n<p>Ending with a super-useful panel about diversity and empowerment in the tech industry meant that my day had been full of learning about the difficulty responsibilities that come with building and owning websites. Accessibility, diversity, inclusivity, and privacy are all part of our jobs as website developers and coders. But they are all bigger issues than just the technology: people are involved. And that makes them both all the more important, and all the more difficult to get right.<\/p>\n<h2>Sunday Talks<\/h2>\n<p>The later start on Sunday was appreciated. Especially as my day started with John Blackbourn diving deep into the roles and responsibilities API of WordPress. Technical stuff, but with some brilliant insight from a WordPress core developer.<\/p>\n<p>This was followed by Dave Walker&#8217;s talk &#8220;The WordPress Cartoonist &#8211; A User&#8217;s Perspective&#8221;. Dave was also a new speaker and I thought it was BRILLIANT that he got to share his experiences. He was highly entertaining and can be hugely proud. I love that this community, which mainly revolves around a software tool, not only makes (extra-)ordinary users welcome and puts on an event that they enjoy and get stuff out of, but accepts talks from new people who have a story to tell or knowledge to share. I really hope Dave will speak again.<\/p>\n<p>I missed most of the rest of the Sunday preparing for and recovering from my own talk. Thanks to all who came, you were very gracious about my relatively dull, slide-heavy, fact-pact, thing.<\/p>\n<h2>The People<\/h2>\n<p>The people, the people, the people. A diverse and gentle and welcoming and funny and clever gathering of minds. I made friends. I connected with old friends. We shared stories. We encouraged one another in our work and creative endeavours. It was great to be one of the people.<\/p>\n<h2>The Glowing Feedback<\/h2>\n<p>I love, love, LOVE how the organisers of this event take on feedback from attendees. They genuinely listen, and the work SO hard to make the event accessible and to meet everyone&#8217;s needs.<\/p>\n<p>This year I was particularly thankful for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The excellent Wifi &#8211; I had no issues at all. It was fast and reliable. I hardly noticed it was there. Which is awesome. A big thumbs up.<\/li>\n<li>The lunch organisation. It seems there were issues last year with queueing and so on, but they were totally resolved this year. A well-done high-five for that.<\/li>\n<li>The &#8220;Hello&#8221; tables &#8211; I didn&#8217;t use them, but the idea of a specific area to go to meet people if you&#8217;re on your own was excellent.<\/li>\n<li>The creche and children. I do hope they had a good weekend. It was great to see the creche being well used and families attending at WordCamp.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Some ideas<\/h2>\n<p>I have thought, before, about how standing up and talking to a room full of people isn&#8217;t everyone&#8217;s idea of fun. So how can events like this tap into the wisdom and knowledge wrapped up inside the (many) introverts and sensitive and anxious people who might really fear the stage?<\/p>\n<p>So, two things have sprung to mind:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>WordCamp Radio: We could have pre-recorded audio talks or interviews available somehow to people at the conference. This would allow people to record and edit their contribution. They would have to be OK about their own voice, but they would not have to fear the stage or the live element of public speaking. And they wouldn&#8217;t have to make slides. They could take feedback online, or perhaps have a session in a room where people can ask them questions.<\/li>\n<li>WordCamp Newspaper\/Magazine: A printed publication, available to participants, would be a way to publish written content for those who want to write rather than speak. It would also be great for sponsorship with ad placements available, and sponsored content, and would be a great take-home momento for attendees.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that both of these would require huge effort to produce, but I leave them here on the table and would love to see other ideas about how those uncomfortable with public speaking could share their knowledge.<\/p>\n<h2>Summing up<\/h2>\n<p>Web development, running a business, and being a creator or engineer are all hard things. Events like this are refreshing, energising, inspiring, engaging, informative. Touch points in the year when we share our challenges, find solutions, discover what we didn&#8217;t know we didn&#8217;t know, and find new companions on the journey.<\/p>\n<p>This year&#8217;s event was supremely well-run, full of quality content, and just what I needed as I head into a busy-looking year.<\/p>\n<p>And I couldn&#8217;t end without a special thanks to Jenny Wong who has been lead organiser for two (or possibly three?) years. She puts extraordinary effort into making this event happen. She is bold, decisive, forward thinking and WordCamp London would not be the awesome event that it now is without her dedication and hard work.<\/p>\n<p>May I offer a standing ovation for all who made this event happen.<\/p>\n",

But you&#8217;re always wondering &#8220;what if&#8230;?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>And this side project allows people to post short notices. It&#8217;s a niche social network, in effect.<\/p>\n<p>But when you&#8217;re developing something where people can post anything, you start down the road of thinking about terms and conditions, getting permission\/licences to publish content, acceptable use rules, even the possibility of moderation and blocking.<\/p>\n<p>So, I think I&#8217;ve decided that this really is not worth it. I don&#8217;t want to build a niche social network. It seems like an exciting prospect at first, but it only takes a little thought to realise that it&#8217;s a bad idea.<\/p>\n<p>So, if anything I (may) be building a niche anti-social network.<\/p>\n<p>Will it ever see the light of day? I both hope so, and suspect not. Let&#8217;s see.<\/p>\n",

But you&#8217;re always wondering &#8220;what if&#8230;?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>And this side project allows people to post short notices. It&#8217;s a niche social network, in effect.<\/p>\n<p>But when you&#8217;re developing something where people can post anything, you start down the road of thinking about terms and conditions, getting permission\/licences to publish content, acceptable use rules, even the possibility of moderation and blocking.<\/p>\n<p>So, I think I&#8217;ve decided that this really is not worth it. I don&#8217;t want to build a niche social network. It seems like an exciting prospect at first, but it only takes a little thought to realise that it&#8217;s a bad idea.<\/p>\n<p>So, if anything I (may) be building a niche anti-social network.<\/p>\n<p>Will it ever see the light of day? I both hope so, and suspect not. Let&#8217;s see.<\/p>\n",
