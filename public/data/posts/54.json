Changing the world isn&#8217;t easy, but organisations like Tearfund, Christian Aid, and Oxfam provide plenty of good resources to help us badger big businesses, and make our views known to our MPs.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes this feels futile.  If lucky you get a standard letter or email back to your campaigning message and, though we see some token gestures to some of the issues that we raise, it&#8217;s rare that the things that we ask for are actually implemented in full.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of campaigning going on lately regarding a piece of legislation called the climate change bill.  This is going to commit our country to major reductions in carbon emissions.  I&#8217;ve written to several members of parliament and sent postcards and emails about this issue because I really believe that it&#8217;s something we need to do &#8211; and sooner rather than later.<\/p>\n<p>So I was heartened today to read this Guardian article about how, not only has the government included the full emissions reductions in the bill, but it&#8217;s decided to incorporate shipping and aviation emissions as well.  This is exactly what I and many other people have been campaigning for.<\/p>\n<p>I particularly like Thom Yorke&#8217;s encouragement that &#8220;it came about simply because hundreds of thousands of people on the ground hassled their MP, who in turn hassled the government. Amazing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So, if you care about something, find an organisation that can help you campaign about it, and get writing.  Sometimes it really does work!<\/p>\n",

Changing the world isn&#8217;t easy, but organisations like Tearfund, Christian Aid, and Oxfam provide plenty of good resources to help us badger big businesses, and make our views known to our MPs.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes this feels futile.  If lucky you get a standard letter or email back to your campaigning message and, though we see some token gestures to some of the issues that we raise, it&#8217;s rare that the things that we ask for are actually implemented in full.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of campaigning going on lately regarding a piece of legislation called the climate change bill.  This is going to commit our country to major reductions in carbon emissions.  I&#8217;ve written to several members of parliament and sent postcards and emails about this issue because I really believe that it&#8217;s something we need to do &#8211; and sooner rather than later.<\/p>\n<p>So I was heartened today to read this Guardian article about how, not only has the government included the full emissions reductions in the bill, but it&#8217;s decided to incorporate shipping and aviation emissions as well.  This is exactly what I and many other people have been campaigning for.<\/p>\n<p>I particularly like Thom Yorke&#8217;s encouragement that &#8220;it came about simply because hundreds of thousands of people on the ground hassled their MP, who in turn hassled the government. Amazing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So, if you care about something, find an organisation that can help you campaign about it, and get writing.  Sometimes it really does work!<\/p>\n",

Masses of it.  It&#8217;s awesome!  Everyday, English creatures that exist all around us that you start to notice once you get close to the ground.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Earthworms<\/span>: There are masses of them in our garden.  Hundreds&#8230;probably many thousands.  They&#8217;re brilliantly camouflaged (yes, really, they look like plant roots!), live underground, and help to break down our soil and compost.  Brilliant.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Frogs<\/span>: We don&#8217;t have a pond but we do have lots of clay-y soil and it&#8217;s moisture rich.  There&#8217;s also a large patch of our garden that hasn&#8217;t been weeded and has a thick layer of grass and weeds on it.  This provides ample cover for the little amphibians and there&#8217;s lots of them around.  Also brilliantly camouflaged, they give you a real fright when they unexpectedly hop out of the grass.  You have to be careful not to step on them at night though!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Spiders<\/span>: If you were reading last year you&#8217;ll know I love <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2007\/09\/naturewatch-fat-spider.html\">a good spider<\/a> or two!  And though we&#8217;ve moved house, we have plenty of arachnids in the new neighbourhood.  Amazing co-ordination and web building skills.  Awesome creatures.  And there&#8217;s a surprisingly large amount of them that just scuttle around on the ground too.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Bees: <\/span>I&#8217;m not a huge fan of wasps (of which we&#8217;ve not seen very many this year), but bees are more tolerable.  They seem to defy physics by flying, elegantly drifting from one flower to the next.  They seem to come from far and wide in little teams to visit our plants.  And, of course, we wouldn&#8217;t have our fruits without their pollinating.  Sadly, bees are rumoured to be in decline.  We may well be setting up a little log or something next year to encourage bees to nest in our garden.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Everything else<\/span>: There&#8217;s beetles, ants, slugs and snails, weevils, grubs, caterpillars, centipedes. Really a plethora of different tiny creatures who make up the eco-system that is our garden.  Some of them we love, some of them we hate, but they&#8217;re all important in keeping the ground workable and fertile.<\/p>\n<p>Nature is truly an awesome thing and when you get close to it you start to realise that even more.  We praise God for the amazing things that has made, the detail of each little creature and the incredibly complex way that it all works together to bring us our food.<\/p>\n",

Masses of it.  It&#8217;s awesome!  Everyday, English creatures that exist all around us that you start to notice once you get close to the ground.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Earthworms<\/span>: There are masses of them in our garden.  Hundreds&#8230;probably many thousands.  They&#8217;re brilliantly camouflaged (yes, really, they look like plant roots!), live underground, and help to break down our soil and compost.  Brilliant.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Frogs<\/span>: We don&#8217;t have a pond but we do have lots of clay-y soil and it&#8217;s moisture rich.  There&#8217;s also a large patch of our garden that hasn&#8217;t been weeded and has a thick layer of grass and weeds on it.  This provides ample cover for the little amphibians and there&#8217;s lots of them around.  Also brilliantly camouflaged, they give you a real fright when they unexpectedly hop out of the grass.  You have to be careful not to step on them at night though!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Spiders<\/span>: If you were reading last year you&#8217;ll know I love <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2007\/09\/naturewatch-fat-spider.html\">a good spider<\/a> or two!  And though we&#8217;ve moved house, we have plenty of arachnids in the new neighbourhood.  Amazing co-ordination and web building skills.  Awesome creatures.  And there&#8217;s a surprisingly large amount of them that just scuttle around on the ground too.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Bees: <\/span>I&#8217;m not a huge fan of wasps (of which we&#8217;ve not seen very many this year), but bees are more tolerable.  They seem to defy physics by flying, elegantly drifting from one flower to the next.  They seem to come from far and wide in little teams to visit our plants.  And, of course, we wouldn&#8217;t have our fruits without their pollinating.  Sadly, bees are rumoured to be in decline.  We may well be setting up a little log or something next year to encourage bees to nest in our garden.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Everything else<\/span>: There&#8217;s beetles, ants, slugs and snails, weevils, grubs, caterpillars, centipedes. Really a plethora of different tiny creatures who make up the eco-system that is our garden.  Some of them we love, some of them we hate, but they&#8217;re all important in keeping the ground workable and fertile.<\/p>\n<p>Nature is truly an awesome thing and when you get close to it you start to realise that even more.  We praise God for the amazing things that has made, the detail of each little creature and the incredibly complex way that it all works together to bring us our food.<\/p>\n",

            },
            "content": {
                "rendered": "<p>Recently someone asked if there was a good tool for dumping lots of stuff that was in their head in a GTD (<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Getting_Things_Done\">Getting Things Done<\/a>) manner.<\/p>\n<p>I use a tool called<a href=\"http:\/\/groups.google.com\/group\/wikidpad\/web\/home?pli=1\"> Wikidpad<\/a> for this. It&#8217;s a desktop Wiki, which enabled you to write short or long notes, and link them together in a variety of ways &#8211; in much the same way as a web-based Wiki.  But it&#8217;s not very well documented and there&#8217;s not tutorial for using it.  So here&#8217;s my own little guide to how I use it.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to cover the basics of Wikis &#8211; you can read about them elsewhere.  Wikidpad uses simple CamelCase as WikiWords that automatically become links to other pages (though you can suppress this for specified words).<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d recommend opening the help Wiki and looking at the pages TextFormatting, TodoItems and WikiDocumentAttributes as a starting point.<\/p>\n<p>For me, what really makes Wikidpad useful is its auto-indexed attributes and todo-type tags.  Not only do your pages appear in a tree showing their location within the Wiki (essentially creating folders of related information), but you can also create hierarchical attributes that are<br \/>indexed and then displayed as a tree in the &#8220;Views&#8221; section.  This is essentially an index of information that you&#8217;ve &#8220;tagged&#8221; with attributes.<\/p>\n<p>For example, I can have a &#8220;Customer&#8221; attribute.  If I put the text &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">[Customer:New Technologies Inc]<\/span>&#8221; on a page, this will create, in the index, a customer folder, containing a New Technologies Inc folder, containing all the pages with that attribute.<\/p>\n<p>This is HUGELY useful because it means I can &#8220;tag&#8221; information in a whole multitude of different ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By customer<\/li>\n<li>By any number of different references that may exist (e.g. a request for change reference).<\/li>\n<li>How&#8217;s about atrtributes by date?  I can effectively create a journal by using attributes like &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">[Diary.2008.10:07]<\/span>&#8221; &#8211; then everything I did on that date is referenced from the index views under 2008 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 07.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Another example is meetings &#8211; I write up meeting notes in my wiki with<br \/>attributes for like:<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:courier new;\">[Diary.2008.18:15]<br \/>[Customer:Random Corp]<br \/>[Meetings.Present:Dave Smith]<br \/>[Meetings.Present:Joe Bloggs]<\/p>\n<p>Thus helping me answer questions like &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that mentioned in a meeting with Dave back in November?&#8221; quickly and easily.<\/p>\n<p>The todo&#8217;s are good too.  I can use keywords like &#8220;action&#8221;, &#8220;todo&#8221;, &#8220;done&#8221;, &#8220;track&#8221; and &#8220;question&#8221; to gather items that need my attention. If I write &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">action: Send documentation to account manager<\/span>&#8220;, this will appear in the index under my actions.  These can also be nested &#8211; so I can classify actions.  e.g. &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">todo.Personal: Book next year&#8217;s holiday<\/span>&#8220;, or &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">action.Objectives:Deliver storage improvement project<\/span>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not entirely clear in on the GTD philosophy &#8211; I know a little &#8211; but this is great, it allows me to group all my meeting actions and todo&#8217;s together, review them in one go, pick off the little ones that can be cleared down easily, and then focus on the bigger ones.<\/p>\n<p>The only thing that this doesn&#8217;t really allow is setting deadlines.  But I&#8217;m sure you could use some combination of todo&#8217;s and attributes to do this.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, it&#8217;s the combination of a page hierarchy (as in a standard Wiki), todos, and attributes, that make this tool powerful and flexible. You can really customise it to how you want to work!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, these&#8217;s a full search facililty, as well as the ability to produce lists of backlinks, rename pages while keeping WikiWords consistent, and you can do neat things like add little icons to your<br \/>hierarchy of pages.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit clunky at first but worth persevering with &#8211; it really has become my second brain (and it&#8217;s backed up to a memory stick FREQUENTLY!).  I also export all the pages to HTML every now and then so that Google Desktop can index them too.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully that&#8217;s of use to someone.  Enjoy!  And if you&#8217;ve any other tips for productivity, let me know!<\/p>\n",

Wikidpad uses simple CamelCase as WikiWords that automatically become links to other pages (though you can suppress this for specified words).<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d recommend opening the help Wiki and looking at the pages TextFormatting, TodoItems and WikiDocumentAttributes as a starting point.<\/p>\n<p>For me, what really makes Wikidpad useful is its auto-indexed attributes and todo-type tags.  Not only do your pages appear in a tree showing their location within the Wiki (essentially creating folders of related information), but you can also create hierarchical attributes that are<br \/>indexed and then displayed as a tree in the &#8220;Views&#8221; section.  This is essentially an index of information that you&#8217;ve &#8220;tagged&#8221; with attributes.<\/p>\n<p>For example, I can have a &#8220;Customer&#8221; attribute.  If I put the text &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">[Customer:New Technologies Inc]<\/span>&#8221; on a page, this will create, in the index, a customer folder, containing a New Technologies Inc folder, containing all the pages with that attribute.<\/p>\n<p>This is HUGELY useful because it means I can &#8220;tag&#8221; information in a whole multitude of different ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By customer<\/li>\n<li>By any number of different references that may exist (e.g. a request for change reference).<\/li>\n<li>How&#8217;s about atrtributes by date?  I can effectively create a journal by using attributes like &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">[Diary.2008.10:07]<\/span>&#8221; &#8211; then everything I did on that date is referenced from the index views under 2008 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 07.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Another example is meetings &#8211; I write up meeting notes in my wiki with<br \/>attributes for like:<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:courier new;\">[Diary.2008.18:15]<br \/>[Customer:Random Corp]<br \/>[Meetings.Present:Dave Smith]<br \/>[Meetings.Present:Joe Bloggs]<\/p>\n<p>Thus helping me answer questions like &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that mentioned in a meeting with Dave back in November?&#8221; quickly and easily.<\/p>\n<p>The todo&#8217;s are good too.  I can use keywords like &#8220;action&#8221;, &#8220;todo&#8221;, &#8220;done&#8221;, &#8220;track&#8221; and &#8220;question&#8221; to gather items that need my attention. If I write &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">action: Send documentation to account manager<\/span>&#8220;, this will appear in the index under my actions.  These can also be nested &#8211; so I can classify actions.  e.g. &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">todo.Personal: Book next year&#8217;s holiday<\/span>&#8220;, or &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">action.Objectives:Deliver storage improvement project<\/span>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not entirely clear in on the GTD philosophy &#8211; I know a little &#8211; but this is great, it allows me to group all my meeting actions and todo&#8217;s together, review them in one go, pick off the little ones that can be cleared down easily, and then focus on the bigger ones.<\/p>\n<p>The only thing that this doesn&#8217;t really allow is setting deadlines.  But I&#8217;m sure you could use some combination of todo&#8217;s and attributes to do this.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, it&#8217;s the combination of a page hierarchy (as in a standard Wiki), todos, and attributes, that make this tool powerful and flexible. You can really customise it to how you want to work!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, these&#8217;s a full search facililty, as well as the ability to produce lists of backlinks, rename pages while keeping WikiWords consistent, and you can do neat things like add little icons to your<br \/>hierarchy of pages.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit clunky at first but worth persevering with &#8211; it really has become my second brain (and it&#8217;s backed up to a memory stick FREQUENTLY!).  I also export all the pages to HTML every now and then so that Google Desktop can index them too.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully that&#8217;s of use to someone.  Enjoy!  And if you&#8217;ve any other tips for productivity, let me know!<\/p>\n",

They won&#8217;t mean much to some so I&#8217;ll try and explain.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>&#8220;Discipleship&#8221; is lots of things.  For me it&#8217;s the process of being a disciple of Jesus Christ, learning his ways, following in his footsteps, trying to lead a godly life.  What&#8217;s a godly life you might ask?  Well, part of the process is finding that out.  There are general rules but it&#8217;s worked out in different ways for each person, and each time.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We&#8217;ve just had a new youth minister start at our church and he&#8217;s really interested in helping people on this journey and is exploring ways of doing this.  Discipleship Academy and SoulSpace are two of these things.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Discipleship Academy<\/span> is mostly for the young people of our church, but I&#8217;m tagging along as a &#8220;fellow journeyer&#8221;.  I&#8217;m hesitant to call myself a &#8220;leader&#8221; in this activity because I&#8217;m actually going through the process myself.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>This is intended to be 12, monthly sessions looking at, and equipping us to do discipleship.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I missed the first session, but went along today and it was really inspiring.  The youth minister has produced a set of what I would call &#8220;tools&#8221; (things like study, reading, finding space, journalling and attending church) which we&#8217;re all discussing the use of and encouraging each other to actually do.  It was really good and I&#8217;m sure that these tools and sessions will be useful for us all as we try to do &#8220;discipleship&#8221; together.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">SoulSpace<\/span> is the new minister giving our Sunday evening church service a bit of an overhaul.  We won&#8217;t be doing this every week, but it will happen 2 weekends every month.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The idea of this is that rather than do a typical church service (a &#8220;hymn sandwich&#8221; as he called it today), we&#8217;ll be trying to do church things in different ways.  Sometimes we&#8217;ll sing, sometimes we wont.  Sometimes there will be a talk from the front.  Sometimes we&#8217;ll have group discussions.  Sometimes we&#8217;ll have other creative forms of worship or prayer.  We&#8217;ll just try, as a community, to learn from God and respond to him in different ways.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>And community is key in both of these activities.  This is something we&#8217;ll do together.  But also something that is not confined to Sunday evenings &#8211; the things we learn, the things we&#8217;re encouraged to do, will, hopefully, spill over into the rest of our lives.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>So tonight we&#8217;ve looked at:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>using the Bible as a tool.  How can we use it?  How do we break it down into bite-sized chunks, read it, understand it, and apply it to our lives; and<\/li>\n<li>authenticity &#8211; being real.  How do we carry all this church stuff with us in our daily lives.  Are we honest with people about who we are, and what we believe in?  Or do we hide for fear of being &#8220;found out&#8221; and embarassed about that key part of our lives: our faith?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>These are both difficult things to grapple with &#8211; Jesus didn&#8217;t promise us following him would be easy.  But I&#8217;ve been really inspired tonight in both these things, and the fact that a little pocket of people around me are also grappling with them helps a LOT.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We also had a really good church service this morning.  The speaker did lots of storytelling, which I always find a powerful way of communicating.  The story was of Joseph and the key thing I got from it was that he wasn&#8217;t called by God.  He didn&#8217;t have God speaking from a burning bush like Moses, or a revelation from angels or anything like that.  He just did what he thought he should be doing and God lead him and worked through him.  Some people have things that God clearly wants them to do, but the rest of us shouldn&#8217;t feel left out &#8211; God can do great things through all of us who follow him, wherever we are!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>It&#8217;s weird writing publicly about my faith, but in the interests of taking a step in discipleship and being real, I feel I must be writing more about what God is doing and saying.  My faith is more important than my cycling, gardening, housework, DIY, music and technology interests, but that probably doesn&#8217;t come across here.  I hope it will in future!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;ve had an inspiring evening with these two little events.  They won&#8217;t mean much to some so I&#8217;ll try and explain.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>&#8220;Discipleship&#8221; is lots of things.  For me it&#8217;s the process of being a disciple of Jesus Christ, learning his ways, following in his footsteps, trying to lead a godly life.  What&#8217;s a godly life you might ask?  Well, part of the process is finding that out.  There are general rules but it&#8217;s worked out in different ways for each person, and each time.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We&#8217;ve just had a new youth minister start at our church and he&#8217;s really interested in helping people on this journey and is exploring ways of doing this.  Discipleship Academy and SoulSpace are two of these things.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Discipleship Academy<\/span> is mostly for the young people of our church, but I&#8217;m tagging along as a &#8220;fellow journeyer&#8221;.  I&#8217;m hesitant to call myself a &#8220;leader&#8221; in this activity because I&#8217;m actually going through the process myself.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>This is intended to be 12, monthly sessions looking at, and equipping us to do discipleship.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I missed the first session, but went along today and it was really inspiring.  The youth minister has produced a set of what I would call &#8220;tools&#8221; (things like study, reading, finding space, journalling and attending church) which we&#8217;re all discussing the use of and encouraging each other to actually do.  It was really good and I&#8217;m sure that these tools and sessions will be useful for us all as we try to do &#8220;discipleship&#8221; together.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">SoulSpace<\/span> is the new minister giving our Sunday evening church service a bit of an overhaul.  We won&#8217;t be doing this every week, but it will happen 2 weekends every month.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The idea of this is that rather than do a typical church service (a &#8220;hymn sandwich&#8221; as he called it today), we&#8217;ll be trying to do church things in different ways.  Sometimes we&#8217;ll sing, sometimes we wont.  Sometimes there will be a talk from the front.  Sometimes we&#8217;ll have group discussions.  Sometimes we&#8217;ll have other creative forms of worship or prayer.  We&#8217;ll just try, as a community, to learn from God and respond to him in different ways.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>And community is key in both of these activities.  This is something we&#8217;ll do together.  But also something that is not confined to Sunday evenings &#8211; the things we learn, the things we&#8217;re encouraged to do, will, hopefully, spill over into the rest of our lives.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>So tonight we&#8217;ve looked at:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>using the Bible as a tool.  How can we use it?  How do we break it down into bite-sized chunks, read it, understand it, and apply it to our lives; and<\/li>\n<li>authenticity &#8211; being real.  How do we carry all this church stuff with us in our daily lives.  Are we honest with people about who we are, and what we believe in?  Or do we hide for fear of being &#8220;found out&#8221; and embarassed about that key part of our lives: our faith?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>These are both difficult things to grapple with &#8211; Jesus didn&#8217;t promise us following him would be easy.  But I&#8217;ve been really inspired tonight in both these things, and the fact that a little pocket of people around me are also grappling with them helps a LOT.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We also had a really good church service this morning.  The speaker did lots of storytelling, which I always find a powerful way of communicating.  The story was of Joseph and the key thing I got from it was that he wasn&#8217;t called by God.  He didn&#8217;t have God speaking from a burning bush like Moses, or a revelation from angels or anything like that.  He just did what he thought he should be doing and God lead him and worked through him.  Some people have things that God clearly wants them to do, but the rest of us shouldn&#8217;t feel left out &#8211; God can do great things through all of us who follow him, wherever we are!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>It&#8217;s weird writing publicly about my faith, but in the interests of taking a step in discipleship and being real, I feel I must be writing more about what God is doing and saying.  My faith is more important than my cycling, gardening, housework, DIY, music and technology interests, but that probably doesn&#8217;t come across here.  I hope it will in future!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

I&#8217;ve taken up darts!!!<\/p>\n<p>We have a cultural change program going on at work and we have a glorified sports and social club in our office.  One of the things this little committee (that I&#8217;m a part of) have done is install a darts board.<\/p>\n<p>And I must confess, I&#8217;ve really rather taken to the game, but it&#8217;s also caused me some problems.  I should add the the squeamish <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">can<\/span> read on, there are no descriptions of gory holes in the head or feet coming up.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Darts Players and Culture<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m slightly baffed by darts players and culture. Given the list of attributes above, you&#8217;d maybe expect the stereotypical darts player to be a geeky, thin, glasses-wearing mathematician type.<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s slightly confusing that it&#8217;s mostly played by hairy, overweight man who&#8217;ve spent too long in the pub.<\/p>\n<p>And what&#8217;s with all the women that are forced to follow it.  IF you ever watch it on the telly there&#8217;s always bikini-clad models walking around.  At work, we ordered the board, surround, scoring machine and a few sets of darts from a company called Red Dragon Darts.  When it arrived it came with a catalogue which was more soft-porn than precision sport.  I don&#8217;t link to their website for similar reasons &#8211; I almost couldn&#8217;t condone them as supplier!<\/p>\n<p>Bizarre.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Game<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The game is quite addictive you know.  Having invested \u00a312 (not much really) in my own darts (it&#8217;s much better if you get used to a set that you always use) I not only play the odd game, but I&#8217;m practicing by playing solitaire &#8220;round-the-clock&#8221; &#8211; hit all the numbers from 1 to 20 in order.<\/p>\n<p>You have to get worse before you get better too.  When you start you could hit pretty much anything, but, aiming for twenty, as you do, you usually end up hitting anything from 12 through to 18.  12 and 18 give you pretty good scores.  As you improve that range narrows, and you start hitting more 1&#8217;s and 5&#8217;s.  These are NOT good scores.  This is the stage I&#8217;m at.<\/p>\n<p>As for hitting doubles&#8230;that&#8217;s a different matter altogether.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dangers!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I said it was dangerous.  Shortly after I started playing my shoulder started to ache.  I thought this was a general wearing-out type pain, but then Sally said &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s the darts?&#8221;, and I think she&#8217;s right.  It puts a lot of tension on very specific parts of the arm, and the repetitive action can certainly take it&#8217;s toll.<\/p>\n<p>Also&#8230;you may remember my stomach pain from my long bike ride a couple of months back (see the bottom half of <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/pre-holiday-cycling-news.html\">this post<\/a>), well, I reckon this has actually turned out to be darts-related too.  When I throw my arrows I tend to lean forward and put all my weight on my front (right) leg.  I think my hip flexor was getting quite a lot of strain put on it by this with the result that cycling made it flare up and become painful.<\/p>\n<p>Not kidding&#8230;you can really do yourself an injury playing darts.  And not necessarily one that involves being hit with a pointy stick.<\/p>\n<p>You have been warned!<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ve taken up darts!!!<\/p>\n<p>We have a cultural change program going on at work and we have a glorified sports and social club in our office.  One of the things this little committee (that I&#8217;m a part of) have done is install a darts board.<\/p>\n<p>And I must confess, I&#8217;ve really rather taken to the game, but it&#8217;s also caused me some problems.  I should add the the squeamish <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">can<\/span> read on, there are no descriptions of gory holes in the head or feet coming up.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Darts Players and Culture<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m slightly baffed by darts players and culture. Given the list of attributes above, you&#8217;d maybe expect the stereotypical darts player to be a geeky, thin, glasses-wearing mathematician type.<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s slightly confusing that it&#8217;s mostly played by hairy, overweight man who&#8217;ve spent too long in the pub.<\/p>\n<p>And what&#8217;s with all the women that are forced to follow it.  IF you ever watch it on the telly there&#8217;s always bikini-clad models walking around.  At work, we ordered the board, surround, scoring machine and a few sets of darts from a company called Red Dragon Darts.  When it arrived it came with a catalogue which was more soft-porn than precision sport.  I don&#8217;t link to their website for similar reasons &#8211; I almost couldn&#8217;t condone them as supplier!<\/p>\n<p>Bizarre.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Game<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The game is quite addictive you know.  Having invested \u00a312 (not much really) in my own darts (it&#8217;s much better if you get used to a set that you always use) I not only play the odd game, but I&#8217;m practicing by playing solitaire &#8220;round-the-clock&#8221; &#8211; hit all the numbers from 1 to 20 in order.<\/p>\n<p>You have to get worse before you get better too.  When you start you could hit pretty much anything, but, aiming for twenty, as you do, you usually end up hitting anything from 12 through to 18.  12 and 18 give you pretty good scores.  As you improve that range narrows, and you start hitting more 1&#8217;s and 5&#8217;s.  These are NOT good scores.  This is the stage I&#8217;m at.<\/p>\n<p>As for hitting doubles&#8230;that&#8217;s a different matter altogether.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dangers!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I said it was dangerous.  Shortly after I started playing my shoulder started to ache.  I thought this was a general wearing-out type pain, but then Sally said &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s the darts?&#8221;, and I think she&#8217;s right.  It puts a lot of tension on very specific parts of the arm, and the repetitive action can certainly take it&#8217;s toll.<\/p>\n<p>Also&#8230;you may remember my stomach pain from my long bike ride a couple of months back (see the bottom half of <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/pre-holiday-cycling-news.html\">this post<\/a>), well, I reckon this has actually turned out to be darts-related too.  When I throw my arrows I tend to lean forward and put all my weight on my front (right) leg.  I think my hip flexor was getting quite a lot of strain put on it by this with the result that cycling made it flare up and become painful.<\/p>\n<p>Not kidding&#8230;you can really do yourself an injury playing darts.  And not necessarily one that involves being hit with a pointy stick.<\/p>\n<p>You have been warned!<\/p>\n",

Most of this will probably mean nothing to any of you and for that I make absolutely no apology whatsoever.<\/p>\n<p>This whole post is a bit of a brag, but it&#8217;s writing up what&#8217;s been an intriguing afternoon\/evening for me too.<\/p>\n<p>I have a pretty strong background in Software Engineering, but I&#8217;m a bit behind with the times.  I don&#8217;t really know much about how people go about developing applications these days.  It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been meaning to get to grips with for a while.  Today I&#8217;ve been playing a bit with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.symfony-project.org\/\">Symfony<\/a> &#8211; a PHP-based web development framework, with the aim of re-writing the database using a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Symfony.  If you really care I&#8217;m using an installation of MoWes on a USB stick to keep this all portable so I can develop from work or home.  Thanks must go to those on Twitter who have thrown some of these technologies my way.<\/p>\n<p>Web-based applications seem to be the way of things at the moment (unless you&#8217;re doing hard-core coding for things like OS&#8217;s or embedded systems, which I&#8217;m not).  And all the little projects I can either get my hands on, or dream up, are all web-apps that would benefit from a rapid-application development (RAD) type approach.<\/p>\n<p>This has sort-of been happening a bit at work as I look after a database with a web-based front-end.  This is currently written in PHP, outputting static HTML (i.e. no JavaScript) but when I wrote it I tried to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>abstract the database operations;<\/li>\n<li>separate the data model and the presentation so that the code didn&#8217;t need to be updated when new fields got added, deleted, etc.;<\/li>\n<li>create some generic code for those things that remained the same for all pages (cookies\/authentication, standard menus, banners, etc).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit clunky but it works well and the time spent coding the abstractions has saved me a lot of time with subsequent modifications.<\/p>\n<p>So it was a surprise to find that most of what I&#8217;ve done, or tried to do, fits with the principles on which application frameworks are based (see the Fundamental Concepts section of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.symfony-project.org\/book\/1_1\/01-Introducing-Symfony\">Symfony book<\/a> I&#8217;m reading).  The terminology is all a bit much to take in in one go, but essentially I was doing things right.<\/p>\n<p>Or is it a surprise?  My computing teachers were always keen to teach us good principles like abstraction, and I&#8217;ve always held that my fundamentals are good.  So maybe it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that learning to use Symfony is quick and easy.  I&#8217;m working my way through the tutorial, but without a lot of time it could easily leak from my head.<\/p>\n<p>Possibly more techie posts like this to come as I learn more.  Or maybe I&#8217;ll have rewritten the database before I get a chance to write again.  That&#8217;ll depend on how good all this new technolgoy really is!<\/p>\n",

Most of this will probably mean nothing to any of you and for that I make absolutely no apology whatsoever.<\/p>\n<p>This whole post is a bit of a brag, but it&#8217;s writing up what&#8217;s been an intriguing afternoon\/evening for me too.<\/p>\n<p>I have a pretty strong background in Software Engineering, but I&#8217;m a bit behind with the times.  I don&#8217;t really know much about how people go about developing applications these days.  It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been meaning to get to grips with for a while.  Today I&#8217;ve been playing a bit with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.symfony-project.org\/\">Symfony<\/a> &#8211; a PHP-based web development framework, with the aim of re-writing the database using a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Symfony.  If you really care I&#8217;m using an installation of MoWes on a USB stick to keep this all portable so I can develop from work or home.  Thanks must go to those on Twitter who have thrown some of these technologies my way.<\/p>\n<p>Web-based applications seem to be the way of things at the moment (unless you&#8217;re doing hard-core coding for things like OS&#8217;s or embedded systems, which I&#8217;m not).  And all the little projects I can either get my hands on, or dream up, are all web-apps that would benefit from a rapid-application development (RAD) type approach.<\/p>\n<p>This has sort-of been happening a bit at work as I look after a database with a web-based front-end.  This is currently written in PHP, outputting static HTML (i.e. no JavaScript) but when I wrote it I tried to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>abstract the database operations;<\/li>\n<li>separate the data model and the presentation so that the code didn&#8217;t need to be updated when new fields got added, deleted, etc.;<\/li>\n<li>create some generic code for those things that remained the same for all pages (cookies\/authentication, standard menus, banners, etc).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit clunky but it works well and the time spent coding the abstractions has saved me a lot of time with subsequent modifications.<\/p>\n<p>So it was a surprise to find that most of what I&#8217;ve done, or tried to do, fits with the principles on which application frameworks are based (see the Fundamental Concepts section of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.symfony-project.org\/book\/1_1\/01-Introducing-Symfony\">Symfony book<\/a> I&#8217;m reading).  The terminology is all a bit much to take in in one go, but essentially I was doing things right.<\/p>\n<p>Or is it a surprise?  My computing teachers were always keen to teach us good principles like abstraction, and I&#8217;ve always held that my fundamentals are good.  So maybe it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that learning to use Symfony is quick and easy.  I&#8217;m working my way through the tutorial, but without a lot of time it could easily leak from my head.<\/p>\n<p>Possibly more techie posts like this to come as I learn more.  Or maybe I&#8217;ll have rewritten the database before I get a chance to write again.  That&#8217;ll depend on how good all this new technolgoy really is!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>I&#8217;m a cyclist &#8211; you can probably tell that &#8211; and I love all sports of different kinds.  But there&#8217;s one that I&#8217;ve never got on with&#8230;running!  It knackers my kness and every time I try to take it up I have to give up quite quickly because I&#8217;m in pain.<\/p>\n<p>So instead, I tend to run by proxy.  I know so many people who are really into running, and I engage with other runners by talking about&#8230;err&#8230;other runners.  I&#8217;m a middle man in the running circles of Swindon.<\/p>\n<p>So, with today being the Swindon Half Marathon, my duty was not as a runner, but as a supporter.<\/p>\n<p>It was a beautiful day for it &#8211; if anything too hot &#8211; and Sally and I pedalled out on our bikes to a fine spot on the course where we would see people running out (at about 3 miles) and back in (at about 9 miles) from the same place.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m not really sure what to do as a running-race supporter, or how to cheer people on.  We clapped a lot.  In fact, we clapped almost non-stop for about 3 hours!  And we called people&#8217;s names and shouted things like &#8220;Well done&#8221; and &#8220;Keep Going&#8221;, but it all feels a bit lame.<\/p>\n<p>The hard core runners seem to view this as a distraction, and they keep focussed on the road ahead, barely acknowledging your presence.  The ones at the back seem to appreciate it more, and occasionally engage in some banter.  When I told one friend &#8220;Keep going!  You&#8217;re doing well!&#8221; he shouted back &#8220;No I&#8217;m not!&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So, I hope we helped some people along.<\/p>\n<p>It was quite inspiring too.  This was a small race of only around 1500 people, but it seemed to be a LOT from where we were standing.  My sister and her boyfriend are pretty quick but there were a surprisingly large number of people running at a similar pace.  It all made me think that surely running 13 miles is something that I could do.<\/p>\n<p>One friend of mine called back &#8220;Your turn next year Wintle!&#8221; as he ran past.  Perhaps he&#8217;s right.  Perhaps I should try again, take it easy, build up slowly and have a go at running with the aim of running next year&#8217;s Swindon Half.<\/p>\n<p>Hmmm&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>To finish, I pay my respect to those I know who ran.  I&#8217;m hugley impressed by their commitment and effort.  Sarah, Guy, Dave, Carol, James, Mike, Stevo, Ray&#8230;well done!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;m a cyclist &#8211; you can probably tell that &#8211; and I love all sports of different kinds.  But there&#8217;s one that I&#8217;ve never got on with&#8230;running!  It knackers my kness and every time I try to take it up I have to give up quite quickly because I&#8217;m in pain.<\/p>\n<p>So instead, I tend to run by proxy.  I know so many people who are really into running, and I engage with other runners by talking about&#8230;err&#8230;other runners.  I&#8217;m a middle man in the running circles of Swindon.<\/p>\n<p>So, with today being the Swindon Half Marathon, my duty was not as a runner, but as a supporter.<\/p>\n<p>It was a beautiful day for it &#8211; if anything too hot &#8211; and Sally and I pedalled out on our bikes to a fine spot on the course where we would see people running out (at about 3 miles) and back in (at about 9 miles) from the same place.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m not really sure what to do as a running-race supporter, or how to cheer people on.  We clapped a lot.  In fact, we clapped almost non-stop for about 3 hours!  And we called people&#8217;s names and shouted things like &#8220;Well done&#8221; and &#8220;Keep Going&#8221;, but it all feels a bit lame.<\/p>\n<p>The hard core runners seem to view this as a distraction, and they keep focussed on the road ahead, barely acknowledging your presence.  The ones at the back seem to appreciate it more, and occasionally engage in some banter.  When I told one friend &#8220;Keep going!  You&#8217;re doing well!&#8221; he shouted back &#8220;No I&#8217;m not!&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So, I hope we helped some people along.<\/p>\n<p>It was quite inspiring too.  This was a small race of only around 1500 people, but it seemed to be a LOT from where we were standing.  My sister and her boyfriend are pretty quick but there were a surprisingly large number of people running at a similar pace.  It all made me think that surely running 13 miles is something that I could do.<\/p>\n<p>One friend of mine called back &#8220;Your turn next year Wintle!&#8221; as he ran past.  Perhaps he&#8217;s right.  Perhaps I should try again, take it easy, build up slowly and have a go at running with the aim of running next year&#8217;s Swindon Half.<\/p>\n<p>Hmmm&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>To finish, I pay my respect to those I know who ran.  I&#8217;m hugley impressed by their commitment and effort.  Sarah, Guy, Dave, Carol, James, Mike, Stevo, Ray&#8230;well done!<\/p>\n",

\u00a0I mean, it was one of the best meals I&#8217;ve EVER had. \u00a0If you&#8217;re in the area and not staying at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.masseriadegliulivi.com\/\">Masseria degli Ulivi<\/a>, then at least go and eat there!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Monday was heading home day. \u00a0The SatNav took us on a VERY weird route to the airport and failed completely to find us a petrol station. \u00a0The small scratches to the car went unnoticed. \u00a0And we were amused by the presence of a large number of older English people on our plane, who&#8217;d obviously all booked with the same tour operator. \u00a0Hearing one of them ordering &#8220;Four cappucino americanos&#8221; made me feel that I&#8217;d done quite well with my Italian, and my order of &#8220;Due cappucini e una panina&#8221; felt quite authentic in comparison.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The English baggage collection was surprisingly swift and collecting the car from the car park was a doddle. \u00a0Re-learning driving on the left was interesting and my brain was well confused for a while, especially at junctions and when we hit the motorway. \u00a0But I quickly got back into it.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>A great holiday, with a little stressful day surrounded by some amazing places and food. \u00a0Summing up the holiday was mostly done in my first post. \u00a0Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/week-in-sicily-introduction.html\">the highlights<\/a> there.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I leave you with one thing that confused and amused us. \u00a0Now, my Italian isn&#8217;t great, by any means, but I can mostly get by with at least reading signs and notices. \u00a0This bottle baffled though,<br \/>\n as the best translation I could do of &#8220;Con il suo gusto morbido e delicato&#8230;&#8221; was &#8220;With the delicate taste of death&#8230;&#8221;<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWCzxrYfI\/AAAAAAAAEPA\/77ITc8XwifM\/s400\/IMG_1418.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWCzxrYfI\/AAAAAAAAEPA\/77ITc8XwifM\/s400\/IMG_1418.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:300px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Perhaps someone else knows better?<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Note: Google claims that &#8220;morbido&#8221; means &#8220;delicate&#8221;. \u00a0Hey &#8211; easy mistake to make!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWPlkYSiI\/AAAAAAAAEP4\/RYn57H9BtYE\/s400\/IMG_1436.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWPlkYSiI\/AAAAAAAAEP4\/RYn57H9BtYE\/s400\/IMG_1436.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:300px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

We stopped off next to a shallow pool on the way, for some lunch. \u00a0This really could have been a film set or something, it was almost unreal in its purity and beauty.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\">On returning to the car we set out to find some other, less spectacular Necropoli nearby, which were also quite spectacular. \u00a0Tombs, dwellings and even churches carved out of the rock amongst breathtaking scenery.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\">This place is mentioned in the Rough Guide, and is even one of the listed top 30 things to see\/do while there, but you could so easily pass it by. \u00a0&#8220;Who want&#8217;s to go and see a load of tombs?&#8221;, but this place is a true gem!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTVY1Nc6zI\/AAAAAAAAEM0\/geK80LITvPQ\/s400\/IMG_1384.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTVY1Nc6zI\/AAAAAAAAEM0\/geK80LITvPQ\/s400\/IMG_1384.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:300px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Palazzolo Acreide<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Leaving the Pantalica area we checked the Rough Guide to see what else was nearby, and decided to call in at a place called Palazzolo Acreide. \u00a0This small town has a great Archaelogical park. \u00a0It&#8217;s at the top of a fairly big hill, so we recommend taking the car up to the top if you can.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>This place is mostly well-preserved Greek tombs, dwellings and temples. \u00a0But it brings things slightly more to life because it&#8217;s all layed out as a small village. \u00a0You are almost transported back in time and you can imagine ancient people wandering around, meeting together and heading to worship. \u00a0It feels like a place with community, rather than just a random collection of ancient buildings and artifacts.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTVkJYt8TI\/AAAAAAAAENU\/Or5dSypWi20\/s400\/IMG_1390.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTVkJYt8TI\/AAAAAAAAENU\/Or5dSypWi20\/s400\/IMG_1390.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:300px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div>And the highlight of this place was the greek theatre. \u00a0Marvellously intact, with an entrace hallway, tunnels to walk through to your seats, and bits of the staging and set still on show.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Dinner back in Noto rounded off our day. \u00a0We found a reasonably good restaurant but the service was a bit brusque. \u00a0Never mind.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Sunday and Home<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Sunday was a real day of rest as we packed and prepared to head home. \u00a0Mostly spent around the hotel it was a good chance to chill out. \u00a0We blew a load of money on a last meal in the hotel which was GREAT! \u00a0I mean, it was one of the best meals I&#8217;ve EVER had. \u00a0If you&#8217;re in the area and not staying at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.masseriadegliulivi.com\/\">Masseria degli Ulivi<\/a>, then at least go and eat there!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Monday was heading home day. \u00a0The SatNav took us on a VERY weird route to the airport and failed completely to find us a petrol station. \u00a0The small scratches to the car went unnoticed. \u00a0And we were amused by the presence of a large number of older English people on our plane, who&#8217;d obviously all booked with the same tour operator. \u00a0Hearing one of them ordering &#8220;Four cappucino americanos&#8221; made me feel that I&#8217;d done quite well with my Italian, and my order of &#8220;Due cappucini e una panina&#8221; felt quite authentic in comparison.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The English baggage collection was surprisingly swift and collecting the car from the car park was a doddle. \u00a0Re-learning driving on the left was interesting and my brain was well confused for a while, especially at junctions and when we hit the motorway. \u00a0But I quickly got back into it.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>A great holiday, with a little stressful day surrounded by some amazing places and food. \u00a0Summing up the holiday was mostly done in my first post. \u00a0Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/week-in-sicily-introduction.html\">the highlights<\/a> there.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I leave you with one thing that confused and amused us. \u00a0Now, my Italian isn&#8217;t great, by any means, but I can mostly get by with at least reading signs and notices. \u00a0This bottle baffled though,<br \/>\n as the best translation I could do of &#8220;Con il suo gusto morbido e delicato&#8230;&#8221; was &#8220;With the delicate taste of death&#8230;&#8221;<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWCzxrYfI\/AAAAAAAAEPA\/77ITc8XwifM\/s400\/IMG_1418.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWCzxrYfI\/AAAAAAAAEPA\/77ITc8XwifM\/s400\/IMG_1418.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:300px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Perhaps someone else knows better?<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Note: Google claims that &#8220;morbido&#8221; means &#8220;delicate&#8221;. \u00a0Hey &#8211; easy mistake to make!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWPlkYSiI\/AAAAAAAAEP4\/RYn57H9BtYE\/s400\/IMG_1436.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWPlkYSiI\/AAAAAAAAEP4\/RYn57H9BtYE\/s400\/IMG_1436.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:300px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n",
