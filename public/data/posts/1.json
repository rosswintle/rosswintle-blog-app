My flatmate Mark rightly comments that:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You can make the Bible say pretty much what you want&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>A statement that I would refine to:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You can select parts of the Bible and interpret those parts in such a way that you can make them pretty much whatever you want&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>(This is a slight tangent but I believe that God&#8217;s word as a whole and interpreted correctly is not inconsistent &#8211; though I&#8217;m still working on that)<\/p>\n<p>The things I&#8217;ve been reading and hearing seem to take this approach. On the tape I was listening to a woman was explaining a Biblical view of Gender differences. I confess to being immediately sceptical of a woman talking about gender difference. I&#8217;d be equally sceptical of a man talking about the same topic though so you can&#8217;t really win.<\/p>\n<p>This woman, in my view, had an agenda that she wanted to tackle. In fact, she started her talk with a &#8220;hypothesis&#8221;. So much for coming to the God&#8217;s word with an open mind! She then proceeded to perform a very academic analysis of this hypothesis before turning to the Bible to see what it said. But she could only ever teach from a limited part of the Bible and she chose to focus on things which supported what she was talking about.<\/p>\n<p>The book was even worse, making huge statements (most of which I did agree with by the way) and then backing them up with a single verse (or less) of scripture.<\/p>\n<p>Grrr&#8230;..<\/p>\n<p>I think that the Bible is quite clearly split up to cover various different topics. Genesis is about creation, the fall, and the history of Israel. Sure, some of what it says applies to gender differences but surely we should turn to a book of the bible that&#8217;s specifically talking about that topic for God&#8217;s advice on it?<\/p>\n<p>Biblical inconsistency seems to happen when people take things out of context&#8230;I&#8217;m guilty of it myself. We need to recognise this and make sure that we use God&#8217;s word to mould our view of the world, not to support our own hypothesis about the world.<\/p>\n<p>Lord, help us all to be rooted in your word and to think about what people preach. Help us to back-up what people tell us with what you tell us. Help us not to be naive about what people preach us, but, respectfully, to think for ourselves too.<\/p>\n",

My flatmate Mark rightly comments that:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You can make the Bible say pretty much what you want&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>A statement that I would refine to:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You can select parts of the Bible and interpret those parts in such a way that you can make them pretty much whatever you want&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>(This is a slight tangent but I believe that God&#8217;s word as a whole and interpreted correctly is not inconsistent &#8211; though I&#8217;m still working on that)<\/p>\n<p>The things I&#8217;ve been reading and hearing seem to take this approach. On the tape I was listening to a woman was explaining a Biblical view of Gender differences. I confess to being immediately sceptical of a woman talking about gender difference. I&#8217;d be equally sceptical of a man talking about the same topic though so you can&#8217;t really win.<\/p>\n<p>This woman, in my view, had an agenda that she wanted to tackle. In fact, she started her talk with a &#8220;hypothesis&#8221;. So much for coming to the God&#8217;s word with an open mind! She then proceeded to perform a very academic analysis of this hypothesis before turning to the Bible to see what it said. But she could only ever teach from a limited part of the Bible and she chose to focus on things which supported what she was talking about.<\/p>\n<p>The book was even worse, making huge statements (most of which I did agree with by the way) and then backing them up with a single verse (or less) of scripture.<\/p>\n<p>Grrr&#8230;..<\/p>\n<p>I think that the Bible is quite clearly split up to cover various different topics. Genesis is about creation, the fall, and the history of Israel. Sure, some of what it says applies to gender differences but surely we should turn to a book of the bible that&#8217;s specifically talking about that topic for God&#8217;s advice on it?<\/p>\n<p>Biblical inconsistency seems to happen when people take things out of context&#8230;I&#8217;m guilty of it myself. We need to recognise this and make sure that we use God&#8217;s word to mould our view of the world, not to support our own hypothesis about the world.<\/p>\n<p>Lord, help us all to be rooted in your word and to think about what people preach. Help us to back-up what people tell us with what you tell us. Help us not to be naive about what people preach us, but, respectfully, to think for ourselves too.<\/p>\n",

Not a very big or good band, we&#8217;re just starting out really playing once a month, rocked up versions of contemporary Christian songs to God (&#8220;worship songs&#8221; for the uninitiated).  I love it, I&#8217;m passionate about it, I have fun doing it, it&#8217;s just great and it&#8217;s just me.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve found an unexpected benefit.  I feel like a part of a real community.<\/p>\n<p>Community is a huge thing.  The Bible&#8217;s quite clear about relationships and community being essential to life&#8230;it&#8217;s a Christian cliche but we were made to be in relationships with other people.<\/p>\n<p>I also believe that community is very difficult to find in a society like ours which is incredibly transitory.  I&#8217;ve not lived in one place for more than 2 years since I left in University and I still don&#8217;t have a clear idea of where I will settle.  Jobs, girlfriends, family and ourselves all contribute to make us move on quite often.  Christians in particular are often faced with the guilt trip of being in a &#8220;comfort zone&#8221; that they need to move out of.<\/p>\n<p>The band is just one example of something that achieves relationship, community and closeness through having common passions, aspirations and goals.<\/p>\n<p>I also play 6-a-side, an activity which I only started a few weeks ago but which has already made me a lot of friends.<\/p>\n<p>These things (and many others like them) should be examples to us of how to form community.  Christians should exist in community with each other because they share a common passion for Jesus and a common goal of seeing his kingdom on earth.  But we should also exist in community with people who don&#8217;t believe in our faith.<\/p>\n<p>We need to engage with those around us and that will require finding common ground.  Let us get out there and find what we have in common with out neighbours.  God wants us to and we might be surprised &#8211; maybe there are close friends waiting to be made.<\/p>\n",

Not a very big or good band, we&#8217;re just starting out really playing once a month, rocked up versions of contemporary Christian songs to God (&#8220;worship songs&#8221; for the uninitiated).  I love it, I&#8217;m passionate about it, I have fun doing it, it&#8217;s just great and it&#8217;s just me.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve found an unexpected benefit.  I feel like a part of a real community.<\/p>\n<p>Community is a huge thing.  The Bible&#8217;s quite clear about relationships and community being essential to life&#8230;it&#8217;s a Christian cliche but we were made to be in relationships with other people.<\/p>\n<p>I also believe that community is very difficult to find in a society like ours which is incredibly transitory.  I&#8217;ve not lived in one place for more than 2 years since I left in University and I still don&#8217;t have a clear idea of where I will settle.  Jobs, girlfriends, family and ourselves all contribute to make us move on quite often.  Christians in particular are often faced with the guilt trip of being in a &#8220;comfort zone&#8221; that they need to move out of.<\/p>\n<p>The band is just one example of something that achieves relationship, community and closeness through having common passions, aspirations and goals.<\/p>\n<p>I also play 6-a-side, an activity which I only started a few weeks ago but which has already made me a lot of friends.<\/p>\n<p>These things (and many others like them) should be examples to us of how to form community.  Christians should exist in community with each other because they share a common passion for Jesus and a common goal of seeing his kingdom on earth.  But we should also exist in community with people who don&#8217;t believe in our faith.<\/p>\n<p>We need to engage with those around us and that will require finding common ground.  Let us get out there and find what we have in common with out neighbours.  God wants us to and we might be surprised &#8211; maybe there are close friends waiting to be made.<\/p>\n",

There was no reason for it. I can only put it in the category of &#8220;depression&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Theories:<br \/>1) a combination of tiredness, stress, fighting off a bug, giving blood on Wednesday night, and hundred other things&#8230;I&#8217;ve not slept well for about 3 nights now.<br \/>2) my hay fever tablets.  I take loratadine, and have been on them on-and-off for a week or two.  After Googling them Sally found that they can cause depression.  Perhaps taking them after giving blood (and thus having a higher concentration of the stuff in my blood) made me really low.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway.  We eventually decided to both stay at home (which I feel very bad about).  We&#8217;ve sat around in the garden, read the paper, enjoyed the nesting birds (more later), and written a few letters.<\/p>\n<p>I can now empathise with people who&#8217;ve had depression.

However, I was just about to leave for the stag day I&#8217;m supposed to be at, when I collapsed in a heap and cried.  I was wept, on-and-off, and uncontrollably, for about 2 hours. There was no reason for it. I can only put it in the category of &#8220;depression&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Theories:<br \/>1) a combination of tiredness, stress, fighting off a bug, giving blood on Wednesday night, and hundred other things&#8230;I&#8217;ve not slept well for about 3 nights now.<br \/>2) my hay fever tablets.  I take loratadine, and have been on them on-and-off for a week or two.  After Googling them Sally found that they can cause depression.  Perhaps taking them after giving blood (and thus having a higher concentration of the stuff in my blood) made me really low.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway.  We eventually decided to both stay at home (which I feel very bad about).  We&#8217;ve sat around in the garden, read the paper, enjoyed the nesting birds (more later), and written a few letters.<\/p>\n<p>I can now empathise with people who&#8217;ve had depression.  It was scary feeling out of control of my emotions.  Just crying for no reason at all!<\/p>\n<p>I can only hope that it doesn&#8217;t come back.<\/p>\n",

We started out on Sustrans&#8217; National Cycle route 45, which is great BUT, in their wonderful efforts to get you off road as much as possible they don&#8217;t half put you on some narrow and gravelly tracks.  You can&#8217;t get much speed up at all on some of these.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; the NCN is a GREAT thing but sometimes you have to be a bit creative to get where you want in the way that you want.<\/p>\n<p>Good ride though!<\/p>\n",

We started out on Sustrans&#8217; National Cycle route 45, which is great BUT, in their wonderful efforts to get you off road as much as possible they don&#8217;t half put you on some narrow and gravelly tracks.  You can&#8217;t get much speed up at all on some of these.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; the NCN is a GREAT thing but sometimes you have to be a bit creative to get where you want in the way that you want.<\/p>\n<p>Good ride though!<\/p>\n",
