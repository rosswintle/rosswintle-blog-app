But&#8230; WHY???<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Some background<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I made a simple, app-like, completely static-file version of this site! It&#8217;s super-fast and pretty lightweight and it didn&#8217;t take very long. It&#8217;s here:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>https:\/\/m.rosswintle.uk\/<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s some of what I was trying to achieve and why&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Keeping it simple<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I find myself rebelling a lot against the complexity of modern web solutions. I&#8217;m a use-the-platform guy who firmly believes that the simple solutions are better, easier to make and maintain, faster, cheaper, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Proving things to myself<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m working with a lot of complexity at work: mostly building a headless site with React and Next.js and highly-scalable headless solutions involving many layers of caching and integration. This is right (maybe?) for the context of the work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve found myself wondering if a much simpler solution could achieve the same benefits &#8211; to <em>some<\/em> extent, at least.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to prove that there was a &#8220;headless&#8221; solution to websites that didn&#8217;t require node.js or a ton of heavy JavaScript framework code and a zillion dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Yes, I&#8217;m (probably) reinventing the wheel<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If I build a tool that scrapes all the content from the WordPress API and dumps it to some static format for serving as a static site, am I just making a poor-man&#8217;s Gatsby? Or Astro. Or&#8230; Next.js &#8211; the thing I&#8217;m proving that I don&#8217;t need? Or <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/simply-static\/\">Simply Static<\/a>? Is it not just what the JAMStack was doing all along for so many years?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, maybe. And one of the main reasons for using such a tool is that they handle all the complex edge cases that I&#8217;ve almost certainly not thought of yet and don&#8217;t have the constraints that I had. Probably the best reason I&#8217;ve been presented with for using Next.js for a web<em> site<\/em> (rather than a web <em>application<\/em>) is that if you start adding more and more code to handle features and use-cases, you end up with your own Next-like framework anyway, and it&#8217;s better to use a framework maintained by a framework expert! So I see the reasons you would do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I wanted to show what is possible with a very simple approach. It seems to me that you should be able to get a long way building a static site with a simple scraper script and a basic template.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with a bit of JavaScript, maybe using a small reactive framework, we can make it app-like too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Statically hosting all of this on a CDN means free hosting in the best case, and enormous scalability, and global edge serving in the other best case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I won&#8217;t do<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach had some hard constraints\/limitations:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>It will be slow to generate a large site<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It will need developer experience and tooling to use<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It won&#8217;t be able to do anything that requires server-side processing without some third party service (e.g. forms, signups, etc &#8211; though I DID find a way to do search!)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Template editing won&#8217;t be WYSIWYG &#8211; the resulting output will be pretty bland and made in HTML and CSS.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all limitations I&#8217;m happy to accept for my simple personal blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I made&#8230; it&#8217;s not finished, but it&#8217;s 80% of the way there:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/m.rosswintle.uk\/\">https:\/\/m.rosswintle.uk\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately the back-end is my regular WordPress blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The static version is built using a PHP-based CLI tool, using <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel-zero.com\/\">Laravel Zero<\/a> to scrape the content, restructure it and save it. It&#8217;s pretty efficient &#8211; the slowness is in the API queries. It builds my 750-page\/post site in about 80 seconds.<br><br>There&#8217;s then a simple HTML template and some <a href=\"https:\/\/alpinejs.dev\/\">AlpineJS<\/a> scripting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was really glad to stumble upon <a href=\"https:\/\/pagefind.app\/\">PageFind<\/a> &#8211; a tool that builds a static content index and that allows search. This makes everything a bit more dynamic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things I want to add in the future:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>History\/back\/forward navigation\/URL updates<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Page listing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ability to re-use the scrape\/build scripts across sites. They&#8217;re not quite site-agnostic yet, and I want to write some docs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a shorter list than I thought it would be before I started writing it! So that&#8217;s good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusions and thoughts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For many years I was pretty unimpressed by the JAMStack approach. I think because it always seemed to be querying some dynamic back-end anyway, so it felt like you had the complexity of a dynamic CMS AND the complexity of a dynamic front-end app, but without very much benefit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps I misunderstood. But it seemed like you had:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Static site generators: all static files, built at run time<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;JAMStack&#8221; sites: static templating, but pulling in dynamic content over an API<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As I&#8217;ve been moving from a &#8220;Spin up a WordPress site for every little project&#8221; approach to a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2023\/08\/free-websites-for-side-projects\/\">Make some static HTML files and host them for free<\/a>&#8221; approach, I&#8217;ve been thinking about how this model can be used more. It&#8217;s cheap. It&#8217;s secure. It&#8217;s fast. I love developing with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not what Next does. Next needs a back-end server and a zillion (ish) dependencies. And it&#8217;s better suited to applications that need lots of dynamic content, not a simple blog site. I remain that if you&#8217;re building a marketing site, the cost\/benefit of Next is low if not negative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s probably what <a href=\"https:\/\/astro.build\/\">Astro<\/a> does, but Astro also has &#8230; checks notes &#8230;  450 ish dependencies!! (Astro looks really interesting, very nicely done, and has <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.astro.build\/en\/guides\/cms\/wordpress\/#building-a-blog-with-wordpress-and-astro\">a guide on working with a WordPress blog\/site<\/a>!). There are probably other frameworks and site generators that can help too. I&#8217;m no expert in this area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My site has 93 JavaScript package dependencies, which is still too many, but most of them are via TailwindCSS which is entirely optional, which I trust, and which rarely breaks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My project also has a bunch of Composer\/PHP dependencies. But most of those are to create the CLI tool that does the scraping. These are not problematic. This stuff just works. It&#8217;s stable. And when it&#8217;s broken you get helpful errors. It&#8217;s not a world of pain like I find npm to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I proved the concept. I achieved my goals. I like this. It&#8217;s not perfect. But I will take it a bit further and see where I get to.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>This time it&#8217;s a static-file-driven, mobile-app-like blog. And the tooling I made should be usable on any simple WordPress blog! But&#8230; WHY???<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Some background<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I made a simple, app-like, completely static-file version of this site! It&#8217;s super-fast and pretty lightweight and it didn&#8217;t take very long. It&#8217;s here:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>https:\/\/m.rosswintle.uk\/<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s some of what I was trying to achieve and why&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Keeping it simple<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I find myself rebelling a lot against the complexity of modern web solutions. I&#8217;m a use-the-platform guy who firmly believes that the simple solutions are better, easier to make and maintain, faster, cheaper, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Proving things to myself<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m working with a lot of complexity at work: mostly building a headless site with React and Next.js and highly-scalable headless solutions involving many layers of caching and integration. This is right (maybe?) for the context of the work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve found myself wondering if a much simpler solution could achieve the same benefits &#8211; to <em>some<\/em> extent, at least.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to prove that there was a &#8220;headless&#8221; solution to websites that didn&#8217;t require node.js or a ton of heavy JavaScript framework code and a zillion dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Yes, I&#8217;m (probably) reinventing the wheel<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If I build a tool that scrapes all the content from the WordPress API and dumps it to some static format for serving as a static site, am I just making a poor-man&#8217;s Gatsby? Or Astro. Or&#8230; Next.js &#8211; the thing I&#8217;m proving that I don&#8217;t need? Or <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/simply-static\/\">Simply Static<\/a>? Is it not just what the JAMStack was doing all along for so many years?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, maybe. And one of the main reasons for using such a tool is that they handle all the complex edge cases that I&#8217;ve almost certainly not thought of yet and don&#8217;t have the constraints that I had. Probably the best reason I&#8217;ve been presented with for using Next.js for a web<em> site<\/em> (rather than a web <em>application<\/em>) is that if you start adding more and more code to handle features and use-cases, you end up with your own Next-like framework anyway, and it&#8217;s better to use a framework maintained by a framework expert! So I see the reasons you would do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I wanted to show what is possible with a very simple approach. It seems to me that you should be able to get a long way building a static site with a simple scraper script and a basic template.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with a bit of JavaScript, maybe using a small reactive framework, we can make it app-like too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Statically hosting all of this on a CDN means free hosting in the best case, and enormous scalability, and global edge serving in the other best case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I won&#8217;t do<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach had some hard constraints\/limitations:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>It will be slow to generate a large site<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It will need developer experience and tooling to use<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It won&#8217;t be able to do anything that requires server-side processing without some third party service (e.g. forms, signups, etc &#8211; though I DID find a way to do search!)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Template editing won&#8217;t be WYSIWYG &#8211; the resulting output will be pretty bland and made in HTML and CSS.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all limitations I&#8217;m happy to accept for my simple personal blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I made&#8230; it&#8217;s not finished, but it&#8217;s 80% of the way there:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/m.rosswintle.uk\/\">https:\/\/m.rosswintle.uk\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately the back-end is my regular WordPress blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The static version is built using a PHP-based CLI tool, using <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel-zero.com\/\">Laravel Zero<\/a> to scrape the content, restructure it and save it. It&#8217;s pretty efficient &#8211; the slowness is in the API queries. It builds my 750-page\/post site in about 80 seconds.<br><br>There&#8217;s then a simple HTML template and some <a href=\"https:\/\/alpinejs.dev\/\">AlpineJS<\/a> scripting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was really glad to stumble upon <a href=\"https:\/\/pagefind.app\/\">PageFind<\/a> &#8211; a tool that builds a static content index and that allows search. This makes everything a bit more dynamic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things I want to add in the future:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>History\/back\/forward navigation\/URL updates<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Page listing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ability to re-use the scrape\/build scripts across sites. They&#8217;re not quite site-agnostic yet, and I want to write some docs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a shorter list than I thought it would be before I started writing it! So that&#8217;s good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusions and thoughts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For many years I was pretty unimpressed by the JAMStack approach. I think because it always seemed to be querying some dynamic back-end anyway, so it felt like you had the complexity of a dynamic CMS AND the complexity of a dynamic front-end app, but without very much benefit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps I misunderstood. But it seemed like you had:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Static site generators: all static files, built at run time<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;JAMStack&#8221; sites: static templating, but pulling in dynamic content over an API<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As I&#8217;ve been moving from a &#8220;Spin up a WordPress site for every little project&#8221; approach to a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2023\/08\/free-websites-for-side-projects\/\">Make some static HTML files and host them for free<\/a>&#8221; approach, I&#8217;ve been thinking about how this model can be used more. It&#8217;s cheap. It&#8217;s secure. It&#8217;s fast. I love developing with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not what Next does. Next needs a back-end server and a zillion (ish) dependencies. And it&#8217;s better suited to applications that need lots of dynamic content, not a simple blog site. I remain that if you&#8217;re building a marketing site, the cost\/benefit of Next is low if not negative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s probably what <a href=\"https:\/\/astro.build\/\">Astro<\/a> does, but Astro also has &#8230; checks notes &#8230;  450 ish dependencies!! (Astro looks really interesting, very nicely done, and has <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.astro.build\/en\/guides\/cms\/wordpress\/#building-a-blog-with-wordpress-and-astro\">a guide on working with a WordPress blog\/site<\/a>!). There are probably other frameworks and site generators that can help too. I&#8217;m no expert in this area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My site has 93 JavaScript package dependencies, which is still too many, but most of them are via TailwindCSS which is entirely optional, which I trust, and which rarely breaks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My project also has a bunch of Composer\/PHP dependencies. But most of those are to create the CLI tool that does the scraping. These are not problematic. This stuff just works. It&#8217;s stable. And when it&#8217;s broken you get helpful errors. It&#8217;s not a world of pain like I find npm to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I proved the concept. I achieved my goals. I like this. It&#8217;s not perfect. But I will take it a bit further and see where I get to.<\/p>\n",

But will mean less time for some of the other things! So I added it as medium.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about by importance?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>High\n<ul>\n<li>Eat well\/lose weight<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exercise and\/or stretch<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clean\/tidy\/fix up our house properly<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stop going to bed late<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Medium\n<ul>\n<li>Floss<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Declutter<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Low\n<ul>\n<li>Read books<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Write short blog posts\/produce content<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Work on side projects<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Meta\n<ul>\n<li>See it:do it<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Structure my day\/todos<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Take responsibility<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That was useful. Seems I value health highly!! And while I WANT the fun stuff to be higher, it&#8217;s really not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have some dimensions here. Size and importance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve read about this somewhere. It&#8217;s probably a James Clear thing. But I swear I&#8217;m totally making this up as I go. We need a diagram!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/2023-Goals_Priorities.png\" alt=\"A chart this is hard to explain in words\" class=\"wp-image-254817\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/2023-Goals_Priorities.png 960w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/2023-Goals_Priorities-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/2023-Goals_Priorities-768x576.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">I realised after making this that &#8220;Exercise&#8221; in on here twice. Oops.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Note: I am not a designer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those things in the green zone are the sweet spot. The quick, important things I can do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In theory, side projects are the worst thing to focus on. So that&#8217;s kinda sad. They WILL get attention. But it looks like the things I need to focus on first are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Eat well<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exercise<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Floss<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Declutter<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>See it:do it<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps, once I&#8217;ve got those better, the others will come along more easily.<\/p>\n",

So&#8230; how?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be a very high-level, figuring out what I need to focus on. Yes, yes, there&#8217;s lots of theory and practice around habits and resolutions that I know but have left out of this. Steven Bartlett would say to focus on one habit, be task oriented and positive. James Clear would tell me to frame them in terms of what sort of person I want to become.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But work with me&#8230; I&#8217;m doing this initial set up in real time. Let&#8217;s see where it leads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a list of things on my mind that I want to do or be better at in the coming year:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Read books<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Write short blog posts\/produce content<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Floss<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exercise and\/or stretch<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Eat well\/lose weight<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Work on side projects<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clean\/tidy\/fix up our house properly<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Declutter\/simplify\/embrace minimalism<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stop going to bed so late!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Structure my day<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use personal todo lists effectively<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>See it:do it<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Take responsibility (there&#8217;s a whole post about this)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a LOT.

But will mean less time for some of the other things! So I added it as medium.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about by importance?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>High\n<ul>\n<li>Eat well\/lose weight<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exercise and\/or stretch<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clean\/tidy\/fix up our house properly<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stop going to bed late<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Medium\n<ul>\n<li>Floss<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Declutter<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Low\n<ul>\n<li>Read books<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Write short blog posts\/produce content<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Work on side projects<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Meta\n<ul>\n<li>See it:do it<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Structure my day\/todos<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Take responsibility<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That was useful. Seems I value health highly!! And while I WANT the fun stuff to be higher, it&#8217;s really not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have some dimensions here. Size and importance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve read about this somewhere. It&#8217;s probably a James Clear thing. But I swear I&#8217;m totally making this up as I go. We need a diagram!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/2023-Goals_Priorities.png\" alt=\"A chart this is hard to explain in words\" class=\"wp-image-254817\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/2023-Goals_Priorities.png 960w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/2023-Goals_Priorities-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/2023-Goals_Priorities-768x576.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">I realised after making this that &#8220;Exercise&#8221; in on here twice. Oops.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Note: I am not a designer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those things in the green zone are the sweet spot. The quick, important things I can do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In theory, side projects are the worst thing to focus on. So that&#8217;s kinda sad. They WILL get attention. But it looks like the things I need to focus on first are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Eat well<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exercise<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Floss<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Declutter<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>See it:do it<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps, once I&#8217;ve got those better, the others will come along more easily.<\/p>\n",

OR, the person makes their own assumptions (&#8220;here&#8217;s a 50g packet of flaked almonds!\u201d) and the whole process becomes blocked and rework is needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes longer to do the initial work, but you get your cake baked on time for the birthday party!!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;I was coaching someone on how to be a better mentor recently.

They are on the snack aisle, the baking aisle and in the produce department.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various packet sizes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The actual requirement is something like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Ground Almonds, 150g for baking cake\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lesson: Think about what the other person needs to know to fulfil your requirement without needing further exchange of information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, further communication is needed, which slows you down. OR, the person makes their own assumptions (&#8220;here&#8217;s a 50g packet of flaked almonds!\u201d) and the whole process becomes blocked and rework is needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes longer to do the initial work, but you get your cake baked on time for the birthday party!!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;I was coaching someone on how to be a better mentor recently. One perspective I shared is that while you can teach people better work habits, you can\u2019t teach them to care. That is intrinsic, only the person can choose to care about a job or problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can teach how to code, how to run meetings or how to write status reports.

I figured someone must have written a Laravel HTTP client wrapper for this and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rickwest\/laravel-wordpress-api\">Rick West delivered for me<\/a> there!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I wanted to get Tinkering. And I reach for <a href=\"https:\/\/tinkerwell.app\/ref\/Bzl4z9qvNO\">Tinkerwell<\/a> (&lt;- referral link) for that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s when the problems started. And I couldn&#8217;t find easy answers to any of these problems. So here they are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;Target class [config] does not exist&#8221; error in Tinkerwell with Laravel Zero<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I had this error appearing in Tinkerwell. I searched. I scoured. I even ChatGPT&#8217;d to no avail!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually I realised that Laravel Zero needs its own Tinkerwell driver. And fortunately <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/owenvoke\/e3bf8c7394826c2541d450a5b12b2853\">Owen Voke has provided that<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;cURL error 60: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, I&#8217;m working locally. I&#8217;m trying to use the WordPress REST API served from a local site running on Laravel Valet. And even though I&#8217;ve gone through the Valet certificate trusting dance, <code>curl<\/code> needs a little extra help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My immediate thought was to reach for the <code>'verify' => false<\/code> option. But could I find out how to set this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel provides <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/10.x\/http-client#global-middleware\">Global Request Middleware<\/a>, but this doesn&#8217;t let you set options. These can only be changed when creating an instance of the <code>Http<\/code> client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Rick&#8217;s wonderful WordPress API wrapper doesn&#8217;t let you set options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SO&#8230; I hacked Http options into that and that works a treat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will PR this and hope that Rick accepts it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel Zero with Tinkerwell and the WordPress REST API package!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"509\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-22.02.48-1024x509.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Tinkerwell tinkering app showing the use of Rick West's WordPress REST API package, complete with an API response!

        "content": "\n<p>Today I decided to start work on a silly new thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will involve CLI commands, so I went for <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel-zero.com\/\">Laravel Zero<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I needed to use the WordPress REST API. I figured someone must have written a Laravel HTTP client wrapper for this and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rickwest\/laravel-wordpress-api\">Rick West delivered for me<\/a> there!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I wanted to get Tinkering. And I reach for <a href=\"https:\/\/tinkerwell.app\/ref\/Bzl4z9qvNO\">Tinkerwell<\/a> (&lt;- referral link) for that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s when the problems started. And I couldn&#8217;t find easy answers to any of these problems. So here they are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;Target class [config] does not exist&#8221; error in Tinkerwell with Laravel Zero<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I had this error appearing in Tinkerwell. I searched. I scoured. I even ChatGPT&#8217;d to no avail!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually I realised that Laravel Zero needs its own Tinkerwell driver. And fortunately <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/owenvoke\/e3bf8c7394826c2541d450a5b12b2853\">Owen Voke has provided that<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;cURL error 60: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, I&#8217;m working locally. I&#8217;m trying to use the WordPress REST API served from a local site running on Laravel Valet. And even though I&#8217;ve gone through the Valet certificate trusting dance, <code>curl<\/code> needs a little extra help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My immediate thought was to reach for the <code>'verify' => false<\/code> option. But could I find out how to set this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel provides <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/10.x\/http-client#global-middleware\">Global Request Middleware<\/a>, but this doesn&#8217;t let you set options. These can only be changed when creating an instance of the <code>Http<\/code> client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Rick&#8217;s wonderful WordPress API wrapper doesn&#8217;t let you set options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SO&#8230; I hacked Http options into that and that works a treat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will PR this and hope that Rick accepts it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel Zero with Tinkerwell and the WordPress REST API package!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"509\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-22.02.48-1024x509.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Tinkerwell tinkering app showing the use of Rick West's WordPress REST API package, complete with an API response!

                "rendered": "\n<p>It sounds simple, but the concept of &#8220;remembering&#8221; has becoming really important to me. Not facts, or information, but people and situations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can so easily \u201cforget\u201d &#8211; just get on with our own things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Remembering\u201d people &#8211; bringing them and their situations to mind &#8211; makes us mindful of their reality. And when we do that we gain empathy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sometimes try to do this when navigating a busy city. Noting that the people around me are\u2026 people! They have thoughts and feelings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they have a difficult situation they are working through and life is hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they are celebrating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they are on their way to a job interview. Or an important meeting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they couldn&#8217;t pay their electricity bill today or visited a food bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they have a Jewish friend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they know someone living in Gaza.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be overwhelming, realising that all those people passing by have complex inner lives and relationships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, it seems more critical than ever that we remember.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also overwhelming to think of people we don&#8217;t see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who, themselves, live &#8211; or are struggling to live &#8211; in Gaza&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who are on the front-line in Ukraine&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People working in hospitals in war zones&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People digging through rubble to find their child or sibling or parent&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is overwhelming. And it&#8217;s OK to not focus on it all day long. To distract yourself. To switch off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we must remember.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For if we don&#8217;t remember, we don&#8217;t have empathy; we are, as I once heard, &#8220;like a cow looking at cars. You know, a cow looks at a car. They watch it. But nothing&#8217;s going on. When you drive past a cow [in Ireland] it looks up, it watches, but there&#8217;s nothing going on inside. And then it goes back to eating. That&#8217;s how we treat people in daily life&#8230; you don&#8217;t really see them. They&#8217;re just objects. They are functions.&#8221;<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>It sounds simple, but the concept of &#8220;remembering&#8221; has becoming really important to me. Not facts, or information, but people and situations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can so easily \u201cforget\u201d &#8211; just get on with our own things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Remembering\u201d people &#8211; bringing them and their situations to mind &#8211; makes us mindful of their reality. And when we do that we gain empathy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sometimes try to do this when navigating a busy city. Noting that the people around me are\u2026 people! They have thoughts and feelings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they have a difficult situation they are working through and life is hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they are celebrating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they are on their way to a job interview. Or an important meeting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they couldn&#8217;t pay their electricity bill today or visited a food bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they have a Jewish friend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they know someone living in Gaza.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be overwhelming, realising that all those people passing by have complex inner lives and relationships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, it seems more critical than ever that we remember.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also overwhelming to think of people we don&#8217;t see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who, themselves, live &#8211; or are struggling to live &#8211; in Gaza&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who are on the front-line in Ukraine&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People working in hospitals in war zones&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People digging through rubble to find their child or sibling or parent&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is overwhelming. And it&#8217;s OK to not focus on it all day long. To distract yourself. To switch off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we must remember.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For if we don&#8217;t remember, we don&#8217;t have empathy; we are, as I once heard, &#8220;like a cow looking at cars. You know, a cow looks at a car. They watch it. But nothing&#8217;s going on. When you drive past a cow [in Ireland] it looks up, it watches, but there&#8217;s nothing going on inside. And then it goes back to eating. That&#8217;s how we treat people in daily life&#8230; you don&#8217;t really see them. They&#8217;re just objects. They are functions.&#8221;<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>An observation from work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a senior developer, but I&#8217;m still a developer. I&#8217;m the &#8220;bottom of the pile&#8221;. I don&#8217;t pass work to others. They pass it to me. My job is really to shut up and do what I&#8217;m told.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I might do technical architecture and have technical opinions about HOW to do the things that I&#8217;m told. But I&#8217;m not supposed to do strategy and planning and determine WHAT to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously I was in a similar job working with IT systems at a low-level. Working with the bottom of the pile in a technical stack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s this weird thing about being bottom of the pile; about being the place that the work ends up at: you get to see a lot of things!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seem backwards, or upside-down. But I keep finding myself in roles where I seem to have a much wider view than others above me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When everyone needs something done on your system, you get a sometimes-uniquely-broad view of what&#8217;s going on. A bunch of different plans and strategies that can&#8217;t necessarily see each other all end up with actions that arrive at the bottom of the pile &#8211; with you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s the opportunity that you have as a bottom-of-the-pile developer: making connections!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds odd because it&#8217;s a people thing, not a technology thing. And it may not be your strength. But there&#8217;s a chance that you are one of the few people who can see both &#8220;that thing up there&#8221; <em>and<\/em> &#8220;that thing over there&#8221;. So here&#8217;s my tip for levelling up and being a great developer:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take responsibility for making connections! At the very least, ask the question: &#8220;I see that you want to me do &#8216;This&#8217;&#8230; but it might conflict with &#8216;That&#8217;. Are you aware of &#8216;That&#8217;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This relates to another thought of mine. I remember hearing on a podcast once that a senior person should be faster at their work. This is why senior people get paid more &#8211; they get more done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, yes: if I know my task, and if I have focus time, I should &#8230; I <em>will<\/em> &#8230; be quicker at getting the job done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you come to me with a request rather than a defined task, I say that a senior digs in; asks questions; finds out more; challenges assumptions; takes steps back to look at the broader picture; and does some &#8220;systems thinking&#8221;, before knuckling down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might slow you down. Possibly a LOT. But the difference is that it gets you <s>the right<\/s> a better result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So: maybe you too are in a bottom-of-the-pile developer role? If so, don&#8217;t think you are unimportant. You might see things that no one else does. So take in the view; ask questions; make connections; think about the broader picture that you &#8211; and maybe only you &#8211; can see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could slow you down, but honestly, for the sake of asking a few questions about what you can see, you could also end up being a hero!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>An observation from work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a senior developer, but I&#8217;m still a developer. I&#8217;m the &#8220;bottom of the pile&#8221;. I don&#8217;t pass work to others. They pass it to me. My job is really to shut up and do what I&#8217;m told.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I might do technical architecture and have technical opinions about HOW to do the things that I&#8217;m told. But I&#8217;m not supposed to do strategy and planning and determine WHAT to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously I was in a similar job working with IT systems at a low-level. Working with the bottom of the pile in a technical stack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s this weird thing about being bottom of the pile; about being the place that the work ends up at: you get to see a lot of things!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seem backwards, or upside-down. But I keep finding myself in roles where I seem to have a much wider view than others above me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When everyone needs something done on your system, you get a sometimes-uniquely-broad view of what&#8217;s going on. A bunch of different plans and strategies that can&#8217;t necessarily see each other all end up with actions that arrive at the bottom of the pile &#8211; with you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s the opportunity that you have as a bottom-of-the-pile developer: making connections!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds odd because it&#8217;s a people thing, not a technology thing. And it may not be your strength. But there&#8217;s a chance that you are one of the few people who can see both &#8220;that thing up there&#8221; <em>and<\/em> &#8220;that thing over there&#8221;. So here&#8217;s my tip for levelling up and being a great developer:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take responsibility for making connections! At the very least, ask the question: &#8220;I see that you want to me do &#8216;This&#8217;&#8230; but it might conflict with &#8216;That&#8217;. Are you aware of &#8216;That&#8217;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This relates to another thought of mine. I remember hearing on a podcast once that a senior person should be faster at their work. This is why senior people get paid more &#8211; they get more done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, yes: if I know my task, and if I have focus time, I should &#8230; I <em>will<\/em> &#8230; be quicker at getting the job done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you come to me with a request rather than a defined task, I say that a senior digs in; asks questions; finds out more; challenges assumptions; takes steps back to look at the broader picture; and does some &#8220;systems thinking&#8221;, before knuckling down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might slow you down. Possibly a LOT. But the difference is that it gets you <s>the right<\/s> a better result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So: maybe you too are in a bottom-of-the-pile developer role? If so, don&#8217;t think you are unimportant. You might see things that no one else does. So take in the view; ask questions; make connections; think about the broader picture that you &#8211; and maybe only you &#8211; can see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could slow you down, but honestly, for the sake of asking a few questions about what you can see, you could also end up being a hero!<\/p>\n",

But this was slow and, in many cases, bloated, and could get expensive with domain and hosting costs. In many cases it was way more than I actually needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I now have a process that gets me small, fast, side-project websites for virtually zero cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week I quickly spun up <a href=\"https:\/\/ev-tools.veryuseful.app\/\">EV Tools<\/a> for me to do some calculations while I was in Europe.

I happen to own a license for TailwindUI too if I need something more fancy, as I&#8217;m NOT a designer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those domains I put subdomains on? I happen to own <code>veryuseful.app<\/code> (which has <a href=\"https:\/\/veryuseful.app\/\">a nice index<\/a>, built using this very system, of course!) and <code>forwp.dev<\/code> (which is new and only has one secret project on it at the moment).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can find one that works (and with all the new top-level domains like <code>.tools<\/code> and <code>.dev<\/code> and <code>.app<\/code> it&#8217;s not so hard!) then these let you create as many sub-domains as you like, for free!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, they may not have the SEO juice or be so memorable. But the point of these projects is to quickly put something on the web for me, or to share on social media. Not to build a new SaaS or something. So it really doesn&#8217;t matter. And if it does: keep forking our for those domains, or just upgrade later!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Process<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, the process is a bit complicated if you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing. You&#8217;ll need to do DNS and Git and command-line and hand-code (or copy and paste, or generate with AI) HTML and CSS. You can bolt onto that whatever you like, but that&#8217;s a minimum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And once you &#8220;get it&#8221;, you can replicate this process pretty quickly. You can probably even automate more of it with CLI tools and APIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I won&#8217;t go into <em>how<\/em> to do each step. If you&#8217;re qualified to use this process, you <em>probably<\/em> don&#8217;t need those extra details anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the main steps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new Git repository from <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/small-site-template\/\">my template in GitHub<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clone the new repository locally.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make some HTML files.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Run the build step (<code>.\/build.sh<\/code>)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Commit everything to Git and push to GitHub<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Set up a new Cloudflare Pages project, connect to GitHub if you need to, and deploy the application on a temporary URL (Cloudflare uses <code>&lt;something>.pages.dev<\/code>)\n<ul>\n<li>With my template you need to set the build output directory to &#8220;public&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Save and deploy the site<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once deployed, you can go and add the custom domain. If you specify a new subdomain of a domain that you own, this will be created and DNS set up for you. It will even create an HTTPS certificate!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it. Now you can edit your HTML\/CSS\/JS files, use the build step when you need to, and a push to GitHub will trigger a deploy. Magic!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This new tech is awesome<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So many cool new bits of tech have come together to make this possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern CSS and JavaScript is amazing. You don&#8217;t need libraries\/frameworks for simple sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I pair it with Tailwind because I like that for small projects that I need to revisit from time to time and it&#8217;s proven to be robust and &#8211; crucially for this kind of project &#8211; low on dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I use AlpineJS for those reactive JS sprinkles without needing a full-on framework that will go out of date.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Jamstack&#8221; hosting gives us static hosting for free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LetsEncrypt secures the web for us for free with HTTPS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subdomains give me unlimited domains (virtually) for free for new small projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>GitHub hosts the code and pairs with the static hosting to achieve automated deployments with no FTP or anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also use <a href=\"https:\/\/usefathom.com\/ref\/SVE71E\">Fathom Analytics<\/a> on some sites. This is not free, but as long as they remain low-traffic I get 100,000 page views a month spread across up to 50 sites. This lets me get some idea of who is coming and from where without the need for faffy cookie banners or privacy policies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WHAT AN AMAZING WORLD WE LIVE IN that we have access to all this at low cost so we can tinker and play and create as web people!?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re curious, here&#8217;s some sites that I use some of all of this technique on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/ev-tools.veryuseful.app\/\">EV Tools<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tweet-finder.veryuseful.app\/\">Tweet Finder<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.com\/\">WordlePress<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">Can I PHP?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",

        "title": "FREE WEBSITES!! How I make small, side-project websites for free (pretty much)",
        "content": "\n<p>There was a time when a new web-based side project was a case of buying a domain, firing up a WordPress instance, wading through installs of a bunch of plugins and maybe a page builder theme. But this was slow and, in many cases, bloated, and could get expensive with domain and hosting costs. In many cases it was way more than I actually needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I now have a process that gets me small, fast, side-project websites for virtually zero cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week I quickly spun up <a href=\"https:\/\/ev-tools.veryuseful.app\/\">EV Tools<\/a> for me to do some calculations while I was in Europe. Zero cost. Just the coding. So easy. Kick-ass performance scores. Automated deployment from Git. What&#8217;s not to like?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This method is not for the everyday web user, as you will see. But if you do web dev, there may be some stuff here that&#8217;s an &#8220;Aha!&#8221; moment for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s see how it works&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Stack<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially the not-so-secret sauce here is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A simple static site generator (I made <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/12\/hang-on-php-is-a-static-site-generator\/\">my own in PHP<\/a>, but you can choose your own tech)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some neat domains that I make sub-domains from (free side-project domains FTW!!)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pages.cloudflare.com\/\">Cloudflare Pages<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.netlify.com\/\">Netlify<\/a> (or <a href=\"https:\/\/pages.github.com\/\">GitHub pages<\/a>) for hosting<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition I have a <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/small-site-template\/tree\/main\">starter template<\/a> that includes TailwindCSS, Tailwind Forms and Typography plugins and <a href=\"https:\/\/alpinejs.dev\/\">AlpineJS<\/a> for JavaScript sprinkles. I happen to own a license for TailwindUI too if I need something more fancy, as I&#8217;m NOT a designer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those domains I put subdomains on? I happen to own <code>veryuseful.app<\/code> (which has <a href=\"https:\/\/veryuseful.app\/\">a nice index<\/a>, built using this very system, of course!) and <code>forwp.dev<\/code> (which is new and only has one secret project on it at the moment).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can find one that works (and with all the new top-level domains like <code>.tools<\/code> and <code>.dev<\/code> and <code>.app<\/code> it&#8217;s not so hard!) then these let you create as many sub-domains as you like, for free!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, they may not have the SEO juice or be so memorable. But the point of these projects is to quickly put something on the web for me, or to share on social media. Not to build a new SaaS or something. So it really doesn&#8217;t matter. And if it does: keep forking our for those domains, or just upgrade later!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Process<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, the process is a bit complicated if you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing. You&#8217;ll need to do DNS and Git and command-line and hand-code (or copy and paste, or generate with AI) HTML and CSS. You can bolt onto that whatever you like, but that&#8217;s a minimum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And once you &#8220;get it&#8221;, you can replicate this process pretty quickly. You can probably even automate more of it with CLI tools and APIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I won&#8217;t go into <em>how<\/em> to do each step. If you&#8217;re qualified to use this process, you <em>probably<\/em> don&#8217;t need those extra details anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the main steps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new Git repository from <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/small-site-template\/\">my template in GitHub<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clone the new repository locally.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make some HTML files.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Run the build step (<code>.\/build.sh<\/code>)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Commit everything to Git and push to GitHub<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Set up a new Cloudflare Pages project, connect to GitHub if you need to, and deploy the application on a temporary URL (Cloudflare uses <code>&lt;something>.pages.dev<\/code>)\n<ul>\n<li>With my template you need to set the build output directory to &#8220;public&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Save and deploy the site<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once deployed, you can go and add the custom domain. If you specify a new subdomain of a domain that you own, this will be created and DNS set up for you. It will even create an HTTPS certificate!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it. Now you can edit your HTML\/CSS\/JS files, use the build step when you need to, and a push to GitHub will trigger a deploy. Magic!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This new tech is awesome<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So many cool new bits of tech have come together to make this possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern CSS and JavaScript is amazing. You don&#8217;t need libraries\/frameworks for simple sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I pair it with Tailwind because I like that for small projects that I need to revisit from time to time and it&#8217;s proven to be robust and &#8211; crucially for this kind of project &#8211; low on dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I use AlpineJS for those reactive JS sprinkles without needing a full-on framework that will go out of date.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Jamstack&#8221; hosting gives us static hosting for free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LetsEncrypt secures the web for us for free with HTTPS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subdomains give me unlimited domains (virtually) for free for new small projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>GitHub hosts the code and pairs with the static hosting to achieve automated deployments with no FTP or anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also use <a href=\"https:\/\/usefathom.com\/ref\/SVE71E\">Fathom Analytics<\/a> on some sites. This is not free, but as long as they remain low-traffic I get 100,000 page views a month spread across up to 50 sites. This lets me get some idea of who is coming and from where without the need for faffy cookie banners or privacy policies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WHAT AN AMAZING WORLD WE LIVE IN that we have access to all this at low cost so we can tinker and play and create as web people!?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re curious, here&#8217;s some sites that I use some of all of this technique on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/ev-tools.veryuseful.app\/\">EV Tools<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tweet-finder.veryuseful.app\/\">Tweet Finder<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.com\/\">WordlePress<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">Can I PHP?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",

If kWs, kWhs, CCS, and so on are confusing and you want to know what they all mean, that&#8217;s a good starting point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">TL;DR summary<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Our old car was dying.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We decided to go fully electric.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We needed a car that could get a family of 4 with luggage for a long weekend 120 miles in winter.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We looked at a number of used EV&#8217;s:\n<ul>\n<li>Renault Zoe (Hard NOPE!)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kia eNiro and Hyundai Kona (Nice cars &#8211; but more expensive.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>MG5 (Would have made a nice estate. Great value.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nissan Leaf (A close 2nd.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We bought a 2020 Hyundai Ioniq Electric.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We&#8217;re really happy with it!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">We know about the downsides<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, I want to make it clear that we know about the downsides of electric cars outside of their range and battery life. The <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Embodied_energy\">embodied energy<\/a> in their manufacture. The costs of digging up lithium and cobalt. The extra weight and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rac.co.uk\/drive\/electric-cars\/running\/do-electric-vehicles-produce-more-tyre-and-brake-pollution-than-petrol-and\/\">possible extra tyre particulate &#8220;emissions&#8221;<\/a>. And yes, the fact that <em>just not using a car is by far the best thing to do<\/em> for SO many reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/sounds\/play\/m001mt53\">What about the bridges\/car parks\/etc<\/a>? Well, yes, EV&#8217;s are heavier than combustion engine cars. But before you start wondering if it&#8217;s small, electric, family cars that are going to break the world, may I first ask you to consider the unnecessary, ridiculous, space-taking, road-wearing, gas-guzzling, child- and planet-killing SUVs that have become so popular.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cars I&#8217;m looking at are well within the specifications that car parks and bridges are built to. If you&#8217;re really worried about this, get complaining about the Nissan Navaras and Ford F150s of the world and all the other ridiculously over-sized vehicles that most people can&#8217;t drive or park properly. Grrrrr. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really want to stress that we have weighed up a LOT of factors in deciding to buy this car. We haven&#8217;t just decided it would be cool to own an EV. Some have said that EVs are marketing hype and a ploy by the car industry to keep us buying cars instead of fixing the actual problems that personal vehicle ownership cause. And yes, I have concerns about some aspects of EV&#8217;s. But I can&#8217;t deny it: cars are convenient, and an EV seems like the best option right now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve seriously questioned if we need a car. Ideally we would be in a decent car club, or car-sharing scheme, and we would hire for longer holidays and stuff. But this just does not exist near us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I cycle a lot instead of driving. We have not flown anywhere for&#8230; what?&#8230; 10 or 11 years? Maybe more? We do SO much of the &#8220;right things&#8221; for the environment in the face of SO much who-gives-a-crappery. And we have good, family-related reasons right now to want to be able to make some journeys easily. So we determined that we would get a new car. This is a huge privilege. And we&#8217;ll try really hard to use it as efficiently and carefully as we can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at why we needed it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Old Car<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We are a single car family. This is a privilege we are aware of. We can both work remotely. We are both able to walk or cycle. We literally have a supermarket at the end of our road and a primary school at the end of our garden.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our old car was 15 years old. A petrol Toyota midi-MPV (a Corolla Verso).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We bought it 11 years ago for about \u00a37000. It had done 94,000 miles. We had run it into the ground. The clutch was slipping. The engine was rattling. The interior was falling apart. The paint was flaking. I was convinced that it was about to give up in a fairly serious way. And I didn&#8217;t want that to happen to us on some long family journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We really got as much out of this car as we felt we could. And this car had been BRILLIANT. Other than replacing the drive shaft and having to re-attach some stupid metal heat-shield plate, this car had done us SO proud. It owed us and the world nothing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But its time had come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What we needed &#8211; our car usage<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We only do about 6000 &#8211; 7000 miles per year. We are fortunate enough that neither of us commute on a regular basis. So our driving is mostly a mix of:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Category 1: around-town stuff in bad weather and with the kids or heavy loads<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Category 2: shorter local &#8220;expeditions&#8221;, 15-50 miles<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Category 3: longer short-holiday trips of 100-150 miles with light luggage (occasionally much longer trips)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Category 4: bigger holidays that aren&#8217;t long distances, but that included camping with a VERY full load and a roofbox<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one <em>critical<\/em> journey that we need to make sort-of-often, and that&#8217;s 120 miles to visit my in-laws. Now that the kids are both well past toddler stage, we can do this trip relatively lightly and it&#8217;s a shorter category 3 trip.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Did you consider a plug-in hybrid, or regular hybrid?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Plug-in_hybrid\">PHEV&#8217;s (plugin hybrids)<\/a> seemed popular, and I&#8217;d had some recommendations. But some had also said that they were the worst of both worlds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We felt that our needs fitted within the abilities of an EV available within our budget. So I didn&#8217;t want the extra cost and complexity when it wasn&#8217;t really needed. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not really a problem, but I feel like having a combustion engine AND electric motor and battery AND the systems to manage it all was overly complex. For me, more complexity is more that can go wrong, so if we don&#8217;t need it then we should avoid it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A regular hybrid wasn&#8217;t on the table. It&#8217;s neat tech, but it&#8217;s primarily a petrol\/diesel car, and we were trying to avoid burning fossil fuels, so again, if we could avoid it, we should.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What we needed &#8211; our EV requirements<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We had decided that we couldn&#8217;t do category 4 trips in an EV. If we wanted to do that we would hire something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we needed a real-world range of, ideally, around 120+ miles to visit the in-laws, assuming we could pick up a top-up charge on the way, or charge at the destination somehow. We need this range when fully-loaded in winter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We needed a boot big enough for family-of-four luggage for a long weekend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we had a budget of \u00a315,000 &#8211; \u00a320,000. For the right car maybe we could do more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cars we looked at<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Renault Zoe (2022)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a running joke in our family, after a poor experience with electrics on a French car bought from the dealer-who-shall-not-be-named (let&#8217;s call them &#8220;Salmon Sisters&#8221; for now), that I would never buy a French car of any sort from Salmon Sisters, let alone <em>an electric one<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after doing some intense EV research and looking around online I noticed that Salmon Sisters &#8211; who are very local to us &#8211; had a smart-looking, 1-year old Renault Zoe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I signed up and took it for a test drive. Well, not the one that was for sale, but an equivalent car (don&#8217;t ask). And it was pretty nice. Great value. Just about big enough. <a href=\"https:\/\/ev-database.org\/uk\/car\/1205\/Renault-Zoe-ZE50-R135\">Advertised range of 240 miles, and a &#8220;real world&#8221; range of 190<\/a>. Rapid charging. And all the modern conveniences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked all the right questions and was really interested in it. A friend of ours has a Zoe and likes it. So I went away to think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I found this: this newer Renault Zoe got a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autocar.co.uk\/car-news\/new-cars\/renault-zoe-given-zero-stars-euro-ncap-safety-tests\">zero-star Euro-NCAP rating<\/a>! Mostly because they had removed a critical side-airbag. But also because the automated safety features weren&#8217;t up to scratch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One review was sub-titled: &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.carmagazine.co.uk\/car-reviews\/renault\/zoe-ev\/\">Little car, long range, don&#8217;t crash<\/a>&#8220;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Renault had apparently addressed some of the automated features in an update. And Euro-NCAP is like an enhanced safety standard. The Zoe is a legally-safe vehicle. So it&#8217;s not unsafe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But ALL the other cars we were looking at had 5-star Euro-NCAP ratings. So this seemed like a real downer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried to get past this. It seemed like a great car otherwise and great value. I could even ignore the reports of poor quality interior and sometimes leaky doors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I found out why we couldn&#8217;t test drive the actual car that was for sale. The story of &#8220;it&#8217;s on loan as a courtesy car&#8221; turned into &#8220;they forgot to charge it&#8221; and then into &#8220;the charging circuit is broken and needs to be replaced&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that point I quickly turned from being able to forgive its flaws to a hard &#8220;no thanks&#8221;. Both to the Zoe and to Salmon Sisters, who I felt had not been honest with us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nissan Leaf<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nissan Leaf was a great car. We looked at <a href=\"https:\/\/ev-database.org\/uk\/car\/1144\/Nissan-Leaf-eplus\">the &#8220;E+&#8221;<\/a> as this was the only one that had the range we needed. It had about 50 miles more range than the Hyundai Ioniq that we bought BUT it&#8217;s a less efficient car, so this came at the cost of a much larger 62kWh battery (vs 40kWh in the Ioniq).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of why it&#8217;s less efficient is that it&#8217;s more powerful. I mean, the Ioniq would accelerate quick if you put your foot down, but the Leaf&#8230; wow! It has 160kW of power equating to 215hp, vs the Ioniq&#8217;s 100kW\/134hp. (Those Tesla&#8217;s must be incredible!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Leaf felt more &#8220;manual&#8221; &#8211; like I was more in control and a bit more solid. The Hyundai felt a bit squishy and detached from the road. But really&#8230; I&#8217;m not a petrol head (we need some new words now, right?). The Ioniq is FINE and actually, I don&#8217;t want the encouragement to drive fast and hard. Plus, that bigger battery will take longer to charge up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the Leaf has a &#8220;CHAdeMO&#8221; rapid-charging port. This isn&#8217;t really <em>much<\/em> of a problem, but Europe is standardising on the &#8220;CCS&#8221; rapid charging ports and CHAdeMO may be a little bit harder to come across.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We liked the Leaf. It felt more like the kind of car we would drive and own. And it had a 5-star Euro NCAP safety rating. I would happily have bought it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hyundai Ioniq<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ev-database.org\/uk\/car\/1165\/Hyundai-IONIQ-Electric\">This is the one we bought<\/a>. Advertised range of 193 miles, real range of around 155 miles. Enough for our longer trip we need to do a lot. It&#8217;s 3 years old with 17,000 miles on it and the battery health seems fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main reason to choose this over the Leaf was the charging convenience. We don&#8217;t have a driveway or garage. We park on-street. So we can&#8217;t charge at home. So we need convenient charging. And the Ioniq&#8217;s greater efficiency, smaller battery size, quicker charging, and the more-commonly-found CCS charge port were what sold us on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to drive and has loads of safety features and clever stuff on board. And that 5-star Euro NCAP rating to stick it to the Zoe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, it feels less connected to the road than the Leaf was, but that&#8217;s OK. The interior is really nice if a bit lacking in headroom (none of us are too tall). And while lower power, it still has the instant torque that EV&#8217;s have which makes pulling away sometimes fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually like that it&#8217;s lower power. It has three driving modes: Eco, Normal and Sport. I&#8217;ve gotten used to Eco Mode which cranks up the regeneration (when the car harvests energy from braking) and kinda guides you into driving efficiently. And driving like this feels safer too. I&#8217;ve turned Sport Mode on a couple of times and it frightens me!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My only other complaint is that &#8230; well &#8230; it just <em>looks<\/em> a bit boring. It&#8217;s a sleek, grey saloon car. And the world is FULL of sleek, grey saloon cars. It&#8217;s a salesman&#8217;s car, not a family car. There&#8217;s not much fun about it. And it has this weird plate on the front that looks&#8230; just&#8230; weird.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230; we are REALLY happy with it. We are in a hugely privileged position to be able to own such a vehicle and we are really enjoying using it to get around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s been a lot to learn along the way. We&#8217;ve yet to do a drive of more than about 50 miles in it. But we hope this car will serve us well for many years to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where did you get it from?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, NOT &#8220;Salmon Sisters&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We found it on Auto Trader, who are great for search. But that search pointed us at <a href=\"https:\/\/drive-green.co.uk\/\">Drive Green<\/a> &#8211; a specialist used EV dealer just south of Bath (about 50 miles from us).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We took a day out to get there and go and try some cars out. One good thing about an independent dealership is that you can try a variety of makes and models, and they had a good stock of lots of different models. We could have tried BMW i3s, Peugeot e2008s, electric Minis, VW eGolfs, even used Teslas!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Drive Green team are brilliant. And they don&#8217;t want to sell you THEIR car. They want to sell you the car that&#8217;s right for you. They are highly recommended if you&#8217;re in the area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final notes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I said, we&#8217;re really fortunate to own this car. It&#8217;s a luxury. I feel quite embarrassed about it. But do we need it? REALLY need it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is probably no. We <em>could<\/em>, if we worked hard at it, be a zero-car family. I&#8217;d LOVE to not own a personal vehicle. To be in a car club. To have superb public transport around us. And to keep cycling for transport too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at this stage of life it&#8217;s enormously convenient to have access to a car.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We properly like our EV. We&#8217;re pretty certain we did the right thing getting it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we will try to remain a one-car family. (We know this is also a privilege!). We will keep cycling. We will keep avoiding the car for shorter journeys. We will keep asking our council and government for better infrastructure. And maybe, when this car has done its time, we won&#8217;t need to own one again? <\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>We recently bought an electric car. This post explains why we did this, what we purchased, and why we chose that car.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helpful note: I previously made an <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2023\/06\/my-simple-ev-terminology-cheatsheet\/\">EV &#8220;Cheat Sheet&#8221;<\/a> that explains most of the concepts and terminology around electric cars. If kWs, kWhs, CCS, and so on are confusing and you want to know what they all mean, that&#8217;s a good starting point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">TL;DR summary<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Our old car was dying.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We decided to go fully electric.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We needed a car that could get a family of 4 with luggage for a long weekend 120 miles in winter.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We looked at a number of used EV&#8217;s:\n<ul>\n<li>Renault Zoe (Hard NOPE!)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kia eNiro and Hyundai Kona (Nice cars &#8211; but more expensive.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>MG5 (Would have made a nice estate. Great value.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nissan Leaf (A close 2nd.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We bought a 2020 Hyundai Ioniq Electric.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We&#8217;re really happy with it!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">We know about the downsides<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, I want to make it clear that we know about the downsides of electric cars outside of their range and battery life. The <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Embodied_energy\">embodied energy<\/a> in their manufacture. The costs of digging up lithium and cobalt. The extra weight and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rac.co.uk\/drive\/electric-cars\/running\/do-electric-vehicles-produce-more-tyre-and-brake-pollution-than-petrol-and\/\">possible extra tyre particulate &#8220;emissions&#8221;<\/a>. And yes, the fact that <em>just not using a car is by far the best thing to do<\/em> for SO many reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/sounds\/play\/m001mt53\">What about the bridges\/car parks\/etc<\/a>? Well, yes, EV&#8217;s are heavier than combustion engine cars. But before you start wondering if it&#8217;s small, electric, family cars that are going to break the world, may I first ask you to consider the unnecessary, ridiculous, space-taking, road-wearing, gas-guzzling, child- and planet-killing SUVs that have become so popular.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cars I&#8217;m looking at are well within the specifications that car parks and bridges are built to. If you&#8217;re really worried about this, get complaining about the Nissan Navaras and Ford F150s of the world and all the other ridiculously over-sized vehicles that most people can&#8217;t drive or park properly. Grrrrr. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really want to stress that we have weighed up a LOT of factors in deciding to buy this car. We haven&#8217;t just decided it would be cool to own an EV. Some have said that EVs are marketing hype and a ploy by the car industry to keep us buying cars instead of fixing the actual problems that personal vehicle ownership cause. And yes, I have concerns about some aspects of EV&#8217;s. But I can&#8217;t deny it: cars are convenient, and an EV seems like the best option right now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve seriously questioned if we need a car. Ideally we would be in a decent car club, or car-sharing scheme, and we would hire for longer holidays and stuff. But this just does not exist near us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I cycle a lot instead of driving. We have not flown anywhere for&#8230; what?&#8230; 10 or 11 years? Maybe more? We do SO much of the &#8220;right things&#8221; for the environment in the face of SO much who-gives-a-crappery. And we have good, family-related reasons right now to want to be able to make some journeys easily. So we determined that we would get a new car. This is a huge privilege. And we&#8217;ll try really hard to use it as efficiently and carefully as we can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at why we needed it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Old Car<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We are a single car family. This is a privilege we are aware of. We can both work remotely. We are both able to walk or cycle. We literally have a supermarket at the end of our road and a primary school at the end of our garden.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our old car was 15 years old. A petrol Toyota midi-MPV (a Corolla Verso).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We bought it 11 years ago for about \u00a37000. It had done 94,000 miles. We had run it into the ground. The clutch was slipping. The engine was rattling. The interior was falling apart. The paint was flaking. I was convinced that it was about to give up in a fairly serious way. And I didn&#8217;t want that to happen to us on some long family journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We really got as much out of this car as we felt we could. And this car had been BRILLIANT. Other than replacing the drive shaft and having to re-attach some stupid metal heat-shield plate, this car had done us SO proud. It owed us and the world nothing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But its time had come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What we needed &#8211; our car usage<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We only do about 6000 &#8211; 7000 miles per year. We are fortunate enough that neither of us commute on a regular basis. So our driving is mostly a mix of:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Category 1: around-town stuff in bad weather and with the kids or heavy loads<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Category 2: shorter local &#8220;expeditions&#8221;, 15-50 miles<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Category 3: longer short-holiday trips of 100-150 miles with light luggage (occasionally much longer trips)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Category 4: bigger holidays that aren&#8217;t long distances, but that included camping with a VERY full load and a roofbox<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one <em>critical<\/em> journey that we need to make sort-of-often, and that&#8217;s 120 miles to visit my in-laws. Now that the kids are both well past toddler stage, we can do this trip relatively lightly and it&#8217;s a shorter category 3 trip.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Did you consider a plug-in hybrid, or regular hybrid?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Plug-in_hybrid\">PHEV&#8217;s (plugin hybrids)<\/a> seemed popular, and I&#8217;d had some recommendations. But some had also said that they were the worst of both worlds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We felt that our needs fitted within the abilities of an EV available within our budget. So I didn&#8217;t want the extra cost and complexity when it wasn&#8217;t really needed. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not really a problem, but I feel like having a combustion engine AND electric motor and battery AND the systems to manage it all was overly complex. For me, more complexity is more that can go wrong, so if we don&#8217;t need it then we should avoid it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A regular hybrid wasn&#8217;t on the table. It&#8217;s neat tech, but it&#8217;s primarily a petrol\/diesel car, and we were trying to avoid burning fossil fuels, so again, if we could avoid it, we should.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What we needed &#8211; our EV requirements<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We had decided that we couldn&#8217;t do category 4 trips in an EV. If we wanted to do that we would hire something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we needed a real-world range of, ideally, around 120+ miles to visit the in-laws, assuming we could pick up a top-up charge on the way, or charge at the destination somehow. We need this range when fully-loaded in winter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We needed a boot big enough for family-of-four luggage for a long weekend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we had a budget of \u00a315,000 &#8211; \u00a320,000. For the right car maybe we could do more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cars we looked at<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Renault Zoe (2022)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a running joke in our family, after a poor experience with electrics on a French car bought from the dealer-who-shall-not-be-named (let&#8217;s call them &#8220;Salmon Sisters&#8221; for now), that I would never buy a French car of any sort from Salmon Sisters, let alone <em>an electric one<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after doing some intense EV research and looking around online I noticed that Salmon Sisters &#8211; who are very local to us &#8211; had a smart-looking, 1-year old Renault Zoe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I signed up and took it for a test drive. Well, not the one that was for sale, but an equivalent car (don&#8217;t ask). And it was pretty nice. Great value. Just about big enough. <a href=\"https:\/\/ev-database.org\/uk\/car\/1205\/Renault-Zoe-ZE50-R135\">Advertised range of 240 miles, and a &#8220;real world&#8221; range of 190<\/a>. Rapid charging. And all the modern conveniences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked all the right questions and was really interested in it. A friend of ours has a Zoe and likes it. So I went away to think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I found this: this newer Renault Zoe got a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autocar.co.uk\/car-news\/new-cars\/renault-zoe-given-zero-stars-euro-ncap-safety-tests\">zero-star Euro-NCAP rating<\/a>! Mostly because they had removed a critical side-airbag. But also because the automated safety features weren&#8217;t up to scratch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One review was sub-titled: &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.carmagazine.co.uk\/car-reviews\/renault\/zoe-ev\/\">Little car, long range, don&#8217;t crash<\/a>&#8220;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Renault had apparently addressed some of the automated features in an update. And Euro-NCAP is like an enhanced safety standard. The Zoe is a legally-safe vehicle. So it&#8217;s not unsafe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But ALL the other cars we were looking at had 5-star Euro-NCAP ratings. So this seemed like a real downer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried to get past this. It seemed like a great car otherwise and great value. I could even ignore the reports of poor quality interior and sometimes leaky doors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I found out why we couldn&#8217;t test drive the actual car that was for sale. The story of &#8220;it&#8217;s on loan as a courtesy car&#8221; turned into &#8220;they forgot to charge it&#8221; and then into &#8220;the charging circuit is broken and needs to be replaced&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that point I quickly turned from being able to forgive its flaws to a hard &#8220;no thanks&#8221;. Both to the Zoe and to Salmon Sisters, who I felt had not been honest with us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nissan Leaf<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nissan Leaf was a great car. We looked at <a href=\"https:\/\/ev-database.org\/uk\/car\/1144\/Nissan-Leaf-eplus\">the &#8220;E+&#8221;<\/a> as this was the only one that had the range we needed. It had about 50 miles more range than the Hyundai Ioniq that we bought BUT it&#8217;s a less efficient car, so this came at the cost of a much larger 62kWh battery (vs 40kWh in the Ioniq).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of why it&#8217;s less efficient is that it&#8217;s more powerful. I mean, the Ioniq would accelerate quick if you put your foot down, but the Leaf&#8230; wow! It has 160kW of power equating to 215hp, vs the Ioniq&#8217;s 100kW\/134hp. (Those Tesla&#8217;s must be incredible!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Leaf felt more &#8220;manual&#8221; &#8211; like I was more in control and a bit more solid. The Hyundai felt a bit squishy and detached from the road. But really&#8230; I&#8217;m not a petrol head (we need some new words now, right?). The Ioniq is FINE and actually, I don&#8217;t want the encouragement to drive fast and hard. Plus, that bigger battery will take longer to charge up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the Leaf has a &#8220;CHAdeMO&#8221; rapid-charging port. This isn&#8217;t really <em>much<\/em> of a problem, but Europe is standardising on the &#8220;CCS&#8221; rapid charging ports and CHAdeMO may be a little bit harder to come across.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We liked the Leaf. It felt more like the kind of car we would drive and own. And it had a 5-star Euro NCAP safety rating. I would happily have bought it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hyundai Ioniq<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ev-database.org\/uk\/car\/1165\/Hyundai-IONIQ-Electric\">This is the one we bought<\/a>. Advertised range of 193 miles, real range of around 155 miles. Enough for our longer trip we need to do a lot. It&#8217;s 3 years old with 17,000 miles on it and the battery health seems fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main reason to choose this over the Leaf was the charging convenience. We don&#8217;t have a driveway or garage. We park on-street. So we can&#8217;t charge at home. So we need convenient charging. And the Ioniq&#8217;s greater efficiency, smaller battery size, quicker charging, and the more-commonly-found CCS charge port were what sold us on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to drive and has loads of safety features and clever stuff on board. And that 5-star Euro NCAP rating to stick it to the Zoe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, it feels less connected to the road than the Leaf was, but that&#8217;s OK. The interior is really nice if a bit lacking in headroom (none of us are too tall). And while lower power, it still has the instant torque that EV&#8217;s have which makes pulling away sometimes fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually like that it&#8217;s lower power. It has three driving modes: Eco, Normal and Sport. I&#8217;ve gotten used to Eco Mode which cranks up the regeneration (when the car harvests energy from braking) and kinda guides you into driving efficiently. And driving like this feels safer too. I&#8217;ve turned Sport Mode on a couple of times and it frightens me!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My only other complaint is that &#8230; well &#8230; it just <em>looks<\/em> a bit boring. It&#8217;s a sleek, grey saloon car. And the world is FULL of sleek, grey saloon cars. It&#8217;s a salesman&#8217;s car, not a family car. There&#8217;s not much fun about it. And it has this weird plate on the front that looks&#8230; just&#8230; weird.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230; we are REALLY happy with it. We are in a hugely privileged position to be able to own such a vehicle and we are really enjoying using it to get around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s been a lot to learn along the way. We&#8217;ve yet to do a drive of more than about 50 miles in it. But we hope this car will serve us well for many years to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where did you get it from?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, NOT &#8220;Salmon Sisters&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We found it on Auto Trader, who are great for search. But that search pointed us at <a href=\"https:\/\/drive-green.co.uk\/\">Drive Green<\/a> &#8211; a specialist used EV dealer just south of Bath (about 50 miles from us).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We took a day out to get there and go and try some cars out. One good thing about an independent dealership is that you can try a variety of makes and models, and they had a good stock of lots of different models. We could have tried BMW i3s, Peugeot e2008s, electric Minis, VW eGolfs, even used Teslas!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Drive Green team are brilliant. And they don&#8217;t want to sell you THEIR car. They want to sell you the car that&#8217;s right for you. They are highly recommended if you&#8217;re in the area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final notes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I said, we&#8217;re really fortunate to own this car. It&#8217;s a luxury. I feel quite embarrassed about it. But do we need it? REALLY need it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is probably no. We <em>could<\/em>, if we worked hard at it, be a zero-car family. I&#8217;d LOVE to not own a personal vehicle. To be in a car club. To have superb public transport around us. And to keep cycling for transport too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at this stage of life it&#8217;s enormously convenient to have access to a car.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We properly like our EV. We&#8217;re pretty certain we did the right thing getting it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we will try to remain a one-car family. (We know this is also a privilege!). We will keep cycling. We will keep avoiding the car for shorter journeys. We will keep asking our council and government for better infrastructure. And maybe, when this car has done its time, we won&#8217;t need to own one again? <\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thisamericanlife.org\/803\/\">This episode of This American Life<\/a> is amazing. It has several parts and looks at artificial intelligence from a number of different creative angles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s fascinating stories of how people become convinced of the &#8220;intelligence&#8221; of ChatGPT. There&#8217;s a short story that reverses the roles and tries to see how intelligent machines might question the intelligence of &#8220;meat&#8221;. There&#8217;s an aside about what whales might be up to. And a truly wonderful short documentary about teenagerhood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all wonderful bits of audio, as you would expect from the TAL crew. But the first one tapped into a whole load of things I&#8217;m thinking about these Large Language Model (LLM) AI&#8217;s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, when explaining how LLM&#8217;s work to people, I&#8217;ll say:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just predicting the next word from what it knows. So if I say to you &#8216;The cat sat on the&#8230;&#8217;, you would normally say&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>and the answer comes back:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;Mat&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And&#8230;that works as a REALLY simplified explanation. But it does often leave me wondering: Hang on&#8230; are WE just predicting the next word too?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the podcast, the people interviewed explain how they tried to get ChatGPT to do things that proved &#8211; or disproved &#8211; its &#8220;intelligence&#8221;. To show that it had a deeper understanding of what it was doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One challenge to ChatGPT is to get it to draw something. But it can&#8217;t draw. So they get it to write some code that will draw something. And it draws a unicorn. And then it&#8217;s given code that draws a unicorn without a horn, and is asked to modify the code to add the horn. And it does it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woah!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also ask it how to stack a number of items on top of each other: &#8220;a book, nine eggs, a laptop, a bottle, and a nail&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT 3 can&#8217;t do this. But ChatGPT 4 can:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;place the book flat on the level surface&#8230; Arrange the nine eggs in a 3-by-3 square on top of the book, leaving some space between them. The eggs will form a second layer and distribute the weight evenly. It continues&#8230; Laptop goes on the eggs, then the bottle, then the nail on the bottle cap, pointy end of the nail facing up&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Woah!!!! It&#8230; it &#8220;understands&#8221;!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there&#8217;s a &#8220;theory of mind&#8221; incident. This is where you can understand what another person knows or could be thinking, and it&#8217;s something you can&#8217;t do as a baby. Until you have &#8220;theory of mind&#8221; everyone knows the same things that you know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>John and Mark are in a room with a cat, a box, and a basket. John takes the cat and puts it in the basket. He leaves the room and goes to school. While John&#8217;s away, Mark takes the cat out of the basket and puts it in the box. Mark leaves the room and goes to work. John and Mark come back and enter the room. Where do they [each] think the cat is?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And ChatGPT 4 knows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where I start to have questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one&#8230; it seems to me like the computer should know this. Well, it should be able to complete this, regardless of whether or not it &#8220;knows&#8221; about the people and stuff. So I wouldn&#8217;t say that the computer has theory of mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what, then, prevents humans being able to complete this task correctly as an infant? Why do we NOT have theory of mind at a young age?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a psychologist. Perhaps there is an answer. And I&#8217;m not a philosopher. But this does speak to a part of me that thinks that we are more than just knowledge machines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our thinking and behaviour is often cloudied or muddied or influenced by other things. Tiredness. Hormones. Emotions. Memories can be fallible. Thoughts can both come from nowhere, and be muddled and incomplete for a whole variety of reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you probably can model a brain in terms of a neural network. But there&#8217;s all these other things going on in a person. A lot of which we don&#8217;t even understand let alone have the ability to model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I wondered was are the infants with no theory of mind driven more by their &#8220;lizard brain&#8221;? I&#8217;ve read a lot about how we have the primaeval &#8220;lizard brain&#8221; that controls our deepest instincts like the fight-or-flight instinct; the &#8220;monkey brain&#8221; which controls some higher levels of motivation and emotion, and the &#8220;human brain&#8221; which controls more abstract thought. (This is <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Triune_brain\">kinda considered a myth now<\/a>, but it seems to be a useful simplification.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are infants just more reliant on their instinctive behaviour?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And could we say that the LLM&#8217;s like Chat GPT are just &#8220;pure human brain&#8221; &#8211; logical, abstract thought, but with no emotions or instincts?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many, many years ago now, in my A Level Computing class (education aged 16-18) we debated whether an accurate reconstruction of a human brain from silicon &#8220;neurons&#8221; would be &#8220;intelligent&#8221; or &#8220;alive&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always felt like it wouldn&#8217;t be. That a human has something else going on. A &#8220;soul&#8221; or &#8220;spirit&#8221; that is something more than the sum of its parts. And this was before any helpful encounter with religion or spirituality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still think this with ChatGPT. Sure&#8230; it&#8217;s clever. But is there more to &#8220;intelligence&#8221; than even &#8220;knowing&#8221; or &#8220;understanding&#8221; things? Is ChatGPT clever because it _has_ &#8220;theory of mind&#8221;, or is it stupid because it _lacks_ the instincts that keep a toddler alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really don&#8217;t know. But they were interesting thoughts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do YOU think?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thisamericanlife.org\/803\/\">This episode of This American Life<\/a> is amazing. It has several parts and looks at artificial intelligence from a number of different creative angles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s fascinating stories of how people become convinced of the &#8220;intelligence&#8221; of ChatGPT. There&#8217;s a short story that reverses the roles and tries to see how intelligent machines might question the intelligence of &#8220;meat&#8221;. There&#8217;s an aside about what whales might be up to. And a truly wonderful short documentary about teenagerhood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all wonderful bits of audio, as you would expect from the TAL crew. But the first one tapped into a whole load of things I&#8217;m thinking about these Large Language Model (LLM) AI&#8217;s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, when explaining how LLM&#8217;s work to people, I&#8217;ll say:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just predicting the next word from what it knows. So if I say to you &#8216;The cat sat on the&#8230;&#8217;, you would normally say&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>and the answer comes back:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;Mat&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And&#8230;that works as a REALLY simplified explanation. But it does often leave me wondering: Hang on&#8230; are WE just predicting the next word too?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the podcast, the people interviewed explain how they tried to get ChatGPT to do things that proved &#8211; or disproved &#8211; its &#8220;intelligence&#8221;. To show that it had a deeper understanding of what it was doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One challenge to ChatGPT is to get it to draw something. But it can&#8217;t draw. So they get it to write some code that will draw something. And it draws a unicorn. And then it&#8217;s given code that draws a unicorn without a horn, and is asked to modify the code to add the horn. And it does it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woah!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also ask it how to stack a number of items on top of each other: &#8220;a book, nine eggs, a laptop, a bottle, and a nail&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT 3 can&#8217;t do this. But ChatGPT 4 can:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;place the book flat on the level surface&#8230; Arrange the nine eggs in a 3-by-3 square on top of the book, leaving some space between them. The eggs will form a second layer and distribute the weight evenly. It continues&#8230; Laptop goes on the eggs, then the bottle, then the nail on the bottle cap, pointy end of the nail facing up&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Woah!!!! It&#8230; it &#8220;understands&#8221;!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there&#8217;s a &#8220;theory of mind&#8221; incident. This is where you can understand what another person knows or could be thinking, and it&#8217;s something you can&#8217;t do as a baby. Until you have &#8220;theory of mind&#8221; everyone knows the same things that you know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>John and Mark are in a room with a cat, a box, and a basket. John takes the cat and puts it in the basket. He leaves the room and goes to school. While John&#8217;s away, Mark takes the cat out of the basket and puts it in the box. Mark leaves the room and goes to work. John and Mark come back and enter the room. Where do they [each] think the cat is?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And ChatGPT 4 knows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where I start to have questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one&#8230; it seems to me like the computer should know this. Well, it should be able to complete this, regardless of whether or not it &#8220;knows&#8221; about the people and stuff. So I wouldn&#8217;t say that the computer has theory of mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what, then, prevents humans being able to complete this task correctly as an infant? Why do we NOT have theory of mind at a young age?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a psychologist. Perhaps there is an answer. And I&#8217;m not a philosopher. But this does speak to a part of me that thinks that we are more than just knowledge machines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our thinking and behaviour is often cloudied or muddied or influenced by other things. Tiredness. Hormones. Emotions. Memories can be fallible. Thoughts can both come from nowhere, and be muddled and incomplete for a whole variety of reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you probably can model a brain in terms of a neural network. But there&#8217;s all these other things going on in a person. A lot of which we don&#8217;t even understand let alone have the ability to model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I wondered was are the infants with no theory of mind driven more by their &#8220;lizard brain&#8221;? I&#8217;ve read a lot about how we have the primaeval &#8220;lizard brain&#8221; that controls our deepest instincts like the fight-or-flight instinct; the &#8220;monkey brain&#8221; which controls some higher levels of motivation and emotion, and the &#8220;human brain&#8221; which controls more abstract thought. (This is <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Triune_brain\">kinda considered a myth now<\/a>, but it seems to be a useful simplification.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are infants just more reliant on their instinctive behaviour?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And could we say that the LLM&#8217;s like Chat GPT are just &#8220;pure human brain&#8221; &#8211; logical, abstract thought, but with no emotions or instincts?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many, many years ago now, in my A Level Computing class (education aged 16-18) we debated whether an accurate reconstruction of a human brain from silicon &#8220;neurons&#8221; would be &#8220;intelligent&#8221; or &#8220;alive&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always felt like it wouldn&#8217;t be. That a human has something else going on. A &#8220;soul&#8221; or &#8220;spirit&#8221; that is something more than the sum of its parts. And this was before any helpful encounter with religion or spirituality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still think this with ChatGPT. Sure&#8230; it&#8217;s clever. But is there more to &#8220;intelligence&#8221; than even &#8220;knowing&#8221; or &#8220;understanding&#8221; things? Is ChatGPT clever because it _has_ &#8220;theory of mind&#8221;, or is it stupid because it _lacks_ the instincts that keep a toddler alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really don&#8217;t know. But they were interesting thoughts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do YOU think?<\/p>\n",
