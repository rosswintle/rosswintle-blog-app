I don&#8217;t record it to make me appear big, I record it to express my sheer exasperation with other people&#8217;s dishonesty, and the fact that the world EXPECTS dishonesty from me &#8211; it has become the acceptable norm and is actively encouraged and it bothers me&#8230;a lot!<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s this lovely girl at work who works in the canteen.  She&#8217;s not been there long and she mostly just clears up after us and takes the money.  But she&#8217;s not so good at taking the money.  She doesn&#8217;t really know how much things cost (which, to her credit, is not really her fault &#8211; most of us customers don&#8217;t know how much things cost either!), and she doesn&#8217;t seem very good at the money handling bit.<\/p>\n<p>The other day I passed her a ten pound note and she accidentally gave me back the ten pound note AND my change.  She, in effect, paid me to eat at the canteen!<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;ve had reason to relate this story to some of my colleagues recently, and every time people have said &#8220;I hope you kept it&#8221; or &#8220;You didn&#8217;t give it back did you?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Well, of course I did.  I wanted to pay for my lunch.  Bless her, she&#8217;s made a mistake, which I&#8217;ve noticed, and I&#8217;m not gonna have her getting into trouble because the till&#8217;s down at the end of the day because I deliberately accepted more change than I was supposed to get!<\/p>\n<p>Yet, I&#8217;m made to feel belittled and silly for doing the right thing.  People are astonished that I&#8217;m honest.  Why is this?<\/p>\n<p>I remember what the Bible says about this: &#8220;even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed&#8221;.<\/p>\n",

I don&#8217;t record it to make me appear big, I record it to express my sheer exasperation with other people&#8217;s dishonesty, and the fact that the world EXPECTS dishonesty from me &#8211; it has become the acceptable norm and is actively encouraged and it bothers me&#8230;a lot!<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s this lovely girl at work who works in the canteen.  She&#8217;s not been there long and she mostly just clears up after us and takes the money.  But she&#8217;s not so good at taking the money.  She doesn&#8217;t really know how much things cost (which, to her credit, is not really her fault &#8211; most of us customers don&#8217;t know how much things cost either!), and she doesn&#8217;t seem very good at the money handling bit.<\/p>\n<p>The other day I passed her a ten pound note and she accidentally gave me back the ten pound note AND my change.  She, in effect, paid me to eat at the canteen!<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;ve had reason to relate this story to some of my colleagues recently, and every time people have said &#8220;I hope you kept it&#8221; or &#8220;You didn&#8217;t give it back did you?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Well, of course I did.  I wanted to pay for my lunch.  Bless her, she&#8217;s made a mistake, which I&#8217;ve noticed, and I&#8217;m not gonna have her getting into trouble because the till&#8217;s down at the end of the day because I deliberately accepted more change than I was supposed to get!<\/p>\n<p>Yet, I&#8217;m made to feel belittled and silly for doing the right thing.  People are astonished that I&#8217;m honest.  Why is this?<\/p>\n<p>I remember what the Bible says about this: &#8220;even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed&#8221;.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>It&#8217;s fair trade fortnight!  I hadn&#8217;t actually realised &#8211; communication on it has been quiet this year.<\/p>\n<p>However, as part of the week, a film called Black Gold was on the telly.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re all into sustainability and fair trade anyway, we understand that the trade that we do greatly affects the lives of people in the third world, we see the bigger picture of how we in the UK are very rich and yet we exploit the poor people in the developing world, and we&#8217;re compelled by our faith and our conscience to do something about it.  So we probably didn&#8217;t need to see this film.<\/p>\n<p>However, it was a good documentary!  Unlike things like &#8220;Super Size Me&#8221;, &#8220;Farenheit 9\/11&#8221; and &#8220;Bowling for Columbine&#8221;, there is no star of the show.  There is no man on a quest.  The filmmakers show only their interviewees and the subjects merely speak for themselves.  There is a central character &#8211; a man who runs a coffee co-operative.  But even he is really just a subject of the film.  I liked this.  I didn&#8217;t feel someone was desperately trying to prove a point.  There weren&#8217;y awkward questions; there were just truthful answers.<\/p>\n<p>The film outlined well the difficulties of growing coffee, selling it for a good price and making a living as a coffee farmer.  It showed that there are many middlemen in the selling process, who all take their cut of the money.  It demonstrated that the price of coffee is mostly decided by rich businessmen in America and the UK.<\/p>\n<p>And it showed how unfair the standard process of trade really is!<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s some of the figures that I recall.  Ethiopian coffee beans sold for 2 Ethiopian Birr per kilo &#8211; at the time of making the film this was 57 US cents.<\/p>\n<p>A kilo of beans makes 80 cups of coffee.  This equates to 0.71 US cents per cup.<\/p>\n<p>One of the farmers says that selling for 5 Birr instead of 2 would change his life dramatically.  5 Birr is 142.5 US cents per kilo or, given the 80-cups-per-kilo figure, 1.78 US cents per cup.<\/p>\n<p>This means an extra 1.07 US cents, per cup, would dramatically change this guys life.<\/p>\n<p>1 US cent!<\/p>\n<p>Per cup!<\/p>\n<p>And the middle men and Starbucks and Nestle and Tesco and probably even the Fairtrade coffee companies are making millions!<\/p>\n<p>Now, I know that fair trade isn&#8217;t a long term solution to the problems of the developing world.  But for 1 cent per cup of coffee we could transform lives, give people some healthcare, send kids to school.<\/p>\n<p>So what we do? What can I do?  I already buy fair trade so I&#8217;m already helping in some way.  I did have the idea of having a pot by the kettle and putting a coin (of any denomination) in it each time I made a cup of coffee, and giving this money to a development agency.  But I&#8217;m already paying the fair trade premium, so how much will this help.<\/p>\n<p>Better is to get other people to buy fairtrade and push more of the market that way.  Better to campaign for the multinational coffee buyers to set and pay a fair price.  Better to make sure others know that such a small amount of money makes such a big difference!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>It&#8217;s fair trade fortnight!  I hadn&#8217;t actually realised &#8211; communication on it has been quiet this year.<\/p>\n<p>However, as part of the week, a film called Black Gold was on the telly.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re all into sustainability and fair trade anyway, we understand that the trade that we do greatly affects the lives of people in the third world, we see the bigger picture of how we in the UK are very rich and yet we exploit the poor people in the developing world, and we&#8217;re compelled by our faith and our conscience to do something about it.  So we probably didn&#8217;t need to see this film.<\/p>\n<p>However, it was a good documentary!  Unlike things like &#8220;Super Size Me&#8221;, &#8220;Farenheit 9\/11&#8221; and &#8220;Bowling for Columbine&#8221;, there is no star of the show.  There is no man on a quest.  The filmmakers show only their interviewees and the subjects merely speak for themselves.  There is a central character &#8211; a man who runs a coffee co-operative.  But even he is really just a subject of the film.  I liked this.  I didn&#8217;t feel someone was desperately trying to prove a point.  There weren&#8217;y awkward questions; there were just truthful answers.<\/p>\n<p>The film outlined well the difficulties of growing coffee, selling it for a good price and making a living as a coffee farmer.  It showed that there are many middlemen in the selling process, who all take their cut of the money.  It demonstrated that the price of coffee is mostly decided by rich businessmen in America and the UK.<\/p>\n<p>And it showed how unfair the standard process of trade really is!<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s some of the figures that I recall.  Ethiopian coffee beans sold for 2 Ethiopian Birr per kilo &#8211; at the time of making the film this was 57 US cents.<\/p>\n<p>A kilo of beans makes 80 cups of coffee.  This equates to 0.71 US cents per cup.<\/p>\n<p>One of the farmers says that selling for 5 Birr instead of 2 would change his life dramatically.  5 Birr is 142.5 US cents per kilo or, given the 80-cups-per-kilo figure, 1.78 US cents per cup.<\/p>\n<p>This means an extra 1.07 US cents, per cup, would dramatically change this guys life.<\/p>\n<p>1 US cent!<\/p>\n<p>Per cup!<\/p>\n<p>And the middle men and Starbucks and Nestle and Tesco and probably even the Fairtrade coffee companies are making millions!<\/p>\n<p>Now, I know that fair trade isn&#8217;t a long term solution to the problems of the developing world.  But for 1 cent per cup of coffee we could transform lives, give people some healthcare, send kids to school.<\/p>\n<p>So what we do? What can I do?  I already buy fair trade so I&#8217;m already helping in some way.  I did have the idea of having a pot by the kettle and putting a coin (of any denomination) in it each time I made a cup of coffee, and giving this money to a development agency.  But I&#8217;m already paying the fair trade premium, so how much will this help.<\/p>\n<p>Better is to get other people to buy fairtrade and push more of the market that way.  Better to campaign for the multinational coffee buyers to set and pay a fair price.  Better to make sure others know that such a small amount of money makes such a big difference!<\/p>\n",

For a nearly-town house this is HUGE!  And it&#8217;s nicely split with some lawn, some patio and a vegetable patch.<\/p>\n<p>There are numerous reasons why we think a veg patch is great:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It&#8217;s OH SO ENGLISH!<\/li>\n<li>We believe in buying locally<\/li>\n<li>We&#8217;re trying to be sustainable (might not achieve that this year but hope to in future years!)<\/li>\n<li>We hate supermarket food packaging<\/li>\n<li>Gardening is fun, and a good team-building opportunity<\/li>\n<li>It will help us keep fit<\/li>\n<li>Food will taste better<\/li>\n<li>Eating vegetables will be SO much more satisfying knowing that we&#8217;ve grown them ourselves.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Oh and we&#8217;ve already decided that there&#8217;s no point resisting the fact that we&#8217;re turning into our parents so there&#8217;s not real excuse NOT to get into gardening.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Preparing the Soil<\/p>\n<p><\/span>Now, we bought the house in October and it took us a while to move and unpack and settle, so we&#8217;ve only really just seriously started thinking about the garden and from what we gather, all the weed killing processes (mulching, rotavating, poisoning and so on) start in the autumn and progress over the winter.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Failed Cardboard Mulching and so on&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We DID originally try laying lots of cardboard over the patch.  This would remove the light and air and kill the plants and they would then rot into the ground!  But this has only been a little bit successful.  We didn&#8217;t really have enough cardboard and it kept blowing away &#8211; you need LOTS of BIG boxes and heavy things to hold them down &#8211; fabric pegs are not strong enough.  This probably works if you have lots of old carpet or something but just cardboard boxes really didn&#8217;t do it<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">.<\/p>\n<p><\/span>The idea with rotavating is very similar &#8211; you chop everything up and over the winter it rots into the ground.  We didn&#8217;t do this.  It would probably have worked better.<\/p>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t try herbicides as we&#8217;re TRYING to be organic and not cover our nice veggies with nasty chemicals.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Digging<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And so we find ourselves in the spring with a garden full of weeds.  The only route&#8230;manual eradication!  Yes, down on our hands and knees pulling up us much as we can, roots and all.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s slow, back breaking work.  But it&#8217;s working.  We&#8217;re adding in some compost to our very-clay&#8217;y (?) soil and it&#8217;s actually looking like something might grow in it!  In fact, I&#8217;m quite encouraged by how much the weeds like the soil!<\/p>\n<p>And our veggies will taste all the better for it!<\/p>\n",

For a nearly-town house this is HUGE!  And it&#8217;s nicely split with some lawn, some patio and a vegetable patch.<\/p>\n<p>There are numerous reasons why we think a veg patch is great:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It&#8217;s OH SO ENGLISH!<\/li>\n<li>We believe in buying locally<\/li>\n<li>We&#8217;re trying to be sustainable (might not achieve that this year but hope to in future years!)<\/li>\n<li>We hate supermarket food packaging<\/li>\n<li>Gardening is fun, and a good team-building opportunity<\/li>\n<li>It will help us keep fit<\/li>\n<li>Food will taste better<\/li>\n<li>Eating vegetables will be SO much more satisfying knowing that we&#8217;ve grown them ourselves.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Oh and we&#8217;ve already decided that there&#8217;s no point resisting the fact that we&#8217;re turning into our parents so there&#8217;s not real excuse NOT to get into gardening.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Preparing the Soil<\/p>\n<p><\/span>Now, we bought the house in October and it took us a while to move and unpack and settle, so we&#8217;ve only really just seriously started thinking about the garden and from what we gather, all the weed killing processes (mulching, rotavating, poisoning and so on) start in the autumn and progress over the winter.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Failed Cardboard Mulching and so on&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We DID originally try laying lots of cardboard over the patch.  This would remove the light and air and kill the plants and they would then rot into the ground!  But this has only been a little bit successful.  We didn&#8217;t really have enough cardboard and it kept blowing away &#8211; you need LOTS of BIG boxes and heavy things to hold them down &#8211; fabric pegs are not strong enough.  This probably works if you have lots of old carpet or something but just cardboard boxes really didn&#8217;t do it<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">.<\/p>\n<p><\/span>The idea with rotavating is very similar &#8211; you chop everything up and over the winter it rots into the ground.  We didn&#8217;t do this.  It would probably have worked better.<\/p>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t try herbicides as we&#8217;re TRYING to be organic and not cover our nice veggies with nasty chemicals.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Digging<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And so we find ourselves in the spring with a garden full of weeds.  The only route&#8230;manual eradication!  Yes, down on our hands and knees pulling up us much as we can, roots and all.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s slow, back breaking work.  But it&#8217;s working.  We&#8217;re adding in some compost to our very-clay&#8217;y (?) soil and it&#8217;s actually looking like something might grow in it!  In fact, I&#8217;m quite encouraged by how much the weeds like the soil!<\/p>\n<p>And our veggies will taste all the better for it!<\/p>\n",

Its also ridiculously easy to play, I already know the words, and it&#8217;s another one that I&#8217;ve tried to learn before, so it&#8217;s just a case of cementing the chords in my head.

And it&#8217;s just cheesy jangly guitar pop.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, I&#8217;m sure many many people know it, so it&#8217;s on my list.  Its also ridiculously easy to play, I already know the words, and it&#8217;s another one that I&#8217;ve tried to learn before, so it&#8217;s just a case of cementing the chords in my head.

And here&#8217;s another &#8211; Counting Crows&#8217; &#8220;Mr Jones&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I discovered Counting Crows a bit later than my contemporaries.  Their debut was, I believe, released in the 90&#8217;s but I only found them through Sally&#8217;s record collection a couple of years back.  And they&#8217;re awesome!<\/p>\n<p>A friend of mine who is a very good musician, and who&#8217;s musical opinion I very much respect, has Counting Crows&#8217; &#8220;August and Everything After&#8221; album on his list of top albums of the 90&#8217;s, and I really do agree &#8211; it&#8217;s an album I&#8217;ve listened to again and again and again and never grown bored of.  In fact, I keep finding more and more intricacies to keep me interested.  For example, the song &#8220;Anna Begins&#8221; was usually skipped over at first, but it&#8217;s a true gem that I choose to listen to now.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway &#8211; Mr Jones is a great song.  A poem set to music.  It&#8217;s rousing, thoughtful, interesting, and dynamic.  But it&#8217;s a complicated one.  I HAVE already learned all the words.  I will probably not be able to get them in the right order.  I know that the music contains d-minor&#8217;s &#8211; my least favourite chord.  But it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to learn.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m falling a bit behind again.  This is week 10, so I&#8217;ve skipped 3 songs.  But never mind.  So I really only have until Tuesday to learn this!  Eeek!<\/p>\n",

And here&#8217;s another &#8211; Counting Crows&#8217; &#8220;Mr Jones&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I discovered Counting Crows a bit later than my contemporaries.  Their debut was, I believe, released in the 90&#8217;s but I only found them through Sally&#8217;s record collection a couple of years back.  And they&#8217;re awesome!<\/p>\n<p>A friend of mine who is a very good musician, and who&#8217;s musical opinion I very much respect, has Counting Crows&#8217; &#8220;August and Everything After&#8221; album on his list of top albums of the 90&#8217;s, and I really do agree &#8211; it&#8217;s an album I&#8217;ve listened to again and again and again and never grown bored of.  In fact, I keep finding more and more intricacies to keep me interested.  For example, the song &#8220;Anna Begins&#8221; was usually skipped over at first, but it&#8217;s a true gem that I choose to listen to now.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway &#8211; Mr Jones is a great song.  A poem set to music.  It&#8217;s rousing, thoughtful, interesting, and dynamic.  But it&#8217;s a complicated one.  I HAVE already learned all the words.  I will probably not be able to get them in the right order.  I know that the music contains d-minor&#8217;s &#8211; my least favourite chord.  But it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to learn.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m falling a bit behind again.  This is week 10, so I&#8217;ve skipped 3 songs.  But never mind.  So I really only have until Tuesday to learn this!  Eeek!<\/p>\n",

Well, not locks, but little sliding latches.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Easy&#8221;, I thought.  Jusy buy &#8217;em, from B&amp;Q, fix one bit to the door and another bit to the frame and Bob&#8217;s your uncle!<\/p>\n<p>Not so!  Did you know that there are two types of simple sliding latch?  I didn&#8217;t!<\/p>\n<p>The first one went on fine.  More fluke than anything.<\/p>\n<p>I got the first bit of the second one on and then suddenly realised that it was not going to work.  I had to go and buy another latch of a slightly different type!<\/p>\n<p>A quick explanation.  It all depends on which side of the door you&#8217;re on.  From one side a door closes agains the frame.  I&#8217;ll call this the &#8220;outside&#8221; of the door.  When the door is closed it sits behind a chunk of wood.  In this case you can use a latch which slides into a hole in the frame.  Like this&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-apzUKeIVI\/AAAAAAAAB4o\/fjxGqWpRaw4\/s1600-h\/IMG_0421.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-apzUKeIVI\/AAAAAAAAB4o\/fjxGqWpRaw4\/s400\/IMG_0421.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>If you&#8217;re on the &#8220;inside&#8221; of the door, the door is flush with the frame &#8211; so you don&#8217;t have the chunk of wood to drill a big hole into.  So you have to have a raised &#8220;hole&#8221; for the latch to fit into.  Like this&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-arYUKeIWI\/AAAAAAAAB4w\/0limCbj1p2k\/s1600-h\/IMG_0417.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-arYUKeIWI\/AAAAAAAAB4w\/0limCbj1p2k\/s400\/IMG_0417.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>It WELL confused me for a while.  It all makes perfect sense now but why didn&#8217;t we think of it before?  How am I supposed to know that there&#8217;s two different sorts of latch.<\/p>\n<p>I believe this is what people call &#8220;trial and error&#8221;.  I sense there may be more of this ahead!<\/p>\n",

Well, not locks, but little sliding latches.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Easy&#8221;, I thought.  Jusy buy &#8217;em, from B&amp;Q, fix one bit to the door and another bit to the frame and Bob&#8217;s your uncle!<\/p>\n<p>Not so!  Did you know that there are two types of simple sliding latch?  I didn&#8217;t!<\/p>\n<p>The first one went on fine.  More fluke than anything.<\/p>\n<p>I got the first bit of the second one on and then suddenly realised that it was not going to work.  I had to go and buy another latch of a slightly different type!<\/p>\n<p>A quick explanation.  It all depends on which side of the door you&#8217;re on.  From one side a door closes agains the frame.  I&#8217;ll call this the &#8220;outside&#8221; of the door.  When the door is closed it sits behind a chunk of wood.  In this case you can use a latch which slides into a hole in the frame.

But I just think that football players are rude and obnoxious in comparison, there&#8217;s the minority of violent fans, and these external factors often ruin my enjoyment of the game.<\/p>\n<p>Rugby is a game for thugs, but, even in the professional version, they remain polite and respectful throughout and the players are humble and intelligent.  Plus, it&#8217;s MORE beautiful to watch when played well, MORE exciting and MORE entertaining.<\/p>\n<p>Only my opinions of course.<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;without a club to watch (Swindon Supermarine anybody?) I get very excited when the 6 Nations comes around each year and this year has been no exception, especially as England seem to be pulling themselves up a bit after their dismal first half of the World Cup last year.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking recently about the big famous guy &#8211; Jonny Wilkinson.  A while back, after winning the World Cup in 2003, he was injured a LOT and whenever he tried to come back to the game he got injured again.  I was really thinking that his career was over.<\/p>\n<p>And here he is, kicking the points that win games for England again, breaking points records, charging into wince-inducing tackles, and chucking the ball around like gravity doesn&#8217;t exist.  How did he get from there to here?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had a lot of injuries and illness lately and I&#8217;m recovering from that myself.  And, I can tell you, it feels great.  But at the time it was really hard on me and a lot of that was psychological.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that a big part of Wilkinson&#8217;s recovery is psychological.  When he speaks about it, Wilkinson says that his kicking is all about his mental focus and I believe that he applied that to his recovery.  In the same way he pictures the ball going between the posts from 50 metres, he pictures himself being well, recovering and playing again.  And it&#8217;s not just me &#8211; even the 6 Nations commentators have been talking a lot about his incredible &#8220;self belief&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m quite inspired by this.  I know that a lot of my recovery was actually thinking I was better. Yes, I believe that God helped with my psychological process (there&#8217;s a LOT of encouraging words to boost your self-esteem in the Bible), and I hope that I&#8217;m mentally a bit tougher for having gone through it.  But I also see how important it is that we think positively, even when we&#8217;re in pain or distress.<\/p>\n<p>Having said all of that, tomorrow is the final day of this year&#8217;s six nations, and I don&#8217;t think any about of positive thinking on behalf of myself or Jonny Wilkinson will reduce the number of points that Wales and France have.  We&#8217;ve no way to win.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps if I start thinking about 6 Nations 2009 now&#8230;<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;m a big rugby (UNION!!!) fan.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217; t know why.  Football is a great game; incredibly skillful, beautiful to watch, exciting, entertaining.  But I just think that football players are rude and obnoxious in comparison, there&#8217;s the minority of violent fans, and these external factors often ruin my enjoyment of the game.<\/p>\n<p>Rugby is a game for thugs, but, even in the professional version, they remain polite and respectful throughout and the players are humble and intelligent.  Plus, it&#8217;s MORE beautiful to watch when played well, MORE exciting and MORE entertaining.<\/p>\n<p>Only my opinions of course.<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;without a club to watch (Swindon Supermarine anybody?) I get very excited when the 6 Nations comes around each year and this year has been no exception, especially as England seem to be pulling themselves up a bit after their dismal first half of the World Cup last year.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking recently about the big famous guy &#8211; Jonny Wilkinson.  A while back, after winning the World Cup in 2003, he was injured a LOT and whenever he tried to come back to the game he got injured again.  I was really thinking that his career was over.<\/p>\n<p>And here he is, kicking the points that win games for England again, breaking points records, charging into wince-inducing tackles, and chucking the ball around like gravity doesn&#8217;t exist.  How did he get from there to here?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had a lot of injuries and illness lately and I&#8217;m recovering from that myself.  And, I can tell you, it feels great.  But at the time it was really hard on me and a lot of that was psychological.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that a big part of Wilkinson&#8217;s recovery is psychological.  When he speaks about it, Wilkinson says that his kicking is all about his mental focus and I believe that he applied that to his recovery.  In the same way he pictures the ball going between the posts from 50 metres, he pictures himself being well, recovering and playing again.  And it&#8217;s not just me &#8211; even the 6 Nations commentators have been talking a lot about his incredible &#8220;self belief&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m quite inspired by this.  I know that a lot of my recovery was actually thinking I was better. Yes, I believe that God helped with my psychological process (there&#8217;s a LOT of encouraging words to boost your self-esteem in the Bible), and I hope that I&#8217;m mentally a bit tougher for having gone through it.  But I also see how important it is that we think positively, even when we&#8217;re in pain or distress.<\/p>\n<p>Having said all of that, tomorrow is the final day of this year&#8217;s six nations, and I don&#8217;t think any about of positive thinking on behalf of myself or Jonny Wilkinson will reduce the number of points that Wales and France have.  We&#8217;ve no way to win.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps if I start thinking about 6 Nations 2009 now&#8230;<\/p>\n",

As I drove back from the N.E.C. today, via my lovely Grandma&#8217;s for a cuppa, I noticed a Kebab van on the edge of a small town called Malmesbury (famous for it&#8217;s Naked Gardeners).  I think it was in this layby here:<\/p>\n<p>[googlemaps http:\/\/maps.google.co.uk\/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Malmesbury,+Wiltshire&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;s=AARTsJojaaoN-iacqTpehAEMs3OdvQFehA&amp;ll=51.585803,-2.089237&amp;spn=0.001167,0.00228&amp;z=18&amp;output=embed&amp;w=425&amp;h=350]<\/p>\n<p>If the link to Google Maps works you should be able to zoom out and see that this is on a quiet road with&#8230;err&#8230;no houses near it at all.  I imagine that quaint, antique-shoppy Malmesbury&#8217;s market for kebabs is pretty small and most passing cars won&#8217;t know there&#8217;s greasy food and cheap coffee in polystyrene cups available until they&#8217;re passed the damn thing and well on their way to Tetbury anyway.<\/p>\n<p>Can they make ANY money at all?<\/p>\n<p>And yet &#8211; someone had stopped to buy one!<\/p>\n<p>Who?

As I drove back from the N.E.C. today, via my lovely Grandma&#8217;s for a cuppa, I noticed a Kebab van on the edge of a small town called Malmesbury (famous for it&#8217;s Naked Gardeners).  I think it was in this layby here:<\/p>\n<p>[googlemaps http:\/\/maps.google.co.uk\/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Malmesbury,+Wiltshire&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;s=AARTsJojaaoN-iacqTpehAEMs3OdvQFehA&amp;ll=51.585803,-2.089237&amp;spn=0.001167,0.00228&amp;z=18&amp;output=embed&amp;w=425&amp;h=350]<\/p>\n<p>If the link to Google Maps works you should be able to zoom out and see that this is on a quiet road with&#8230;err&#8230;no houses near it at all.  I imagine that quaint, antique-shoppy Malmesbury&#8217;s market for kebabs is pretty small and most passing cars won&#8217;t know there&#8217;s greasy food and cheap coffee in polystyrene cups available until they&#8217;re passed the damn thing and well on their way to Tetbury anyway.<\/p>\n<p>Can they make ANY money at all?<\/p>\n<p>And yet &#8211; someone had stopped to buy one!<\/p>\n<p>Who? And why?<\/p>\n",

This is like admitting to enjoying watching &#8220;Spice World&#8221; (oh come on, it was worth it just for the fake bus jumping over Tower Bridge &#8220;Speed&#8221;-style).  Yes, this was on TV.
