I&#8217;ve also actually posting some useful information about it on <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/het_schoolbot\">Twitter<\/a>.

                "rendered": "\n<p>Everyone is writing about CSS, and I work with CSS, so I guess I should write about CSS too. Please bear in mind I\u2019ve spent far less time thinking about this than others. But these are my thoughts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, I half-jokingly present you my new convention: SUCSS. But before I tell you what it\u2019s all about let&#8217;s get some context.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS and Me<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m relatively old friends with CSS. I guess I started working in web development for real in 2010. I remember the stupid IE6 margin bugs, and learning the box model. It was hard work, but it was all we had. And once you knew the quirks it was actually powerful to work with. And I&#8217;d argue that it has remained powerful and only gotten MORE powerful over the years. Regardless of where you put it and how you name things, CSS is THE underlying technology for all styling of HTML on the web. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Presentational vs Semantic Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in the day \u201csemantic classes\u201d were all the rage. This was What You Should Do. And the hard line on this appeared to be a push back against people wanting to make \u201cpresentational\u201d classes like \u201cbig-padding\u201d or \u201cfloat-left\u201d or \u201cblue-text\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This kind of stuff, they said, shouldn\u2019t clutter up your markup. The markup describes the structure of the document not its presentation!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Classes should be things like \u201cmain-header\u201d, \u201cwidget-area\u201d, \u201cfooter-credits\u201d. Names that describe what something is, not what it looks like. After all the sidebar could be on the left or the right or at the bottom. You shouldn\u2019t constrain your presentation by what you write in your markup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I always found writing CSS for semantic classes was a bind. Well, not so much writing it, but editing it. Especially other people\u2019s CSS. I remember spending time searching huge CSS files (and later entire directories of SASS files) to try and work out where a class was so that I could tweak the padding on it, only to realise then that this would affect ALL instances of this class and might have unintended knock-on effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wished that I had some kind of permission to add an inline style attribute, or a \u201cbig-padding-top\u201d class to safely tweak just that one instance of this thing in this one place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">BEM, OOCSS, SMACSS and so on<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Various conventions then emerged from some very clever people to try and name your classes and structure your CSS in better ways. These were great. They kept semantics, but allowed you to add contexts and modifiers, inherit properties between classes in an ordered way, and flatten the cascade toprevent styles bleeding from one place to another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clever stuff!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I liked this. But the problem was that anyone involved in the project had to be along for the ride. In an agency this is possible but I\u2019m a freelancer who sometimes works solo and sometimes with other freelancers or agencies, and so I never really fully adopted one of these techniques because each project was different. Yes, they informed the techniques and conventions I used but I found it hard to take them on 100%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Aside: Less and SASS and tooling.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s quickly touch on these. I\u2019m not an early adopter of new things. I\u2019m a cautious semi-early adopter. I picked SASS and was glad I did. I don\u2019t use it in a big way: variables, nesting (not needed so much if you\u2019re full-on BEM), and file includes to break things up all help though. I\u2019m pretty much SASS by default now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the tooling&#8230;THE TOOLING! Yes, it was good. But it came in many forms. And so many people had so many different setups. Again, if you work in one big team and do the same thing everywhere this isn\u2019t so bad. But working in multiple places and often inheriting projects from others made this hard work: what\u2019s the darned build command on THIS project then?!?!? The README.txt became king.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>npm, grunt, gulp, webpack, PostCSS, and so on have not helped in this regard. Yes, tool chains have got way more powerful than they were, but they are also way more complicated!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">And so we come full circle<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So it came to pass that one day I inherited a project that used \u201cTachyons\u201d. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I\u2019m looking at markup with things like <code>class=\"f4 mt3 bt bw1 b\u2014gray br2\"<\/code> and I\u2019m thinking: WHAT?!?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, it turns out, was my first exposure to \u201cfunctional\u201d or \u201c    utility\u201d CSS. This is basically writing styles in the markup, but disguised as CSS classes. Which is, you know, the thing everyone rallied hard against 6 or 7 years ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;whereas everyone can understand <code>style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1.25rem;\"<\/code> etc, Tachyons has its own language that only Tachyons people understand. All, presumably, in the name of saving bytes (a measure which, at this scale, is probably irrelevant).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also&#8230;reading and understanding markup with Tachyons classes in it is horrendous. Just what is this thing? Yes, it\u2019s a large, blue, margin-topped, bottom-bordered THING with white text. But, like, WHAT IS IT?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HTML5 elements can help identify things, of course, as can IDs or components, if that\u2019s your thing. But&#8230;just&#8230;.gah!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I get that you can define your colours and type scales and so on, but I, personally, didn&#8217;t like Tachyons (can you tell?) and it left me along with the project I inherited that used it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Aside: I&#8217;m being somewhat extreme for dramatic effect here. If you use Tachyons and love it then that&#8217;s awesome. If you made Tachyons &#8211; great job, thank you! I, personally didn&#8217;t get on with it at all though and these were my genuine reactions on seeing it.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then Tailwind came on my radar. Tailwind is like Tachyons but seems to be to be substantially more friendly. Mostly its nicer because the class names aren\u2019t all abbreviated beyond readability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people in my industry are raving about it. And I\u2019ve not tried it yet. And one reason is that I\u2019m put off by the very first example in the docs:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"686\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-1024x686.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of TailWind docs showing complicated markup.\" class=\"wp-image-4497\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-1024x686.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-768x514.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-945x633.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-600x402.jpg 600w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender.jpg 1519w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I do NOT want my code to look like that. I don\u2019t mean with a picture of <a href=\"https:\/\/adamwathan.me\/\">Adam Wathan<\/a> above it, of course (He&#8217;s great and has made <a href=\"https:\/\/refactoringui.com\/book\">some<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/course.testdrivenlaravel.com\/\">awesome<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fullstackradio.com\/\">stuff<\/a>, by the way!). But this is the exact opposite end of the scale of all the things that were wrong with semantic classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With semantic classes I could see what all the things were, but not how they were styled. With both Tachyons and Tailwind I can see all the styles, but not what the things are!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the first example you find that collecting styles into components with helpful names is encouraged in Tailwind. And this seems like we\u2019re almost in my CSS heaven: I can write <code>&lt;a href=\"button-link\"&gt;<\/code> and have my semantic class or component that says what the thing is but then also easily tweak it for the context it\u2019s in. Yippee!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, so there\u2019s still some unhelpful abbreviation there, but it\u2019s not that bad once you\u2019ve been introduced to the basics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tailwind is \u201cutility first\u201d. You START by writing with just utilities and extract re-usable components where needed.  And in my head I get that creating things with it should be quick, but I\u2019ve seen videos of people working with it and it\u2019s often painful:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I want to increase this font size a little\n<\/li><li>So I\u2019ll inspect it in dev tools and tweak the size until it\u2019s what I want.\n<\/li><li>Then I take the size I want and look it up in my config file to find the class I need to make it that size\n<\/li><li>Then I\u2019ll add the class to my HTML\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t right! CSS and dev tools work beautifully together, and now we have a naming abstraction and a config layer and..ugh&#8230;it just seems like we\u2019ve made things harder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My other beef with Tailwind is tooling. It introduces PostCSS and JavaScript configuration and&#8230;well&#8230;I just don\u2019t want to have to get to grips with these things to write CSS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS with added awesome!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CSS itself has come a long way. We have variables baked in, and Flexbox in pretty much every browser I work with and Grid support growing quickly.  With a good naming convention you don&#8217;t need nesting so much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All we&#8217;re really lacking is includes. But arguably HTTP2 takes care of the problem of having lots of small regular CSS files, and caching and service workers probably help here too. There&#8217;s probably good arguments for lots of small CSS files loaded as and when you need them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think we will soon reach a point where the tooling isn\u2019t necessary. I see a day where I just write CSS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I still need to organise it on large projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS Heaven<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, in a discussion about exactly these things: CSS, Tailwind and BEM, my Twitter friend Ben posts this (and I note that the whole conversation was interesting and read-worthy):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That\u2019s it. I\u2019m calling it BEU &#8211; block, element, utility!<\/p>&mdash; Ben Furfie (@frontendben) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/frontendben\/status\/1085280423805100032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 15, 2019<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And my mind blows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one has explicitly defined it before, but this is it! This is what I want! Semantically-named, re-usable components with utility modifiers!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with modern day CSS variables we can probably do this, can\u2019t we? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Relatively flat CSS&#8230;\n<\/li><li>&#8230;with built in variables&#8230;\n<\/li><li>&#8230;that needs no toolchain to build.\n<\/li><li>We have re-usable components that let us state what our markup IS, not just what it looks like&#8230;\n<\/li><li>&#8230;but we have utility modifiers in the form of classes we can add sparingly to make adjustments to components to make them fit their context&#8230;\n<\/li><li>&#8230;but without cluttering up our markup with ALL the styles.\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben calls this \u201cBEU: Block, element, utility\u201d, which is nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I call it \u201cSUCSS: Sematics + Utility CSS\u201d, not to spite Ben. Just because it\u2019s funnier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said at the start, I&#8217;m no expert. So help me , CSS gurus. Please tell me why this is wrong. Which bit of component + utility + vanilla CSS is bad here? What wouldn&#8217;t work with this approach?<\/p>\n",

        "title": "My new CSS framework: SUCSS!",
        "content": "\n<p>Everyone is writing about CSS, and I work with CSS, so I guess I should write about CSS too. Please bear in mind I\u2019ve spent far less time thinking about this than others. But these are my thoughts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, I half-jokingly present you my new convention: SUCSS. But before I tell you what it\u2019s all about let&#8217;s get some context.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS and Me<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m relatively old friends with CSS. I guess I started working in web development for real in 2010. I remember the stupid IE6 margin bugs, and learning the box model. It was hard work, but it was all we had. And once you knew the quirks it was actually powerful to work with. And I&#8217;d argue that it has remained powerful and only gotten MORE powerful over the years. Regardless of where you put it and how you name things, CSS is THE underlying technology for all styling of HTML on the web. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Presentational vs Semantic Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in the day \u201csemantic classes\u201d were all the rage. This was What You Should Do. And the hard line on this appeared to be a push back against people wanting to make \u201cpresentational\u201d classes like \u201cbig-padding\u201d or \u201cfloat-left\u201d or \u201cblue-text\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This kind of stuff, they said, shouldn\u2019t clutter up your markup. The markup describes the structure of the document not its presentation!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Classes should be things like \u201cmain-header\u201d, \u201cwidget-area\u201d, \u201cfooter-credits\u201d. Names that describe what something is, not what it looks like. After all the sidebar could be on the left or the right or at the bottom. You shouldn\u2019t constrain your presentation by what you write in your markup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I always found writing CSS for semantic classes was a bind. Well, not so much writing it, but editing it. Especially other people\u2019s CSS. I remember spending time searching huge CSS files (and later entire directories of SASS files) to try and work out where a class was so that I could tweak the padding on it, only to realise then that this would affect ALL instances of this class and might have unintended knock-on effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wished that I had some kind of permission to add an inline style attribute, or a \u201cbig-padding-top\u201d class to safely tweak just that one instance of this thing in this one place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">BEM, OOCSS, SMACSS and so on<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Various conventions then emerged from some very clever people to try and name your classes and structure your CSS in better ways. These were great. They kept semantics, but allowed you to add contexts and modifiers, inherit properties between classes in an ordered way, and flatten the cascade toprevent styles bleeding from one place to another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clever stuff!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I liked this. But the problem was that anyone involved in the project had to be along for the ride. In an agency this is possible but I\u2019m a freelancer who sometimes works solo and sometimes with other freelancers or agencies, and so I never really fully adopted one of these techniques because each project was different. Yes, they informed the techniques and conventions I used but I found it hard to take them on 100%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Aside: Less and SASS and tooling.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s quickly touch on these. I\u2019m not an early adopter of new things. I\u2019m a cautious semi-early adopter. I picked SASS and was glad I did. I don\u2019t use it in a big way: variables, nesting (not needed so much if you\u2019re full-on BEM), and file includes to break things up all help though. I\u2019m pretty much SASS by default now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the tooling&#8230;THE TOOLING! Yes, it was good. But it came in many forms. And so many people had so many different setups. Again, if you work in one big team and do the same thing everywhere this isn\u2019t so bad. But working in multiple places and often inheriting projects from others made this hard work: what\u2019s the darned build command on THIS project then?!?!? The README.txt became king.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>npm, grunt, gulp, webpack, PostCSS, and so on have not helped in this regard. Yes, tool chains have got way more powerful than they were, but they are also way more complicated!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">And so we come full circle<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So it came to pass that one day I inherited a project that used \u201cTachyons\u201d. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I\u2019m looking at markup with things like <code>class=\"f4 mt3 bt bw1 b\u2014gray br2\"<\/code> and I\u2019m thinking: WHAT?!?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, it turns out, was my first exposure to \u201cfunctional\u201d or \u201c    utility\u201d CSS. This is basically writing styles in the markup, but disguised as CSS classes. Which is, you know, the thing everyone rallied hard against 6 or 7 years ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;whereas everyone can understand <code>style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1.25rem;\"<\/code> etc, Tachyons has its own language that only Tachyons people understand. All, presumably, in the name of saving bytes (a measure which, at this scale, is probably irrelevant).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also&#8230;reading and understanding markup with Tachyons classes in it is horrendous. Just what is this thing? Yes, it\u2019s a large, blue, margin-topped, bottom-bordered THING with white text. But, like, WHAT IS IT?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HTML5 elements can help identify things, of course, as can IDs or components, if that\u2019s your thing. But&#8230;just&#8230;.gah!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I get that you can define your colours and type scales and so on, but I, personally, didn&#8217;t like Tachyons (can you tell?) and it left me along with the project I inherited that used it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Aside: I&#8217;m being somewhat extreme for dramatic effect here. If you use Tachyons and love it then that&#8217;s awesome. If you made Tachyons &#8211; great job, thank you! I, personally didn&#8217;t get on with it at all though and these were my genuine reactions on seeing it.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then Tailwind came on my radar. Tailwind is like Tachyons but seems to be to be substantially more friendly. Mostly its nicer because the class names aren\u2019t all abbreviated beyond readability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people in my industry are raving about it. And I\u2019ve not tried it yet. And one reason is that I\u2019m put off by the very first example in the docs:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"686\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-1024x686.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of TailWind docs showing complicated markup.\" class=\"wp-image-4497\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-1024x686.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-768x514.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-945x633.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-600x402.jpg 600w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender.jpg 1519w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I do NOT want my code to look like that. I don\u2019t mean with a picture of <a href=\"https:\/\/adamwathan.me\/\">Adam Wathan<\/a> above it, of course (He&#8217;s great and has made <a href=\"https:\/\/refactoringui.com\/book\">some<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/course.testdrivenlaravel.com\/\">awesome<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fullstackradio.com\/\">stuff<\/a>, by the way!). But this is the exact opposite end of the scale of all the things that were wrong with semantic classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With semantic classes I could see what all the things were, but not how they were styled. With both Tachyons and Tailwind I can see all the styles, but not what the things are!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the first example you find that collecting styles into components with helpful names is encouraged in Tailwind. And this seems like we\u2019re almost in my CSS heaven: I can write <code>&lt;a href=\"button-link\"&gt;<\/code> and have my semantic class or component that says what the thing is but then also easily tweak it for the context it\u2019s in. Yippee!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, so there\u2019s still some unhelpful abbreviation there, but it\u2019s not that bad once you\u2019ve been introduced to the basics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tailwind is \u201cutility first\u201d. You START by writing with just utilities and extract re-usable components where needed.  And in my head I get that creating things with it should be quick, but I\u2019ve seen videos of people working with it and it\u2019s often painful:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I want to increase this font size a little\n<\/li><li>So I\u2019ll inspect it in dev tools and tweak the size until it\u2019s what I want.\n<\/li><li>Then I take the size I want and look it up in my config file to find the class I need to make it that size\n<\/li><li>Then I\u2019ll add the class to my HTML\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t right! CSS and dev tools work beautifully together, and now we have a naming abstraction and a config layer and..ugh&#8230;it just seems like we\u2019ve made things harder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My other beef with Tailwind is tooling. It introduces PostCSS and JavaScript configuration and&#8230;well&#8230;I just don\u2019t want to have to get to grips with these things to write CSS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS with added awesome!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CSS itself has come a long way. We have variables baked in, and Flexbox in pretty much every browser I work with and Grid support growing quickly.  With a good naming convention you don&#8217;t need nesting so much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All we&#8217;re really lacking is includes. But arguably HTTP2 takes care of the problem of having lots of small regular CSS files, and caching and service workers probably help here too. There&#8217;s probably good arguments for lots of small CSS files loaded as and when you need them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think we will soon reach a point where the tooling isn\u2019t necessary. I see a day where I just write CSS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I still need to organise it on large projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS Heaven<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, in a discussion about exactly these things: CSS, Tailwind and BEM, my Twitter friend Ben posts this (and I note that the whole conversation was interesting and read-worthy):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That\u2019s it.

This is what I want! Semantically-named, re-usable components with utility modifiers!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with modern day CSS variables we can probably do this, can\u2019t we? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Relatively flat CSS&#8230;\n<\/li><li>&#8230;with built in variables&#8230;\n<\/li><li>&#8230;that needs no toolchain to build.\n<\/li><li>We have re-usable components that let us state what our markup IS, not just what it looks like&#8230;\n<\/li><li>&#8230;but we have utility modifiers in the form of classes we can add sparingly to make adjustments to components to make them fit their context&#8230;\n<\/li><li>&#8230;but without cluttering up our markup with ALL the styles.\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben calls this \u201cBEU: Block, element, utility\u201d, which is nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I call it \u201cSUCSS: Sematics + Utility CSS\u201d, not to spite Ben. Just because it\u2019s funnier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said at the start, I&#8217;m no expert. So help me , CSS gurus. Please tell me why this is wrong. Which bit of component + utility + vanilla CSS is bad here? What wouldn&#8217;t work with this approach?<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m hesitant to publish because&#8230;well&#8230;how could little old me have a valid critique of such a software engineering giant? Yet I keep reading it and I&#8217;m really happy with what I&#8217;ve written and the light it brings to the topic. I&#8217;m finally clicking &#8220;Publish&#8221;. I hope you like it too!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I was shown\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.cleancoder.com\/uncle-bob\/2012\/04\/18\/After-The-Disaster.html\">Uncle Bob&#8217;s 2012 blog post &#8220;After the Disaster&#8221;<\/a>\u00a0a while back &#8211; an interesting piece from a very experienced software developer about how &#8220;If [people] find that [software developers]\u00a0are disciplined, and self regulating, then perhaps they\u2019ll leave us mostly alone. But if they find that we are undisciplined hacks then you know that they\u2019ll impose all manner of horrible regulation upon us.&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>He makes a really good point about how software is encroaching more and more into our daily lives, and that software development <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can be<\/span> undisciplined and therefore potentially dangerous. And he&#8217;s right. \u00a0&#8220;Coding&#8221; has become popular and very easy to learn. But software development &#8211; the broader craft of solving complex problems in maintainable, testable, well-structured, easily-understandable ways &#8211; is harder and needs more discipline than you get by just learning to code.<\/p>\n<p>Software development is a lot more than just coding. Just yesterday, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/Why-is-programming-so-easy#!n=18\">this Quora Q&amp;A thread<\/a> appeared in my inbox titled &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/Why-is-programming-so-easy#!n=18\">Why is programming so easy?<\/a>&#8220;. One of my favourite answers is &#8220;Coding is easy. In fact it is the easiest part of a programming job imo.&#8221; And in my opinion the world&#8217;s ratio of &#8220;software engineers&#8221; to &#8220;coders&#8221; is too low. This needs to change.<\/p>\n<p>So I get and agree with Uncle Bob&#8217;s point. But I feel I need to give some critique of his explanation of it, and the examples that he uses.<\/p>\n<h3>Not all software is equal<\/h3>\n<p>Bob says: &#8220;Is there software in your cell phone&#8230;your watch&#8230;the light switch on the wall&#8230;the light bulbs&#8230;the intercom&#8230;the doorbell&#8230;the thermostat&#8230;your furnace&#8230;your air conditioner&#8230;your refrigerator, dishwasher, washing-machine, drier?&#8221;. And yes, he&#8217;s right. Software is all around us.<\/p>\n<p>But he then seamlessly switches into this: &#8220;How about your car; and all the other cars on the road? How about the traffic signals? Did you ride an elevator today? Get in a plane or a train? How about an escalator? Do you have a pacemaker? An insulin pump?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s start by making it clear that not all software is equal. The first list of things is very different to the second list of things. The probability that something very bad will happen if software in the first list of things goes wrong is pretty low.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, you can concoct scenarios like &#8220;my fridge got too hot and I got food poisoning&#8221; but there are other mitigating factors that prevent that hazard (like the fridge getting too hot) turning into harm (food poisoning). \u00a0We&#8217;ll come back to this.<\/p>\n<p>The probability that something very bad will happen if software in the second list of things goes wrong is pretty high. \u00a0Most of those things move large, heavy chunks of metal around at great velocities, and are then subsequently responsible for stopping them moving too. The others are medical equipment that keeps people alive.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s be clear &#8211; these are different things. A lightbulb and an airplane have very different requirements for the integrity of their software.<\/p>\n<p>Not all software is equal.<\/p>\n<h3>Therefore, not all software processes are equal<\/h3>\n<p>Bob then says this: &#8220;How many times per day do you put your life in the hands of an \u2018if\u2019 statement written by some twenty-two year old at three in the morning, while strung out on vodka and redbull?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And the answer is probably pretty close to &#8220;zero&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I worked in safety critical software for 4 years. I was actually writing and testing safety-critical code when I was twenty-two. And I can tell you that it is definitely NOT the case that a young, junior software developer would be able to commit code to the stable codebase of software for a car, traffic signal, elevator, train, plane, escalator or piece of medical equipment at 2am on a whim.<\/p>\n<p>The software processes for these kind of things involve:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>rigid, formal software specifications<\/li>\n<li>coding using appropriate tools and languages that minimise coding errors and help test that code does what it should and meets the spec<\/li>\n<li>correct levels of testing<\/li>\n<li>code review by peers, senior engineers, and often external third parties<\/li>\n<li>compliance with relevant safety standards<\/li>\n<li>production of safety cases that analyse the potential hazards, risk probabilities, and levels of harm to minimise danger<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>AND&#8230;in addition to all that there will be hardware fail-safes and other physical mechanisms that prevent a problem with software becoming something harmful.<\/p>\n<p>In this context, I&#8217;ve worked on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>static analysis of compiled code at assembler level<\/li>\n<li>review of compiled assembler code against the high-level source code<\/li>\n<li>testing so thorough that I discovered a (already documented but unknown to my team) bug in a microprocessor &#8211; yes, our spec and testing were so good that when the test failed, we turned to the microprocessor manual to see what was up!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.cleancoder.com\/uncle-bob\/2014\/02\/21\/WhereIsTheForeman.html\">another, related post<\/a>, Bob writes: &#8220;Where&#8217;s the guy who makes sure all the errors are checked, and that references can&#8217;t be null, and that variables are thread-safe?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Actually, in these industries, languages with provable properties are used. You can eliminate null references and entire classes of basic coding errors and performance issues. And in the safety-critical world these tools are often mandated.<\/p>\n<p>These processes are expensive. They are used in this context because people&#8217;s lives are clearly at risk. \u00a0Rigid, complicated, expensive processes are not needed for all forms of software. The budget for these projects MUST pay for the appropriate level of engineering, testing and approval.<\/p>\n<p>I currently build websites. In most cases, if my code is wrong, an image is displayed in the wrong place on someone&#8217;s screen. \u00a0Linting, code review, static analysis are helpful. But they can be safely omitted if the budget is not large enough.<\/p>\n<p>Different software needs different software\u00a0processes.<\/p>\n<h3>The Disaster<\/h3>\n<p>Bob then says: &#8220;Some time in the not too distant future, there\u2019s going to be an event. Thousands of people will die. And it will be the fault of some errant piece of code written by some poor schmuck under hellish pressure facing impossible deadlines. Perhaps it will be an airline crash, or a cruise ship sinking. Perhaps it\u2019ll be an explosion at a factory, or a train accident involving toxins. Perhaps it\u2019ll be a simple clerical error at a medical research lab that causes a vial of smallpox or ebola to be improperly disposed of.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Basically, there may well be a disaster as a result of code. But please, an airline crash or a cruise ship sinking or a train accident will not be caused in this way.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Poor schmuck&#8217;s&#8221; are not employed to write code like this. &#8220;Hellish pressure&#8221; is not allowed in this context. &#8220;Impossible deadlines&#8221; exist, but there are protections&#8230; You can not&#8230;you are not allowed to&#8230;ship dangerous code in a safety-critical context like this.<\/p>\n<p>Even if bad software does get in, the number of things that would need to happen between a software failure on a train and spillage of toxins in transit is huge and the probability of each of them is very low. And there are non-digital things\u00a0&#8211; handling measures, hardware precautions, and so on &#8211; that try to prevent software hazards becoming physical harm.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Will they find that developers work at all hours of the day and night, are under hellish pressure and impossible deadlines? Will they find that there are no professional standard, practices, or disciplines. Will they discover that we are all really just a bunch of undisciplined hacks?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Well. Umm. No, Bob. In the industries that you keep suggesting will cause the disaster, you will not find these things.<\/p>\n<h3>We&#8217;re already After the Disaster<\/h3>\n<p>And Bob&#8217;s conclusion: &#8220;The population will scream for protection, and the lawmakers will respond with self-righteous indignation. In their toolkit they\u2019ll have regulations, restrictions, licensing requirements, and certification tests&#8230;if they find that we are undisciplined hacks then you know that they\u2019ll impose all manner of horrible regulation upon us&#8230;.They might tell us what languages to use. They might tell us what process to use&#8230;we\u2019ll work in a government regulated profession.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So, let me introduce you to the Civil Aviation Authority, the Office of Rail Regulation, the Federal Aviation Authority, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Office for Nuclear Regulation.<\/p>\n<p>Is it really thought that development of software in safety-critical applications has no government-backed processes and procedures, legal and regulatory frameworks, restrictions, certification tests?<\/p>\n<p>Is it really thought that these things don&#8217;t exist? And even if they don&#8217;t, wouldn&#8217;t it be a good thing if a regulatory body told us to use a language that could be statically analysed to prove that it had no out-of-array-bounds accesses, undeclared variable uses, type errors, etc, etc. Would this not be a good thing?<\/p>\n<p>These industries are already regulated. And rightly so. \u00a0You can&#8217;t be a lazy indisciplined coder in these places. It&#8217;s not allowed. The &#8220;disaster&#8221; won&#8217;t lead to regulation because the regulation already exists.<\/p>\n<p>So what IS Bob advocating?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If they find that we are disciplined, and self regulating, then perhaps they\u2019ll leave us mostly alone.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a call to arms. We need to self-impose discipline and regulation on ourselves, &#8220;Otherwise we\u2019ll work in a government regulated profession. And then life will be hell.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In contrast to what, I wonder? To working drunk at 2am on code for a lightbulb? \u00a0Well, on one thing we agree! Both ends of this spectrum are bad. We need something in the middle.<\/p>\n<p>We need to stop working when tired, drunk and powered by energy drinks. We need to do testing and code review. We need to use the tools, languages, and processes that make our software better. All of this we should do.<\/p>\n<p>But we should also be pragmatic. Not every application is a fly-by-wire aircraft control system. \u00a0And a good engineer is pragmatic, making trade-offs, assessing risks, defining requirements, building and testing code responsibly.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of applications aren&#8217;t going to cause &#8220;the disaster&#8221;, and not all code needs to be built to prevent it.<\/p>\n<p>So while I strongly disagree with Bob&#8217;s examples and his explanation of and implications of some hypothetical\u00a0disaster, he is right. Our industry is a mess. We need to take ourselves more seriously.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t just ship it, coders. Learn your craft well. Work responsibly. \u00a0Charge properly. Say &#8220;no&#8221;. Ask difficult questions. Don&#8217;t make assumptions.<\/p>\n<p>People might not be dying at the hands of your if statements, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t care.<\/p>\n",

Yet I keep reading it and I&#8217;m really happy with what I&#8217;ve written and the light it brings to the topic. I&#8217;m finally clicking &#8220;Publish&#8221;. I hope you like it too!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I was shown\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.cleancoder.com\/uncle-bob\/2012\/04\/18\/After-The-Disaster.html\">Uncle Bob&#8217;s 2012 blog post &#8220;After the Disaster&#8221;<\/a>\u00a0a while back &#8211; an interesting piece from a very experienced software developer about how &#8220;If [people] find that [software developers]\u00a0are disciplined, and self regulating, then perhaps they\u2019ll leave us mostly alone. But if they find that we are undisciplined hacks then you know that they\u2019ll impose all manner of horrible regulation upon us.&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>He makes a really good point about how software is encroaching more and more into our daily lives, and that software development <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can be<\/span> undisciplined and therefore potentially dangerous. And he&#8217;s right. \u00a0&#8220;Coding&#8221; has become popular and very easy to learn. But software development &#8211; the broader craft of solving complex problems in maintainable, testable, well-structured, easily-understandable ways &#8211; is harder and needs more discipline than you get by just learning to code.<\/p>\n<p>Software development is a lot more than just coding. Just yesterday, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/Why-is-programming-so-easy#!n=18\">this Quora Q&amp;A thread<\/a> appeared in my inbox titled &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/Why-is-programming-so-easy#!n=18\">Why is programming so easy?<\/a>&#8220;. One of my favourite answers is &#8220;Coding is easy. In fact it is the easiest part of a programming job imo.&#8221; And in my opinion the world&#8217;s ratio of &#8220;software engineers&#8221; to &#8220;coders&#8221; is too low. This needs to change.<\/p>\n<p>So I get and agree with Uncle Bob&#8217;s point. But I feel I need to give some critique of his explanation of it, and the examples that he uses.<\/p>\n<h3>Not all software is equal<\/h3>\n<p>Bob says: &#8220;Is there software in your cell phone&#8230;your watch&#8230;the light switch on the wall&#8230;the light bulbs&#8230;the intercom&#8230;the doorbell&#8230;the thermostat&#8230;your furnace&#8230;your air conditioner&#8230;your refrigerator, dishwasher, washing-machine, drier?&#8221;. And yes, he&#8217;s right. Software is all around us.<\/p>\n<p>But he then seamlessly switches into this: &#8220;How about your car; and all the other cars on the road? How about the traffic signals? Did you ride an elevator today? Get in a plane or a train? How about an escalator? Do you have a pacemaker? An insulin pump?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s start by making it clear that not all software is equal. The first list of things is very different to the second list of things. The probability that something very bad will happen if software in the first list of things goes wrong is pretty low.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, you can concoct scenarios like &#8220;my fridge got too hot and I got food poisoning&#8221; but there are other mitigating factors that prevent that hazard (like the fridge getting too hot) turning into harm (food poisoning). \u00a0We&#8217;ll come back to this.<\/p>\n<p>The probability that something very bad will happen if software in the second list of things goes wrong is pretty high. \u00a0Most of those things move large, heavy chunks of metal around at great velocities, and are then subsequently responsible for stopping them moving too. The others are medical equipment that keeps people alive.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s be clear &#8211; these are different things. A lightbulb and an airplane have very different requirements for the integrity of their software.<\/p>\n<p>Not all software is equal.<\/p>\n<h3>Therefore, not all software processes are equal<\/h3>\n<p>Bob then says this: &#8220;How many times per day do you put your life in the hands of an \u2018if\u2019 statement written by some twenty-two year old at three in the morning, while strung out on vodka and redbull?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And the answer is probably pretty close to &#8220;zero&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I worked in safety critical software for 4 years. I was actually writing and testing safety-critical code when I was twenty-two. And I can tell you that it is definitely NOT the case that a young, junior software developer would be able to commit code to the stable codebase of software for a car, traffic signal, elevator, train, plane, escalator or piece of medical equipment at 2am on a whim.<\/p>\n<p>The software processes for these kind of things involve:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>rigid, formal software specifications<\/li>\n<li>coding using appropriate tools and languages that minimise coding errors and help test that code does what it should and meets the spec<\/li>\n<li>correct levels of testing<\/li>\n<li>code review by peers, senior engineers, and often external third parties<\/li>\n<li>compliance with relevant safety standards<\/li>\n<li>production of safety cases that analyse the potential hazards, risk probabilities, and levels of harm to minimise danger<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>AND&#8230;in addition to all that there will be hardware fail-safes and other physical mechanisms that prevent a problem with software becoming something harmful.<\/p>\n<p>In this context, I&#8217;ve worked on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>static analysis of compiled code at assembler level<\/li>\n<li>review of compiled assembler code against the high-level source code<\/li>\n<li>testing so thorough that I discovered a (already documented but unknown to my team) bug in a microprocessor &#8211; yes, our spec and testing were so good that when the test failed, we turned to the microprocessor manual to see what was up!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.cleancoder.com\/uncle-bob\/2014\/02\/21\/WhereIsTheForeman.html\">another, related post<\/a>, Bob writes: &#8220;Where&#8217;s the guy who makes sure all the errors are checked, and that references can&#8217;t be null, and that variables are thread-safe?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Actually, in these industries, languages with provable properties are used. You can eliminate null references and entire classes of basic coding errors and performance issues. And in the safety-critical world these tools are often mandated.<\/p>\n<p>These processes are expensive. They are used in this context because people&#8217;s lives are clearly at risk. \u00a0Rigid, complicated, expensive processes are not needed for all forms of software. The budget for these projects MUST pay for the appropriate level of engineering, testing and approval.<\/p>\n<p>I currently build websites. In most cases, if my code is wrong, an image is displayed in the wrong place on someone&#8217;s screen. \u00a0Linting, code review, static analysis are helpful. But they can be safely omitted if the budget is not large enough.<\/p>\n<p>Different software needs different software\u00a0processes.<\/p>\n<h3>The Disaster<\/h3>\n<p>Bob then says: &#8220;Some time in the not too distant future, there\u2019s going to be an event. Thousands of people will die. And it will be the fault of some errant piece of code written by some poor schmuck under hellish pressure facing impossible deadlines. Perhaps it will be an airline crash, or a cruise ship sinking. Perhaps it\u2019ll be an explosion at a factory, or a train accident involving toxins. Perhaps it\u2019ll be a simple clerical error at a medical research lab that causes a vial of smallpox or ebola to be improperly disposed of.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Basically, there may well be a disaster as a result of code. But please, an airline crash or a cruise ship sinking or a train accident will not be caused in this way.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Poor schmuck&#8217;s&#8221; are not employed to write code like this. &#8220;Hellish pressure&#8221; is not allowed in this context. &#8220;Impossible deadlines&#8221; exist, but there are protections&#8230; You can not&#8230;you are not allowed to&#8230;ship dangerous code in a safety-critical context like this.<\/p>\n<p>Even if bad software does get in, the number of things that would need to happen between a software failure on a train and spillage of toxins in transit is huge and the probability of each of them is very low. And there are non-digital things\u00a0&#8211; handling measures, hardware precautions, and so on &#8211; that try to prevent software hazards becoming physical harm.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Will they find that developers work at all hours of the day and night, are under hellish pressure and impossible deadlines? Will they find that there are no professional standard, practices, or disciplines. Will they discover that we are all really just a bunch of undisciplined hacks?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Well. Umm. No, Bob. In the industries that you keep suggesting will cause the disaster, you will not find these things.<\/p>\n<h3>We&#8217;re already After the Disaster<\/h3>\n<p>And Bob&#8217;s conclusion: &#8220;The population will scream for protection, and the lawmakers will respond with self-righteous indignation. In their toolkit they\u2019ll have regulations, restrictions, licensing requirements, and certification tests&#8230;if they find that we are undisciplined hacks then you know that they\u2019ll impose all manner of horrible regulation upon us&#8230;.They might tell us what languages to use. They might tell us what process to use&#8230;we\u2019ll work in a government regulated profession.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So, let me introduce you to the Civil Aviation Authority, the Office of Rail Regulation, the Federal Aviation Authority, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Office for Nuclear Regulation.<\/p>\n<p>Is it really thought that development of software in safety-critical applications has no government-backed processes and procedures, legal and regulatory frameworks, restrictions, certification tests?<\/p>\n<p>Is it really thought that these things don&#8217;t exist? And even if they don&#8217;t, wouldn&#8217;t it be a good thing if a regulatory body told us to use a language that could be statically analysed to prove that it had no out-of-array-bounds accesses, undeclared variable uses, type errors, etc, etc. Would this not be a good thing?<\/p>\n<p>These industries are already regulated. And rightly so. \u00a0You can&#8217;t be a lazy indisciplined coder in these places. It&#8217;s not allowed. The &#8220;disaster&#8221; won&#8217;t lead to regulation because the regulation already exists.<\/p>\n<p>So what IS Bob advocating?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If they find that we are disciplined, and self regulating, then perhaps they\u2019ll leave us mostly alone.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a call to arms. We need to self-impose discipline and regulation on ourselves, &#8220;Otherwise we\u2019ll work in a government regulated profession. And then life will be hell.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In contrast to what, I wonder? To working drunk at 2am on code for a lightbulb? \u00a0Well, on one thing we agree! Both ends of this spectrum are bad. We need something in the middle.<\/p>\n<p>We need to stop working when tired, drunk and powered by energy drinks. We need to do testing and code review. We need to use the tools, languages, and processes that make our software better. All of this we should do.<\/p>\n<p>But we should also be pragmatic. Not every application is a fly-by-wire aircraft control system. \u00a0And a good engineer is pragmatic, making trade-offs, assessing risks, defining requirements, building and testing code responsibly.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of applications aren&#8217;t going to cause &#8220;the disaster&#8221;, and not all code needs to be built to prevent it.<\/p>\n<p>So while I strongly disagree with Bob&#8217;s examples and his explanation of and implications of some hypothetical\u00a0disaster, he is right. Our industry is a mess. We need to take ourselves more seriously.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t just ship it, coders. Learn your craft well. Work responsibly. \u00a0Charge properly. Say &#8220;no&#8221;. Ask difficult questions. Don&#8217;t make assumptions.<\/p>\n<p>People might not be dying at the hands of your if statements, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t care.<\/p>\n",

If I wanted to sell myself I&#8217;d write a post extolling my virtues rather than questioning them. But I can&#8217;t write about finding my place without describing the things that will help determine my place. If it&#8217;s self-indulgent, I&#8217;m sorry. On with the show&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really wanted to some hopes and goals for 2019 down in the form of a pre-emptive\/prophetic retrospective on the year.

I&#8217;m clearly a far more experienced software developer than many. But I&#8217;m also clearly a far less experienced developer than many. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a CS degree and a strong background in software engineering and high-end hosting operations. I can mentor other people on coding in various languages; I&#8217;m highly proficient at using code to solve problems; and I&#8217;m pretty advanced at dealing with databases and hosting too. But I also look at other people who have a really deep knowledge of a particular language or framework or something who know far more than I do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m between proficiency levels. And confused about how much I should be an educator helping people up the ladder, and how much I need to humbly accept that I&#8217;ve got a lot to learn and get on with expanding my own knowledge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Between primary areas of technical expertise<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And if there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;m highly proficient in, it&#8217;s WordPress. To continue being highly proficient with WordPress I need to learn to develop with the new block editor, which means more JavaScript and probably React.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, WordPress is between things: I feel like the new editor switches its direction from being a multi-purpose CMS to being a tool that is primarily for publishing and simple site building. Editing and site construction is now front and centre. Post types and fields have taken a back seat. Evolving the database to cater for things like post relationships seems like it&#8217;ll never happen. Gutenberg is an advanced HTML editing tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so as well as being on the Laravel train (which I very much am) I&#8217;m also feeling like I need new CMS options, of which there are so many now it&#8217;s very confusing to know where to start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I also face a more general choice between dragging myself kicking and screaming into more JavaScript and React, and knuckling down into PHP and Laravel and deeper back-end wrangling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Between soft and hard skills<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as being a good software developer, I like to think that I have a good set of soft skills that I enjoy making use of:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Understanding business\/organisational problems<\/li><li>Writing<\/li><li>Bidding and pitching for work<\/li><li>Project management<\/li><li>Speaking and Educating<\/li><li>Administration and running a business<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This also spreads me thin. Should I focus more on just doing the technology? Or do these skills give me a (uncommon?) ability to bridge the gap between less-technical people and technology. Should I be maximising on being that bridge in my projects at the expense of technical focus?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Between project sizes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who has historically wanted to connect smaller organisations with technology that can help them, I&#8217;ve often had multiple small projects on the go, as well as larger, longer term projects for bigger clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is actually quite exhausting and stressful. Smaller projects sometimes need as much communication and project management as larger ones as less tech-savvy clients need more hand-holding through the process. Keeping it all in my head and juggling deadlines and expectations as well as getting the technical work done is quite difficult. And yes, I confess, at times I&#8217;ve not been very good at it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I feel, right now, like I want to ditch all the smaller stuff and find a smaller number of larger projects to work on this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don&#8217;t know how to sell myself on those bigger projects or where that work will come from. Plus, my business focus has always been on the smaller orgs and there&#8217;s something about being in that space that I love. I <em>want<\/em> to help those people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Argh!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Mentor, or be mentored?<\/li><li>Focus on back-end tech, or embrace the move to JavaScript and front-end?<\/li><li>Dig into modern WordPress development, or spread my wings elsewhere?<\/li><li>Double-down on my tech skills, or continue to work with my soft skills in a big way too?<\/li><li>See if I can find some bigger, longer term (and better paid?) projects to ease the mental (and financial?) strain? Or carry on my mission of being a bridge enabling smaller organisations to embrace modern website technology, bearing the load as I go?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where I&#8217;m at. Lots of questions, and potentially lots of risks and opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The difficult beauty of being multi-skilled<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be easy if I was just a back-end or reasonably full-stack dev, coding to a provided spec without considering the consequences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be easy if I was an hip young web dev coding React front ends all over the place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be easy if I was a WordPress implementor churning out small sites to a fixed process with a bit of design skill or possibly working with a designer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m an in-betweeny: I have <em>lots<\/em> of skills and interests; I have a keen desire to do good and right things and care about my craft; I&#8217;m a coder and an educator; I&#8217;m a businessman and a geek; I&#8217;m an open-minded developer who wants to get to grips with new technologie, and also a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.brucelawson.co.uk\/2018\/the-practical-value-of-semantic-html\/\">Dull Old Web Fart<\/a>&#8221; who&#8217;s set in his ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And\u2026I must remind myself, I MUST!\u2026what an amazing thing to be!! What a unique, eclectic, diverse range of skills and experiences! How can I not be happy that I&#8217;m capable of being these bridges, building cool things on the web, helping people use technology to solve problems. What a privilege!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Marketing me<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The difficulty is partly marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People don&#8217;t Google for &#8220;multi-disciplinary geeks&#8221; to help them solve problems. They Google &#8220;web designers in Swindon&#8221; or &#8220;Charity website builders&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People don&#8217;t want a landing page to say &#8220;I&#8217;ll use cool technology to help you solve your business problems&#8221; because it doesn&#8217;t really mean anything. They want to see &#8220;We make fast, beautiful WordPress websites&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I want to embrace &#8220;me&#8221;, how do I communicate that to others &#8211; to non-technical people that want to understand what I do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2019 then?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What does it hold? I really don&#8217;t know. Perhaps you can help me write the prophetic 2019 review this week. Have I missed something obvious? Am I running scared? Do I just need to make some decisions and stick them out for a while?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be my coach: what would you do?!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>Preamble: This will, at times, sound like I&#8217;m trying to sell myself. I&#8217;m not. If I wanted to sell myself I&#8217;d write a post extolling my virtues rather than questioning them. But I can&#8217;t write about finding my place without describing the things that will help determine my place. If it&#8217;s self-indulgent, I&#8217;m sorry. On with the show&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really wanted to some hopes and goals for 2019 down in the form of a pre-emptive\/prophetic retrospective on the year. I.e. what do I want my 2019 review to look like in 12 months time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the truth is, I&#8217;m a bit stuck with some major parts of it. And this post will, I hope, help me collect my thoughts on it and maybe inspire some feedback.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big question really, is: where do I fit in the world of web development?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Between proficiency levels<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that ALL software developers could write this next sentence: I feel pretty stuck in the middle. I&#8217;m clearly a far more experienced software developer than many. But I&#8217;m also clearly a far less experienced developer than many. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a CS degree and a strong background in software engineering and high-end hosting operations. I can mentor other people on coding in various languages; I&#8217;m highly proficient at using code to solve problems; and I&#8217;m pretty advanced at dealing with databases and hosting too. But I also look at other people who have a really deep knowledge of a particular language or framework or something who know far more than I do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m between proficiency levels. And confused about how much I should be an educator helping people up the ladder, and how much I need to humbly accept that I&#8217;ve got a lot to learn and get on with expanding my own knowledge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Between primary areas of technical expertise<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And if there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;m highly proficient in, it&#8217;s WordPress. To continue being highly proficient with WordPress I need to learn to develop with the new block editor, which means more JavaScript and probably React.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, WordPress is between things: I feel like the new editor switches its direction from being a multi-purpose CMS to being a tool that is primarily for publishing and simple site building. Editing and site construction is now front and centre. Post types and fields have taken a back seat. Evolving the database to cater for things like post relationships seems like it&#8217;ll never happen. Gutenberg is an advanced HTML editing tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so as well as being on the Laravel train (which I very much am) I&#8217;m also feeling like I need new CMS options, of which there are so many now it&#8217;s very confusing to know where to start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I also face a more general choice between dragging myself kicking and screaming into more JavaScript and React, and knuckling down into PHP and Laravel and deeper back-end wrangling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Between soft and hard skills<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as being a good software developer, I like to think that I have a good set of soft skills that I enjoy making use of:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Understanding business\/organisational problems<\/li><li>Writing<\/li><li>Bidding and pitching for work<\/li><li>Project management<\/li><li>Speaking and Educating<\/li><li>Administration and running a business<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This also spreads me thin. Should I focus more on just doing the technology? Or do these skills give me a (uncommon?) ability to bridge the gap between less-technical people and technology. Should I be maximising on being that bridge in my projects at the expense of technical focus?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Between project sizes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who has historically wanted to connect smaller organisations with technology that can help them, I&#8217;ve often had multiple small projects on the go, as well as larger, longer term projects for bigger clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is actually quite exhausting and stressful. Smaller projects sometimes need as much communication and project management as larger ones as less tech-savvy clients need more hand-holding through the process. Keeping it all in my head and juggling deadlines and expectations as well as getting the technical work done is quite difficult. And yes, I confess, at times I&#8217;ve not been very good at it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I feel, right now, like I want to ditch all the smaller stuff and find a smaller number of larger projects to work on this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don&#8217;t know how to sell myself on those bigger projects or where that work will come from. Plus, my business focus has always been on the smaller orgs and there&#8217;s something about being in that space that I love. I <em>want<\/em> to help those people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Argh!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Mentor, or be mentored?<\/li><li>Focus on back-end tech, or embrace the move to JavaScript and front-end?<\/li><li>Dig into modern WordPress development, or spread my wings elsewhere?<\/li><li>Double-down on my tech skills, or continue to work with my soft skills in a big way too?<\/li><li>See if I can find some bigger, longer term (and better paid?) projects to ease the mental (and financial?) strain? Or carry on my mission of being a bridge enabling smaller organisations to embrace modern website technology, bearing the load as I go?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where I&#8217;m at. Lots of questions, and potentially lots of risks and opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The difficult beauty of being multi-skilled<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be easy if I was just a back-end or reasonably full-stack dev, coding to a provided spec without considering the consequences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be easy if I was an hip young web dev coding React front ends all over the place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be easy if I was a WordPress implementor churning out small sites to a fixed process with a bit of design skill or possibly working with a designer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m an in-betweeny: I have <em>lots<\/em> of skills and interests; I have a keen desire to do good and right things and care about my craft; I&#8217;m a coder and an educator; I&#8217;m a businessman and a geek; I&#8217;m an open-minded developer who wants to get to grips with new technologie, and also a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.brucelawson.co.uk\/2018\/the-practical-value-of-semantic-html\/\">Dull Old Web Fart<\/a>&#8221; who&#8217;s set in his ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And\u2026I must remind myself, I MUST!\u2026what an amazing thing to be!! What a unique, eclectic, diverse range of skills and experiences! How can I not be happy that I&#8217;m capable of being these bridges, building cool things on the web, helping people use technology to solve problems. What a privilege!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Marketing me<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The difficulty is partly marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People don&#8217;t Google for &#8220;multi-disciplinary geeks&#8221; to help them solve problems. They Google &#8220;web designers in Swindon&#8221; or &#8220;Charity website builders&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People don&#8217;t want a landing page to say &#8220;I&#8217;ll use cool technology to help you solve your business problems&#8221; because it doesn&#8217;t really mean anything. They want to see &#8220;We make fast, beautiful WordPress websites&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I want to embrace &#8220;me&#8221;, how do I communicate that to others &#8211; to non-technical people that want to understand what I do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2019 then?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What does it hold? I really don&#8217;t know. Perhaps you can help me write the prophetic 2019 review this week. Have I missed something obvious? Am I running scared? Do I just need to make some decisions and stick them out for a while?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be my coach: what would you do?!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>The physical <a href=\"https:\/\/beatthestreet.me\/\">Beat the Street<\/a> game had loads of funny sound effects when you tapped a box. So I wanted my virtual clone of it &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/zapthemap.com\/\">Zap the Map<\/a> &#8211; to have them too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article explains a difficulty I had with this because of the Safari browser&#8217;s auto-play policies and a workaround, whilst also detailing a slight mystery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Playing sound in a browser<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theoretically playing a sound in a browser is pretty simple. You create an <code>audio<\/code> element with the <code>src<\/code> attribute set to the URL of your sound, and then when you want to play it, you get the element in your JavaScript and you call the <code>play()<\/code> method:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;audio src=&quot;https:\/\/example.com\/assets\/sounds\/bang.mp3&quot;&gt;&lt;\/audio&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n  const sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n  sound.play();\n&lt;\/script&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Note that audio elements are not displayed by default so the <code>&lt;audio><\/code> is hidden from view.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with playing a sound using JavaScript is that browsers have auto-play policies that demand that a user interaction happen before you can play the sound. So a button click should work fine:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;audio src=&quot;https:\/\/example.com\/assets\/sounds\/bang.mp3&quot;&gt;&lt;\/audio&gt; \n\n&lt;button&gt;Play Sound&lt;\/button&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n  const sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n  const button = document.querySelector('button');\n  button.addEventListener('click', e =&gt; sound.play());\n&lt;\/script&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Note here that <code>sound.play()<\/code> actually returns a <code>Promise<\/code> which is resolved when playback starts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Playing sounds in Vue.js instance methods<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My example that I had problems with was a bit more complex than this. I&#8217;m running inside a Vue.js for a start and the click handler was a method on the application instance:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;button @click=&quot;tap&quot;&gt;Zap!&lt;\/button&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n  var app = new Vue({\n    el: '#app',\n    methods: {\n      tap: function () {\n        response = axios.post('\/api\/v1\/tap', {\n          \/\/ Some data,\n        }).then( e =&gt; {  \n          \/\/ Use arrow function to avoid binding this\n          if (response.data.points &gt; 0) {\n            this.playSound();\n          }\n        });\n      },\n      playSound: function() {\n        let sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n        sound.play();\n      }\n    }\n  });\n&lt;\/script&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Now, this worked fine in Chrome on my desktop, and in Firefox too. And after later testing it seemed to work fine on Chrome in Android as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in Safari, this sound was not playing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve produced a fairly minimal test case that reproduces this here: <a href=\"https:\/\/acoustic-snow.glitch.me\/\">https:\/\/acoustic-snow.glitch.me\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In constructing this case I found that if Vue.js wasn&#8217;t involved everything worked fine everywhere. So there&#8217;s something in Vue that causes some kind of interruption to the call stack when you execute the promise that Safari doesn&#8217;t understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Fix!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that I have a hacky fix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I explored the developer docs and StackOverflow trying to resolve this issue, I read somewhere, in passing, that once you&#8217;ve played the sound once on a user interaction, you can then play it again without further interaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I came up with the idea of setting the volume to zero and playing the sound in the click handler <em>before<\/em> the async operation, to &#8220;initialise&#8221; it, and then, once my async operation is complete, put the volume back up to 1 and play it again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This worked! Hooray!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;button @click=&quot;tap&quot;&gt;Zap!&lt;\/button&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n  var app = new Vue({\n    el: '#app',\n    methods: {\n      tap: function () {\n        this.loadSound();\n        response = axios.post('\/api\/v1\/tap', {\n          \/\/ Some data,\n        }).then( response =&gt; {\n          \/\/ Use arrow function to avoid binding this\n          if (response.data.points &gt; 0) {\n            this.playSound();\n          }\n        });\n      },\n      loadSound: function() {\n        let sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n        sound.volume = 0;\n        sound.play();\n      },\n      playSound: function() {\n        let sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n        sound.volume = 1;\n        sound.play();\n      }\n    }\n  });\n&lt;\/script&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A &#8220;fun&#8221; little mobile Safari bug?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To add to my fun, this application is a walking-around game. So I took it out testing it on my iPhone, and when I did I found that the sound played when it shouldn&#8217;t have!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a bit more digging I found what I can only assume is a proper Mobile Safari bug!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Aside: did you know if you have an iPhone and a Mac you can plug one into the other and use the developer tools in the desktop browser to inspect what is going on on the mobile device? Well if you didn&#8217;t, <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/AppleApplications\/Conceptual\/Safari_Developer_Guide\/GettingStarted\/GettingStarted.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40007874-CH2-SW8\"><em>you do now<\/em><\/a><em>!)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this whole <code>sound.volume = 0<\/code> thing &#8211; this didn&#8217;t work in my test case scenario with Vue.js involved. It seemed that <code>sound.volume<\/code> was read-only. And you can see this in the <a href=\"https:\/\/acoustic-snow.glitch.me\/\">sample test case<\/a> when you click the bottom button on mobile Safari.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.36.32.png\" alt=\"Console screengrab showing sound.volume assignment not working\" class=\"wp-image-4480\" width=\"252\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.36.32.png 410w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.36.32-300x187.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px\" \/><figcaption>Setting sound.volume has no effect on mobile Safari<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of my test case, and in desktop Safari, it&#8217;s fine, of course!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.40.16.png\" alt=\"Console screengrab showing sound.volume assignment working\" class=\"wp-image-4481\" width=\"368\" height=\"207\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.40.16.png 594w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.40.16-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" \/><figcaption>But it&#8217;s fine on desktop Safari!<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, once I&#8217;d tracked this down, I discovered that <code>sound.muted<\/code> worked fine. So now, I just set both.

        "content": "\n<p>The physical <a href=\"https:\/\/beatthestreet.me\/\">Beat the Street<\/a> game had loads of funny sound effects when you tapped a box. So I wanted my virtual clone of it &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/zapthemap.com\/\">Zap the Map<\/a> &#8211; to have them too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article explains a difficulty I had with this because of the Safari browser&#8217;s auto-play policies and a workaround, whilst also detailing a slight mystery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Playing sound in a browser<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theoretically playing a sound in a browser is pretty simple. You create an <code>audio<\/code> element with the <code>src<\/code> attribute set to the URL of your sound, and then when you want to play it, you get the element in your JavaScript and you call the <code>play()<\/code> method:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;audio src=&quot;https:\/\/example.com\/assets\/sounds\/bang.mp3&quot;&gt;&lt;\/audio&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n  const sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n  sound.play();\n&lt;\/script&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Note that audio elements are not displayed by default so the <code>&lt;audio><\/code> is hidden from view.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with playing a sound using JavaScript is that browsers have auto-play policies that demand that a user interaction happen before you can play the sound. So a button click should work fine:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;audio src=&quot;https:\/\/example.com\/assets\/sounds\/bang.mp3&quot;&gt;&lt;\/audio&gt; \n\n&lt;button&gt;Play Sound&lt;\/button&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n  const sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n  const button = document.querySelector('button');\n  button.addEventListener('click', e =&gt; sound.play());\n&lt;\/script&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Note here that <code>sound.play()<\/code> actually returns a <code>Promise<\/code> which is resolved when playback starts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Playing sounds in Vue.js instance methods<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My example that I had problems with was a bit more complex than this. I&#8217;m running inside a Vue.js for a start and the click handler was a method on the application instance:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;button @click=&quot;tap&quot;&gt;Zap!&lt;\/button&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n  var app = new Vue({\n    el: '#app',\n    methods: {\n      tap: function () {\n        response = axios.post('\/api\/v1\/tap', {\n          \/\/ Some data,\n        }).then( e =&gt; {  \n          \/\/ Use arrow function to avoid binding this\n          if (response.data.points &gt; 0) {\n            this.playSound();\n          }\n        });\n      },\n      playSound: function() {\n        let sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n        sound.play();\n      }\n    }\n  });\n&lt;\/script&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Now, this worked fine in Chrome on my desktop, and in Firefox too. And after later testing it seemed to work fine on Chrome in Android as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in Safari, this sound was not playing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve produced a fairly minimal test case that reproduces this here: <a href=\"https:\/\/acoustic-snow.glitch.me\/\">https:\/\/acoustic-snow.glitch.me\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In constructing this case I found that if Vue.js wasn&#8217;t involved everything worked fine everywhere. So there&#8217;s something in Vue that causes some kind of interruption to the call stack when you execute the promise that Safari doesn&#8217;t understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Fix!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that I have a hacky fix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I explored the developer docs and StackOverflow trying to resolve this issue, I read somewhere, in passing, that once you&#8217;ve played the sound once on a user interaction, you can then play it again without further interaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I came up with the idea of setting the volume to zero and playing the sound in the click handler <em>before<\/em> the async operation, to &#8220;initialise&#8221; it, and then, once my async operation is complete, put the volume back up to 1 and play it again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This worked! Hooray!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;button @click=&quot;tap&quot;&gt;Zap!&lt;\/button&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n  var app = new Vue({\n    el: '#app',\n    methods: {\n      tap: function () {\n        this.loadSound();\n        response = axios.post('\/api\/v1\/tap', {\n          \/\/ Some data,\n        }).then( response =&gt; {\n          \/\/ Use arrow function to avoid binding this\n          if (response.data.points &gt; 0) {\n            this.playSound();\n          }\n        });\n      },\n      loadSound: function() {\n        let sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n        sound.volume = 0;\n        sound.play();\n      },\n      playSound: function() {\n        let sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n        sound.volume = 1;\n        sound.play();\n      }\n    }\n  });\n&lt;\/script&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A &#8220;fun&#8221; little mobile Safari bug?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To add to my fun, this application is a walking-around game. So I took it out testing it on my iPhone, and when I did I found that the sound played when it shouldn&#8217;t have!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a bit more digging I found what I can only assume is a proper Mobile Safari bug!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Aside: did you know if you have an iPhone and a Mac you can plug one into the other and use the developer tools in the desktop browser to inspect what is going on on the mobile device? Well if you didn&#8217;t, <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/AppleApplications\/Conceptual\/Safari_Developer_Guide\/GettingStarted\/GettingStarted.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40007874-CH2-SW8\"><em>you do now<\/em><\/a><em>!)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this whole <code>sound.volume = 0<\/code> thing &#8211; this didn&#8217;t work in my test case scenario with Vue.js involved. It seemed that <code>sound.volume<\/code> was read-only. And you can see this in the <a href=\"https:\/\/acoustic-snow.glitch.me\/\">sample test case<\/a> when you click the bottom button on mobile Safari.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.36.32.png\" alt=\"Console screengrab showing sound.volume assignment not working\" class=\"wp-image-4480\" width=\"252\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.36.32.png 410w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.36.32-300x187.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px\" \/><figcaption>Setting sound.volume has no effect on mobile Safari<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of my test case, and in desktop Safari, it&#8217;s fine, of course!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.40.16.png\" alt=\"Console screengrab showing sound.volume assignment working\" class=\"wp-image-4481\" width=\"368\" height=\"207\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.40.16.png 594w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.40.16-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" \/><figcaption>But it&#8217;s fine on desktop Safari!<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, once I&#8217;d tracked this down, I discovered that <code>sound.muted<\/code> worked fine. So now, I just set both. I won&#8217;t post code for that but you can see it in the <a href=\"https:\/\/acoustic-snow.glitch.me\/\">sample test case<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summing up!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>In some odd cases that seem to involve Vue.js (in my case at least) and asynchronous operations, Safari&#8217;s auto-playing media policies seem to prevent playing sounds, when playing them should be OK and when other browsers are fine with playing them.<\/li><li>There is a workaround that involves playing the sound in muted form before the async operation happens.<\/li><li>There is a weird bug in Mobile Safari, I think, that prevents HTTPMediaElement.volume being updated, that almost certainly no one will ever come across.<\/li><li>Playing sounds in web browsers SEEMS easy, but it turns out not to be!<\/li><\/ul>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>2018 seems to have flown by, but actually a LOT has happened and a lot has been achieved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Personal and financial<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally it\u2019s been a mixed year, as they usually are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been a lot of great things: the kids turned two and seven (they\u2019re actually just-turned-seven and very-nearly-three).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eldest has really settled in year 2 and is thriving at school both academically and socially.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Youngest is now much better able to look after herself. She\u2019s very much nearly sleeping through the night every night, which means our sleep routines are approaching something normal. She\u2019s on her way to being potty trained (which is good) and dropping her nap (which is a mixed blessing). She was a bit terrible-two, but really not all that much and I think she\u2019ll be a super-fun three year old.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, family-wise, we\u2019re much more settled and solo double-bedtimes are quite routine now which means its easier for at least one of us to go out of an evening! Yay! Can we have our life back now please?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\u2019s not been without difficulty. My wife broke her ankle in April. It was a pretty simple break, but for 6 weeks I had to do EVERYTHING. People would ask if Sally was doing OK, I would half- (and on half-) jokingly say \u201cShe\u2019s fine. She gets to sit around all day while I do ALL THE THINGS!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds funny. Bit it was actually very stressful and it really pushed me to breaking point. I somehow had to manage to keep my work running while doing all the school runs and shopping trips and cooking and cleaning and gardening and carrying anything that needed carrying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we did it. We got through, and I know people who have endured MUCH worse. But it did leave me in catchup mode for June\/July and then before I knew it we had summer holidays to cover too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financially we\u2019re not struggling, but the ankle-break and my subsequent loss of hours did hit us a bit. We\u2019re both working slightly part time to be able to spend time with our kids in the week, and already pay a financial penalty as a result, so the lost time hit us. I feel like this will be a break-even year, which is OK. But next year will need to be better!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Work<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I didn\u2019t actually do a huge amount of proper technical work. I didn\u2019t launch many large, complete website projects. The few I did were quite long-running things so it&#8217;s not really felt like much both started  and finished within the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did a lot of support and minor updates and smaller, but technically complex changes. Though I\u2019m freelance, I work with a couple of \u201cteams\u201d, and I tend to field the stuff that other people get stuck with, such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>working closely with a hosting company to recover a site that\u2019s been subject to a sophisticated hacking attempt<\/li><li>building a Ninja Forms extension to add clever new fields<\/li><li>tweaking an off-the-shelf SVG world map to correct country boundaries<\/li><li>building proxy APIs to make third-party service integrations more reliable<\/li><li>or figuring out other people\u2019s code to build plugins, integrate with APIs and tweak and fix existing sites.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I did do a few smaller, end-to-end website projects, and I was SUPER proud to have done a some of them entirely under my own steam without even help from a designer!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the year I unexpectedly ended up looking into \u201cproper jobs\u201d, but then subsequently found out that a) it\u2019s currently too hard for me to wind down <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/\">Oikos<\/a> to a place where I can leave it and b) I need to retain flexibility to support some possible future career moves for my wife, while discharging all the parenting duties that we need to fit into a week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It DOES feel like change is afoot, it\u2019s just not going to happen immediately and I don\u2019t yet know when it will happen. I was REALLY encouraged that several people were very interested in employing me for permanent developer roles, and its definitely got me working on simplifying the business so I can make that move at some future point if I want to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOT TOPICS! GDPR and Gutenberg<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be remiss of me to neglect the two Hot Topics of the year in my world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>GDPR got in the way in May just as I was Doing All The Things because of the broken ankle. But I focussed hard on doing the Right Thing for GDPR and I have processes, audits, and documents that should all support my data protection efforts. I was thrilled when a large charity declared that I didn\u2019t have to sign their own data processing agreement because my own legal documentation was more than sufficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg &#8211; the new WordPress editor &#8211; also finally came along in December after a year of debate and discussion. People have claimed it has been a smooth transition, but for small agencies like me and the people that I work closely with we\u2019ve not let many of our clients loose with the new editor yet, so the pain is yet to come. And from a personal point of view I don\u2019t like the new editor, I don\u2019t get what it\u2019s for, it\u2019s going to need to me to re-tool and re-skill somewhat in order to use it properly on projects, and it feels like a change in the direction of WordPress that doesn\u2019t suit me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Learning and Playing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve continued to dig into learning Laravel, I\u2019ve been trying to #LearnToLoveJS (JavaScript), I\u2019ve been practicing with Vue.js a lot and have done a little React and Advanced Gutenberg training too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also dug in to Test Driven Development, which has been on my radar for a while. A couple of my side projects exist mostly to get to grips with TDD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back through my GitHub history I kicked off a LOAD of little side project things. I was sure many were from previous years, but it seems that this year I\u2019ve been churning stuff out in my \u201cspare\u201d time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/yet.fyi\">https:\/\/yet.fyi<\/a> &#8211; This is the best domain that I own. I built a very simple app for showing Yes\/No status pages on URLs like <a href=\"https:\/\/hasdaviddavisresigned.yet.fyi\/\">https:\/\/hasdaviddavisresigned.yet.fyi\/<\/a>. This project was my first real-world use of TDD though and it was simple enough to get started.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/kownter.com\">https:\/\/kownter.com<\/a> &#8211; this was also an excuse to do TDD but at a larger scale. Amongst the difficulties of GDPR I decided to see what it would take to build cookie-less, strong-privacy, simple analytics. The basics of it works, but it has fallen off my radar.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/wptolaravel.com\">https:\/\/wptolaravel.com<\/a> &#8211; I finished off the videos and course \u201cplatform\u201d for my free course introducing WP developers to the Laravel framework<\/li><li>SchoolBot (no link &#8211; yet!, but see <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/08\/about-schoolbot\/\">About SchoolBot<\/a>) &#8211; I\u2019m a school parent now and getting access to information I need on a day to day basis can be tricky, so I made a chatbot that sits on top of a parent information database. It super cool. I should probably do better marketing of it.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/zapthemap.com\">https:\/\/zapthemap.com<\/a> &#8211; While the incredibly successful \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/beatthestreet.me\/swindon\">Beat the Street<\/a>\u201d scheme was running in my home town of Swindon, I decided to see if you could make a \u201cvirtual\u201d version of it. It was a great chance to tinker with some mobile browser API\u2019s for location and orientation, practice my Vue.js and Laravel, and to re-learn some trigonometry and maths! <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also really interesting to start a JavaScript channel in the UK WordPress Slack and to find I\u2019m actually more practiced than many with my JavaScript.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Speaking and conferences<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I did less speaking this year. My only conference talk submission was rejected, so I attended WordCamp London as a punter this year, which was actually quite nice for a break. I really wanted to get to either WordCamp Manchester or WordCamp Edinburgh, but the autumn was so chock full of work that I couldn\u2019t. I also bought a ticket to the first UK Laravel conference, Laravel Live, in June but failed to make it because I was still picking up the pieces of the broken ankle saga.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I delivered a talk at the WordPress Bristol People meetup on using developer tools in the browser (<a href=\"https:\/\/wpbristol.co.uk\/developer-tools-tips-tricks-and-social-media-for-business-qa-tues-6th-feb\/\">link<\/a>), I thought I\u2019d also done this at the Cheltenham WordPress Meetup, but it looks like this was back in 2017.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the back of this talk I started making a set of <a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/for-developers\/web-browser-developer-tools\/\">screencasts on using developer tools<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also started recording a <a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/?page_id=642&amp;preview=true\">series on using the command line\/terminal<\/a> right from the very basics of the first Linux commands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general I tried to double down on video as my means of sharing knowledge. It\u2019s great because it doesn\u2019t need as much planning and I don\u2019t need to book travel or accommodation to do it. So in a year where traveling was hard it was great to help people out using this medium and it\u2019s something I hope will continue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Breadmaking is on the rise<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in May, at peak-Ankle-Breaking-Crisis, my good friend Chris brought me a small plastic tub of gloop. This gloop was an apparently-several-year-old sourdough starter. He also brought me a loaf of sourdough bread, and a bag of organic rye flour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Sourdough starter and recipe\" class=\"wp-image-4461\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-945x709.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This may seem like it was a bit of a crazy time to start regularly making slow-proving bread, but actually, I was stuck at home a lot of the time, and I needed a distraction from things. And so making bread became a thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually love the rituals of food and drink. I enjoy the morning coffee-making ritual, for example, be it pour-over filter or more complicated espresso-based drinks. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve always being intrigued by baking &#8211; it seems a good combination of ritual, process, science and art.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve been baking regularly ever since. I did get a bit stuck with loaves getting stuck in the proving baskets &#8211; a problem fixed with a dusting of rice flour &#8211; and the rise is inconsistent, especially with part-wholemeal loaves. But it&#8217;s been great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Sourdough loaf\" class=\"wp-image-4462\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-945x709.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve reduced plastic use: flour in paper bags is delivered (from Shipton Mill) in cardboard boxes and the rest of the process is pretty plastic-free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s somewhat better for you &#8211; apparently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve done some maths and worked out that even with premium flour it&#8217;s actually cheaper than buying bread in the supermarket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we now have our own tub of gloop that&#8217;s been in our house for about 8 months that frequently finds its way into our bread! I&#8217;ll happily take questions on how to make sourdough and share what I know with you. Ask me anything!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What\u2019s up in 2019?!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s been a great year in many ways. My little family is growing up, and this will continue. Business has been a bit lean because I&#8217;ve needed to focus on family. But I&#8217;ve kept busy and feel like I&#8217;m in a good place to focus on the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll try to write about next! So look out for the 2019 plans post!<\/p>\n",

        "title": "2018 Breaking and Making",
        "content": "\n<p>2018 seems to have flown by, but actually a LOT has happened and a lot has been achieved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Personal and financial<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally it\u2019s been a mixed year, as they usually are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been a lot of great things: the kids turned two and seven (they\u2019re actually just-turned-seven and very-nearly-three).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eldest has really settled in year 2 and is thriving at school both academically and socially.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Youngest is now much better able to look after herself. She\u2019s very much nearly sleeping through the night every night, which means our sleep routines are approaching something normal. She\u2019s on her way to being potty trained (which is good) and dropping her nap (which is a mixed blessing). She was a bit terrible-two, but really not all that much and I think she\u2019ll be a super-fun three year old.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, family-wise, we\u2019re much more settled and solo double-bedtimes are quite routine now which means its easier for at least one of us to go out of an evening! Yay! Can we have our life back now please?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\u2019s not been without difficulty. My wife broke her ankle in April. It was a pretty simple break, but for 6 weeks I had to do EVERYTHING. People would ask if Sally was doing OK, I would half- (and on half-) jokingly say \u201cShe\u2019s fine. She gets to sit around all day while I do ALL THE THINGS!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds funny. Bit it was actually very stressful and it really pushed me to breaking point. I somehow had to manage to keep my work running while doing all the school runs and shopping trips and cooking and cleaning and gardening and carrying anything that needed carrying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we did it. We got through, and I know people who have endured MUCH worse. But it did leave me in catchup mode for June\/July and then before I knew it we had summer holidays to cover too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financially we\u2019re not struggling, but the ankle-break and my subsequent loss of hours did hit us a bit. We\u2019re both working slightly part time to be able to spend time with our kids in the week, and already pay a financial penalty as a result, so the lost time hit us. I feel like this will be a break-even year, which is OK. But next year will need to be better!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Work<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I didn\u2019t actually do a huge amount of proper technical work. I didn\u2019t launch many large, complete website projects. The few I did were quite long-running things so it&#8217;s not really felt like much both started  and finished within the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did a lot of support and minor updates and smaller, but technically complex changes. Though I\u2019m freelance, I work with a couple of \u201cteams\u201d, and I tend to field the stuff that other people get stuck with, such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>working closely with a hosting company to recover a site that\u2019s been subject to a sophisticated hacking attempt<\/li><li>building a Ninja Forms extension to add clever new fields<\/li><li>tweaking an off-the-shelf SVG world map to correct country boundaries<\/li><li>building proxy APIs to make third-party service integrations more reliable<\/li><li>or figuring out other people\u2019s code to build plugins, integrate with APIs and tweak and fix existing sites.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I did do a few smaller, end-to-end website projects, and I was SUPER proud to have done a some of them entirely under my own steam without even help from a designer!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the year I unexpectedly ended up looking into \u201cproper jobs\u201d, but then subsequently found out that a) it\u2019s currently too hard for me to wind down <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/\">Oikos<\/a> to a place where I can leave it and b) I need to retain flexibility to support some possible future career moves for my wife, while discharging all the parenting duties that we need to fit into a week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It DOES feel like change is afoot, it\u2019s just not going to happen immediately and I don\u2019t yet know when it will happen. I was REALLY encouraged that several people were very interested in employing me for permanent developer roles, and its definitely got me working on simplifying the business so I can make that move at some future point if I want to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOT TOPICS! GDPR and Gutenberg<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be remiss of me to neglect the two Hot Topics of the year in my world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>GDPR got in the way in May just as I was Doing All The Things because of the broken ankle. But I focussed hard on doing the Right Thing for GDPR and I have processes, audits, and documents that should all support my data protection efforts. I was thrilled when a large charity declared that I didn\u2019t have to sign their own data processing agreement because my own legal documentation was more than sufficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg &#8211; the new WordPress editor &#8211; also finally came along in December after a year of debate and discussion. People have claimed it has been a smooth transition, but for small agencies like me and the people that I work closely with we\u2019ve not let many of our clients loose with the new editor yet, so the pain is yet to come. And from a personal point of view I don\u2019t like the new editor, I don\u2019t get what it\u2019s for, it\u2019s going to need to me to re-tool and re-skill somewhat in order to use it properly on projects, and it feels like a change in the direction of WordPress that doesn\u2019t suit me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Learning and Playing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve continued to dig into learning Laravel, I\u2019ve been trying to #LearnToLoveJS (JavaScript), I\u2019ve been practicing with Vue.js a lot and have done a little React and Advanced Gutenberg training too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also dug in to Test Driven Development, which has been on my radar for a while. A couple of my side projects exist mostly to get to grips with TDD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back through my GitHub history I kicked off a LOAD of little side project things. I was sure many were from previous years, but it seems that this year I\u2019ve been churning stuff out in my \u201cspare\u201d time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/yet.fyi\">https:\/\/yet.fyi<\/a> &#8211; This is the best domain that I own. I built a very simple app for showing Yes\/No status pages on URLs like <a href=\"https:\/\/hasdaviddavisresigned.yet.fyi\/\">https:\/\/hasdaviddavisresigned.yet.fyi\/<\/a>. This project was my first real-world use of TDD though and it was simple enough to get started.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/kownter.com\">https:\/\/kownter.com<\/a> &#8211; this was also an excuse to do TDD but at a larger scale. Amongst the difficulties of GDPR I decided to see what it would take to build cookie-less, strong-privacy, simple analytics. The basics of it works, but it has fallen off my radar.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/wptolaravel.com\">https:\/\/wptolaravel.com<\/a> &#8211; I finished off the videos and course \u201cplatform\u201d for my free course introducing WP developers to the Laravel framework<\/li><li>SchoolBot (no link &#8211; yet!, but see <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/08\/about-schoolbot\/\">About SchoolBot<\/a>) &#8211; I\u2019m a school parent now and getting access to information I need on a day to day basis can be tricky, so I made a chatbot that sits on top of a parent information database. It super cool. I should probably do better marketing of it.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/zapthemap.com\">https:\/\/zapthemap.com<\/a> &#8211; While the incredibly successful \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/beatthestreet.me\/swindon\">Beat the Street<\/a>\u201d scheme was running in my home town of Swindon, I decided to see if you could make a \u201cvirtual\u201d version of it. It was a great chance to tinker with some mobile browser API\u2019s for location and orientation, practice my Vue.js and Laravel, and to re-learn some trigonometry and maths! <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also really interesting to start a JavaScript channel in the UK WordPress Slack and to find I\u2019m actually more practiced than many with my JavaScript.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Speaking and conferences<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I did less speaking this year. My only conference talk submission was rejected, so I attended WordCamp London as a punter this year, which was actually quite nice for a break. I really wanted to get to either WordCamp Manchester or WordCamp Edinburgh, but the autumn was so chock full of work that I couldn\u2019t. I also bought a ticket to the first UK Laravel conference, Laravel Live, in June but failed to make it because I was still picking up the pieces of the broken ankle saga.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I delivered a talk at the WordPress Bristol People meetup on using developer tools in the browser (<a href=\"https:\/\/wpbristol.co.uk\/developer-tools-tips-tricks-and-social-media-for-business-qa-tues-6th-feb\/\">link<\/a>), I thought I\u2019d also done this at the Cheltenham WordPress Meetup, but it looks like this was back in 2017.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the back of this talk I started making a set of <a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/for-developers\/web-browser-developer-tools\/\">screencasts on using developer tools<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also started recording a <a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/?page_id=642&amp;preview=true\">series on using the command line\/terminal<\/a> right from the very basics of the first Linux commands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general I tried to double down on video as my means of sharing knowledge. It\u2019s great because it doesn\u2019t need as much planning and I don\u2019t need to book travel or accommodation to do it. So in a year where traveling was hard it was great to help people out using this medium and it\u2019s something I hope will continue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Breadmaking is on the rise<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in May, at peak-Ankle-Breaking-Crisis, my good friend Chris brought me a small plastic tub of gloop. This gloop was an apparently-several-year-old sourdough starter. He also brought me a loaf of sourdough bread, and a bag of organic rye flour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Sourdough starter and recipe\" class=\"wp-image-4461\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-945x709.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This may seem like it was a bit of a crazy time to start regularly making slow-proving bread, but actually, I was stuck at home a lot of the time, and I needed a distraction from things. And so making bread became a thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually love the rituals of food and drink. I enjoy the morning coffee-making ritual, for example, be it pour-over filter or more complicated espresso-based drinks. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve always being intrigued by baking &#8211; it seems a good combination of ritual, process, science and art.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve been baking regularly ever since. I did get a bit stuck with loaves getting stuck in the proving baskets &#8211; a problem fixed with a dusting of rice flour &#8211; and the rise is inconsistent, especially with part-wholemeal loaves. But it&#8217;s been great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Sourdough loaf\" class=\"wp-image-4462\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-945x709.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve reduced plastic use: flour in paper bags is delivered (from Shipton Mill) in cardboard boxes and the rest of the process is pretty plastic-free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s somewhat better for you &#8211; apparently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve done some maths and worked out that even with premium flour it&#8217;s actually cheaper than buying bread in the supermarket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we now have our own tub of gloop that&#8217;s been in our house for about 8 months that frequently finds its way into our bread! I&#8217;ll happily take questions on how to make sourdough and share what I know with you. Ask me anything!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What\u2019s up in 2019?!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s been a great year in many ways. My little family is growing up, and this will continue. Business has been a bit lean because I&#8217;ve needed to focus on family. But I&#8217;ve kept busy and feel like I&#8217;m in a good place to focus on the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll try to write about next! So look out for the 2019 plans post!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>I\u2019ve been thinking about technical goals for 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I currently mostly write PHP with both WordPress and Laravel and associated HTML, CSS and bits of JavaScript enhancement, including Vue.js and I\u2019ve been trying to learn React too, without quite getting there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m trying to #LearnToLoveJS, rather than Learn JavaScript Deeply as the WordPress world is trying to do. Unfortunately this isn\u2019t quite working out as I had hoped: I feel like I\u2019m making progress with deeper JavaScript knowledge, but not so much with the enjoyment\/loving it aspect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Learn to love TypeScript, or learn it Deeply, or something?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So I\u2019ve been wondering about TypeScript and actually installing it and reading through the docs and tutorials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trouble with TypeScript is that it\u2019s a departure from the norm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like the small-to-medium-sized projects that I work on to be easily-hand-on-able.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another developer picking up one of my projects should not have to learn something that they don\u2019t know. The build process and tool-chain should be simple and well-documented (confession: the latter is not always true, for which I apologise to both other dev\u2019s and my future self).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And TypeScript would add another dependency both into the tool-chain and the required knowledge to take on a project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;I wonder if another goal of 2019 is to take on more projects that are more bespoke, more self-contained and less likely to be handed on to other devs. More projects where I am the dev and I make the technical choices and I\u2019m unashamed about picking the right tool for me to accomplish the task with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Go, Go, Go!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a real hankering to learn Go. I don\u2019t know how that will happen, but from what I\u2019ve heard it seems like a language I would enjoy working with. Compilation with compile-time static analysis. Strongly typed. Multi-threaded. There are all Good Things for a grumpy, old-school dev like me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what would I do with it? I don\u2019t work on the kind of projects where Go would be a viable technology choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But again&#8230;maybe I should. Maybe this is where I should be positioning myself this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can you select technology choices before positioning yourself for work?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Or should it happen the other way around? I suspect a bit of both is required. You won\u2019t win the kinds of work you want until you show capability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe that\u2019s the goal for this year &#8211; demonstrate capability for more of this kind of work and see what happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m pretty firmly entrenched in WordPress world. And I\u2019d like that to continue somewhat. So I SHOULD be learning Gutenberg and Blocks and React. But the reasons for not wanting to do that are&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;the subject of another post probably.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I\u2019ve been thinking about technical goals for 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I currently mostly write PHP with both WordPress and Laravel and associated HTML, CSS and bits of JavaScript enhancement, including Vue.js and I\u2019ve been trying to learn React too, without quite getting there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m trying to #LearnToLoveJS, rather than Learn JavaScript Deeply as the WordPress world is trying to do. Unfortunately this isn\u2019t quite working out as I had hoped: I feel like I\u2019m making progress with deeper JavaScript knowledge, but not so much with the enjoyment\/loving it aspect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Learn to love TypeScript, or learn it Deeply, or something?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So I\u2019ve been wondering about TypeScript and actually installing it and reading through the docs and tutorials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trouble with TypeScript is that it\u2019s a departure from the norm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like the small-to-medium-sized projects that I work on to be easily-hand-on-able.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another developer picking up one of my projects should not have to learn something that they don\u2019t know. The build process and tool-chain should be simple and well-documented (confession: the latter is not always true, for which I apologise to both other dev\u2019s and my future self).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And TypeScript would add another dependency both into the tool-chain and the required knowledge to take on a project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;I wonder if another goal of 2019 is to take on more projects that are more bespoke, more self-contained and less likely to be handed on to other devs. More projects where I am the dev and I make the technical choices and I\u2019m unashamed about picking the right tool for me to accomplish the task with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Go, Go, Go!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a real hankering to learn Go. I don\u2019t know how that will happen, but from what I\u2019ve heard it seems like a language I would enjoy working with. Compilation with compile-time static analysis. Strongly typed. Multi-threaded. There are all Good Things for a grumpy, old-school dev like me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what would I do with it? I don\u2019t work on the kind of projects where Go would be a viable technology choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But again&#8230;maybe I should. Maybe this is where I should be positioning myself this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can you select technology choices before positioning yourself for work?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Or should it happen the other way around? I suspect a bit of both is required. You won\u2019t win the kinds of work you want until you show capability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe that\u2019s the goal for this year &#8211; demonstrate capability for more of this kind of work and see what happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m pretty firmly entrenched in WordPress world. And I\u2019d like that to continue somewhat. So I SHOULD be learning Gutenberg and Blocks and React. But the reasons for not wanting to do that are&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;the subject of another post probably.<\/p>\n",

            },
            "content": {
                "rendered": "\n<p>As a developer who finds design really hard, I was very much looking forward to the release of Steve Schoger and Adam Wathan&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/refactoringui.com\/book\/\">Refactoring UI<\/a>&#8221; book and kit of resources. Here&#8217;s some thoughts on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: I&#8217;m writing my thoughts in the order I had them. The positive stuff comes later!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Price<br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I heard the quote recently that &#8220;If people complain about the price, you&#8217;re doing it right&#8221;, and I confess, I complained about the price, so maybe they did price it right. I&#8217;d prepared myself for it to be 3 or 4 times the cost of an expensive book. But they priced it at $249 for the digital version of the book (not a physical book!) with all the resources! Yes, there&#8217;s a launch discount of 50%, but even so, this half-priced version was expensive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I get the arguments that a lot of experience and knowledge is in here, and a lot of work has been put in to make it a thing. And I get the argument that this will save me time, and it only has to save me a few hours to pay for itself. But actually, I think owning this book won&#8217;t save me time; it will make me do better design work and spend longer on it! Which is fine. As long as someone wants that and is paying me for it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also can&#8217;t help thinking that if this was half the price then they&#8217;d sell twice as many copies, make just as much money and share their knowledge more widely. And isn&#8217;t this the point of making such a resource: to share your knowledge with people?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A could of years back I&#8217;d been disappointed by Adam&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/adamwathan.me\/refactoring-to-collections\/\">Refactoring to Collections<\/a>&#8221; book which I thought wasn&#8217;t worth the money, and the provided videos in particular weren&#8217;t useful at all. So I was skeptical that this book&#8217;s extra resources would be helpful too &#8211; maybe I should just buy the basic package with the book?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But persuaded by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fullstackradio.com\/103\">Full Stack Radio podcast<\/a> that detailed exactly what was in it, I eventually bit and bought the full Refactoring UI kit.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Format<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from it being a digital-only book, it was PDF format. And I get that they&#8217;ve spent time laying it out and typesetting it, but PDF&#8217;s are still not my favourite eBook format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re also selling it on Gumroad and the Gumroad reader seems to display PDFs at low quality. I&#8217;ve seen complaints on Twitter about the PDF quality and if you download it and open it locally it&#8217;s fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More annoying though is that the component library, colour schemes and font selections are all also in PDF form. Which is annoying because the ability to copy\/paste stuff out of here, see the code, and tinker with it in the browser would have been great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Material\/Content<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, so here&#8217;s the good stuff. Because I&#8217;m not a designer, I can&#8217;t see visual stuff in my head or produce &#8220;nice looking stuff&#8221; out of thin air, I&#8217;m pretty dependent on rules and copying other people&#8217;s ideas to make things I make for the web look nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the book here really delivers. Strategic, rule-based design tips that really suit someone like me. It&#8217;s presented in a really easily digestible format, and has LOADS of very-well-put-together real-life examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see the amount of work that has gone into this in creating the fictional-but-real-looking designs that illustrate the points being made. They&#8217;re done a really great job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s great stuff, well presented, and reading it WILL change my work for the better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I want exercises!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, as well as wanting the component library and things in code, I think it would really benefit from some exercises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The videos are great at explaining the concepts and showing how to transform a bad design into a good one. But I really want to have a go at this myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some exercises a bit like Wes Bos&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/javascript30.com\/\">JavaScript 30<\/a> course would be an amazing addition. Give me the video, the starting design\/code and the ending design\/code, and let me see if I can make some of the changes myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading and watching is all well and good, but I&#8217;m only going to build up the skills and get them into my &#8220;muscle memory&#8221; if I actually DO then.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summary<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I love this kit. It&#8217;s expensive, but it&#8217;s an amazing tool for me. But it does also feel lacking\/incomplete in its current form.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My hope is that Adam and Steve have made so much cash now that they don&#8217;t have to work for a year, and that now the book is out, they can spend some time producing some additional resources for those who have purchased it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n",

        "title": "Refactoring UI",
        "content": "\n<p>As a developer who finds design really hard, I was very much looking forward to the release of Steve Schoger and Adam Wathan&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/refactoringui.com\/book\/\">Refactoring UI<\/a>&#8221; book and kit of resources. Here&#8217;s some thoughts on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: I&#8217;m writing my thoughts in the order I had them. The positive stuff comes later!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Price<br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I heard the quote recently that &#8220;If people complain about the price, you&#8217;re doing it right&#8221;, and I confess, I complained about the price, so maybe they did price it right. I&#8217;d prepared myself for it to be 3 or 4 times the cost of an expensive book. But they priced it at $249 for the digital version of the book (not a physical book!) with all the resources! Yes, there&#8217;s a launch discount of 50%, but even so, this half-priced version was expensive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I get the arguments that a lot of experience and knowledge is in here, and a lot of work has been put in to make it a thing. And I get the argument that this will save me time, and it only has to save me a few hours to pay for itself. But actually, I think owning this book won&#8217;t save me time; it will make me do better design work and spend longer on it! Which is fine. As long as someone wants that and is paying me for it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also can&#8217;t help thinking that if this was half the price then they&#8217;d sell twice as many copies, make just as much money and share their knowledge more widely. And isn&#8217;t this the point of making such a resource: to share your knowledge with people?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A could of years back I&#8217;d been disappointed by Adam&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/adamwathan.me\/refactoring-to-collections\/\">Refactoring to Collections<\/a>&#8221; book which I thought wasn&#8217;t worth the money, and the provided videos in particular weren&#8217;t useful at all. So I was skeptical that this book&#8217;s extra resources would be helpful too &#8211; maybe I should just buy the basic package with the book?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But persuaded by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fullstackradio.com\/103\">Full Stack Radio podcast<\/a> that detailed exactly what was in it, I eventually bit and bought the full Refactoring UI kit.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Format<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from it being a digital-only book, it was PDF format. And I get that they&#8217;ve spent time laying it out and typesetting it, but PDF&#8217;s are still not my favourite eBook format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re also selling it on Gumroad and the Gumroad reader seems to display PDFs at low quality. I&#8217;ve seen complaints on Twitter about the PDF quality and if you download it and open it locally it&#8217;s fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More annoying though is that the component library, colour schemes and font selections are all also in PDF form. Which is annoying because the ability to copy\/paste stuff out of here, see the code, and tinker with it in the browser would have been great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Material\/Content<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, so here&#8217;s the good stuff. Because I&#8217;m not a designer, I can&#8217;t see visual stuff in my head or produce &#8220;nice looking stuff&#8221; out of thin air, I&#8217;m pretty dependent on rules and copying other people&#8217;s ideas to make things I make for the web look nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the book here really delivers. Strategic, rule-based design tips that really suit someone like me. It&#8217;s presented in a really easily digestible format, and has LOADS of very-well-put-together real-life examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see the amount of work that has gone into this in creating the fictional-but-real-looking designs that illustrate the points being made. They&#8217;re done a really great job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s great stuff, well presented, and reading it WILL change my work for the better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I want exercises!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, as well as wanting the component library and things in code, I think it would really benefit from some exercises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The videos are great at explaining the concepts and showing how to transform a bad design into a good one. But I really want to have a go at this myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some exercises a bit like Wes Bos&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/javascript30.com\/\">JavaScript 30<\/a> course would be an amazing addition. Give me the video, the starting design\/code and the ending design\/code, and let me see if I can make some of the changes myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading and watching is all well and good, but I&#8217;m only going to build up the skills and get them into my &#8220;muscle memory&#8221; if I actually DO then.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summary<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I love this kit. It&#8217;s expensive, but it&#8217;s an amazing tool for me. But it does also feel lacking\/incomplete in its current form.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My hope is that Adam and Steve have made so much cash now that they don&#8217;t have to work for a year, and that now the book is out, they can spend some time producing some additional resources for those who have purchased it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n",
