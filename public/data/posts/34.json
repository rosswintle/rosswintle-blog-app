I&#8217;m not going to Uni.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes I spend a chunk of time writing a comment on someone else&#8217;s blog. \u00a0I find it a shame that that&#8217;s not somehow linked here, so&#8230;as I&#8217;ve invested the time writing&#8230;I&#8217;m copying that here.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a great discussion going on on <a href=\"http:\/\/mulqueeny.wordpress.com\">Emma Mulqueeny&#8217;s blog<\/a>\u00a0that&#8217;s people giving advice to a young person who&#8217;s thinking about going to Uni to study computer science, or something similar. \u00a0Well worth a read if you&#8217;re in that position yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s my take on the matter (slightly edited).<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>I hope you don\u2019t mind but I\u2019m not going to answer [the young person&#8217;s] questions directly. What I would like to do is share my own experiences and lessons learned.<\/p>\n<p>I was interested in computers from about age 12 \u2013 this in the day of early PC\u2019s and Commodore 64?s. I got good GCSE\u2019s and A levels (Maths, Physics and Computing) and then, more because I was interested than because I wanted it as a career path, I went to Uni to study computer science.<\/p>\n<p>I studied at York, which had an excellent department and course which taught lots of good fundamentals of computing at all different levels, from low-level electronics and maths up to Object-Oriented software design.<\/p>\n<p>The story of how I ended up at York is a whole other comment\/post, but I\u2019d agree with what was said above about looking at syllabuses and what areas of research the Uni is interested in. As I looked around some were really into robotics\/cybernetics, some were into graphics and modelling of motion and particle dynamics, others were into formal programming principles. I think the latter will give a better grounding for programming, but that\u2019s just my opinion.<\/p>\n<p>Having said all of that, maybe you don\u2019t know what specific area you want to go into? I certainly didn\u2019t and I suppose the course that I did gave me some future direction.<\/p>\n<p>ALSO\u2026remember that you\u2019re going to spend three years of your life at Uni and you\u2019ll want to be comfortable and enjoy it. I\u2019m from Swindon, a not-so-big town, and after visiting Imperial I quickly lost interest as I would have found London expensive and stressful. York was cheaper, quieter and more friendly. It\u2019s a personal thing, but worth thinking about if you decide to go to Uni. You may long for the big city life!<\/p>\n<p>The course mostly did me well, though I felt that it was highly geared towards people who would stay on for further study (masters, PhD, etc). The final year in particular covered topics that were highly theoretical and specific to the research interests of the University I was at.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of practical application, probably everything I learned in the first two years was enough. I did a straight 3-year degree and I WISH I\u2019d taken a year in industry. I\u2019d encourage you to do something practical like that and see how IT works in the real world as well as in the theoretical playground of a University. I was fortunate to get 13-weeks work as a junior DBA. Totally different to everything I was studying, but hugely important in my future career.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also true that you don\u2019t have to be an academic star to be good at this stuff. Some of the best people I\u2019ve worked with in IT have been school leavers or people who didn\u2019t finish at school. They got simple jobs in IT firms and worked they way up, succeeding by having industry knowledge, a willingness and ability to learn, and a good work ethic. As I worked in IT operations it was easy to see that some of those in lower-level jobs (shift operators, etc) had great prospects and would quickly move into more technical positions.<\/p>\n<p>So, anyway, I graduated and was fortunate enough to get a job where I used a lot of the skills I\u2019d learned at Uni, working in safety-critical software engineering. This was amazing and I left that first job for personal reasons rather than because I disliked the work.<\/p>\n<p>My second job (look at my CV if you want to know) was in a big IT\/telecoms firm. And I guess some companies will be better than others, but experience was actually quite stifling. Initially they invested in me, but ultimately I found that the the large corporate only had one thing on its mind: cash! And if they\u2019re a PLC that also means cash-for-investors-and-shareholders. I found the large corporate to care little for real innovation and creativity.<\/p>\n<p>And so I left in February to go freelance and be creative and do my own thing and learn masses about business and technology and creativity and working in partnership and\u2026so much more. I LOVE it. I love problem solving on MY terms, I love learning new stuff. Yes, I end some days weary and frustrated \u2013 that happened when I was employed too \u2013 but I always wake with fire in my belly because I\u2019m doing the thing I love doing: using technology to help people solve problems.<\/p>\n<p>A final thing to throw in. For a long time I thought my degree was pretty worthless in terms of real-world application. But when I worked for the big corporate I learned that the foundations of computer science that I had made learning new things SO much easier. The classic case was a training course I was on learning a scripting language. When it came to exercises, initially I was the slowest. Everyone else was just rattling off the answers they\u2019d memorised or copied from the course notes. But I was questioning how things worked to try and get \u201cunder the bonnet\u201d of the language. When it came to later, more complex exercises, my greater understanding of how the language worked meant that I could solve the more complex problems much more easily. That \u201cdigging down\u201d was informed by the fundamentals I\u2019d learned in my degree.<\/p>\n<p>So I guess my lessons are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Knowledge of the fundamentals is very useful \u2013 more useful than I realised.<\/li>\n<li>But real-world, practical application and experience is also hugely valuable.<\/li>\n<li>My opinion is that you can be good with either, but to be great you need both.<\/li>\n<li>Research courses and universities well \u2013 it\u2019s a big decision that could affect you a lot.<\/li>\n<li>Decide on a route \u2013 this will inform your university decision \u2013 perhaps you can find a course that specialises in medical applications?<\/li>\n<li>OR\u2026don\u2019t decide on a route. Pick a place that looks good and have your future guided by what you learn on the course.<\/li>\n<li>I disagree that learning the current thing (Cloud, \u201cWeb Science\u201d) will do you well. If you learn the fundamentals you will quickly pick up whatever the current trend is. Plus, web development is only one area of programming \u2013 it\u2019s a quick, easy way in, but probably, ultimately, a short-term approach.<\/li>\n<li>This is also a personal opinion, but I find the languages of the web pretty poor. They let you get stuff done very quickly, but don\u2019t encourage good software engineering practices. Learn something well-structured and strongly-typed first (maybe something functional?) to get the principles. Any code that you later write in something like PHP or JavaScript will be FAR better as a result.<\/li>\n<li>Often small companies are doing the interesting stuff. My experience is that large companies stifle innovation. There are probably exceptions to this (Google, Apple), but you\u2019ll need to be really good to get in. REALLY good!<\/li>\n<li>I think [the young person in the original post] will do really well. They sounded intelligent, hard-working, and had a desire to be creative and solve real world problems.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There\u2019s a little bit more (and some repetition of what I\u2019ve said) on my blog \u2013 I\u2019m thinking specifically these two posts may be useful\/inspiring:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2011\/03\/im-a-php-expert\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2011\/03\/im-a-php-expert\/<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2011\/02\/sparks\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2011\/02\/sparks\/<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To anyone reading this, feel free to leave a comment here if you want to discuss my experiences.

        "content": "<p>No. Not me. I&#8217;m not going to Uni.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes I spend a chunk of time writing a comment on someone else&#8217;s blog. \u00a0I find it a shame that that&#8217;s not somehow linked here, so&#8230;as I&#8217;ve invested the time writing&#8230;I&#8217;m copying that here.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a great discussion going on on <a href=\"http:\/\/mulqueeny.wordpress.com\">Emma Mulqueeny&#8217;s blog<\/a>\u00a0that&#8217;s people giving advice to a young person who&#8217;s thinking about going to Uni to study computer science, or something similar. \u00a0Well worth a read if you&#8217;re in that position yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s my take on the matter (slightly edited).<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>I hope you don\u2019t mind but I\u2019m not going to answer [the young person&#8217;s] questions directly. What I would like to do is share my own experiences and lessons learned.<\/p>\n<p>I was interested in computers from about age 12 \u2013 this in the day of early PC\u2019s and Commodore 64?s. I got good GCSE\u2019s and A levels (Maths, Physics and Computing) and then, more because I was interested than because I wanted it as a career path, I went to Uni to study computer science.<\/p>\n<p>I studied at York, which had an excellent department and course which taught lots of good fundamentals of computing at all different levels, from low-level electronics and maths up to Object-Oriented software design.<\/p>\n<p>The story of how I ended up at York is a whole other comment\/post, but I\u2019d agree with what was said above about looking at syllabuses and what areas of research the Uni is interested in. As I looked around some were really into robotics\/cybernetics, some were into graphics and modelling of motion and particle dynamics, others were into formal programming principles. I think the latter will give a better grounding for programming, but that\u2019s just my opinion.<\/p>\n<p>Having said all of that, maybe you don\u2019t know what specific area you want to go into? I certainly didn\u2019t and I suppose the course that I did gave me some future direction.<\/p>\n<p>ALSO\u2026remember that you\u2019re going to spend three years of your life at Uni and you\u2019ll want to be comfortable and enjoy it. I\u2019m from Swindon, a not-so-big town, and after visiting Imperial I quickly lost interest as I would have found London expensive and stressful. York was cheaper, quieter and more friendly. It\u2019s a personal thing, but worth thinking about if you decide to go to Uni. You may long for the big city life!<\/p>\n<p>The course mostly did me well, though I felt that it was highly geared towards people who would stay on for further study (masters, PhD, etc). The final year in particular covered topics that were highly theoretical and specific to the research interests of the University I was at.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of practical application, probably everything I learned in the first two years was enough. I did a straight 3-year degree and I WISH I\u2019d taken a year in industry. I\u2019d encourage you to do something practical like that and see how IT works in the real world as well as in the theoretical playground of a University. I was fortunate to get 13-weeks work as a junior DBA. Totally different to everything I was studying, but hugely important in my future career.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also true that you don\u2019t have to be an academic star to be good at this stuff. Some of the best people I\u2019ve worked with in IT have been school leavers or people who didn\u2019t finish at school. They got simple jobs in IT firms and worked they way up, succeeding by having industry knowledge, a willingness and ability to learn, and a good work ethic. As I worked in IT operations it was easy to see that some of those in lower-level jobs (shift operators, etc) had great prospects and would quickly move into more technical positions.<\/p>\n<p>So, anyway, I graduated and was fortunate enough to get a job where I used a lot of the skills I\u2019d learned at Uni, working in safety-critical software engineering. This was amazing and I left that first job for personal reasons rather than because I disliked the work.<\/p>\n<p>My second job (look at my CV if you want to know) was in a big IT\/telecoms firm. And I guess some companies will be better than others, but experience was actually quite stifling. Initially they invested in me, but ultimately I found that the the large corporate only had one thing on its mind: cash! And if they\u2019re a PLC that also means cash-for-investors-and-shareholders. I found the large corporate to care little for real innovation and creativity.<\/p>\n<p>And so I left in February to go freelance and be creative and do my own thing and learn masses about business and technology and creativity and working in partnership and\u2026so much more. I LOVE it. I love problem solving on MY terms, I love learning new stuff. Yes, I end some days weary and frustrated \u2013 that happened when I was employed too \u2013 but I always wake with fire in my belly because I\u2019m doing the thing I love doing: using technology to help people solve problems.<\/p>\n<p>A final thing to throw in. For a long time I thought my degree was pretty worthless in terms of real-world application. But when I worked for the big corporate I learned that the foundations of computer science that I had made learning new things SO much easier. The classic case was a training course I was on learning a scripting language. When it came to exercises, initially I was the slowest. Everyone else was just rattling off the answers they\u2019d memorised or copied from the course notes. But I was questioning how things worked to try and get \u201cunder the bonnet\u201d of the language. When it came to later, more complex exercises, my greater understanding of how the language worked meant that I could solve the more complex problems much more easily. That \u201cdigging down\u201d was informed by the fundamentals I\u2019d learned in my degree.<\/p>\n<p>So I guess my lessons are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Knowledge of the fundamentals is very useful \u2013 more useful than I realised.<\/li>\n<li>But real-world, practical application and experience is also hugely valuable.<\/li>\n<li>My opinion is that you can be good with either, but to be great you need both.<\/li>\n<li>Research courses and universities well \u2013 it\u2019s a big decision that could affect you a lot.<\/li>\n<li>Decide on a route \u2013 this will inform your university decision \u2013 perhaps you can find a course that specialises in medical applications?<\/li>\n<li>OR\u2026don\u2019t decide on a route. Pick a place that looks good and have your future guided by what you learn on the course.<\/li>\n<li>I disagree that learning the current thing (Cloud, \u201cWeb Science\u201d) will do you well. If you learn the fundamentals you will quickly pick up whatever the current trend is. Plus, web development is only one area of programming \u2013 it\u2019s a quick, easy way in, but probably, ultimately, a short-term approach.<\/li>\n<li>This is also a personal opinion, but I find the languages of the web pretty poor. They let you get stuff done very quickly, but don\u2019t encourage good software engineering practices. Learn something well-structured and strongly-typed first (maybe something functional?) to get the principles. Any code that you later write in something like PHP or JavaScript will be FAR better as a result.<\/li>\n<li>Often small companies are doing the interesting stuff. My experience is that large companies stifle innovation. There are probably exceptions to this (Google, Apple), but you\u2019ll need to be really good to get in. REALLY good!<\/li>\n<li>I think [the young person in the original post] will do really well. They sounded intelligent, hard-working, and had a desire to be creative and solve real world problems.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There\u2019s a little bit more (and some repetition of what I\u2019ve said) on my blog \u2013 I\u2019m thinking specifically these two posts may be useful\/inspiring:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2011\/03\/im-a-php-expert\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2011\/03\/im-a-php-expert\/<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2011\/02\/sparks\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2011\/02\/sparks\/<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To anyone reading this, feel free to leave a comment here if you want to discuss my experiences.
