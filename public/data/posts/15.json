I\u2019m writing up the lessons learned to try to help others (and my future self) avoid the same pitfalls. So this is observation and information, not criticism. If you think anything I write up might be about you and you don\u2019t like what I wrote, please let me know and I\u2019ll fix things. Thanks!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re making a new website for your organisation or company (or for yourself!), it\u2019s kinda trendy to use abstract language that doesn\u2019t actually reflect what you do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be a problem. Especially if you rely on search engines like Google to send people to your website from search results. And DOUBLY especially if your business name itself doesn\u2019t mention what or where you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a problem because search engines are trying to identify who you are and what you\u2019re about, and if you\u2019re too abstract in your language and content then you won\u2019t appear in the right searches.<br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m actually guilty of having a vague company name myself. My company is \u201cOikos Digital Ltd\u201d which, while <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/about\/\">a clever name<\/a>, doesn\u2019t describe in English any of what I do. So I\u2019m very careful to have my website set up with a big title saying \u201cweb development and technology consultancy for charities, communities and small businesses\u201d and I try to talk about those things a lot on my website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As another, made-up example, let\u2019s say you ran a bakery in Bath. You\u2019ve decided to call it \u201cRisen\u201d. Your marketing agency has suggested you use the tagline \u201cFresh \/ Tasty \/ Treats\u201d. Your website is at risen.co.uk (don\u2019t go there &#8211; I made it up &#8211; I can\u2019t be held responsible for what you actually see), and it has lots of shallow-depth-of-field photos of beautiful cakes topped with sparkly buttercream, and rustic loaves dusted in stoneground flour, and it talks a lot about craft sponges and cup-cakes, artisan icing techniques, and hand-crafted sourdough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google may well put you in search results for these things you mention. But you\u2019ve neglected to mention that you\u2019re a bakery&#8230;in Bath. So if someone does a search for \u201cBakeries in Bath\u201d you may not be found.<br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, while it may seem incredibly boring to do so, it\u2019s actually quite helpful to talk about what you do, and, if you have a physical shop or office or venue, to talk about where you are too. It helps people find you, and when people arrive on your website, they know exactly what they are looking at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This process of making your website\u2019s content help you appear in search results is called \u201cSearch Engine Optimisaiton\u201d, or \u201cSEO\u201d for short. It&#8217;s a big, scary subject, and lots of people will try to sell you lots of expensive services and tools to help you do it well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the basics are simple: Make it clear who you are, what you do, where you are. Talk about those things. Put those things in headings and titles to show they are important. If you know how, include them in meta tags for descriptions and titles too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, my imaginary bakery (this is making me hungry!) may want to be found in searches for \u201cfresh treats\u201d or \u201cartisan sourdough\u201d. Maybe that\u2019s a strategy you\u2019ve chosen. But if you\u2019re an average local business wanting to attract local people then you probably want something less obscure.<br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A trendy website is no good if no one is going to find it. Trendy, abstract, modernist marketing is great, and you can still use some of that, but be careful what you write: you may need to be boring to be found!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br\/><\/p>\n",

I\u2019m writing up the lessons learned to try to help others (and my future self) avoid the same pitfalls. So this is observation and information, not criticism. If you think anything I write up might be about you and you don\u2019t like what I wrote, please let me know and I\u2019ll fix things. Thanks!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re making a new website for your organisation or company (or for yourself!), it\u2019s kinda trendy to use abstract language that doesn\u2019t actually reflect what you do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be a problem. Especially if you rely on search engines like Google to send people to your website from search results. And DOUBLY especially if your business name itself doesn\u2019t mention what or where you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a problem because search engines are trying to identify who you are and what you\u2019re about, and if you\u2019re too abstract in your language and content then you won\u2019t appear in the right searches.<br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m actually guilty of having a vague company name myself. My company is \u201cOikos Digital Ltd\u201d which, while <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/about\/\">a clever name<\/a>, doesn\u2019t describe in English any of what I do. So I\u2019m very careful to have my website set up with a big title saying \u201cweb development and technology consultancy for charities, communities and small businesses\u201d and I try to talk about those things a lot on my website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As another, made-up example, let\u2019s say you ran a bakery in Bath. You\u2019ve decided to call it \u201cRisen\u201d. Your marketing agency has suggested you use the tagline \u201cFresh \/ Tasty \/ Treats\u201d. Your website is at risen.co.uk (don\u2019t go there &#8211; I made it up &#8211; I can\u2019t be held responsible for what you actually see), and it has lots of shallow-depth-of-field photos of beautiful cakes topped with sparkly buttercream, and rustic loaves dusted in stoneground flour, and it talks a lot about craft sponges and cup-cakes, artisan icing techniques, and hand-crafted sourdough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google may well put you in search results for these things you mention. But you\u2019ve neglected to mention that you\u2019re a bakery&#8230;in Bath. So if someone does a search for \u201cBakeries in Bath\u201d you may not be found.<br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, while it may seem incredibly boring to do so, it\u2019s actually quite helpful to talk about what you do, and, if you have a physical shop or office or venue, to talk about where you are too. It helps people find you, and when people arrive on your website, they know exactly what they are looking at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This process of making your website\u2019s content help you appear in search results is called \u201cSearch Engine Optimisaiton\u201d, or \u201cSEO\u201d for short. It&#8217;s a big, scary subject, and lots of people will try to sell you lots of expensive services and tools to help you do it well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the basics are simple: Make it clear who you are, what you do, where you are. Talk about those things. Put those things in headings and titles to show they are important. If you know how, include them in meta tags for descriptions and titles too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, my imaginary bakery (this is making me hungry!) may want to be found in searches for \u201cfresh treats\u201d or \u201cartisan sourdough\u201d. Maybe that\u2019s a strategy you\u2019ve chosen. But if you\u2019re an average local business wanting to attract local people then you probably want something less obscure.<br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A trendy website is no good if no one is going to find it. Trendy, abstract, modernist marketing is great, and you can still use some of that, but be careful what you write: you may need to be boring to be found!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br\/><\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>In the web development world there&#8217;s been a load of discussion about learning\/knowing CSS, the cascade, CSS-in-JSS vs CSS-in-err-CSS recently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve largely not taken part mostly because I see these things as tools: you use the one that works for you and your project, and no one is right or wrong &#8211; you&#8217;re allowed your opinion (but do express is kindly, please).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that learning the cascade isn&#8217;t something you should do (if you work on the web, it&#8217;s probably <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">helpful<\/span> to <a href=\"https:\/\/hankchizljaw.io\/wrote\/css-specifity-and-the-cascade\/\">understand the cascade<\/a>), and it isn&#8217;t saying that you should avoid work by just lazily doing whatever you&#8217;ve done in the past because it worked then and it should work now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d say that learning CSS is easy and learning CSS-in-JS is easy; what&#8217;s hard is learning how to decide what is the best tool to use on your project. This is the difference between knowledge (which is easily gained) &#8211; and wisdom (which is gained over years of work and much trial and error).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway&#8230;the whole thing ended up with <a href=\"https:\/\/toots.hankchizljaw.io\/@hankchizljaw\">someone<\/a>\u00a0suggesting to me that &#8220;the title &#8216;front-end developer&#8217; is pretty much synonymous with React now.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This got me thinking. Because a &#8220;front-end&#8221; developer used to be someone who made layouts and designs in code. They did HTML and CSS with some JavaScript sprinkles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, because front-end can include any of the popular JS frameworks, the description of that role has significantly changed and now includes doing routing, data storage and manipulation, interfacing with (and creating) APIs and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When discussing this with someone else it was suggested that &#8220;all developer jobs are full stack now&#8221; and that&#8217;s because all the stuff that used to happen in the &#8220;back-end&#8221; can, and frequently does, now happen in the browser.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so our <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2014\/11\/job-titles\/\">job titles<\/a>\u00a0are all messed up. I think we need some new ones that better distinguish between the disciplines of web and application development. Along the lines of &#8220;visual developer&#8221; and &#8220;data developer&#8221;. Hopefully you get my meaning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s easier to switch languages (i.e. I&#8217;d probably be fine writing data-processing algorithms in JavaScript if I wanted to, but I&#8217;m not really into animation or advanced typography and font-handling techniques) than to switch disciplines (i.e. to go from being a data geek to being an animation geek).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we need terms that better describe our disciplines. I&#8217;m happy to take your suggestions in the comments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case&#8230;I love my self-proclaimed job title of &#8220;Creator &#8211; Engineer &#8211; Advisor&#8221;. It perfectly sums up what I do without tying me to any particular discipline or technology! So why not make your own, like I did?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>In the web development world there&#8217;s been a load of discussion about learning\/knowing CSS, the cascade, CSS-in-JSS vs CSS-in-err-CSS recently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve largely not taken part mostly because I see these things as tools: you use the one that works for you and your project, and no one is right or wrong &#8211; you&#8217;re allowed your opinion (but do express is kindly, please).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that learning the cascade isn&#8217;t something you should do (if you work on the web, it&#8217;s probably <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">helpful<\/span> to <a href=\"https:\/\/hankchizljaw.io\/wrote\/css-specifity-and-the-cascade\/\">understand the cascade<\/a>), and it isn&#8217;t saying that you should avoid work by just lazily doing whatever you&#8217;ve done in the past because it worked then and it should work now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d say that learning CSS is easy and learning CSS-in-JS is easy; what&#8217;s hard is learning how to decide what is the best tool to use on your project. This is the difference between knowledge (which is easily gained) &#8211; and wisdom (which is gained over years of work and much trial and error).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway&#8230;the whole thing ended up with <a href=\"https:\/\/toots.hankchizljaw.io\/@hankchizljaw\">someone<\/a>\u00a0suggesting to me that &#8220;the title &#8216;front-end developer&#8217; is pretty much synonymous with React now.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This got me thinking. Because a &#8220;front-end&#8221; developer used to be someone who made layouts and designs in code. They did HTML and CSS with some JavaScript sprinkles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, because front-end can include any of the popular JS frameworks, the description of that role has significantly changed and now includes doing routing, data storage and manipulation, interfacing with (and creating) APIs and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When discussing this with someone else it was suggested that &#8220;all developer jobs are full stack now&#8221; and that&#8217;s because all the stuff that used to happen in the &#8220;back-end&#8221; can, and frequently does, now happen in the browser.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so our <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2014\/11\/job-titles\/\">job titles<\/a>\u00a0are all messed up. I think we need some new ones that better distinguish between the disciplines of web and application development. Along the lines of &#8220;visual developer&#8221; and &#8220;data developer&#8221;. Hopefully you get my meaning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s easier to switch languages (i.e. I&#8217;d probably be fine writing data-processing algorithms in JavaScript if I wanted to, but I&#8217;m not really into animation or advanced typography and font-handling techniques) than to switch disciplines (i.e. to go from being a data geek to being an animation geek).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we need terms that better describe our disciplines. I&#8217;m happy to take your suggestions in the comments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case&#8230;I love my self-proclaimed job title of &#8220;Creator &#8211; Engineer &#8211; Advisor&#8221;. It perfectly sums up what I do without tying me to any particular discipline or technology! So why not make your own, like I did?<\/p>\n",

This totally isn&#8217;t their fault! They don&#8217;t know what they don&#8217;t know. And my job is to educate and guide them in the right direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This lead me to thinking I should do a &#8220;WordPress Website Drivers License&#8221; course that covers some of the hidden aspects of running a website and helps people understand not only what they need to do, but why they need to do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It <em>could<\/em> be generic, rather than WordPress specific. But focussing on WordPress would give me a chance to talk about tools and settings that are specific to that platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a flip side to this though: why does WordPress, out of the box, have so many basic security and performance problems that require initial lockdown? Sure, some &#8220;features&#8221; of WordPress are wide open to abuse if you can get an admin login, but we could limit the attack vectors; we could close some of the holes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surely simple brute force protection\/rate limiting, two-factor auth (or password-less login), not-having-a-user-called-admin, page caching, and perhaps even testing SPF records are solved problems now? So why do I have to add these in myself to protect people that I work with?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yes, I know that some of these things exist and may be merged into WordPress core in future. But until they are, it&#8217;s not just the editing experience that puts WordPress behind the likes of SquareSpace and Shopify.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Often people come to me with a simple &#8220;Can you tweak this thing on my website?&#8221; and when I get a login I end up fixing basic security and performance and privacy things. This totally isn&#8217;t their fault! They don&#8217;t know what they don&#8217;t know. And my job is to educate and guide them in the right direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This lead me to thinking I should do a &#8220;WordPress Website Drivers License&#8221; course that covers some of the hidden aspects of running a website and helps people understand not only what they need to do, but why they need to do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It <em>could<\/em> be generic, rather than WordPress specific. But focussing on WordPress would give me a chance to talk about tools and settings that are specific to that platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a flip side to this though: why does WordPress, out of the box, have so many basic security and performance problems that require initial lockdown? Sure, some &#8220;features&#8221; of WordPress are wide open to abuse if you can get an admin login, but we could limit the attack vectors; we could close some of the holes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surely simple brute force protection\/rate limiting, two-factor auth (or password-less login), not-having-a-user-called-admin, page caching, and perhaps even testing SPF records are solved problems now? So why do I have to add these in myself to protect people that I work with?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yes, I know that some of these things exist and may be merged into WordPress core in future. But until they are, it&#8217;s not just the editing experience that puts WordPress behind the likes of SquareSpace and Shopify.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

Just putting simple data into a database and pulling simple data out again!&#8221;. And you&#8217;re right. That&#8217;s exactly what it is. But doing it in a structured way for a given niche is where the value is here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding structure to data means you can do interesting things with it. For example, I can automatically display today&#8217;s meal from the menus and meals lists on the website now, without anyone having to update the website!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that schools are the only places where making data more structured can help. I want to get SchoolBot in front of some users and schools and see what they make of it. If it&#8217;s useful, then maybe there are other places we can build!<\/p>\n",

Just putting simple data into a database and pulling simple data out again!&#8221;. And you&#8217;re right. That&#8217;s exactly what it is. But doing it in a structured way for a given niche is where the value is here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding structure to data means you can do interesting things with it. For example, I can automatically display today&#8217;s meal from the menus and meals lists on the website now, without anyone having to update the website!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that schools are the only places where making data more structured can help. I want to get SchoolBot in front of some users and schools and see what they make of it. If it&#8217;s useful, then maybe there are other places we can build!<\/p>\n",

So I&#8217;m not officially a &#8220;web designer&#8221; as well as a &#8220;web developer&#8221;! I&#8217;m pretty proud of what we&#8217;ve achieved and it came in under budget too. (P.S. Thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.34sp.com\/\">34SP.com<\/a> for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.34sp.com\/charity-hosting\">free charity hosting<\/a>!)<\/li><li>I finished off building a small, <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/\">Laravel<\/a>-based proxy API for <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/\">MailChimp<\/a>.<br\/><br\/>The client was sending requests from a third-party tool into MailChimp and they were sometimes getting lost in transit, and the third party tool had no logs or error checking or anything.<br\/><br\/>This proxy takes the request, validates it, and passes it on to MailChimp. The benefit of the proxy is that it logs ALL signup attempts, regardless of validity, and records errors that come back from the MailChimp API.<\/li><li>I did some post-go-live snagging on a recently launched <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/\">WordPress<\/a> site.<\/li><li>I worked more on <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/08\/about-schoolbot\/\">SchoolBot<\/a> to try to get it to a point where I can demo it to demonstrate its usefulness. It now does better keyword recognition (though still not natural language processing), and has a number of new APIs that allow data to be got into a website using the WordPress plugin that I&#8217;m building alongside it. This remains a non-public project, and is only really for my own use and testing.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow &#8211; after really posting a lot in the previous week, last week I managed a grand total of ZERO blog posts. I will try to do better this week. I guess that&#8217;s what going back to work does! But I did dig up and share some old content that was relevant this week:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I regurgitated\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2012\/05\/parenthood-the-sum-of-my-knowledge\/\">this old post about everything I know about parenting<\/a>.<\/li><li>As much as I enjoy public speaking, I&#8217;ve only actually done three conference talks!

So I&#8217;m not officially a &#8220;web designer&#8221; as well as a &#8220;web developer&#8221;! I&#8217;m pretty proud of what we&#8217;ve achieved and it came in under budget too. (P.S. Thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.34sp.com\/\">34SP.com<\/a> for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.34sp.com\/charity-hosting\">free charity hosting<\/a>!)<\/li><li>I finished off building a small, <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/\">Laravel<\/a>-based proxy API for <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/\">MailChimp<\/a>.<br\/><br\/>The client was sending requests from a third-party tool into MailChimp and they were sometimes getting lost in transit, and the third party tool had no logs or error checking or anything.<br\/><br\/>This proxy takes the request, validates it, and passes it on to MailChimp. The benefit of the proxy is that it logs ALL signup attempts, regardless of validity, and records errors that come back from the MailChimp API.<\/li><li>I did some post-go-live snagging on a recently launched <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/\">WordPress<\/a> site.<\/li><li>I worked more on <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/08\/about-schoolbot\/\">SchoolBot<\/a> to try to get it to a point where I can demo it to demonstrate its usefulness. It now does better keyword recognition (though still not natural language processing), and has a number of new APIs that allow data to be got into a website using the WordPress plugin that I&#8217;m building alongside it. This remains a non-public project, and is only really for my own use and testing.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow &#8211; after really posting a lot in the previous week, last week I managed a grand total of ZERO blog posts. I will try to do better this week. I guess that&#8217;s what going back to work does! But I did dig up and share some old content that was relevant this week:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I regurgitated\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2012\/05\/parenthood-the-sum-of-my-knowledge\/\">this old post about everything I know about parenting<\/a>.<\/li><li>As much as I enjoy public speaking, I&#8217;ve only actually done three conference talks!

And it\u2019s kind of odd that we rarely remind ourselves of these things (maybe this is just us?).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose anniversarys are celebrations, but maybe we should be better at reminding ourselves of our vows on an ongoing basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was thinking that we are now moving quickly away from the all-our-friends-are-getting-married phase through the all-our-friends-are-having-children phase. We found it hard to name the people who are likely to be bride and groom at the next wedding we attend. So we will be reminded of the wedding vows less often and we shall hear fewer wedding sermons and wedding speeches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weddings are, of course, all about the two people getting married. But they are also useful reminders of the nature of the ongoing, practical, sacrificial, unconditional love that underpins any committed relationship and that has to be worked out through the gritty and unpredictable mess of daily life lived together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here\u2019s a little prompt. If you are married or in a civil partnership (apologies for the topic if you aren\u2019t), why not remind yourself of your vows? Or, if you\u2019ve been married a while, why not even plan to renew your vows in public? It doesn\u2019t have to be a big thing. As well as reminding yourselves of your promises to each other, it might be a reminder to others about what love is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can\u2019t help but feel that that\u2019s something the world needs right now.<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Remembering your promises",
        "content": "\n<p>It was a complete joy (and a real honour) to attend a wedding yesterday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attending weddings always reminds me of my own wedding, and especially of the promises that I made to my wonderful wife Sally on that day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those promises are such huge things to say, in public, and (in our case, we believe) in the presence of God. And it\u2019s kind of odd that we rarely remind ourselves of these things (maybe this is just us?).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose anniversarys are celebrations, but maybe we should be better at reminding ourselves of our vows on an ongoing basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was thinking that we are now moving quickly away from the all-our-friends-are-getting-married phase through the all-our-friends-are-having-children phase. We found it hard to name the people who are likely to be bride and groom at the next wedding we attend. So we will be reminded of the wedding vows less often and we shall hear fewer wedding sermons and wedding speeches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weddings are, of course, all about the two people getting married. But they are also useful reminders of the nature of the ongoing, practical, sacrificial, unconditional love that underpins any committed relationship and that has to be worked out through the gritty and unpredictable mess of daily life lived together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here\u2019s a little prompt. If you are married or in a civil partnership (apologies for the topic if you aren\u2019t), why not remind yourself of your vows? Or, if you\u2019ve been married a while, why not even plan to renew your vows in public? It doesn\u2019t have to be a big thing. As well as reminding yourselves of your promises to each other, it might be a reminder to others about what love is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can\u2019t help but feel that that\u2019s something the world needs right now.<\/p>\n",

And I think its useful to note where I come from when thinking about Gutenberg.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, there\u2019s my own context. Mostly as a user of WordPress (I\u2019m using it right now!) but also as a developer. And I\u2019m always aware, when thinking about and commenting on Gutenberg, that I\u2019m not a typical user.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there\u2019s this second context, which is: what does everyone else think? Here, I\u2019m often guessing (probably incorrectly) what the typical user might want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also have this other, third role\/context that I think overrides thoughts of \u201cwhat do I want\u201d and \u201cwhat might everyone else want\u201d. That role is WordPress educator and support person. The role where I explain to both the public (sometimes) and to my clients (more often) how to use WordPress, or take questions on how to use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this role, the main question I\u2019m asking is: \u201cHow the heck am I going to explain this to someone else?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ll happily take advice in the comments on how to answer that question.<br\/><\/p>\n",

The role where I explain to both the public (sometimes) and to my clients (more often) how to use WordPress, or take questions on how to use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this role, the main question I\u2019m asking is: \u201cHow the heck am I going to explain this to someone else?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ll happily take advice in the comments on how to answer that question.<br\/><\/p>\n",

            },
            "content": {
                "rendered": "\n<p>I&#8217;ve always had that temptation to spend extra money on cordless things. But the extra expense has never quite seemed worth it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, battery-powered, cordless things are getting cheaper. And, while I won&#8217;t paint a life of posh, cordless-powered luxury in the Wintle household (because that&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s like at all), I have made some purchases recently that have really helped with getting things done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, I know Lidl do a cordless hammer drill that gets good reviews. But they don&#8217;t stock it very often! (Watch out, they stock the non-hammer-action drill often, but it won&#8217;t do masonry!). So when it DID appear in stock one week I bought one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And not only did I then go and hang a load of things on walls that had been waiting for me to do so for ages, but I also went a bit crazy and creative and made my son a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/04\/i-made-things-a-basketball-hoop\/\">basketball hoop<\/a> on a whim!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freed from the constraints of having to find an appropriate combination of socket, circuit breaker, and extension lead, I could now just grab-and-go. And it was a joy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d had this nagging feeling that I&#8217;d get more done with cordless things. Being able to just pick up a tool and do a job was great. Especially with busy family life where having kids around corded electrical goods is a bit of a hazard for everyone. And it had been proven true. So what next?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, my wife broke her ankle, that&#8217;s what was next. And I was in charge of EVERYTHING for six weeks in the late spring. 2 children. All the cooking. Even carrying cups of tea around the house. I barely had a moment to spare. So anything that would speed up household tasks and let me do little bits here and there rather than committing to huge long sessions of cleaning would be a boon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, one day in Lidl again, I saw they were selling a battery-powered lawn strimmer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s amazing!&#8221;, I thought, &#8220;I can just grab this while the kids are playing in the garden, whizz round a bit of the lawn and keep it from getting too long, all without that incredible hassle of traipsing up and down my long garden with extension leads and stuff. AND it uses the SAME batteries as the drill!!!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was proven right too.\u00a0 Sure, a battery-powered strimmer isn&#8217;t as powerful as a corded one. And it feels a bit plasticky and flimsy. But it really does the job. I grab it and &#8220;mow&#8221; while the kids are playing. I can do 10 or 15 minutes of it at a time and the job gets done in little bursts as a part of daily life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So finally, and this took some convincing and research and waiting for a good deal, but I caved and also bought a cordless vacuum cleaner. These things can be expensive. But I got one for a huge 50% off. And it&#8217;s not perfect, but it has transformed cleaning in our house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s less powerful than our &#8220;big vacuum&#8221;, but this has the benefit that it&#8217;s also much quieter. And it&#8217;s great. We can just grab it, do a room while the kids watch TV or something, and then put it away. So quick and easy and brilliant for a busy family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some problems are people problems and have solutions with people. But sometimes technology really is a help in everyday life. I&#8217;ve loved ditching cables around the house. Are there other appliances I should go cordless with?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I&#8217;ve always had that temptation to spend extra money on cordless things. But the extra expense has never quite seemed worth it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, battery-powered, cordless things are getting cheaper. And, while I won&#8217;t paint a life of posh, cordless-powered luxury in the Wintle household (because that&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s like at all), I have made some purchases recently that have really helped with getting things done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, I know Lidl do a cordless hammer drill that gets good reviews. But they don&#8217;t stock it very often! (Watch out, they stock the non-hammer-action drill often, but it won&#8217;t do masonry!). So when it DID appear in stock one week I bought one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And not only did I then go and hang a load of things on walls that had been waiting for me to do so for ages, but I also went a bit crazy and creative and made my son a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/04\/i-made-things-a-basketball-hoop\/\">basketball hoop<\/a> on a whim!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freed from the constraints of having to find an appropriate combination of socket, circuit breaker, and extension lead, I could now just grab-and-go. And it was a joy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d had this nagging feeling that I&#8217;d get more done with cordless things. Being able to just pick up a tool and do a job was great. Especially with busy family life where having kids around corded electrical goods is a bit of a hazard for everyone. And it had been proven true. So what next?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, my wife broke her ankle, that&#8217;s what was next. And I was in charge of EVERYTHING for six weeks in the late spring. 2 children. All the cooking. Even carrying cups of tea around the house. I barely had a moment to spare. So anything that would speed up household tasks and let me do little bits here and there rather than committing to huge long sessions of cleaning would be a boon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, one day in Lidl again, I saw they were selling a battery-powered lawn strimmer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s amazing!&#8221;, I thought, &#8220;I can just grab this while the kids are playing in the garden, whizz round a bit of the lawn and keep it from getting too long, all without that incredible hassle of traipsing up and down my long garden with extension leads and stuff. AND it uses the SAME batteries as the drill!!!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was proven right too.\u00a0 Sure, a battery-powered strimmer isn&#8217;t as powerful as a corded one. And it feels a bit plasticky and flimsy. But it really does the job. I grab it and &#8220;mow&#8221; while the kids are playing. I can do 10 or 15 minutes of it at a time and the job gets done in little bursts as a part of daily life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So finally, and this took some convincing and research and waiting for a good deal, but I caved and also bought a cordless vacuum cleaner. These things can be expensive. But I got one for a huge 50% off. And it&#8217;s not perfect, but it has transformed cleaning in our house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s less powerful than our &#8220;big vacuum&#8221;, but this has the benefit that it&#8217;s also much quieter. And it&#8217;s great. We can just grab it, do a room while the kids watch TV or something, and then put it away. So quick and easy and brilliant for a busy family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some problems are people problems and have solutions with people. But sometimes technology really is a help in everyday life. I&#8217;ve loved ditching cables around the house. Are there other appliances I should go cordless with?<\/p>\n",
