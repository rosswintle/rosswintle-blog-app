This totally isn&#8217;t their fault! They don&#8217;t know what they don&#8217;t know. And my job is to educate and guide them in the right direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This lead me to thinking I should do a &#8220;WordPress Website Drivers License&#8221; course that covers some of the hidden aspects of running a website and helps people understand not only what they need to do, but why they need to do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It <em>could<\/em> be generic, rather than WordPress specific. But focussing on WordPress would give me a chance to talk about tools and settings that are specific to that platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a flip side to this though: why does WordPress, out of the box, have so many basic security and performance problems that require initial lockdown? Sure, some &#8220;features&#8221; of WordPress are wide open to abuse if you can get an admin login, but we could limit the attack vectors; we could close some of the holes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surely simple brute force protection\/rate limiting, two-factor auth (or password-less login), not-having-a-user-called-admin, page caching, and perhaps even testing SPF records are solved problems now? So why do I have to add these in myself to protect people that I work with?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yes, I know that some of these things exist and may be merged into WordPress core in future. But until they are, it&#8217;s not just the editing experience that puts WordPress behind the likes of SquareSpace and Shopify.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

This totally isn&#8217;t their fault! They don&#8217;t know what they don&#8217;t know. And my job is to educate and guide them in the right direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This lead me to thinking I should do a &#8220;WordPress Website Drivers License&#8221; course that covers some of the hidden aspects of running a website and helps people understand not only what they need to do, but why they need to do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It <em>could<\/em> be generic, rather than WordPress specific. But focussing on WordPress would give me a chance to talk about tools and settings that are specific to that platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a flip side to this though: why does WordPress, out of the box, have so many basic security and performance problems that require initial lockdown? Sure, some &#8220;features&#8221; of WordPress are wide open to abuse if you can get an admin login, but we could limit the attack vectors; we could close some of the holes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surely simple brute force protection\/rate limiting, two-factor auth (or password-less login), not-having-a-user-called-admin, page caching, and perhaps even testing SPF records are solved problems now? So why do I have to add these in myself to protect people that I work with?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yes, I know that some of these things exist and may be merged into WordPress core in future. But until they are, it&#8217;s not just the editing experience that puts WordPress behind the likes of SquareSpace and Shopify.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

Just putting simple data into a database and pulling simple data out again!&#8221;. And you&#8217;re right. That&#8217;s exactly what it is. But doing it in a structured way for a given niche is where the value is here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding structure to data means you can do interesting things with it. For example, I can automatically display today&#8217;s meal from the menus and meals lists on the website now, without anyone having to update the website!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that schools are the only places where making data more structured can help. I want to get SchoolBot in front of some users and schools and see what they make of it. If it&#8217;s useful, then maybe there are other places we can build!<\/p>\n",

Just putting simple data into a database and pulling simple data out again!&#8221;. And you&#8217;re right. That&#8217;s exactly what it is. But doing it in a structured way for a given niche is where the value is here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding structure to data means you can do interesting things with it. For example, I can automatically display today&#8217;s meal from the menus and meals lists on the website now, without anyone having to update the website!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that schools are the only places where making data more structured can help. I want to get SchoolBot in front of some users and schools and see what they make of it. If it&#8217;s useful, then maybe there are other places we can build!<\/p>\n",

This is probably as much for my benefit as anything, but let me know if you find it interesting or helpful. Use the comments &#8211; I&#8217;m happy to tweak the format to make it more useful for others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It was back to work &#8220;full time&#8221; this week as kids went back to school.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I can now say that <a href=\"https:\/\/safestrongfree.org.uk\/\">the site I launched the week before<\/a> was for a brilliant little Devon-based charity called <a href=\"https:\/\/safestrongfree.org.uk\/\">CAP UK<\/a> that do assault prevention education, workshops and resources.<br\/><br\/>This is the first project where I&#8217;ve not had to work with a graphic designer &#8211; I did some iterative design in the browser and that was sufficient. So I&#8217;m not officially a &#8220;web designer&#8221; as well as a &#8220;web developer&#8221;! I&#8217;m pretty proud of what we&#8217;ve achieved and it came in under budget too. (P.S. Thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.34sp.com\/\">34SP.com<\/a> for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.34sp.com\/charity-hosting\">free charity hosting<\/a>!)<\/li><li>I finished off building a small, <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/\">Laravel<\/a>-based proxy API for <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/\">MailChimp<\/a>.<br\/><br\/>The client was sending requests from a third-party tool into MailChimp and they were sometimes getting lost in transit, and the third party tool had no logs or error checking or anything.<br\/><br\/>This proxy takes the request, validates it, and passes it on to MailChimp. The benefit of the proxy is that it logs ALL signup attempts, regardless of validity, and records errors that come back from the MailChimp API.<\/li><li>I did some post-go-live snagging on a recently launched <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/\">WordPress<\/a> site.<\/li><li>I worked more on <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/08\/about-schoolbot\/\">SchoolBot<\/a> to try to get it to a point where I can demo it to demonstrate its usefulness. It now does better keyword recognition (though still not natural language processing), and has a number of new APIs that allow data to be got into a website using the WordPress plugin that I&#8217;m building alongside it. This remains a non-public project, and is only really for my own use and testing.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow &#8211; after really posting a lot in the previous week, last week I managed a grand total of ZERO blog posts. I will try to do better this week. I guess that&#8217;s what going back to work does!

This is probably as much for my benefit as anything, but let me know if you find it interesting or helpful. Use the comments &#8211; I&#8217;m happy to tweak the format to make it more useful for others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It was back to work &#8220;full time&#8221; this week as kids went back to school.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I can now say that <a href=\"https:\/\/safestrongfree.org.uk\/\">the site I launched the week before<\/a> was for a brilliant little Devon-based charity called <a href=\"https:\/\/safestrongfree.org.uk\/\">CAP UK<\/a> that do assault prevention education, workshops and resources.<br\/><br\/>This is the first project where I&#8217;ve not had to work with a graphic designer &#8211; I did some iterative design in the browser and that was sufficient. So I&#8217;m not officially a &#8220;web designer&#8221; as well as a &#8220;web developer&#8221;! I&#8217;m pretty proud of what we&#8217;ve achieved and it came in under budget too. (P.S. Thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.34sp.com\/\">34SP.com<\/a> for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.34sp.com\/charity-hosting\">free charity hosting<\/a>!)<\/li><li>I finished off building a small, <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/\">Laravel<\/a>-based proxy API for <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/\">MailChimp<\/a>.<br\/><br\/>The client was sending requests from a third-party tool into MailChimp and they were sometimes getting lost in transit, and the third party tool had no logs or error checking or anything.<br\/><br\/>This proxy takes the request, validates it, and passes it on to MailChimp. The benefit of the proxy is that it logs ALL signup attempts, regardless of validity, and records errors that come back from the MailChimp API.<\/li><li>I did some post-go-live snagging on a recently launched <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/\">WordPress<\/a> site.<\/li><li>I worked more on <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/08\/about-schoolbot\/\">SchoolBot<\/a> to try to get it to a point where I can demo it to demonstrate its usefulness. It now does better keyword recognition (though still not natural language processing), and has a number of new APIs that allow data to be got into a website using the WordPress plugin that I&#8217;m building alongside it. This remains a non-public project, and is only really for my own use and testing.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow &#8211; after really posting a lot in the previous week, last week I managed a grand total of ZERO blog posts. I will try to do better this week. I guess that&#8217;s what going back to work does! But I did dig up and share some old content that was relevant this week:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I regurgitated\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2012\/05\/parenthood-the-sum-of-my-knowledge\/\">this old post about everything I know about parenting<\/a>.<\/li><li>As much as I enjoy public speaking, I&#8217;ve only actually done three conference talks!

                "rendered": "\n<p>It was a complete joy (and a real honour) to attend a wedding yesterday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attending weddings always reminds me of my own wedding, and especially of the promises that I made to my wonderful wife Sally on that day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those promises are such huge things to say, in public, and (in our case, we believe) in the presence of God. And it\u2019s kind of odd that we rarely remind ourselves of these things (maybe this is just us?).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose anniversarys are celebrations, but maybe we should be better at reminding ourselves of our vows on an ongoing basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was thinking that we are now moving quickly away from the all-our-friends-are-getting-married phase through the all-our-friends-are-having-children phase. We found it hard to name the people who are likely to be bride and groom at the next wedding we attend. So we will be reminded of the wedding vows less often and we shall hear fewer wedding sermons and wedding speeches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weddings are, of course, all about the two people getting married. But they are also useful reminders of the nature of the ongoing, practical, sacrificial, unconditional love that underpins any committed relationship and that has to be worked out through the gritty and unpredictable mess of daily life lived together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here\u2019s a little prompt. If you are married or in a civil partnership (apologies for the topic if you aren\u2019t), why not remind yourself of your vows? Or, if you\u2019ve been married a while, why not even plan to renew your vows in public? It doesn\u2019t have to be a big thing. As well as reminding yourselves of your promises to each other, it might be a reminder to others about what love is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can\u2019t help but feel that that\u2019s something the world needs right now.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>It was a complete joy (and a real honour) to attend a wedding yesterday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attending weddings always reminds me of my own wedding, and especially of the promises that I made to my wonderful wife Sally on that day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those promises are such huge things to say, in public, and (in our case, we believe) in the presence of God. And it\u2019s kind of odd that we rarely remind ourselves of these things (maybe this is just us?).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose anniversarys are celebrations, but maybe we should be better at reminding ourselves of our vows on an ongoing basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was thinking that we are now moving quickly away from the all-our-friends-are-getting-married phase through the all-our-friends-are-having-children phase. We found it hard to name the people who are likely to be bride and groom at the next wedding we attend. So we will be reminded of the wedding vows less often and we shall hear fewer wedding sermons and wedding speeches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weddings are, of course, all about the two people getting married. But they are also useful reminders of the nature of the ongoing, practical, sacrificial, unconditional love that underpins any committed relationship and that has to be worked out through the gritty and unpredictable mess of daily life lived together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here\u2019s a little prompt. If you are married or in a civil partnership (apologies for the topic if you aren\u2019t), why not remind yourself of your vows? Or, if you\u2019ve been married a while, why not even plan to renew your vows in public? It doesn\u2019t have to be a big thing. As well as reminding yourselves of your promises to each other, it might be a reminder to others about what love is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can\u2019t help but feel that that\u2019s something the world needs right now.<\/p>\n",

And I think its useful to note where I come from when thinking about Gutenberg.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, there\u2019s my own context. Mostly as a user of WordPress (I\u2019m using it right now!) but also as a developer. And I\u2019m always aware, when thinking about and commenting on Gutenberg, that I\u2019m not a typical user.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there\u2019s this second context, which is: what does everyone else think? Here, I\u2019m often guessing (probably incorrectly) what the typical user might want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also have this other, third role\/context that I think overrides thoughts of \u201cwhat do I want\u201d and \u201cwhat might everyone else want\u201d. That role is WordPress educator and support person. The role where I explain to both the public (sometimes) and to my clients (more often) how to use WordPress, or take questions on how to use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this role, the main question I\u2019m asking is: \u201cHow the heck am I going to explain this to someone else?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ll happily take advice in the comments on how to answer that question.<br\/><\/p>\n",

The role where I explain to both the public (sometimes) and to my clients (more often) how to use WordPress, or take questions on how to use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this role, the main question I\u2019m asking is: \u201cHow the heck am I going to explain this to someone else?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ll happily take advice in the comments on how to answer that question.<br\/><\/p>\n",

            },
            "content": {
                "rendered": "\n<p>I&#8217;ve always had that temptation to spend extra money on cordless things. But the extra expense has never quite seemed worth it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, battery-powered, cordless things are getting cheaper. And, while I won&#8217;t paint a life of posh, cordless-powered luxury in the Wintle household (because that&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s like at all), I have made some purchases recently that have really helped with getting things done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, I know Lidl do a cordless hammer drill that gets good reviews. But they don&#8217;t stock it very often! (Watch out, they stock the non-hammer-action drill often, but it won&#8217;t do masonry!). So when it DID appear in stock one week I bought one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And not only did I then go and hang a load of things on walls that had been waiting for me to do so for ages, but I also went a bit crazy and creative and made my son a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/04\/i-made-things-a-basketball-hoop\/\">basketball hoop<\/a> on a whim!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freed from the constraints of having to find an appropriate combination of socket, circuit breaker, and extension lead, I could now just grab-and-go. And it was a joy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d had this nagging feeling that I&#8217;d get more done with cordless things. Being able to just pick up a tool and do a job was great. Especially with busy family life where having kids around corded electrical goods is a bit of a hazard for everyone. And it had been proven true. So what next?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, my wife broke her ankle, that&#8217;s what was next. And I was in charge of EVERYTHING for six weeks in the late spring. 2 children. All the cooking. Even carrying cups of tea around the house. I barely had a moment to spare. So anything that would speed up household tasks and let me do little bits here and there rather than committing to huge long sessions of cleaning would be a boon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, one day in Lidl again, I saw they were selling a battery-powered lawn strimmer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s amazing!&#8221;, I thought, &#8220;I can just grab this while the kids are playing in the garden, whizz round a bit of the lawn and keep it from getting too long, all without that incredible hassle of traipsing up and down my long garden with extension leads and stuff. AND it uses the SAME batteries as the drill!!!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was proven right too.\u00a0 Sure, a battery-powered strimmer isn&#8217;t as powerful as a corded one. And it feels a bit plasticky and flimsy. But it really does the job. I grab it and &#8220;mow&#8221; while the kids are playing. I can do 10 or 15 minutes of it at a time and the job gets done in little bursts as a part of daily life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So finally, and this took some convincing and research and waiting for a good deal, but I caved and also bought a cordless vacuum cleaner. These things can be expensive. But I got one for a huge 50% off. And it&#8217;s not perfect, but it has transformed cleaning in our house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s less powerful than our &#8220;big vacuum&#8221;, but this has the benefit that it&#8217;s also much quieter. And it&#8217;s great. We can just grab it, do a room while the kids watch TV or something, and then put it away. So quick and easy and brilliant for a busy family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some problems are people problems and have solutions with people. But sometimes technology really is a help in everyday life. I&#8217;ve loved ditching cables around the house. Are there other appliances I should go cordless with?<\/p>\n",

But the extra expense has never quite seemed worth it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, battery-powered, cordless things are getting cheaper. And, while I won&#8217;t paint a life of posh, cordless-powered luxury in the Wintle household (because that&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s like at all), I have made some purchases recently that have really helped with getting things done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, I know Lidl do a cordless hammer drill that gets good reviews. But they don&#8217;t stock it very often! (Watch out, they stock the non-hammer-action drill often, but it won&#8217;t do masonry!). So when it DID appear in stock one week I bought one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And not only did I then go and hang a load of things on walls that had been waiting for me to do so for ages, but I also went a bit crazy and creative and made my son a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/04\/i-made-things-a-basketball-hoop\/\">basketball hoop<\/a> on a whim!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freed from the constraints of having to find an appropriate combination of socket, circuit breaker, and extension lead, I could now just grab-and-go. And it was a joy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d had this nagging feeling that I&#8217;d get more done with cordless things. Being able to just pick up a tool and do a job was great. Especially with busy family life where having kids around corded electrical goods is a bit of a hazard for everyone. And it had been proven true. So what next?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, my wife broke her ankle, that&#8217;s what was next. And I was in charge of EVERYTHING for six weeks in the late spring. 2 children. All the cooking. Even carrying cups of tea around the house. I barely had a moment to spare. So anything that would speed up household tasks and let me do little bits here and there rather than committing to huge long sessions of cleaning would be a boon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, one day in Lidl again, I saw they were selling a battery-powered lawn strimmer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s amazing!&#8221;, I thought, &#8220;I can just grab this while the kids are playing in the garden, whizz round a bit of the lawn and keep it from getting too long, all without that incredible hassle of traipsing up and down my long garden with extension leads and stuff. AND it uses the SAME batteries as the drill!!!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was proven right too.\u00a0 Sure, a battery-powered strimmer isn&#8217;t as powerful as a corded one. And it feels a bit plasticky and flimsy. But it really does the job. I grab it and &#8220;mow&#8221; while the kids are playing. I can do 10 or 15 minutes of it at a time and the job gets done in little bursts as a part of daily life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So finally, and this took some convincing and research and waiting for a good deal, but I caved and also bought a cordless vacuum cleaner. These things can be expensive. But I got one for a huge 50% off. And it&#8217;s not perfect, but it has transformed cleaning in our house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s less powerful than our &#8220;big vacuum&#8221;, but this has the benefit that it&#8217;s also much quieter. And it&#8217;s great. We can just grab it, do a room while the kids watch TV or something, and then put it away. So quick and easy and brilliant for a busy family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some problems are people problems and have solutions with people. But sometimes technology really is a help in everyday life. I&#8217;ve loved ditching cables around the house. Are there other appliances I should go cordless with?<\/p>\n",

And at home, when I\u2019m outside, I\u2019m usually gardening, cycling, walking or doing something else with purpose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this all means that I rarely get to be barefoot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will probably sound like a really odd thing, but I REALLY liked walking around barefoot on the grass and (this will surprise some but&#8230;) the beach on holiday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like things that connect me to the earth. Cycling and gardening means I have to pay attention to weather. Gardening and growing food also puts you very much in touch with the seasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like cooking (even though Sally does most of it) and baking. \u00a0I like the processes of brewing tea and filter coffee. I like the slowness of making sourdough bread which is a thing which, when starter and dough, feels very much \u201calive\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Computers and the internet are great, brilliant, amazing things. But there\u2019s something special about just feeling the grass beneath your feet.<\/p>\n",

And at home, when I\u2019m outside, I\u2019m usually gardening, cycling, walking or doing something else with purpose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this all means that I rarely get to be barefoot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will probably sound like a really odd thing, but I REALLY liked walking around barefoot on the grass and (this will surprise some but&#8230;) the beach on holiday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like things that connect me to the earth. Cycling and gardening means I have to pay attention to weather. Gardening and growing food also puts you very much in touch with the seasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like cooking (even though Sally does most of it) and baking. \u00a0I like the processes of brewing tea and filter coffee. I like the slowness of making sourdough bread which is a thing which, when starter and dough, feels very much \u201calive\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Computers and the internet are great, brilliant, amazing things. But there\u2019s something special about just feeling the grass beneath your feet.<\/p>\n",

This also involved a highly complex import of existing content scraped from <a href=\"http:\/\/archive.shipoffools.com\/mystery\/index.html\">hundreds of HTML files<\/a>. I also themed <a href=\"https:\/\/vanillaforums.com\/en\/software\/\">Vanilla Forums<\/a> for <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.shipoffools.com\/\">this project\u2019s community side<\/a>, and advised on GDPR, SEO and a bunch of other things.<\/li>\n<li>I\u2019m working on phase&#8230;err&#8230;7 perhaps (?) of a custom Laravel-based food ordering system that uses some hefty amount of <a href=\"https:\/\/vuejs.org\/\">Vue.js<\/a> and a big bunch of custom logic.<\/li>\n<li>I\u2019m about to launch a site for a Devon-based charity that\u2019s a simple <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elegantthemes.com\/gallery\/divi\/\">Divi-based<\/a> WordPress brochure site. But I\u2019m excited because, effectively, I was the visual designer on this and it ACTUALLY LOOKS REALLY NICE!! (Or so I think)<\/li>\n<li>I have two other small Divi-based sites on the go for local organisations\/people. One involves some clever data manipulation and image migration\/import work.<\/li>\n<li>I have a WordPress plugin extension to write to enable custom postcode lookup functionality on a <a href=\"https:\/\/ninjaforms.com\/\">Ninja Form<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>I\u2019m providing ad-hoc support to a number of clients &#8211; mostly WordPress stuff, but sometimes diving into UX, hosting, security, site migrations, domains and DNS, email deliverability, and general IT support.<\/li>\n<li>I\u2019m trying to get an important client email out about the new \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/gutenberg\/\">Gutenberg<\/a>\u201d editor in WordPress (amongst other things) which needs me to edit a screencast video first.<\/li>\n<li>In my spare time I\u2019m building SchoolBot and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/about-kownter\/\">Kownter<\/a> as side projects (amongst other things that have fallen by the wayside), and trying to keep my \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/\">Press Ups<\/a>\u201d video tutorials going too. Oh and there\u2019s (hugely unexciting secret WordPress project) happening too.<\/li>\n<li>Fielding whatever support, hosting, minor changes and prospective client queries come in on a day-to-day basis.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So there we go&#8230;keeps me busy with family and household stuff around too!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<h3>Because some things on the internet are inexplicably hard to do<\/h3>\n<p>Gosh, what a frustrating afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>This is a case of knowing the individual parts of a task pretty well, but not having put all the parts together in this particular way before.<\/p>\n<p>Today I needed\/wanted to create a simple email sign-up\/opt-in form with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The excellent Elegant Themes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elegantthemes.com\/plugins\/bloom\/\">Bloom email sign-up plugin<\/a>\u00a0(though it could have been pretty much any email sign-up plugin)<\/li>\n<li>A regular MailChimp List<\/li>\n<li>MailChimp groups<\/li>\n<li>MailChimp&#8217;s new GDPR fields<\/li>\n<li>and when I got stuck, <a href=\"http:\/\/wpforms.com\/\">WPForms<\/a> too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I reckon I&#8217;ve combined two of these things together in several different combinations. And I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve done one specific combination of three of them. But never more than that.<\/p>\n<p>And I needed at least four of them. And the GDPR fields in MailChimp are new and, well, let&#8217;s say they seem to have been shoe-horned in in a bit of a hurry.<\/p>\n<p>Now&#8230;let&#8217;s go down the rabbit hole&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Bloom integrates with regular MailChimp, but won&#8217;t let you use groups.\u00a0 To do that you need to use a &#8220;custom HTML form&#8221; in the Bloom opt-in which you copy and paste from MailChimp&#8217;s embedded forms section.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with that is that in a pop-up (we have a good case for using a pop-up, it&#8217;s OK!) is that the GDPR text and fields make the form really long and it won&#8217;t fit nicely on a smaller screen.<\/p>\n<p>So I tried reducing the form to just an email input and a button, and then sending that input to a WPForms form using a URL parameter to autocomplete the email field on the &#8220;full&#8221; form. Great! That works really nicely.<\/p>\n<p>Only&#8230;WPForms doesn&#8217;t send the GDPR opt-in fields. Rats! I assume Gravity Forms won&#8217;t do this either.<\/p>\n<p>So maybe, rather than linking the Bloom opt-in to an on-site form, I&#8217;ll link it to an off-site form. That will work!<\/p>\n<p>Only, I want the subscriber to sign up to a specific group, and it turns out that <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/help\/automatically-add-subscribers-to-a-group-at-signup\/\">you sort-of can&#8217;t have a pre-selected group on MailChimps own, hosted forms<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So what am I left with? Taking a MailChimp embedded form, sticking it in a WordPress page, editing the HTML of the form to make the required group pre-selected and hiding the group selection from the user and linking my Bloom pop-up to that page.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s pretty gross. But it does work.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m hoping that at some point MailChimp&#8217;s API will work nicer with the GDPR fields. It seems to have the ability to send &#8220;marketing_permissions&#8221; with a new subscriber, but it&#8217;s not clear how you get the ID&#8217;s needed to send. When this does work nicely, hopefully WPForms or Bloom or Gravity Forms will integrate with it and let me do this properly.<\/p>\n<p>For now&#8230;making a simple form requires a humongous kludge.<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to the internet, everybody!<\/p>\n",

And I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve done one specific combination of three of them. But never more than that.<\/p>\n<p>And I needed at least four of them. And the GDPR fields in MailChimp are new and, well, let&#8217;s say they seem to have been shoe-horned in in a bit of a hurry.<\/p>\n<p>Now&#8230;let&#8217;s go down the rabbit hole&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Bloom integrates with regular MailChimp, but won&#8217;t let you use groups.\u00a0 To do that you need to use a &#8220;custom HTML form&#8221; in the Bloom opt-in which you copy and paste from MailChimp&#8217;s embedded forms section.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with that is that in a pop-up (we have a good case for using a pop-up, it&#8217;s OK!) is that the GDPR text and fields make the form really long and it won&#8217;t fit nicely on a smaller screen.<\/p>\n<p>So I tried reducing the form to just an email input and a button, and then sending that input to a WPForms form using a URL parameter to autocomplete the email field on the &#8220;full&#8221; form. Great! That works really nicely.<\/p>\n<p>Only&#8230;WPForms doesn&#8217;t send the GDPR opt-in fields. Rats! I assume Gravity Forms won&#8217;t do this either.<\/p>\n<p>So maybe, rather than linking the Bloom opt-in to an on-site form, I&#8217;ll link it to an off-site form. That will work!<\/p>\n<p>Only, I want the subscriber to sign up to a specific group, and it turns out that <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/help\/automatically-add-subscribers-to-a-group-at-signup\/\">you sort-of can&#8217;t have a pre-selected group on MailChimps own, hosted forms<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So what am I left with? Taking a MailChimp embedded form, sticking it in a WordPress page, editing the HTML of the form to make the required group pre-selected and hiding the group selection from the user and linking my Bloom pop-up to that page.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s pretty gross. But it does work.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m hoping that at some point MailChimp&#8217;s API will work nicer with the GDPR fields. It seems to have the ability to send &#8220;marketing_permissions&#8221; with a new subscriber, but it&#8217;s not clear how you get the ID&#8217;s needed to send. When this does work nicely, hopefully WPForms or Bloom or Gravity Forms will integrate with it and let me do this properly.<\/p>\n<p>For now&#8230;making a simple form requires a humongous kludge.<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to the internet, everybody!<\/p>\n",
