                "rendered": "<p>Earlier today I tweeted as follows:<\/p>\n<p>[blackbirdpie url=&#8221;https:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/magicroundabout\/status\/133945796117790720&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p>And&#8230;it turns out, several people were intrigued. \u00a0So I ought to explain myself in full.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>The National Childbirth Trust<\/h2>\n<p>Yeah, yeah, you all know, we&#8217;re having a baby (real soon!) right.<\/p>\n<p>We decided, after some good feedback from friends and family, to go on the National Childbirth Trust&#8217;s ante-natal class. \u00a0This is worthy of a post of its own, but in general was very good.<\/p>\n<p>One of the sessions was dedicated to breastfeeding. \u00a0We won&#8217;t mention the fact that I got to wear lipstick. \u00a0We WILL mention the fact that it was run by a knowledgeable woman who obviously cared greatly about the welfare of women and babies at what can be a very stressful time. \u00a0She said &#8220;if you have any problems, call me any time, we can give you help and I can come around and help you work out what&#8217;s going wrong and how you might be able to make things easier&#8221; &#8211; or words to that effect.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s true. We have her number. We can call. She will help. She reinforced the fact: &#8220;call me, I want to help&#8221;. The course tutor reinforced the fact &#8220;call her, she wants to help&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>What a fantastic service! And she, and the team of breastfeeding counsellors in Swindon (and, I believe, around the country) are 100% voluntary.<\/p>\n<h2>So What&#8217;s Breastfeeding Got To Do With Cycling?<\/h2>\n<p>I was impressed by this. Very impressed. And it got me thinking. \u00a0Here&#8217;s someone who:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>passionately believes that a particular activity is good<\/li>\n<li>understands that that activity isn&#8217;t always simple\/easy<\/li>\n<li>longs to help others take up and sustain that activity<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m like that. \u00a0I&#8217;m like that about cycling. \u00a0Many of the regular readers of this blog are like that about cycling too.<\/p>\n<p>And so I find myself thinking, what if we had &#8220;Cycling Counsellors&#8221;?<\/p>\n<p>What if there were people you could call and ask questions like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I&#8217;m thinking of buying a bike, what sort of bike should I get?<\/li>\n<li>How can I easily get from A to B on my bicycle &#8211; I don&#8217;t know the safest\/quickest way<\/li>\n<li>What simple safety checks should I do to my bike every now and then? How hard are they? Can I do them myself?<\/li>\n<li>My tyre&#8217;s flat\/chain&#8217;s come off\/handlebars wobble\/brakes aren&#8217;t very good, what should I do?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Why Not?<\/h2>\n<p>I mostly had very positive responses to this idea. I think it&#8217;s a good one. But I, myself have questions about it, and some people pointed out some useful things.<\/p>\n<h4>It&#8217;s all online!<\/h4>\n<p>There&#8217;s masses of books, internet forums, blogs, Twitter accounts, bike shops anyway. Don&#8217;t these provide that service?<\/p>\n<p>Yes, to some extent they do. And, in particular, there&#8217;s LOADS of good information online.<\/p>\n<p>But despite reading lots of books, articles, blogs, and so on, about birth, parenting, and breastfeeding, Sally and I still found the one-to-one, practical, visual stuff in the NCT course massively valuable. And exploring some of the issues and difficulties with other, real people has been really important.<\/p>\n<p>I think there&#8217;s a lot to be said for personal, local knowledge. <a title=\"A Boris Bike Adventure\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2011\/09\/a-boris-bike-adventure\/\">My experience of riding in London<\/a> is testimony to this. As is <a href=\"http:\/\/cityexile.wordpress.com\/2011\/09\/25\/second-class-citizen\/\">Town Mouse&#8217;s trip through Newcastle<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Surely someone else is doing it already?<\/h4>\n<p>This is a great question &#8211; and one of mine! But I don&#8217;t think they are. Councils do personal travel planning, explaining to people their travel options. CTC have local groups, but, from what I understand, they&#8217;re mostly about social rides and for already-experienced cyclists (though I&#8217;m sure novices would be welcome too). Sustrans have rangers who look after paths, and maintain the national cycle network. And I&#8217;ve heard of Bike Buddy things where you can get someone to show you a route for your commute.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s no centrally co-ordinated, trained, recognised means of doing such a thing. Is there?! (Please comment if you know something I don&#8217;t).<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure it would be great to get CTC, Sustrans and local councils to take up this idea. But, to my knowledge, no one&#8217;s doing it yet.<\/p>\n<h4>Is it needed\/wanted?<\/h4>\n<p>Who would take up such a service? How would they find out about it? Wouldn&#8217;t people abuse it as a way to get cheap bike maintenance?<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really know the answers to these questions. It&#8217;s just an embryonic idea. It would be great to tie in to personal travel planning projects that councils might be doing and to other local cycle\/transport projects that are going on. But&#8230;hmm&#8230;needs thought.<\/p>\n<h4>What are you going to do about it.<\/h4>\n<p>Ah, it&#8217;s just a flash-in-the-pan idea. I&#8217;ll forget about it in a few days time. And besides, I&#8217;m having a baby any day now.<\/p>\n<p>I dunno. What do you think? Is there mileage in this? Or is the notion of a nationally co-ordinated team of cycling counsellors a crazy dream?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Earlier today I tweeted as follows:<\/p>\n<p>[blackbirdpie url=&#8221;https:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/magicroundabout\/status\/133945796117790720&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p>And&#8230;it turns out, several people were intrigued. \u00a0So I ought to explain myself in full.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>The National Childbirth Trust<\/h2>\n<p>Yeah, yeah, you all know, we&#8217;re having a baby (real soon!) right.<\/p>\n<p>We decided, after some good feedback from friends and family, to go on the National Childbirth Trust&#8217;s ante-natal class. \u00a0This is worthy of a post of its own, but in general was very good.<\/p>\n<p>One of the sessions was dedicated to breastfeeding. \u00a0We won&#8217;t mention the fact that I got to wear lipstick. \u00a0We WILL mention the fact that it was run by a knowledgeable woman who obviously cared greatly about the welfare of women and babies at what can be a very stressful time. \u00a0She said &#8220;if you have any problems, call me any time, we can give you help and I can come around and help you work out what&#8217;s going wrong and how you might be able to make things easier&#8221; &#8211; or words to that effect.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s true. We have her number. We can call. She will help. She reinforced the fact: &#8220;call me, I want to help&#8221;. The course tutor reinforced the fact &#8220;call her, she wants to help&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>What a fantastic service! And she, and the team of breastfeeding counsellors in Swindon (and, I believe, around the country) are 100% voluntary.<\/p>\n<h2>So What&#8217;s Breastfeeding Got To Do With Cycling?<\/h2>\n<p>I was impressed by this. Very impressed. And it got me thinking. \u00a0Here&#8217;s someone who:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>passionately believes that a particular activity is good<\/li>\n<li>understands that that activity isn&#8217;t always simple\/easy<\/li>\n<li>longs to help others take up and sustain that activity<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m like that. \u00a0I&#8217;m like that about cycling. \u00a0Many of the regular readers of this blog are like that about cycling too.<\/p>\n<p>And so I find myself thinking, what if we had &#8220;Cycling Counsellors&#8221;?<\/p>\n<p>What if there were people you could call and ask questions like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I&#8217;m thinking of buying a bike, what sort of bike should I get?<\/li>\n<li>How can I easily get from A to B on my bicycle &#8211; I don&#8217;t know the safest\/quickest way<\/li>\n<li>What simple safety checks should I do to my bike every now and then? How hard are they? Can I do them myself?<\/li>\n<li>My tyre&#8217;s flat\/chain&#8217;s come off\/handlebars wobble\/brakes aren&#8217;t very good, what should I do?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Why Not?<\/h2>\n<p>I mostly had very positive responses to this idea. I think it&#8217;s a good one. But I, myself have questions about it, and some people pointed out some useful things.<\/p>\n<h4>It&#8217;s all online!<\/h4>\n<p>There&#8217;s masses of books, internet forums, blogs, Twitter accounts, bike shops anyway. Don&#8217;t these provide that service?<\/p>\n<p>Yes, to some extent they do. And, in particular, there&#8217;s LOADS of good information online.<\/p>\n<p>But despite reading lots of books, articles, blogs, and so on, about birth, parenting, and breastfeeding, Sally and I still found the one-to-one, practical, visual stuff in the NCT course massively valuable. And exploring some of the issues and difficulties with other, real people has been really important.<\/p>\n<p>I think there&#8217;s a lot to be said for personal, local knowledge. <a title=\"A Boris Bike Adventure\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2011\/09\/a-boris-bike-adventure\/\">My experience of riding in London<\/a> is testimony to this. As is <a href=\"http:\/\/cityexile.wordpress.com\/2011\/09\/25\/second-class-citizen\/\">Town Mouse&#8217;s trip through Newcastle<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Surely someone else is doing it already?<\/h4>\n<p>This is a great question &#8211; and one of mine! But I don&#8217;t think they are. Councils do personal travel planning, explaining to people their travel options. CTC have local groups, but, from what I understand, they&#8217;re mostly about social rides and for already-experienced cyclists (though I&#8217;m sure novices would be welcome too). Sustrans have rangers who look after paths, and maintain the national cycle network. And I&#8217;ve heard of Bike Buddy things where you can get someone to show you a route for your commute.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s no centrally co-ordinated, trained, recognised means of doing such a thing. Is there?! (Please comment if you know something I don&#8217;t).<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure it would be great to get CTC, Sustrans and local councils to take up this idea. But, to my knowledge, no one&#8217;s doing it yet.<\/p>\n<h4>Is it needed\/wanted?<\/h4>\n<p>Who would take up such a service? How would they find out about it? Wouldn&#8217;t people abuse it as a way to get cheap bike maintenance?<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really know the answers to these questions. It&#8217;s just an embryonic idea. It would be great to tie in to personal travel planning projects that councils might be doing and to other local cycle\/transport projects that are going on. But&#8230;hmm&#8230;needs thought.<\/p>\n<h4>What are you going to do about it.<\/h4>\n<p>Ah, it&#8217;s just a flash-in-the-pan idea. I&#8217;ll forget about it in a few days time. And besides, I&#8217;m having a baby any day now.<\/p>\n<p>I dunno. What do you think? Is there mileage in this? Or is the notion of a nationally co-ordinated team of cycling counsellors a crazy dream?<\/p>\n",

But with good reason.<\/p>\n<p>If you follow me on Twitter or are friends on Facebook then you will know that we are now a family of three. \u00a0Our baby, Isaac, arrived on 1st December and has been our primary occupation for the last 5 weeks.<\/p>\n<p>This post is a bit of an explanation about why you&#8217;ve not &#8220;seen&#8221; much of Isaac.<\/p>\n<p><!--more-->Sally and I both use social media a lot so you may think that it would be entirely natural for us to keep some detailed online records of the pregnancy, birth (well, not the birth, but the immediate time after), and early days with our boy.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;our interest in social media actually swings us the other way. \u00a0We appreciate the highly public, potentially insecure, and increasingly commercial nature of social media and we&#8217;ve taken the line that we want Isaac to have a substantial amount of choice about what is published about him online.<\/p>\n<p>We find it embarassing enough when our parents bring out the box of baby photos. \u00a0As far as possible we don&#8217;t want Isaac to have all his embarrassing newborn and childhood days already online for the world to see.<\/p>\n<p>So, for now, we are not publicly posting lots of photos and videos of him.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a far-from-simple decision because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We&#8217;ve really enjoyed seeing the children of friends and family of ours grow up through photos and videos, mostly posted on Facebook.<\/li>\n<li>We&#8217;re really very proud of our little boy, he&#8217;s a very cute little kid, and we love showing him off.<\/li>\n<li>We have made some really good friends that we mostly interact with through the medium of social media.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But we also have other friends who&#8217;ve taken the more private route and I don&#8217;t find we miss what isn&#8217;t there.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not entirely the end of the decision though. \u00a0We value technology and its ability to store and present information. \u00a0So we do have a private space online for close friends and family to keep up to date with Isaac&#8217;s latest news and photos.<\/p>\n<p>If you know us well then there are other ways in which you will get to see Isaac as he grows up, if not in person (which, I can tell you, is by FAR the best way).<\/p>\n<p>If you REALLY want to see some photos then drop me a line and we&#8217;ll see if we can send some by more private means.<\/p>\n<p>Or, just take my word for it. He&#8217;s an amazing little man with a face from Sally&#8217;s side of the family and Ross&#8217; big hands and feet. \u00a0He has lots of funny facial expressions and a growing vocabulary of little noises.<\/p>\n<p>And we love him to bits.<\/p>\n",

But with good reason.<\/p>\n<p>If you follow me on Twitter or are friends on Facebook then you will know that we are now a family of three. \u00a0Our baby, Isaac, arrived on 1st December and has been our primary occupation for the last 5 weeks.<\/p>\n<p>This post is a bit of an explanation about why you&#8217;ve not &#8220;seen&#8221; much of Isaac.<\/p>\n<p><!--more-->Sally and I both use social media a lot so you may think that it would be entirely natural for us to keep some detailed online records of the pregnancy, birth (well, not the birth, but the immediate time after), and early days with our boy.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;our interest in social media actually swings us the other way. \u00a0We appreciate the highly public, potentially insecure, and increasingly commercial nature of social media and we&#8217;ve taken the line that we want Isaac to have a substantial amount of choice about what is published about him online.<\/p>\n<p>We find it embarassing enough when our parents bring out the box of baby photos. \u00a0As far as possible we don&#8217;t want Isaac to have all his embarrassing newborn and childhood days already online for the world to see.<\/p>\n<p>So, for now, we are not publicly posting lots of photos and videos of him.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a far-from-simple decision because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We&#8217;ve really enjoyed seeing the children of friends and family of ours grow up through photos and videos, mostly posted on Facebook.<\/li>\n<li>We&#8217;re really very proud of our little boy, he&#8217;s a very cute little kid, and we love showing him off.<\/li>\n<li>We have made some really good friends that we mostly interact with through the medium of social media.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But we also have other friends who&#8217;ve taken the more private route and I don&#8217;t find we miss what isn&#8217;t there.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not entirely the end of the decision though. \u00a0We value technology and its ability to store and present information. \u00a0So we do have a private space online for close friends and family to keep up to date with Isaac&#8217;s latest news and photos.<\/p>\n<p>If you know us well then there are other ways in which you will get to see Isaac as he grows up, if not in person (which, I can tell you, is by FAR the best way).<\/p>\n<p>If you REALLY want to see some photos then drop me a line and we&#8217;ll see if we can send some by more private means.<\/p>\n<p>Or, just take my word for it. He&#8217;s an amazing little man with a face from Sally&#8217;s side of the family and Ross&#8217; big hands and feet. \u00a0He has lots of funny facial expressions and a growing vocabulary of little noises.<\/p>\n<p>And we love him to bits.<\/p>\n",

So Amy asked if Sally could knit a hat for Charlie.<\/p>\n<p>But Sally is mum to our 8-week-old son, and barely has time to make a cup of tea, let alone knit. \u00a0It&#8217;s very much life-one-handed here at the moment!<\/p>\n<p>So, I put a call out on Twitter. \u00a0I have a few creative followers and was pretty sure someone would be up to the challenge.<\/p>\n<p>The response was amazing! I mean, I know things have gone way more viral, but I had a mass of re-tweets, new followers, and, of course, offers of hand-knitted hats. \u00a0The first within about two minutes from the generous and creative Jennifer Begg (<a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/livefreerange\">@livefreerange<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>The internet is AMAZING!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>So&#8230;after much deliberation, and with a hint of guilt, we put a deposit on a new car today.<\/p>\n<p>It was not a quick or easy decision, but our old car is fast approaching 100&#8217;000 miles, is slowly generating a few faults, and with the arrival of Isaac, is just too small &#8211; once the buggy base is in the back of our current car there&#8217;s not room for much else.  We&#8217;re increasingly making trips to see the in-laws down in Devon, and increasingly wanting to offer lifts to other people, sometimes other families who don&#8217;t have cars, so wanting a new car wasn&#8217;t just about us &#8211; it&#8217;s about family and friends too.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Yes, I&#8217;m into using cycling as transport, but I&#8217;m not totally anti-car. Cars have their place. But they should be viewed as a convenience and a privilege, not as a human right.<\/p>\n<p>So we went looking. I suppose I wanted something between a small car and a people carrier, but wasn&#8217;t sure if any such thing existed. It turns out there&#8217;s a whole world of &#8216;midi-MPV&#8217;s that are just what I was after.<\/p>\n<p>The first one we found was a Toyota Corolla Verso. We were immediately impressed with the space and versatility. Some Internet research showed Toyotas to be reliable and easy to drive, and the Verso to be spoken of very positively &#8211; if with a modicum of disdain for its lack of &#8216;fun&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>The reviews also seemed to imply that the diesel has more like the level of get up and go that a car of this size needs.<\/p>\n<p>We were liked this car from the outset.  And we got a very positive impression from the reviews of this vehicle than we got from the reviews of Peugeots and Renaults we saw when looking for a small car a few years ago.<\/p>\n<p>Aside: My favourite review of the Verso said:<br \/>\n&#8211; What does the car make the neighbours think? : &#8216;That my wife is a childminder&#8217;<br \/>\n&#8211; Why did you buy this car? : &#8216;Because my wife is a childminder&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>We had a choice of three. One we weren&#8217;t interested in as it had some visible trim damage and higher mileage. Which left us with a 2.0 diesel &#8211; the slightly cheaper of the two and the more efficient car, but older and with twice as many miles on the clock. And a 1.8 petrol, 2008 model with 30,000 miles. It&#8217;s less efficient but cheaper to insure.<\/p>\n<p>The diesel sold before we got to make a purchase so we were left with the &#8217;08 petrol.<\/p>\n<p>A quick spin put any fears of it not having enough &#8216;oomph&#8217; to rest.  It&#8217;s quite nippy, at least when empty.<\/p>\n<p>We did some other shopping around too, but it was fruitless. This car was ideal and appeared to be a bargain.<\/p>\n<p>I w shocked that our old Peugeot was only valued for trade-in at \u00a3200. As I said at the time &#8216;it&#8217;s got \u00a3200 worth of tyres on it!&#8217;, but it&#8217;ll be convenient not to have to make the sale privately, and they gave us a bigger valuation in the end.<\/p>\n<p>So, the deal is done. We pick up on Friday, and will officially own a 5+2 sweater family car.  It&#8217;s a bit more than we set out to pay, but the car&#8217;s age and mileage and versatility means it will last us, hopefully, many years.<\/p>\n<p>Have my cyclist credentials been ruined? Have I self-justified this purchase enough? Or is it just amazing what having a baby does to you?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>So&#8230;after much deliberation, and with a hint of guilt, we put a deposit on a new car today.<\/p>\n<p>It was not a quick or easy decision, but our old car is fast approaching 100&#8217;000 miles, is slowly generating a few faults, and with the arrival of Isaac, is just too small &#8211; once the buggy base is in the back of our current car there&#8217;s not room for much else.  We&#8217;re increasingly making trips to see the in-laws down in Devon, and increasingly wanting to offer lifts to other people, sometimes other families who don&#8217;t have cars, so wanting a new car wasn&#8217;t just about us &#8211; it&#8217;s about family and friends too.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Yes, I&#8217;m into using cycling as transport, but I&#8217;m not totally anti-car. Cars have their place. But they should be viewed as a convenience and a privilege, not as a human right.<\/p>\n<p>So we went looking. I suppose I wanted something between a small car and a people carrier, but wasn&#8217;t sure if any such thing existed. It turns out there&#8217;s a whole world of &#8216;midi-MPV&#8217;s that are just what I was after.<\/p>\n<p>The first one we found was a Toyota Corolla Verso. We were immediately impressed with the space and versatility. Some Internet research showed Toyotas to be reliable and easy to drive, and the Verso to be spoken of very positively &#8211; if with a modicum of disdain for its lack of &#8216;fun&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>The reviews also seemed to imply that the diesel has more like the level of get up and go that a car of this size needs.<\/p>\n<p>We were liked this car from the outset.  And we got a very positive impression from the reviews of this vehicle than we got from the reviews of Peugeots and Renaults we saw when looking for a small car a few years ago.<\/p>\n<p>Aside: My favourite review of the Verso said:<br \/>\n&#8211; What does the car make the neighbours think? : &#8216;That my wife is a childminder&#8217;<br \/>\n&#8211; Why did you buy this car? : &#8216;Because my wife is a childminder&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>We had a choice of three. One we weren&#8217;t interested in as it had some visible trim damage and higher mileage. Which left us with a 2.0 diesel &#8211; the slightly cheaper of the two and the more efficient car, but older and with twice as many miles on the clock. And a 1.8 petrol, 2008 model with 30,000 miles. It&#8217;s less efficient but cheaper to insure.<\/p>\n<p>The diesel sold before we got to make a purchase so we were left with the &#8217;08 petrol.<\/p>\n<p>A quick spin put any fears of it not having enough &#8216;oomph&#8217; to rest.  It&#8217;s quite nippy, at least when empty.<\/p>\n<p>We did some other shopping around too, but it was fruitless. This car was ideal and appeared to be a bargain.<\/p>\n<p>I w shocked that our old Peugeot was only valued for trade-in at \u00a3200. As I said at the time &#8216;it&#8217;s got \u00a3200 worth of tyres on it!&#8217;, but it&#8217;ll be convenient not to have to make the sale privately, and they gave us a bigger valuation in the end.<\/p>\n<p>So, the deal is done. We pick up on Friday, and will officially own a 5+2 sweater family car.  It&#8217;s a bit more than we set out to pay, but the car&#8217;s age and mileage and versatility means it will last us, hopefully, many years.<\/p>\n<p>Have my cyclist credentials been ruined? Have I self-justified this purchase enough? Or is it just amazing what having a baby does to you?<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s funny how, as a newbie parent myself, it&#8217;s so tempting to offer advice. I also had a conversation this week with someone else who was talking about the dilemma of offering this kind of &#8216;help&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>And the longer I am a parent, the more I believe that the best advice is not advice at all, its almost anti-advice.<\/p>\n<p>So I present the sum of my parenting knowledge:<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlearn <strong>everything<\/strong>. Be prepared to change all that you know or have been told<\/li>\n<li>You already know more than everyone else about your baby. People offer advice. Weigh it. Add your own thoughts and experience. And then make your own decision.<\/li>\n<li>Trust your instinct. Again, you know your baby better than anyone else. You&#8217;ll know when something is wrong, and when something is right.<\/li>\n<li>It does get better. Not at any particular point in time. People will say it gets better after 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, or any other specific time in the future. The truth is simply that &#8216;it will get better&#8217;.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s flippin hard work. Seriously. If someone tells you it&#8217;s hard work, think what that might be like and treble it&#8230;at least!<\/li>\n<li>Every baby is different. So you can generally ignore anyone that tells you what their baby was like.<\/li>\n<li>Every parent is different. So you can generally ignore anyone that gives you advice because you&#8217;ll do it your own way anyway.<\/li>\n<li>It is the most amazing thing. Caring for a tiny little person that you made. Introducing them to the world. Introducing the world to them. Staring at their hands thinking &#8216;I wonder what they&#8217;ll do&#8217; and at their feet and thinking &#8216;I wonder where they will walk&#8217;. It&#8217;s just incredible. The potential for life, love, work, joy, hope, kindness and so many other things wrapped up in a little person is overwhelming at times.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Maybe it doesn&#8217;t sound like it, but I&#8217;m actually HUGELY grateful to everyone that&#8217;s offered us help, advice, encouragement and prayer in our first few months with Isaac. But the truth is, we&#8217;ve listened to and, I hope, respected everyone&#8217;s opinions, and we&#8217;re doing things our own way.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m now about to give in to temptation and actually offer one concrete piece of advice myself. It&#8217;s not about feeding, nappies, which buggy to get, or how to get your baby to sleep. No. It&#8217;s this thing that people kept telling me early on which I initially found hard to believe but now hold firm to:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Treasure every moment!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Isaac no longer smells of baby. I miss that.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t need cuddling to sleep as much. I miss that. It used to be so annoying that he&#8217;d only drift off in our arms. Nowadays, I look for times when I can get to hold him for half an hour or so.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t mimic us any more. I miss that. For a few weeks he tried to copy the sounds that we were making. Now he just makes whatever sounds he wants to regardless of what were babbling at him.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t fit in his baby clothes. He&#8217;s in 6-9 months sizes now. He had some nice outfits. We miss that.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t poo as often. Bizarrely&#8230;I miss that! Change time used to mostly be a fun time. Now it&#8217;s infrequent and a chore.<\/p>\n<p>So many things Isaac did, or that we did with him, have already changed or gone. If you have a young baby, (s)he will be different by this time next week. Enjoy what they&#8217;re like now, even if it&#8217;s difficult and stressful, because they won&#8217;t be like it again.<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s funny how, as a newbie parent myself, it&#8217;s so tempting to offer advice. I also had a conversation this week with someone else who was talking about the dilemma of offering this kind of &#8216;help&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>And the longer I am a parent, the more I believe that the best advice is not advice at all, its almost anti-advice.<\/p>\n<p>So I present the sum of my parenting knowledge:<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlearn <strong>everything<\/strong>. Be prepared to change all that you know or have been told<\/li>\n<li>You already know more than everyone else about your baby. People offer advice. Weigh it. Add your own thoughts and experience. And then make your own decision.<\/li>\n<li>Trust your instinct. Again, you know your baby better than anyone else. You&#8217;ll know when something is wrong, and when something is right.<\/li>\n<li>It does get better. Not at any particular point in time. People will say it gets better after 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, or any other specific time in the future. The truth is simply that &#8216;it will get better&#8217;.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s flippin hard work. Seriously. If someone tells you it&#8217;s hard work, think what that might be like and treble it&#8230;at least!<\/li>\n<li>Every baby is different. So you can generally ignore anyone that tells you what their baby was like.<\/li>\n<li>Every parent is different. So you can generally ignore anyone that gives you advice because you&#8217;ll do it your own way anyway.<\/li>\n<li>It is the most amazing thing. Caring for a tiny little person that you made. Introducing them to the world. Introducing the world to them. Staring at their hands thinking &#8216;I wonder what they&#8217;ll do&#8217; and at their feet and thinking &#8216;I wonder where they will walk&#8217;. It&#8217;s just incredible. The potential for life, love, work, joy, hope, kindness and so many other things wrapped up in a little person is overwhelming at times.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Maybe it doesn&#8217;t sound like it, but I&#8217;m actually HUGELY grateful to everyone that&#8217;s offered us help, advice, encouragement and prayer in our first few months with Isaac. But the truth is, we&#8217;ve listened to and, I hope, respected everyone&#8217;s opinions, and we&#8217;re doing things our own way.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m now about to give in to temptation and actually offer one concrete piece of advice myself. It&#8217;s not about feeding, nappies, which buggy to get, or how to get your baby to sleep. No. It&#8217;s this thing that people kept telling me early on which I initially found hard to believe but now hold firm to:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Treasure every moment!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Isaac no longer smells of baby. I miss that.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t need cuddling to sleep as much. I miss that. It used to be so annoying that he&#8217;d only drift off in our arms. Nowadays, I look for times when I can get to hold him for half an hour or so.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t mimic us any more. I miss that. For a few weeks he tried to copy the sounds that we were making. Now he just makes whatever sounds he wants to regardless of what were babbling at him.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t fit in his baby clothes. He&#8217;s in 6-9 months sizes now. He had some nice outfits. We miss that.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t poo as often. Bizarrely&#8230;I miss that! Change time used to mostly be a fun time. Now it&#8217;s infrequent and a chore.<\/p>\n<p>So many things Isaac did, or that we did with him, have already changed or gone. If you have a young baby, (s)he will be different by this time next week. Enjoy what they&#8217;re like now, even if it&#8217;s difficult and stressful, because they won&#8217;t be like it again.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m blowing my own trumpet slightly, for which I hope you&#8217;ll forgive me, but I hope I make a point too.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Last week I was out cycling and I saw a guy pull up at the side of a dual carriageway and get out of his car. I stopped and asked if he was OK. He&#8217;d run out of fuel. He proceeded to open his boot and take out a plastic petrol can.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>I had a bit of time so I offered to cycle off and get him some fuel, the nearest petrol station being about 2 miles away.  He asked if I was sure and I said I&#8217;d be much quicker than him and could use the exercise. He passed me some cash and told me to fill the can.<\/p>\n<p>Queuing to buy petrol on a bike was a strange experience, but I got him his fuel and cycled back. I felt good. He felt good. And I&#8217;m sure a few people in the petrol queue got a smile out of it too. We don&#8217;t need to be the guy in the picture at the top. Much as cyclists dislike them sometimes, we can be drivers&#8217; friends and it will help bring peace and understanding to our roads.<\/p>\n",

He proceeded to open his boot and take out a plastic petrol can.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>I had a bit of time so I offered to cycle off and get him some fuel, the nearest petrol station being about 2 miles away.  He asked if I was sure and I said I&#8217;d be much quicker than him and could use the exercise. He passed me some cash and told me to fill the can.<\/p>\n<p>Queuing to buy petrol on a bike was a strange experience, but I got him his fuel and cycled back. I felt good. He felt good. And I&#8217;m sure a few people in the petrol queue got a smile out of it too. We don&#8217;t need to be the guy in the picture at the top. Much as cyclists dislike them sometimes, we can be drivers&#8217; friends and it will help bring peace and understanding to our roads.<\/p>\n",

Sorry. Time for a post though!<\/p>\n<p>The Wintle household has gotten increasingly grumpy as the effects of small-child-related sleep deprivation have kicked in. We&#8217;re normally pretty peaceful, happy folk, but Isaac really doesn&#8217;t sleep well and it&#8217;s taking its toll.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been grateful to those who have kept me looking on the sunny side. \u00a0In particular I&#8217;ve been enjoying <a title=\"Jennifer Begg - Live Free Range on Twiter\" href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/livefreerange\">Jennifer Begg&#8217;s<\/a> &#8220;Feel Good Friday&#8221; blogs (see &#8220;<a title=\"We Could Be Heros - Live Free Range\" href=\"http:\/\/livefreerange.com\/2012\/06\/14\/we-could-be-heroes\/\">We could be heros<\/a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a title=\"If Nothing We Do Matters - Live Free Range\" href=\"http:\/\/livefreerange.com\/2012\/06\/08\/if-nothing-we-do-matters\/\">If Nothing We Do Matters<\/a>&#8220;). And last night I came across <a title=\"Stuart Witts on Twitter\" href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/stuartwitts\">Stuart Witts<\/a>\u00a0whose\u00a0<a title=\"Stay Happy and Don't Die\" href=\"http:\/\/stayhappyanddontdie.com\">Stay Happy and Don&#8217;t Die<\/a> blog brought a smile to my face yesterday.<\/p>\n<p>I love my Twitters followees, and they constantly challenge me in numerous ways to be a better person. Today, I&#8217;m challenged to be more positive. Again.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright  wp-image-1298\" title=\"Ross in a Woolly Hat\" alt=\"Ross in a Woolly Hat\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small-300x199.jpg\" width=\"210\" height=\"139\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small-150x99.jpg 150w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" \/><\/a>I particularly like Stuarts <a title=\"Only in the leap from the Lion\u2019s head will he prove his worth\u2026 #lovemyhat  - Stay Happy and Don't Die\" href=\"http:\/\/stayhappyanddontdie.com\/?p=756\">#lovemyhat<\/a> project. A somewhat silly, very fun, pleasingly creative and highly positive month of millinery &#8211; like Movember for headgear. (I hope he doesn&#8217;t mind me thinking it was &#8216;somewhat silly&#8217; and I fully appreciate the seriousness of hat wearing &#8211; check out my Twitter profile pic on the right if you don&#8217;t believe me!)<\/p>\n<p>And that got me thinking&#8230;what silly little creative, fun project might I do? What are the fun little things in my life? Those things that are almost-trivial, possibly slightly embarassing, but that always make you &#8211; and others around you &#8211; happy?<\/p>\n<p>I think that play is massively important, not just to children, but to adults too. I&#8217;m reminded of the Museum of Childhood posters that I saw on <a title=\"Don't Forget Your Inner Child - Creative Review\" href=\"http:\/\/www.creativereview.co.uk\/cr-blog\/2008\/december\/dont-forget-your-inner-child\">Creative Review<\/a>, one of which is shown above. I&#8217;m reminded that play is a blessing. It gets you to let your guard down, open up, show the world &#8211; and sometimes yourself &#8211; a side that they wouldn&#8217;t normally see.<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;and this may not be for everyone&#8230;I was wondering if we might share how we play. \u00a0What silly things do you to to cheer yourself up. Are you a grown man that has a Scalextric in the loft? Is there a book, or toy that always makes you smile? Or a guilty-pleasure of a hobby? Perhaps you climb trees?\u00a0Or maybe you just go outside at night and gaze in wonder at the stars?<\/p>\n<p>I have lots of things that I class as play that bring joy. I can juggle (5 balls &#8211; 3 clubs &#8211; 1 devil stick) and do balloon modelling. I used to write really stupid poetry, and memorize the silly poems of others. \u00a0I love kids books &#8211; I have a complete Mr Men collection, but Roald Dahl, Dr Seuss and The Little Prince are favourites too. And I love to sit and play guitar &#8211; I&#8217;m not much good, but it&#8217;s such a great way of winding down and chilling out.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I have other forms of play that I&#8217;ll think of. But that will do for now. Perhaps I should pick up and blog about one of those things some day?<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t expect everyone to let their guard down and post a comment about how they play. But please stop and think&#8230;perhaps, like me, you&#8217;ve forgotten the little, simple things that make you smile. Go find those things and do those things. And I hope that a few might be willing to share too&#8230;what&#8217;s your inner child like? How do you play?<\/p>\n",

Sorry. Time for a post though!<\/p>\n<p>The Wintle household has gotten increasingly grumpy as the effects of small-child-related sleep deprivation have kicked in. We&#8217;re normally pretty peaceful, happy folk, but Isaac really doesn&#8217;t sleep well and it&#8217;s taking its toll.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been grateful to those who have kept me looking on the sunny side. \u00a0In particular I&#8217;ve been enjoying <a title=\"Jennifer Begg - Live Free Range on Twiter\" href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/livefreerange\">Jennifer Begg&#8217;s<\/a> &#8220;Feel Good Friday&#8221; blogs (see &#8220;<a title=\"We Could Be Heros - Live Free Range\" href=\"http:\/\/livefreerange.com\/2012\/06\/14\/we-could-be-heroes\/\">We could be heros<\/a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a title=\"If Nothing We Do Matters - Live Free Range\" href=\"http:\/\/livefreerange.com\/2012\/06\/08\/if-nothing-we-do-matters\/\">If Nothing We Do Matters<\/a>&#8220;). And last night I came across <a title=\"Stuart Witts on Twitter\" href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/stuartwitts\">Stuart Witts<\/a>\u00a0whose\u00a0<a title=\"Stay Happy and Don't Die\" href=\"http:\/\/stayhappyanddontdie.com\">Stay Happy and Don&#8217;t Die<\/a> blog brought a smile to my face yesterday.<\/p>\n<p>I love my Twitters followees, and they constantly challenge me in numerous ways to be a better person. Today, I&#8217;m challenged to be more positive. Again.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright  wp-image-1298\" title=\"Ross in a Woolly Hat\" alt=\"Ross in a Woolly Hat\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small-300x199.jpg\" width=\"210\" height=\"139\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small-150x99.jpg 150w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" \/><\/a>I particularly like Stuarts <a title=\"Only in the leap from the Lion\u2019s head will he prove his worth\u2026 #lovemyhat  - Stay Happy and Don't Die\" href=\"http:\/\/stayhappyanddontdie.com\/?p=756\">#lovemyhat<\/a> project. A somewhat silly, very fun, pleasingly creative and highly positive month of millinery &#8211; like Movember for headgear. (I hope he doesn&#8217;t mind me thinking it was &#8216;somewhat silly&#8217; and I fully appreciate the seriousness of hat wearing &#8211; check out my Twitter profile pic on the right if you don&#8217;t believe me!)<\/p>\n<p>And that got me thinking&#8230;what silly little creative, fun project might I do? What are the fun little things in my life? Those things that are almost-trivial, possibly slightly embarassing, but that always make you &#8211; and others around you &#8211; happy?<\/p>\n<p>I think that play is massively important, not just to children, but to adults too. I&#8217;m reminded of the Museum of Childhood posters that I saw on <a title=\"Don't Forget Your Inner Child - Creative Review\" href=\"http:\/\/www.creativereview.co.uk\/cr-blog\/2008\/december\/dont-forget-your-inner-child\">Creative Review<\/a>, one of which is shown above. I&#8217;m reminded that play is a blessing. It gets you to let your guard down, open up, show the world &#8211; and sometimes yourself &#8211; a side that they wouldn&#8217;t normally see.<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;and this may not be for everyone&#8230;I was wondering if we might share how we play. \u00a0What silly things do you to to cheer yourself up. Are you a grown man that has a Scalextric in the loft? Is there a book, or toy that always makes you smile? Or a guilty-pleasure of a hobby? Perhaps you climb trees?\u00a0Or maybe you just go outside at night and gaze in wonder at the stars?<\/p>\n<p>I have lots of things that I class as play that bring joy. I can juggle (5 balls &#8211; 3 clubs &#8211; 1 devil stick) and do balloon modelling. I used to write really stupid poetry, and memorize the silly poems of others. \u00a0I love kids books &#8211; I have a complete Mr Men collection, but Roald Dahl, Dr Seuss and The Little Prince are favourites too. And I love to sit and play guitar &#8211; I&#8217;m not much good, but it&#8217;s such a great way of winding down and chilling out.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I have other forms of play that I&#8217;ll think of. But that will do for now. Perhaps I should pick up and blog about one of those things some day?<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t expect everyone to let their guard down and post a comment about how they play. But please stop and think&#8230;perhaps, like me, you&#8217;ve forgotten the little, simple things that make you smile. Go find those things and do those things. And I hope that a few might be willing to share too&#8230;what&#8217;s your inner child like? How do you play?<\/p>\n",

Much as Twitter&#8217;s character limit made people creative with how they expressed themselves, we believe Spongify will help you keep your messages short and beautiful, poetic and sublime.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here&#8217;s an example conversation to show you how it works:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/IMG_0207.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1316 aligncenter\" title=\"Spongify Beard\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/IMG_0207-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"Beard (Spongify)\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/IMG_0207-300x224.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/IMG_0207-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/IMG_0207-150x112.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/IMG_0203.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1317\" title=\"Spongify Hint Taken\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/IMG_0203-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"Hint Taken (Spongify)\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/IMG_0203-300x224.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/IMG_0203-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/IMG_0203-150x112.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/IMG_0208.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1315\" title=\"Spongify Lol\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/IMG_0208-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"Lol (Spongify)\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/IMG_0208-300x224.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/IMG_0208-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/IMG_0208-150x112.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Spongify is a distributed system, which means, you&#8217;ll need your own bathroom and set of letters to run it.

                "rendered": "<p>A while ago I quit the commercial IT world to work as a freelance web developer. There were many aspect to this decision, but one of the big ones was frustration with the software that I had to use.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to blog about this for ages, then tonight, <a title=\"Elliott Richmond on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elliottrichmond\">Elliott Richmond<\/a> tweeted a link to <a title=\"Open Source vs Proprietary Software - SquareOne MD\" href=\"http:\/\/www.squareonemd.co.uk\/open-source-vs-proprietary-software\/\">a post he&#8217;d written about Open Source vs Proprietary software<\/a>, and I took it as an excuse to get my thoughts down. Those thoughts are collected here in a slightly edited copy of my comment on Elliott&#8217;s post.<\/p>\n<p>Elliott&#8217;s post is more about the topic in the context of website publishing and content management systems. my views are probably more about commercial software in general.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure if this belongs on my personal or work blogs. Lets start with it on the personal and see how it goes:<\/p>\n<p>I left a well paid job in the It department of a telecoms company to take the less-well-paid and less-secure (possibly) freelance developer route.<\/p>\n<p>One of the main things that frustrated me about the big-corporate world was their insistence on using COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) software from big vendors. I was mostly using a product set from a very large, multi-national software supplier. Very much closed-source. And it was a nightmare.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It was expensive: initial licensing costs, ongoing support and maintenance costs, were both huge 6-figure sums.<\/li>\n<li>It was badly supported. Sometimes even getting the support team to acknowledge an issue was difficult. When they did, actually getting to deal with someone like a developer who understood what the product was doing was nigh-on impossible.<\/li>\n<li>It was badly written. Even basic defensive coding techniques were not employed. Things would break with no error, no log file message. I remember one particular Windows-based tool that crashed if you ran it as a different user to the one you installed it as. Shocking. No error message. No log. No test for the error and gracefully exit.<\/li>\n<li>Development\/release cycles were long. Aside from the fact that bug reports and enhancement requests were rarely actioned\/implemented, when they were, they were part of a three-month or six-month release cycle. No quick fixes!<\/li>\n<li>Development was mostly by acquisition. The product life cycle seemed to be: produce product roadmap, see useful features in competitors product, acquire competitor, declare competitors tool\/technology as &#8216;the next big thing&#8217;, scrap old product, goto 10 (if you know what I mean). Features promised on the roadmap (which we inevitably promised on to our clients) never appeared as the future was constantly being re-written.<\/li>\n<li>Products tried to be all things to all men &#8211; ended up doing nothing well.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>As a third-line support engineer trying to provide high-quality, high-value services to large corporate customers with huge wallets, it was incredibly frustrating having my hands tied by these constraints imposed upon me, despite paying exorbitant amounts for the pleasure. Telling a client &#8216;yes, I know it&#8217;s broken, it might be fixed sometime, it might never be fixed&#8217; was simply not acceptable.<\/p>\n<p>With OpenSource I see a bug, I investigate a bug, I fix a bug (note: I already have the fix at this point!), I submit a patch, usually released within weeks. Heck, even support is better. I use a premium forms plugin. I had a problem with something I was doing. It was investigated and fixed &#8211; with an updated, patched version of the plugin, within 48 hours. This in a product I paid a three-figure sum for.<\/p>\n<p>I think the key difference isn&#8217;t openness, documentation, flexibility, or cost. It&#8217;s that people who write OpenSource software give a damn. They care. The make things out of love for their trade.<\/p>\n<p>This is not true of all Open Source software: some people write stuff, release stuff, and then never update it. And I&#8217;m sure my experience of COTS isn&#8217;t universal.<\/p>\n<p>In contrats, COTS suppliers are in a race to the bottom: lower support and development costs, and increased profit. Support and development are just processes that employees follow as they resolve as many tickets as possible within SLA and cross tasks off a todo list. They&#8217;re just pawns in a game designed not to produce good software, but to put cash in shareholder&#8217;s pockets.<\/p>\n<p>Rant over. For me open-source wins.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>A while ago I quit the commercial IT world to work as a freelance web developer. There were many aspect to this decision, but one of the big ones was frustration with the software that I had to use.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to blog about this for ages, then tonight, <a title=\"Elliott Richmond on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elliottrichmond\">Elliott Richmond<\/a> tweeted a link to <a title=\"Open Source vs Proprietary Software - SquareOne MD\" href=\"http:\/\/www.squareonemd.co.uk\/open-source-vs-proprietary-software\/\">a post he&#8217;d written about Open Source vs Proprietary software<\/a>, and I took it as an excuse to get my thoughts down. Those thoughts are collected here in a slightly edited copy of my comment on Elliott&#8217;s post.<\/p>\n<p>Elliott&#8217;s post is more about the topic in the context of website publishing and content management systems. my views are probably more about commercial software in general.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure if this belongs on my personal or work blogs. Lets start with it on the personal and see how it goes:<\/p>\n<p>I left a well paid job in the It department of a telecoms company to take the less-well-paid and less-secure (possibly) freelance developer route.<\/p>\n<p>One of the main things that frustrated me about the big-corporate world was their insistence on using COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) software from big vendors. I was mostly using a product set from a very large, multi-national software supplier. Very much closed-source. And it was a nightmare.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It was expensive: initial licensing costs, ongoing support and maintenance costs, were both huge 6-figure sums.<\/li>\n<li>It was badly supported. Sometimes even getting the support team to acknowledge an issue was difficult. When they did, actually getting to deal with someone like a developer who understood what the product was doing was nigh-on impossible.<\/li>\n<li>It was badly written. Even basic defensive coding techniques were not employed. Things would break with no error, no log file message. I remember one particular Windows-based tool that crashed if you ran it as a different user to the one you installed it as. Shocking. No error message. No log. No test for the error and gracefully exit.<\/li>\n<li>Development\/release cycles were long. Aside from the fact that bug reports and enhancement requests were rarely actioned\/implemented, when they were, they were part of a three-month or six-month release cycle. No quick fixes!<\/li>\n<li>Development was mostly by acquisition. The product life cycle seemed to be: produce product roadmap, see useful features in competitors product, acquire competitor, declare competitors tool\/technology as &#8216;the next big thing&#8217;, scrap old product, goto 10 (if you know what I mean). Features promised on the roadmap (which we inevitably promised on to our clients) never appeared as the future was constantly being re-written.<\/li>\n<li>Products tried to be all things to all men &#8211; ended up doing nothing well.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>As a third-line support engineer trying to provide high-quality, high-value services to large corporate customers with huge wallets, it was incredibly frustrating having my hands tied by these constraints imposed upon me, despite paying exorbitant amounts for the pleasure. Telling a client &#8216;yes, I know it&#8217;s broken, it might be fixed sometime, it might never be fixed&#8217; was simply not acceptable.<\/p>\n<p>With OpenSource I see a bug, I investigate a bug, I fix a bug (note: I already have the fix at this point!), I submit a patch, usually released within weeks. Heck, even support is better. I use a premium forms plugin. I had a problem with something I was doing. It was investigated and fixed &#8211; with an updated, patched version of the plugin, within 48 hours. This in a product I paid a three-figure sum for.<\/p>\n<p>I think the key difference isn&#8217;t openness, documentation, flexibility, or cost. It&#8217;s that people who write OpenSource software give a damn. They care. The make things out of love for their trade.<\/p>\n<p>This is not true of all Open Source software: some people write stuff, release stuff, and then never update it. And I&#8217;m sure my experience of COTS isn&#8217;t universal.<\/p>\n<p>In contrats, COTS suppliers are in a race to the bottom: lower support and development costs, and increased profit. Support and development are just processes that employees follow as they resolve as many tickets as possible within SLA and cross tasks off a todo list. They&#8217;re just pawns in a game designed not to produce good software, but to put cash in shareholder&#8217;s pockets.<\/p>\n<p>Rant over. For me open-source wins.<\/p>\n",
