Importing mail into Thunderbird from my old Outlook Express files was easy, and <a title=\"XMarks\" href=\"http:\/\/xmarks.com\" target=\"_blank\">XMarks<\/a> made synching my bookmarks a doddle.<\/p>\n<p>The only real trauma was getting iTunes to keep my library (with playlists, import dates, ratings, album art, etc) intact whilst moving, and, hopefully, not screwing up my iPod when doing a first sync. \u00a0This did happen pretty smoothly, though I&#8217;m not entirely sure how I achieved it. \u00a0I did at one point have two entries for each track, but I just deleted the new ones and convinced it the the old ones were in C:\\Users\\ rather than C:\\Documents and Settings and all seemed to be OK.<\/p>\n<h3>Overall<\/h3>\n<p>Overall, this has been a really good move, and, with all that&#8217;s going on that might need more web development and online collaboration, a timely one too.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a pretty happy, newly upgraded, Windows-7-laptop-owning geek!<\/p>\n",

Importing mail into Thunderbird from my old Outlook Express files was easy, and <a title=\"XMarks\" href=\"http:\/\/xmarks.com\" target=\"_blank\">XMarks<\/a> made synching my bookmarks a doddle.<\/p>\n<p>The only real trauma was getting iTunes to keep my library (with playlists, import dates, ratings, album art, etc) intact whilst moving, and, hopefully, not screwing up my iPod when doing a first sync. \u00a0This did happen pretty smoothly, though I&#8217;m not entirely sure how I achieved it. \u00a0I did at one point have two entries for each track, but I just deleted the new ones and convinced it the the old ones were in C:\\Users\\ rather than C:\\Documents and Settings and all seemed to be OK.<\/p>\n<h3>Overall<\/h3>\n<p>Overall, this has been a really good move, and, with all that&#8217;s going on that might need more web development and online collaboration, a timely one too.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a pretty happy, newly upgraded, Windows-7-laptop-owning geek!<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s so much easier than talking to them&#8221;, says the writer.\u00a0 &#8220;f you want to tackle the problem of kids joining gangs and carrying weapons, you should talk to those kids and find out why they do it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This reminds me of my reaction to the falling of the twin towers on 11th September 2001 &#8211; &#8220;Why?\u00a0 Why would someone do that to us?\u00a0 What must they think of us to want to do that and how canwe repair that relationship?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Jesus &#8211; the guy who lived over 2000 years ago that I attempt to follow in the footsteps of as part of my Christian faith &#8211; sets a great example to us.\u00a0 He didn&#8217;t sit with the leaders, the learned people, the priests and politicians of the day, discussing how to tackle societies ills. No.\u00a0 He got out there and spoke to people, asked them what they wanted, and tried to meet their needs.<\/p>\n<p>Our politicians seem to see youths and those who behave anti-socially as a problem that needs to be solved, so they sit around and talk about the people and work out what they can do to solve this problem.<\/p>\n<p>But, as the expenses scandal of 2009 showed, most MP&#8217;s have absolutely no concept of what it&#8217;s like to be poor, and they have no empathy with the poor.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus understood because he lived in amongst the poor and oppressed.\u00a0 We should do the same!\u00a0 Though, as the article says &#8220;Of course, this is terrifying&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>There are far too few articles in the press that speak with a rational voice about addressing the problems of society in the UK by actually trying to understand the source of those problems, rather than trying to tackle the symptoms.\u00a0 This is one of them.\u00a0 It is a rare jewel and I mark it here with a strong encouragement to read it carefully and give thought to its message.<\/p>\n",

No.\u00a0 He got out there and spoke to people, asked them what they wanted, and tried to meet their needs.<\/p>\n<p>Our politicians seem to see youths and those who behave anti-socially as a problem that needs to be solved, so they sit around and talk about the people and work out what they can do to solve this problem.<\/p>\n<p>But, as the expenses scandal of 2009 showed, most MP&#8217;s have absolutely no concept of what it&#8217;s like to be poor, and they have no empathy with the poor.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus understood because he lived in amongst the poor and oppressed.\u00a0 We should do the same!\u00a0 Though, as the article says &#8220;Of course, this is terrifying&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>There are far too few articles in the press that speak with a rational voice about addressing the problems of society in the UK by actually trying to understand the source of those problems, rather than trying to tackle the symptoms.\u00a0 This is one of them.\u00a0 It is a rare jewel and I mark it here with a strong encouragement to read it carefully and give thought to its message.<\/p>\n",

I had a lot of work done on them to straighten them out when I was younger and I&#8217;ve managed to take good care of them since, and so I don&#8217;t often go to see the dentist and, until a couple of weeks ago, had had no fillings as an adult.<\/p>\n<p>But when a bit of one of my lower front teeth just feel out while I was sat watching TV, I decided it might be worth a visit.<\/p>\n<p><!--more-->A short time later I was lighter of pocket, but plus a white filling, after a relatively painless 10 minutes in the chair.<\/p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t feel too comfortable, and I was surprised at how sensitive the nerves of the mouth are &#8211; a tiny blob of filling felt like a huge alien residing on the back of my incisor.\u00a0 From the word go I was never really convinced that it had been done well, but I&#8217;d not had a filling before, so I was willing to accept it and &#8220;get used to it&#8221; as people kept telling me.<\/p>\n<p>I was proved right when, during the weekend after Christmas, it fell out while I was brushing, taking some more tooth with it.<\/p>\n<p>Question is, do I go back to the same guy and get another potentially bad job done?\u00a0 Or shall I find someone better?\u00a0 And can I get a refund on a dodgy filling?<\/p>\n",

I know I claim to be an all weather cyclist, but it&#8217;s true that neither of my two bikes are really up to travel on ice and snow.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, this is the perfect reason to claim to need a new bike!<\/p>\n<p>When temperatures first plummeted and before the snow and ice came, I did head out on Fuzzy to go to work one morning, only to find that the pedals spun freely in both directions. This is not normal and prevents the main function of the bicycle: forward propulsion.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>I got to work using alternative means, and popped out at lunchtime to get the wheel checked.  I&#8217;d had problems with the rear hub recently&#8230;maybe it had finally failed.<\/p>\n<p>The first shop (my new favourite The Big Adventure Store) realised it was a Felt-branded hub and suggested that I go to a Felt dealer as they&#8217;ll be able to get parts. So I crossed town to Swindon Cycles.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, the problem seemed to have fixed itself.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Aha&#8221;, the Swindon Cycles man said, &#8220;it&#8217;s the cold!  We&#8217;ve already had one of these today.  Do you keep it outside?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Apparently the ratchet in the freewheel can freeze so that the &#8220;pawl&#8221; (the sprung part that catches) is stuck in place.  This either results in no ability to coast\/freewheel (pawl frozen when stuck out) or no ability to pedal (pawl frozen when retracted in).  And, I&#8217;m told, this can happen when water has got inside the freewheel mechanism.<\/p>\n<p>To be honest, the weather&#8217;s been crappy for months now.  Fuzzy has been a true workhorse getting me around in all conditions (bar snow and ice of course) staying parked up out in the rain all day and rarely being cleaned or maintained. It&#8217;s not surprising he&#8217;s a little under the weather.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had the hub cleaned and regressed so hopefully that will help.  In the meantime I&#8217;ve learned something about freewheel&#8217;s, and something about the importance of caring for your steed.<\/p>\n",

I know I claim to be an all weather cyclist, but it&#8217;s true that neither of my two bikes are really up to travel on ice and snow.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, this is the perfect reason to claim to need a new bike!<\/p>\n<p>When temperatures first plummeted and before the snow and ice came, I did head out on Fuzzy to go to work one morning, only to find that the pedals spun freely in both directions. This is not normal and prevents the main function of the bicycle: forward propulsion.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>I got to work using alternative means, and popped out at lunchtime to get the wheel checked.  I&#8217;d had problems with the rear hub recently&#8230;maybe it had finally failed.<\/p>\n<p>The first shop (my new favourite The Big Adventure Store) realised it was a Felt-branded hub and suggested that I go to a Felt dealer as they&#8217;ll be able to get parts. So I crossed town to Swindon Cycles.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, the problem seemed to have fixed itself.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Aha&#8221;, the Swindon Cycles man said, &#8220;it&#8217;s the cold!  We&#8217;ve already had one of these today.  Do you keep it outside?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Apparently the ratchet in the freewheel can freeze so that the &#8220;pawl&#8221; (the sprung part that catches) is stuck in place.  This either results in no ability to coast\/freewheel (pawl frozen when stuck out) or no ability to pedal (pawl frozen when retracted in).  And, I&#8217;m told, this can happen when water has got inside the freewheel mechanism.<\/p>\n<p>To be honest, the weather&#8217;s been crappy for months now.  Fuzzy has been a true workhorse getting me around in all conditions (bar snow and ice of course) staying parked up out in the rain all day and rarely being cleaned or maintained. It&#8217;s not surprising he&#8217;s a little under the weather.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had the hub cleaned and regressed so hopefully that will help.  In the meantime I&#8217;ve learned something about freewheel&#8217;s, and something about the importance of caring for your steed.<\/p>\n",

There are several things in our house that have gone unmended for a long&#8230;a LONG time. But I&#8217;m finally getting in gear and making them work again.<\/p>\n<p>First off was the grill. We&#8217;ve been without it for more than a year&#8230;mostly because our cooker &#8211; like everything in the house that we bought &#8211; is the cheapest of the cheap and local hardware stores don&#8217;t recognise the model number.<\/p>\n<p>So it was with my metaphorical tail between my metaphorical legs, and with my pen poised to sign a blank cheque, that I called the Hotpoint\/Indesit service centre.<\/p>\n<p><!--more-->They were friendly enough but offered two options.  An all-expenses-paid repair for \u00a3100 or some fancy guarantee thing where I pay \u00a3160 over 10 months and if they can&#8217;t repair it or if it breaks again we get the whole thing replaced.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m always sceptical of insurance.  It&#8217;s got to be a profitable business for the insurer, so the odds are actually stacked against the insurer.  And all we wanted was a simple fix for the element or the switch.  But they gave me the hard sell anyway.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You not filling me with confidence that you can fix it for \u00a3100&#8221;, I told them.  &#8220;Do you have any numbers on how many people end up claiming a new appliance?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Initially vague responses about most customers wishing they&#8217;d paid extra were finally not-backed-up with the statistic that over 95% of initial repairs were successful.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If it was just a broken handle then I&#8217;d recommend the cheaper option&#8221;, she said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If it was just a broken handle I&#8217;d fix it myself and definitely wouldn&#8217;t be paying \u00a3100&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I paid the \u00a3100 and booked the visit.<\/p>\n<p>Within 10 days the helpful engineer had visited, ordered two parts, visited again and fixed a faulty switch pack.  Simple.<\/p>\n<p>Grilled bacon butties all round!!<\/p>\n",

There are several things in our house that have gone unmended for a long&#8230;a LONG time. But I&#8217;m finally getting in gear and making them work again.<\/p>\n<p>First off was the grill. We&#8217;ve been without it for more than a year&#8230;mostly because our cooker &#8211; like everything in the house that we bought &#8211; is the cheapest of the cheap and local hardware stores don&#8217;t recognise the model number.<\/p>\n<p>So it was with my metaphorical tail between my metaphorical legs, and with my pen poised to sign a blank cheque, that I called the Hotpoint\/Indesit service centre.<\/p>\n<p><!--more-->They were friendly enough but offered two options.  An all-expenses-paid repair for \u00a3100 or some fancy guarantee thing where I pay \u00a3160 over 10 months and if they can&#8217;t repair it or if it breaks again we get the whole thing replaced.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m always sceptical of insurance.  It&#8217;s got to be a profitable business for the insurer, so the odds are actually stacked against the insurer.  And all we wanted was a simple fix for the element or the switch.  But they gave me the hard sell anyway.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You not filling me with confidence that you can fix it for \u00a3100&#8221;, I told them.  &#8220;Do you have any numbers on how many people end up claiming a new appliance?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Initially vague responses about most customers wishing they&#8217;d paid extra were finally not-backed-up with the statistic that over 95% of initial repairs were successful.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If it was just a broken handle then I&#8217;d recommend the cheaper option&#8221;, she said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If it was just a broken handle I&#8217;d fix it myself and definitely wouldn&#8217;t be paying \u00a3100&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I paid the \u00a3100 and booked the visit.<\/p>\n<p>Within 10 days the helpful engineer had visited, ordered two parts, visited again and fixed a faulty switch pack.  Simple.<\/p>\n<p>Grilled bacon butties all round!!<\/p>\n",
