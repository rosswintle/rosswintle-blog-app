                "rendered": "<p>I&#8217;m married. \u00a0Which means I had a wedding. \u00a0And it&#8217;s traditional to do a &#8220;first dance&#8221; at a wedding. \u00a0And, being a middle-class white guy, I&#8217;m not so good at dancing. \u00a0So I agreed to go along to some dance classes in the run up to my wedding.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>I honestly don&#8217;t remember my initial reaction to the idea. \u00a0I was probably a bit sceptical and needed a bit of convincing. \u00a0But I was madly in love and would have done pretty much anything for my fiancee at the time (for the record, I still am and I probably still would!).<\/p>\n<p>So, living in trendy West London, as we did at the time, we started going along to trendy West London Salsa classes.<\/p>\n<p>It was great fun, and I quickly became a dance-class evangleist (if not a particularly great dancer), telling lots of people that they should go because it was great fun.<\/p>\n<p>Salsa classes were very social: held in trendy, West London bars or large town hall buildings, partners moved around during the class so you got to know, and dance with, lots of people.<\/p>\n<p>It quickly became an important part of our weekly diary. \u00a0And, yes, we did manage to dance a little bit of salsa at our wedding reception without looking like complete dorks. \u00a0Mission accomplished.<\/p>\n<h2>Go West<\/h2>\n<p>Then we left trendy West London and moved to Swindon. We tried to keep the dancing up and found a Salsa class in GW&#8217;s, but it wasn&#8217;t as good, I didn&#8217;t get on with the teaching, and they soon stopped that class because the function room in the pub was refurbished.<\/p>\n<p>We tried a Tango class in a Hotel in Old Town, and that was OK, but, for some reason I can&#8217;t remember, we didn&#8217;t go back.<\/p>\n<p>Then Sally spotted a poster in her office for a Latin and Ballroom class in Lambourne. \u00a0That&#8217;s not too far from Swindon, so I agreed to go along and try it out.<\/p>\n<p>(Aside: Lambourne turned out to be much further from Swindon than I thought, and trekking backwards and forwards on Tuesday nights has certainly had its moments..including probably the most dangerous car journey of my life through the West Berkshire hills in heavy snow!)<\/p>\n<p>The class was very different, but very good. \u00a0The teacher was fantastic and the class far more personal. \u00a0You go as a couple and stick with your partner for the whole class, which has been really nice. \u00a0And we learned a whole load of different dances from the suave, slick, and very difficult Foxtrot, through the giggle-inducing &#8220;dance of luuuuurve&#8221; called the Rhumba, to our favourite: the strong, passionate Tango.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had great fun doing it, but it&#8217;s not been without frustrations. \u00a0We&#8217;re younger and much quicker learners than others in the group, we&#8217;re much more open to learning new things, plus we, and we alone, really enjoy modern music (El Tango de Roxanne, Gotan Project, and Paolo Nutini amongst others). \u00a0In short, it feels like we&#8217;ve staganted a little and the long trek to Lambourne has become a bit of a chore.<\/p>\n<h2>Something New<\/h2>\n<p>So, today, we thought we&#8217;d try something different. \u00a0Various friends of ours have been doing Lindyhop (a form of Jive) for a while, and we found our about a class here in Swindon. \u00a0So we went along.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s really good! \u00a0It&#8217;s stage led, so it&#8217;s less personal, and we&#8217;re back to moving partners every few minutes&#8230;but that&#8217;s a good thing. \u00a0It&#8217;s a well taught class and it&#8217;s nice to have a challenge again. \u00a0Plus it&#8217;s a BIG group in a big venue that seems to have a nice sociable feel to it, so maybe a chance to make new friends too.<\/p>\n<p>Our Rock-and-Roll experience, and the one or two Jive\/Lindyhop lessons we&#8217;ve had will make picking the basics up pretty quick, plus over the years we&#8217;ve learned to learn how to dance, so I&#8217;m hoping we&#8217;ll quickly progress to intermediate level.<\/p>\n<p>We won&#8217;t be recreating Hellzapoppin anytime soon, but it&#8217;s nice to be doing something new.<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R0BHxhUnokU<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;m married. \u00a0Which means I had a wedding. \u00a0And it&#8217;s traditional to do a &#8220;first dance&#8221; at a wedding. \u00a0And, being a middle-class white guy, I&#8217;m not so good at dancing. \u00a0So I agreed to go along to some dance classes in the run up to my wedding.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>I honestly don&#8217;t remember my initial reaction to the idea. \u00a0I was probably a bit sceptical and needed a bit of convincing. \u00a0But I was madly in love and would have done pretty much anything for my fiancee at the time (for the record, I still am and I probably still would!).<\/p>\n<p>So, living in trendy West London, as we did at the time, we started going along to trendy West London Salsa classes.<\/p>\n<p>It was great fun, and I quickly became a dance-class evangleist (if not a particularly great dancer), telling lots of people that they should go because it was great fun.<\/p>\n<p>Salsa classes were very social: held in trendy, West London bars or large town hall buildings, partners moved around during the class so you got to know, and dance with, lots of people.<\/p>\n<p>It quickly became an important part of our weekly diary. \u00a0And, yes, we did manage to dance a little bit of salsa at our wedding reception without looking like complete dorks. \u00a0Mission accomplished.<\/p>\n<h2>Go West<\/h2>\n<p>Then we left trendy West London and moved to Swindon. We tried to keep the dancing up and found a Salsa class in GW&#8217;s, but it wasn&#8217;t as good, I didn&#8217;t get on with the teaching, and they soon stopped that class because the function room in the pub was refurbished.<\/p>\n<p>We tried a Tango class in a Hotel in Old Town, and that was OK, but, for some reason I can&#8217;t remember, we didn&#8217;t go back.<\/p>\n<p>Then Sally spotted a poster in her office for a Latin and Ballroom class in Lambourne. \u00a0That&#8217;s not too far from Swindon, so I agreed to go along and try it out.<\/p>\n<p>(Aside: Lambourne turned out to be much further from Swindon than I thought, and trekking backwards and forwards on Tuesday nights has certainly had its moments..including probably the most dangerous car journey of my life through the West Berkshire hills in heavy snow!)<\/p>\n<p>The class was very different, but very good. \u00a0The teacher was fantastic and the class far more personal. \u00a0You go as a couple and stick with your partner for the whole class, which has been really nice. \u00a0And we learned a whole load of different dances from the suave, slick, and very difficult Foxtrot, through the giggle-inducing &#8220;dance of luuuuurve&#8221; called the Rhumba, to our favourite: the strong, passionate Tango.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had great fun doing it, but it&#8217;s not been without frustrations. \u00a0We&#8217;re younger and much quicker learners than others in the group, we&#8217;re much more open to learning new things, plus we, and we alone, really enjoy modern music (El Tango de Roxanne, Gotan Project, and Paolo Nutini amongst others). \u00a0In short, it feels like we&#8217;ve staganted a little and the long trek to Lambourne has become a bit of a chore.<\/p>\n<h2>Something New<\/h2>\n<p>So, today, we thought we&#8217;d try something different. \u00a0Various friends of ours have been doing Lindyhop (a form of Jive) for a while, and we found our about a class here in Swindon. \u00a0So we went along.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s really good! \u00a0It&#8217;s stage led, so it&#8217;s less personal, and we&#8217;re back to moving partners every few minutes&#8230;but that&#8217;s a good thing. \u00a0It&#8217;s a well taught class and it&#8217;s nice to have a challenge again. \u00a0Plus it&#8217;s a BIG group in a big venue that seems to have a nice sociable feel to it, so maybe a chance to make new friends too.<\/p>\n<p>Our Rock-and-Roll experience, and the one or two Jive\/Lindyhop lessons we&#8217;ve had will make picking the basics up pretty quick, plus over the years we&#8217;ve learned to learn how to dance, so I&#8217;m hoping we&#8217;ll quickly progress to intermediate level.<\/p>\n<p>We won&#8217;t be recreating Hellzapoppin anytime soon, but it&#8217;s nice to be doing something new.<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R0BHxhUnokU<\/p>\n",

I understand that some of these vehicles are needed for work purposes, but we&#8217;re talking about 3, sometimes 4 large vehicles per household. Not in every case, but in some cases.<\/p>\n<p>These all take up lots of room and sometimes mean that we have park our one, single, small car, that fits nicely outside our house, a short walk away.<\/p>\n<p>The image on the right shows what I mean.\u00a0 Normally there are more vehicles around.\u00a0 Note the pavement parking which is &#8220;normal&#8221;, and that we&#8217;re fortunate to have houses on just one side of the road.\u00a0 Imagine if there were houses on both sides &#8211; that&#8217;s what the rest of our area is really like.<\/p>\n<p>Oooh, look at me, getting all &#8220;inconvenienced driver&#8221; and &#8220;war on the motorist&#8221;.\u00a0 Not my usual form at all!<\/p>\n<p>And I realised this recently.\u00a0 That&#8217;s right.\u00a0 That&#8217;s not my usual form.<\/p>\n<p>Hold that thought (or, park that idea, if you like).<\/p>\n<h2>My Street Design Idea<\/h2>\n<p>So thinking about how could we plan our streets better&#8230;I&#8217;m not a town planner but\u00a0 I reckon we need:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some main trunk roads to allow traffic to get between the motorway and the town, and connecting the main suburban areas of the town, and to enable public transport to get around.<\/li>\n<li>Safer residential areas, clear of parked cars and with low speed limits.\u00a0 Areas where people can meet and kids can safely play and move around outside, and where people of all ages can walk and cycle easily.<\/li>\n<li>Parking &#8211;

I understand that some of these vehicles are needed for work purposes, but we&#8217;re talking about 3, sometimes 4 large vehicles per household. Not in every case, but in some cases.<\/p>\n<p>These all take up lots of room and sometimes mean that we have park our one, single, small car, that fits nicely outside our house, a short walk away.<\/p>\n<p>The image on the right shows what I mean.\u00a0 Normally there are more vehicles around.\u00a0 Note the pavement parking which is &#8220;normal&#8221;, and that we&#8217;re fortunate to have houses on just one side of the road.\u00a0 Imagine if there were houses on both sides &#8211; that&#8217;s what the rest of our area is really like.<\/p>\n<p>Oooh, look at me, getting all &#8220;inconvenienced driver&#8221; and &#8220;war on the motorist&#8221;.\u00a0 Not my usual form at all!<\/p>\n<p>And I realised this recently.\u00a0 That&#8217;s right.\u00a0 That&#8217;s not my usual form.<\/p>\n<p>Hold that thought (or, park that idea, if you like).<\/p>\n<h2>My Street Design Idea<\/h2>\n<p>So thinking about how could we plan our streets better&#8230;I&#8217;m not a town planner but\u00a0 I reckon we need:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some main trunk roads to allow traffic to get between the motorway and the town, and connecting the main suburban areas of the town, and to enable public transport to get around.<\/li>\n<li>Safer residential areas, clear of parked cars and with low speed limits.\u00a0 Areas where people can meet and kids can safely play and move around outside, and where people of all ages can walk and cycle easily.<\/li>\n<li>Parking &#8211; I acknowledge the need for cars, we must give people somewhere to put them.<\/li>\n<li>Access to properties.\u00a0 People need to load\/unload, pick people up, drop them off.\u00a0 Shopping and courier deliveries need to be made.<\/li>\n<li>A decent cycle and pedestrian network that somehow mirrors the inter-suburban routes, connecting up the main areas of the town and the suburbs to the town centre.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;ll happily take comments on this list.\u00a0 Cycle campaigner friends, am I pandering to the motorist too much?<\/p>\n<p>Retro fitting such a scheme to an existing town would be almost impossible, but we can think about how this might affect a new housing development.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s my image of how this might look:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<figure id=\"attachment_974\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-974\" style=\"width: 454px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/street-design-1.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-974 \" title=\"My Street Design\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/street-design-1.gif\" alt=\"Idea for shared, off-street parking street design\" width=\"454\" height=\"340\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/street-design-1.gif 454w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/street-design-1-300x224.gif 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/street-design-1-150x112.gif 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-974\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Idea for shared, off-street parking street design<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Yeah&#8230;no expense spared on the design, I know!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In this scheme, the trunk road on the left feeds an area of housing.\u00a0 On the entrance to the area there&#8217;s a car park.\u00a0 People can leave cars here and walk to their homes.\u00a0 If they need to access their property, say, if they&#8217;ve been to Ikea and are unloading a load of flat packs, there is a semi-pedestrianised, one-way route through (the hatched area).\u00a0 Note that gardens are important too, and green spaces have to fit somewhere as these are important, and I&#8217;ve not shown how the cycle\/pedestrian network fits in.\u00a0 Hey, it&#8217;s a primitive concept right now &#8211;

I&#8217;m not sure if God is talking louder in this uncertain time or if I&#8217;m listening better.<\/p>\n<p>Last night we did a bit of TV catchup and saw the jungle episode of the BBC&#8217;s brilliant &#8216;Human Planet&#8217;. And while the programme as a whole was extraordinary what got me was the little &#8216;the making of&#8217; documentary at the end.<\/p>\n<p>For those that missed it they&#8217;d done a section on a tribe of people who, with primitive tools, had built a tree house&#8230;in a 35m-high tree!!  The tribesmen climbed to the treetops using  no more than sticks and vines and strength and stamina. Yet, in the making-of we see the BBC crew all safety-harnessed up with lines and backup lines, helmets, etc.<\/p>\n<p>At the end they interviewed one of the crew. What had he learned from his visit?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I judge my own inadequacies against their expertise and knowledge. You come here and you&#8217;ve got boots in case of snake bites, we&#8217;ve got sun cream on because of the sun, you know, you&#8217;ve got twin safety ropes to make sure if one fails you get caught by the other one. And these guys, OK maybe they have a higher mortality rate but they&#8217;re much freer in their lifestyle. You know they&#8217;ll shimmy up and down these trees. I think I&#8217;d much rather live a shorter, fuller life like they do out here.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes rules and safety measures give you freedom. Other times they take it away. Perhaps not having a safety rope stops us climbing the tree!<\/p>\n<p>Leaving my stable, secure job to pursue something more interesting has been like that. I still wonder what the heck I&#8217;ve done sometimes and check if my safety ropes are ok. But I also have days when I&#8217;ve shimmied higher than ever and can see the view unfolding.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m not sure if God is talking louder in this uncertain time or if I&#8217;m listening better.<\/p>\n<p>Last night we did a bit of TV catchup and saw the jungle episode of the BBC&#8217;s brilliant &#8216;Human Planet&#8217;. And while the programme as a whole was extraordinary what got me was the little &#8216;the making of&#8217; documentary at the end.<\/p>\n<p>For those that missed it they&#8217;d done a section on a tribe of people who, with primitive tools, had built a tree house&#8230;in a 35m-high tree!!  The tribesmen climbed to the treetops using  no more than sticks and vines and strength and stamina. Yet, in the making-of we see the BBC crew all safety-harnessed up with lines and backup lines, helmets, etc.<\/p>\n<p>At the end they interviewed one of the crew. What had he learned from his visit?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I judge my own inadequacies against their expertise and knowledge. You come here and you&#8217;ve got boots in case of snake bites, we&#8217;ve got sun cream on because of the sun, you know, you&#8217;ve got twin safety ropes to make sure if one fails you get caught by the other one. And these guys, OK maybe they have a higher mortality rate but they&#8217;re much freer in their lifestyle. You know they&#8217;ll shimmy up and down these trees. I think I&#8217;d much rather live a shorter, fuller life like they do out here.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes rules and safety measures give you freedom. Other times they take it away. Perhaps not having a safety rope stops us climbing the tree!<\/p>\n<p>Leaving my stable, secure job to pursue something more interesting has been like that. I still wonder what the heck I&#8217;ve done sometimes and check if my safety ropes are ok. But I also have days when I&#8217;ve shimmied higher than ever and can see the view unfolding.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m even finding the process of working out what&#8217;s next a creative one too. \u00a0I&#8217;m not just making &#8220;stuff&#8221;, I&#8217;m making the rest of my life!<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m even finding the process of working out what&#8217;s next a creative one too. \u00a0I&#8217;m not just making &#8220;stuff&#8221;, I&#8217;m making the rest of my life!<\/p>\n",

Will you love her, comfort her, honour and protect her, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to her as long as you both shall live?&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>to which I answered a loud and resounding and heartfelt, &#8220;I WILL&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>A few minutes later I said these words:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I, Ross, take you, Sally, to be my wife, to have and to hold from this day forward; for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part; according to God&#8217;s holy law. In the presence of God I make this vow.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And, to my continual amazement, Sally, of course, also said &#8220;I will&#8221; and made the vows.  An act for which I shall be forever thankful.<\/p>\n<p>I repeated them after our vicar, but I HAD memorised them and I&#8217;m glad I did, because I still remember them and it&#8217;s good to remember them occasionally becayse those promises are the foundation of my marriage.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, I took those vows in a church and yes I believe I did them &#8220;in the presence of God, who is judge of all and knows all the secrets of our hearts&#8221;.  But even without God, those are big promises to make that have consequences for the rest of ones life.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday was St Valentine&#8217;s Day and, while we don&#8217;t ever do much for it, it&#8217;s good to remember and to celebrate.<\/p>\n<p>I think the most difficult part of the vows is the &#8220;honour and protect&#8221; bit.  It&#8217;s easy to slip into making throwaway, jokey comments about &#8220;the wife&#8221; &#8211; especially in a male-dominated office.  But it seems awkward and counter-cultural to praise your wife\/girlfriend\/partner in public.<\/p>\n<p>So, yes, maybe this is a soppy post, but I write it unashamedly.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re going through big changes right now, changes which are mostly better for me than for Sally, but she&#8217;s been unceasingly patient, encouraging and committed.  She&#8217;s served me as I&#8217;ve worked &#8211; not just as I&#8217;ve been doing a job-and-a-half for the last few months, but for the duration of our marriage.  She helps me through my doubts and joins with me in my excitement.<\/p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t be making my career move without her.  Today, I celebrate my wife Sally, whom I love greatly.<\/p>\n",

Will you love her, comfort her, honour and protect her, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to her as long as you both shall live?&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>to which I answered a loud and resounding and heartfelt, &#8220;I WILL&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>A few minutes later I said these words:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I, Ross, take you, Sally, to be my wife, to have and to hold from this day forward; for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part; according to God&#8217;s holy law. In the presence of God I make this vow.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And, to my continual amazement, Sally, of course, also said &#8220;I will&#8221; and made the vows.  An act for which I shall be forever thankful.<\/p>\n<p>I repeated them after our vicar, but I HAD memorised them and I&#8217;m glad I did, because I still remember them and it&#8217;s good to remember them occasionally becayse those promises are the foundation of my marriage.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, I took those vows in a church and yes I believe I did them &#8220;in the presence of God, who is judge of all and knows all the secrets of our hearts&#8221;.  But even without God, those are big promises to make that have consequences for the rest of ones life.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday was St Valentine&#8217;s Day and, while we don&#8217;t ever do much for it, it&#8217;s good to remember and to celebrate.<\/p>\n<p>I think the most difficult part of the vows is the &#8220;honour and protect&#8221; bit.  It&#8217;s easy to slip into making throwaway, jokey comments about &#8220;the wife&#8221; &#8211; especially in a male-dominated office.  But it seems awkward and counter-cultural to praise your wife\/girlfriend\/partner in public.<\/p>\n<p>So, yes, maybe this is a soppy post, but I write it unashamedly.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re going through big changes right now, changes which are mostly better for me than for Sally, but she&#8217;s been unceasingly patient, encouraging and committed.  She&#8217;s served me as I&#8217;ve worked &#8211; not just as I&#8217;ve been doing a job-and-a-half for the last few months, but for the duration of our marriage.  She helps me through my doubts and joins with me in my excitement.<\/p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t be making my career move without her.  Today, I celebrate my wife Sally, whom I love greatly.<\/p>\n",

Video here: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/6953cpo #lblUK&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This explains what the link is, suggests why I might click it (to find out about the campaign) and introduces the hashtag which, from the content of the Tweet, I can probably work out the meaning of now.<\/p>\n<p>Tweet 2. &#8220;Follow Friday: The Live Below the Line campaign, @lblUK &#8211; trying to live on less than \u00a31 a day. #lblUK<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think the #ff hashtag is particularly useful. In fact, with Twitter search and trends I don&#8217;t think that turning ordinary words into hashtags is of much use. \u00a0However, specific tags for specific campaigns or events are useful, so I&#8217;ve left in the #lblUK hashtag as we know what it means now and it is probably useful. \u00a0I&#8217;ve given the opportunity for users to follow @lblUK if they want to, which is the intention of the Tweet.<\/p>\n<p>If the other users are important too you could write a third:<\/p>\n<p>Tweet 3: &#8220;Follow Friday: Live Below the Line campaign partners: @SAIDUK, @christian_aid&#8230;.etc&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 3<\/strong>: Some users will not read a tweet if it contains lots of &#8220;meta-data&#8221;. Keep this to a minimum to keep tweets readable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 4<\/strong>: Think about what response your tweet is trying to invoke. Make that response as easy as possible for the reader to understand and action.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 5<\/strong>: Think about hashtags &#8211; they break up the flow of writing. \u00a0Is it really necessary to turn key words into hashtags? \u00a0Does this bring benefit to your users or to you?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 6<\/strong>: If you&#8217;re going to partake in Follow Friday, keep the users you&#8217;re suggesting to a minimum and explain why they may be of interest.<\/p>\n<p>As I thought about this and looked through my Twitter timeline looking for examples and thinking &#8220;what would I skip the reading of&#8221;, I also noticed that I would skip over tweets written in mostly upper case. \u00a0Interesting!<\/p>\n<p>More generally, that screen grab is from my iPhone Twitter app, and I reckon anywhere that there&#8217;s more underlined content than non-underlined content will be automatically ignored by me as too difficult to read and understand quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Volume is also an issue &#8211; for me, organisations that tweet lots of similar content will eventually be ignored or unfollowed. \u00a0Keep it easy to read, relevant, new and interesting. \u00a0Repeat the same messages or bombarding me with content will not make me listen &#8211; quite the opposite.<\/p>\n<h2>Lessons on Learning Social Media Lessons<\/h2>\n<p>There are no rules about how to use Twitter &#8211; that&#8217;s one of the things I like about it. \u00a0Social Media is a new and evolving form of communication. \u00a0We&#8217;re still developing ettiquette, patterns of use and so on. \u00a0The lessons here are mostly based on how I use Twitter as a reader. It may be different for others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 7<\/strong>: There are no rules, but think about how you use social media as a reader, that will probably help you with writing for social media.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, too, that I&#8217;m probably guilty of breaking my own rules and of also writing illegible Tweets. \u00a0I&#8217;m also sorry if I&#8217;ve caused anyone negative feeling or bad press.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 7<\/strong>: No one&#8217;s perfect!<\/p>\n<p>I love that social media has enabled us to have this discussion, and I love that the non-profits I support are actively using it to engage with their supporters.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think? \u00a0What causes you to skip a tweet? \u00a0What individuals or organisations use social media well? \u00a0And what is it about the way they use it that makes it good?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll start with <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ctc_cyclists\">@CTC_Cyclists<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/nationaltrust\">@nationaltrust<\/a>, I think they&#8217;re great examples of using Twitter well.<\/p>\n",

A quick, and very limited poll of people showed that 2 was probably a maximum. I&#8217;d not only agree with this but I would expand it to any kind of information that&#8217;s not actually the Tweet itself: @mentions, #hashtags and web links all included.<\/p>\n<p>I used, as an example, a charity that I wholeheartedly support the work of, but who I&#8217;ve had an on-and-0ff Twitter following of. \u00a0A couple of days later I used this Tweet from the same organization as another example.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/messy-tweet.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005\" title=\"Messy Tweet\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/messy-tweet.jpg\" alt=\"A Messy Tweet\" width=\"246\" height=\"71\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/messy-tweet.jpg 246w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/messy-tweet-150x43.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Lessons on Giving Feedback<\/h2>\n<p>To cut a long story short, using this as an example lead to another user I follow being incorrectly attributed a comment that I made which resulted in him getting some bad press. \u00a0It all ended well, but \u00a0felt pretty bad about it and have apologised and explained to the charity in more depth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 1<\/strong>: Giving feedback on Twitter is hard &#8211; 140 characters is often not enough to convey a complex piece of constructive criticism.<\/p>\n<p>and<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 2<\/strong>: If you&#8217;re replying to a tweet, make sure you understand who it&#8217;s from and that what you&#8217;re saying about them is correct.<\/p>\n<h2>Lessons on Using Twitter<\/h2>\n<p>The tweet above was not actually a Tweet from the organisation that I follow &#8211; it&#8217;s a &#8220;re-tweet&#8221; of another organisation, and I was even careful to not reveal the name of the organisation that I follow. \u00a0But it&#8217;s a fantastic example of a Tweet that I skim over. \u00a0It has:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>6 @mentions<\/li>\n<li>Two hashtags, one of which is a repeat of an @mention<\/li>\n<li>The RT prefix<\/li>\n<li>A link<\/li>\n<li>A total of 104 character of non-word content (I call this &#8220;meta-data&#8221;, it&#8217;s not the Tweet, it&#8217;s extra information about the Tweet or attached to the Tweet).<\/li>\n<li>Only 30 characters of English word content<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If I see anything like this in my stream I skim right over it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s not esaily readable.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s not clear what it&#8217;s telling me.<\/li>\n<li>It doesn&#8217;t tell me why I should follow the link.<\/li>\n<li>It assumes that I know what the LBLuk hashtag is about.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s a &#8220;Follow Friday&#8221; (a recommendation that I should follow another user), but one that doesn&#8217;t explain why I should follow that other user.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s a &#8220;re-tweet&#8221; &#8211; a sharing of another user&#8217;s tweet &#8211; a &#8220;Follow Friday&#8221; and a link all at the same time; it has three separate purposes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, one question might be: &#8220;OK Ross, so what would you have done?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I think I&#8217;d have not re-tweeted to start with &#8211; the original didn&#8217;t make much sense and RT&#8217;ing it will make it make less sense. \u00a0I&#8217;d have sent two original tweets instead:<\/p>\n<p>Tweet 1. &#8220;Have you seen Live below the Line? \u00a0Trying to live on less than \u00a31 a day &#8211; are you ready? Video here: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/6953cpo #lblUK&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This explains what the link is, suggests why I might click it (to find out about the campaign) and introduces the hashtag which, from the content of the Tweet, I can probably work out the meaning of now.<\/p>\n<p>Tweet 2. &#8220;Follow Friday: The Live Below the Line campaign, @lblUK &#8211; trying to live on less than \u00a31 a day. #lblUK<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think the #ff hashtag is particularly useful. In fact, with Twitter search and trends I don&#8217;t think that turning ordinary words into hashtags is of much use. \u00a0However, specific tags for specific campaigns or events are useful, so I&#8217;ve left in the #lblUK hashtag as we know what it means now and it is probably useful. \u00a0I&#8217;ve given the opportunity for users to follow @lblUK if they want to, which is the intention of the Tweet.<\/p>\n<p>If the other users are important too you could write a third:<\/p>\n<p>Tweet 3: &#8220;Follow Friday: Live Below the Line campaign partners: @SAIDUK, @christian_aid&#8230;.etc&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 3<\/strong>: Some users will not read a tweet if it contains lots of &#8220;meta-data&#8221;. Keep this to a minimum to keep tweets readable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 4<\/strong>: Think about what response your tweet is trying to invoke. Make that response as easy as possible for the reader to understand and action.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 5<\/strong>: Think about hashtags &#8211; they break up the flow of writing. \u00a0Is it really necessary to turn key words into hashtags? \u00a0Does this bring benefit to your users or to you?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 6<\/strong>: If you&#8217;re going to partake in Follow Friday, keep the users you&#8217;re suggesting to a minimum and explain why they may be of interest.<\/p>\n<p>As I thought about this and looked through my Twitter timeline looking for examples and thinking &#8220;what would I skip the reading of&#8221;, I also noticed that I would skip over tweets written in mostly upper case. \u00a0Interesting!<\/p>\n<p>More generally, that screen grab is from my iPhone Twitter app, and I reckon anywhere that there&#8217;s more underlined content than non-underlined content will be automatically ignored by me as too difficult to read and understand quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Volume is also an issue &#8211; for me, organisations that tweet lots of similar content will eventually be ignored or unfollowed. \u00a0Keep it easy to read, relevant, new and interesting. \u00a0Repeat the same messages or bombarding me with content will not make me listen &#8211; quite the opposite.<\/p>\n<h2>Lessons on Learning Social Media Lessons<\/h2>\n<p>There are no rules about how to use Twitter &#8211; that&#8217;s one of the things I like about it. \u00a0Social Media is a new and evolving form of communication. \u00a0We&#8217;re still developing ettiquette, patterns of use and so on. \u00a0The lessons here are mostly based on how I use Twitter as a reader. It may be different for others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 7<\/strong>: There are no rules, but think about how you use social media as a reader, that will probably help you with writing for social media.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, too, that I&#8217;m probably guilty of breaking my own rules and of also writing illegible Tweets. \u00a0I&#8217;m also sorry if I&#8217;ve caused anyone negative feeling or bad press.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 7<\/strong>: No one&#8217;s perfect!<\/p>\n<p>I love that social media has enabled us to have this discussion, and I love that the non-profits I support are actively using it to engage with their supporters.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think? \u00a0What causes you to skip a tweet? \u00a0What individuals or organisations use social media well? \u00a0And what is it about the way they use it that makes it good?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll start with <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ctc_cyclists\">@CTC_Cyclists<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/nationaltrust\">@nationaltrust<\/a>, I think they&#8217;re great examples of using Twitter well.<\/p>\n",

Not giving too much away, the question was along the lines of:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>What output will you get from the following statements:<\/p>\n<p>x=4;<br \/>\necho x&lt;=6 ? &#8216;less than or equal to&#8217; : &#8216;greater than&#8217; . &#8216; six&#8217;;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: Apologies to those that don&#8217;t code at this point &#8211; this won&#8217;t make a whole load of sense.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a clever question because it lures you into thinking that the code is correct and will print &#8216;less than or equal to six&#8217;, but it actually prints just &#8216;less than or equal to&#8217;, because the precedence of the conditional operator is lower than that of string concatenation. \u00a0In case you&#8217;re wondering, no, I didn&#8217;t look this up as I know that the ternary operator has quite low precedence.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth nothing that this is, in my opinion, ambiguous code and any statement like this should always be written more clearly:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>echo (x &lt;= 6 ? &#8216;less than or equal to&#8217; : &#8216;greater than&#8217; ) . &#8216; six&#8217;;<sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1011-1' id='fnref-1011-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(1011)'>1<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Adding parentheses adds no computational overhead <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1011-2' id='fnref-1011-2' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(1011)'>2<\/a><\/sup> and makes the code easier to understand.<\/p>\n<h2>Learning languages<\/h2>\n<p>Do I also have evidence that learning new tools and languages is easier if you have a good grounding in computer science? \u00a0Well, yes.<\/p>\n<p>I was recently on a training course where we were learning a tool that had a built-in scripting language. \u00a0Some of the other guys on the course didn&#8217;t have my computer science background and theory. <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1011-3' id='fnref-1011-3' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(1011)'>3<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>When we got to doing exercises, they raced ahead for the first few, applying the specific bits of knowledge about the language they&#8217;d picked up from the course slides, while I was slow, asking questions like &#8220;what does that function return?&#8221;, or &#8220;why does that query do what it does?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>However, come the later exercises, where you had to do more than just refer back to the the slides, I&#8217;d gained a deeper understanding of the language and raced ahead.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always believed that a thorough grounding in the principles of programming makes you a better coder than someone who just picked up a book and started writing code. \u00a0Occasionally I see practical evidence of this being the case.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday&#8217;s test proved to me that, while I may not know the exact syntax and purpose of every last PHP function or configuration setting, I can still be a PHP expert, and that I have skills and knowledge that are more valuable than I thought.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps tomorrow I&#8217;ll be a C# expert!<\/p>\n<div class='footnotes' id='footnotes-1011'>\n<div class='footnotedivider'><\/div>\n<ol>\n<li id='fn-1011-1'> You can argue about putting the comparison operator in parentheses too, but it&#8217;s pretty safe to assume that a simple numerical comparison will have greater precedence over the conditional operator. <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-1011-1'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li id='fn-1011-2'> OK, perhaps a TINY overhead when PHP tokenises the script. <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-1011-2'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li id='fn-1011-3'> If they&#8217;re reading, I hope they don&#8217;t mind me sharing this story! <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-1011-3'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n",

        "content": "<p>OK, OK, yes, this post is partly blatent self-promotion, but it&#8217;s also a moment of honesty and a hopefully-interesting reflection on an interesting little test that I did today.<\/p>\n<h2><!--more-->What I do know<\/h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the facts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I do class myself as an expert in software engineering &#8211; the process of solving a given real-world problem using computer software.<\/li>\n<li>I do class myself as a very good developer and can quickly turn my hand to new languages and tools for developing software.<\/li>\n<li>I do class myself as a very good web developer. \u00a0I know back-end technologies like databases, SQL, and server administration; I know application development technologies like PHP and MVC frameworks; and I know front-end technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. \u00a0Plus, importantly, I understand the purposes of each and the interaction between them.<\/li>\n<li>However, I would only class myself as upper-intermediate in my PHP skills. \u00a0Yes, I&#8217;ve been using PHP for 4 years are part of my job, but it&#8217;s not been a full-time occupation and I&#8217;m still learning some of the more detailed aspects of the language.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, to prove my worth as a PHP developer, a recruitment consultant sent me a PHP technical test yesterday, and I was a little surprised by the result. \u00a0I got 95% and was in the top 4th percentile of people who took the test. \u00a0It suggested that, far from being intermediate, I was a PHP expert!!<\/p>\n<h2>A confession<\/h2>\n<p>A slight confession is needed at this point. \u00a0The test had a time limit and I approached this test as I would approach a working situation with a tight deadline. \u00a0If I could quickly look something up and understand it enough to answer the question (like, which parameters get passed to a given function), I did, but if it was going to take a while to understand I would either work it out or skip the question. \u00a0So yes, I did quickly look a couple of things up, but I also skipped those questions that I genuinely didn&#8217;t have a clue about. \u00a0And I completed the test in average time.<\/p>\n<p>Even so, I found the test tricky and felt far from confident at the end. \u00a0Why then, did I manage to do so well?<\/p>\n<h2>Languages are just tools<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s a become a bit of a cliche for me that &#8220;languages are just tools&#8221;, but there is a lot of truth in that. \u00a0My A&#8217; level computing teacher used to say that languages were like screwdrivers or chisels are to a woodworker: a good woodworker can pick up a new tool and use it effectively, the important thing is to know how to do woodwork &#8211; how to fit bits of wood together to build things.<\/p>\n<p>I did well at this test because I have a deep understanding of the building blocks of writing code; things like what functions do, recursion, variable scoping, operator precedence and associativity, objects and classes, bitwise operators, loop invariants, interactions between different elements of the system (the database, back-end and front-end), and so on.<\/p>\n<p>I understand the fundamentals of abstraction, encapsulation and decomposition upon which every program should be based.<\/p>\n<p>These are advanced programming concepts that someone who&#8217;s just learned a bit of PHP out of a book won&#8217;t understand, but which I can apply to pretty much any programming language.<\/p>\n<p>And to demonstrate the point, I&#8217;ve used languages as diverse as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scheme and Miranda (functional);<\/li>\n<li>C, Pascal and Ada (procedural);<\/li>\n<li>assembler (low-level);<\/li>\n<li>SmallTalk (object-oriented);<\/li>\n<li>JavaScript (most of the above, plus event-driven)<\/li>\n<li>Perl and PHP (text processing);<\/li>\n<li>Prolog (logic);<\/li>\n<li>and SQL (declarative, query-based).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">An example<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The operator precedence question is a good example. Not giving too much away, the question was along the lines of:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>What output will you get from the following statements:<\/p>\n<p>x=4;<br \/>\necho x&lt;=6 ? &#8216;less than or equal to&#8217; : &#8216;greater than&#8217; . &#8216; six&#8217;;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: Apologies to those that don&#8217;t code at this point &#8211; this won&#8217;t make a whole load of sense.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a clever question because it lures you into thinking that the code is correct and will print &#8216;less than or equal to six&#8217;, but it actually prints just &#8216;less than or equal to&#8217;, because the precedence of the conditional operator is lower than that of string concatenation. \u00a0In case you&#8217;re wondering, no, I didn&#8217;t look this up as I know that the ternary operator has quite low precedence.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth nothing that this is, in my opinion, ambiguous code and any statement like this should always be written more clearly:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>echo (x &lt;= 6 ? &#8216;less than or equal to&#8217; : &#8216;greater than&#8217; ) . &#8216; six&#8217;;<sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1011-1' id='fnref-1011-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(1011)'>1<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Adding parentheses adds no computational overhead <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1011-2' id='fnref-1011-2' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(1011)'>2<\/a><\/sup> and makes the code easier to understand.<\/p>\n<h2>Learning languages<\/h2>\n<p>Do I also have evidence that learning new tools and languages is easier if you have a good grounding in computer science? \u00a0Well, yes.<\/p>\n<p>I was recently on a training course where we were learning a tool that had a built-in scripting language. \u00a0Some of the other guys on the course didn&#8217;t have my computer science background and theory. <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1011-3' id='fnref-1011-3' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(1011)'>3<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>When we got to doing exercises, they raced ahead for the first few, applying the specific bits of knowledge about the language they&#8217;d picked up from the course slides, while I was slow, asking questions like &#8220;what does that function return?&#8221;, or &#8220;why does that query do what it does?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>However, come the later exercises, where you had to do more than just refer back to the the slides, I&#8217;d gained a deeper understanding of the language and raced ahead.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always believed that a thorough grounding in the principles of programming makes you a better coder than someone who just picked up a book and started writing code. \u00a0Occasionally I see practical evidence of this being the case.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday&#8217;s test proved to me that, while I may not know the exact syntax and purpose of every last PHP function or configuration setting, I can still be a PHP expert, and that I have skills and knowledge that are more valuable than I thought.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps tomorrow I&#8217;ll be a C# expert!<\/p>\n<div class='footnotes' id='footnotes-1011'>\n<div class='footnotedivider'><\/div>\n<ol>\n<li id='fn-1011-1'> You can argue about putting the comparison operator in parentheses too, but it&#8217;s pretty safe to assume that a simple numerical comparison will have greater precedence over the conditional operator. <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-1011-1'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li id='fn-1011-2'> OK, perhaps a TINY overhead when PHP tokenises the script. <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-1011-2'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li id='fn-1011-3'> If they&#8217;re reading, I hope they don&#8217;t mind me sharing this story! <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-1011-3'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n",

Pragmatic Environmentalism and; Cycling.<\/p>\n<p><!--more-->Andy&#8217;s posts about user experience have got me thinking a lot about my own experiences of human computer interaction and today has raised an interesting example.<\/p>\n<h2>IE9 for the Average Joe<\/h2>\n<p>As a web developer I like to stay on top of technology so I used a spare moment to get downloading Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer 9.<\/p>\n<p>We should bear in mind that web browsers are a pretty key piece of computer software these days and Microsoft are, of course, competing more and more with Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox, Google&#8217;s Chrome and others. \u00a0So an average man-on-the-street, non-technical person, wanting to take advantage of the new features and increased speed of IE9 should be given a VERY easy time when doing this upgrade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And yet, I &#8211; a highly technical person &#8211; was initially bamboozled at pretty much step one of the install process.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After double-clicking the installer that I&#8217;d downloaded by clicking the big &#8220;Download Now&#8221; button, I got the following message:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020\" title=\"IE9 Install Error\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error.jpg\" alt=\"Internet Explorer 9 Install Error: &quot;Wrong Version of Internet Explorer Installer - This version of setup doesn't support your Windows system type (32\/64 bit)&quot;\" width=\"506\" height=\"145\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error.jpg 506w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-300x85.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-150x42.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>My first thought was, &#8220;wrong version?&#8221;. \u00a0I didn&#8217;t remember having a choice of versions. \u00a0I just clicked the &#8220;Download Now&#8221; button. \u00a0Was there another version?<\/p>\n<p>My second thought was &#8220;What?&#8221;. \u00a0I mean, what is this telling me?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It tells me that I&#8217;ve done something wrong, but it doesn&#8217;t really tell me what I&#8217;ve done wrong.<\/li>\n<li>It uses technical language that a lot of people won&#8217;t understand: &#8220;32-bit\/64-bit&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>It assumes that you know that there are two &#8220;Windows system types&#8221;, which is not necessarily true.<\/li>\n<li>It tells me nothing about how to fix the problem or what I need to do to complete the install.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of particular confusion is the fact that it tells me I&#8217;ve used the wrong installer, but doesn&#8217;t tell me where to get the right installer.<\/p>\n<h2>Giving Up<\/h2>\n<p>I confess, I actually gave up at that point. \u00a0If MS can&#8217;t make this easy for a busy person I&#8217;m wasn&#8217;t going to bother.<\/p>\n<p>For the average user at this point I&#8217;ve got an error I probably don&#8217;t understand and no help in doing the job right. \u00a0There&#8217;s no encouragement to persevere and get it right either.<\/p>\n<h2>A Better Error<\/h2>\n<p>If this message was to remain technical, it should say something more like:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You&#8217;re trying to use the 32-bit installer on a 64-bit Windows system. \u00a0Please use the 64-bit installer instead&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>But, even better, this more technical information should be hidden under a &#8220;More information&#8221; button. \u00a0The error needs to be as simple as possible and give the user the simplest resolution.<\/p>\n<p>I suggest:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You are using the wrong version of the installer for your system. \u00a0Please download and install the right version to continue your upgrade to a faster, better internet experience.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Download Internet Explorer version 9 for your system<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">More Information on this error<\/span>&#8220;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Get it Right First Time<\/h2>\n<p>Even better would be to try to deliver the correct installer anyway &#8211; detect if the user is using 32- or 64-bit and have the download button deliver the correct version. \u00a0This can be easily done in JavaScript by testing the values of:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><code>window.navigator.cpuClass<\/code><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><code>window.navigator.platform<\/code><\/p>\n<p>(I confess to not having used these values before and a quick test shows that, in practice, cpuClass is &#8220;unknown&#8221; for my system and platform is &#8220;Win32&#8221;, so maybe MS try to detect this but it&#8217;s not reported correctly)<\/p>\n<h2>Lessons Learned<\/h2>\n<p>As a techie it&#8217;s easy to assume that everyone knows what I do and to unthoughtfully write error messages that may not be understood. \u00a0But especially for a tool that non-technical people will be installing, errors need to be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>clear;<\/li>\n<li>non-technical (but with an option to get a more technical message); and<\/li>\n<li>help me fix the problem or take the appropriate action to achieve my objective.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the meantime I&#8217;m downloading the 64-bit version and will let you know what I think soon.<\/p>\n<h3>Update<\/h3>\n<p>ARRGH! \u00a0OK, I&#8217;m now running the 64-bit version and I get this message:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024\" title=\"Confusing IE9 Install Dialog\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2.jpg\" alt=\"A confusing IE9 install dialog\" width=\"492\" height=\"190\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2.jpg 492w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2-300x115.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2-150x57.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Which again, suggests something quite complicated and scary while giving me very little help. \u00a0At this point I&#8217;m thinking:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What customized settings does this install include? \u00a0What will it change?<\/li>\n<li>What additional programs will it install?<\/li>\n<li>Is there an option to not install the additional programs?<\/li>\n<li>Is there a version that doesn&#8217;t include customized settings and additional programs?<\/li>\n<li>And if so where do I get it from?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>At least I get a link to the license terms but at this point I&#8217;m still clicking cancel. \u00a0I&#8217;ve been bitten before by &#8220;additional programs&#8221;

        "content": "<p>Bizarrely this is not a post about my job hunting\/exploration of work options. \u00a0It&#8217;s a post about user experience with software.<\/p>\n<p>I did a module at University about human computer interaction and it was fascinating. \u00a0I love exploring psychology and how people interact with each other, themselves and what&#8217;s around them. \u00a0So I&#8217;ve been enjoying <a title=\"Experience not Evangelism - Andy Fryer's Blog\" href=\"http:\/\/andyfryer.blogspot.com\">Andy Fryer&#8217;s blog<\/a> which combines three topics of interest to me: User Experience; Pragmatic Environmentalism and; Cycling.<\/p>\n<p><!--more-->Andy&#8217;s posts about user experience have got me thinking a lot about my own experiences of human computer interaction and today has raised an interesting example.<\/p>\n<h2>IE9 for the Average Joe<\/h2>\n<p>As a web developer I like to stay on top of technology so I used a spare moment to get downloading Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer 9.<\/p>\n<p>We should bear in mind that web browsers are a pretty key piece of computer software these days and Microsoft are, of course, competing more and more with Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox, Google&#8217;s Chrome and others. \u00a0So an average man-on-the-street, non-technical person, wanting to take advantage of the new features and increased speed of IE9 should be given a VERY easy time when doing this upgrade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And yet, I &#8211; a highly technical person &#8211; was initially bamboozled at pretty much step one of the install process.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After double-clicking the installer that I&#8217;d downloaded by clicking the big &#8220;Download Now&#8221; button, I got the following message:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020\" title=\"IE9 Install Error\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error.jpg\" alt=\"Internet Explorer 9 Install Error: &quot;Wrong Version of Internet Explorer Installer - This version of setup doesn't support your Windows system type (32\/64 bit)&quot;\" width=\"506\" height=\"145\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error.jpg 506w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-300x85.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-150x42.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>My first thought was, &#8220;wrong version?&#8221;. \u00a0I didn&#8217;t remember having a choice of versions. \u00a0I just clicked the &#8220;Download Now&#8221; button. \u00a0Was there another version?<\/p>\n<p>My second thought was &#8220;What?&#8221;. \u00a0I mean, what is this telling me?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It tells me that I&#8217;ve done something wrong, but it doesn&#8217;t really tell me what I&#8217;ve done wrong.<\/li>\n<li>It uses technical language that a lot of people won&#8217;t understand: &#8220;32-bit\/64-bit&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>It assumes that you know that there are two &#8220;Windows system types&#8221;, which is not necessarily true.<\/li>\n<li>It tells me nothing about how to fix the problem or what I need to do to complete the install.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of particular confusion is the fact that it tells me I&#8217;ve used the wrong installer, but doesn&#8217;t tell me where to get the right installer.<\/p>\n<h2>Giving Up<\/h2>\n<p>I confess, I actually gave up at that point. \u00a0If MS can&#8217;t make this easy for a busy person I&#8217;m wasn&#8217;t going to bother.<\/p>\n<p>For the average user at this point I&#8217;ve got an error I probably don&#8217;t understand and no help in doing the job right. \u00a0There&#8217;s no encouragement to persevere and get it right either.<\/p>\n<h2>A Better Error<\/h2>\n<p>If this message was to remain technical, it should say something more like:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You&#8217;re trying to use the 32-bit installer on a 64-bit Windows system. \u00a0Please use the 64-bit installer instead&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>But, even better, this more technical information should be hidden under a &#8220;More information&#8221; button. \u00a0The error needs to be as simple as possible and give the user the simplest resolution.<\/p>\n<p>I suggest:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You are using the wrong version of the installer for your system. \u00a0Please download and install the right version to continue your upgrade to a faster, better internet experience.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Download Internet Explorer version 9 for your system<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">More Information on this error<\/span>&#8220;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Get it Right First Time<\/h2>\n<p>Even better would be to try to deliver the correct installer anyway &#8211; detect if the user is using 32- or 64-bit and have the download button deliver the correct version. \u00a0This can be easily done in JavaScript by testing the values of:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><code>window.navigator.cpuClass<\/code><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><code>window.navigator.platform<\/code><\/p>\n<p>(I confess to not having used these values before and a quick test shows that, in practice, cpuClass is &#8220;unknown&#8221; for my system and platform is &#8220;Win32&#8221;, so maybe MS try to detect this but it&#8217;s not reported correctly)<\/p>\n<h2>Lessons Learned<\/h2>\n<p>As a techie it&#8217;s easy to assume that everyone knows what I do and to unthoughtfully write error messages that may not be understood. \u00a0But especially for a tool that non-technical people will be installing, errors need to be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>clear;<\/li>\n<li>non-technical (but with an option to get a more technical message); and<\/li>\n<li>help me fix the problem or take the appropriate action to achieve my objective.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the meantime I&#8217;m downloading the 64-bit version and will let you know what I think soon.<\/p>\n<h3>Update<\/h3>\n<p>ARRGH! \u00a0OK, I&#8217;m now running the 64-bit version and I get this message:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024\" title=\"Confusing IE9 Install Dialog\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2.jpg\" alt=\"A confusing IE9 install dialog\" width=\"492\" height=\"190\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2.jpg 492w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2-300x115.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2-150x57.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Which again, suggests something quite complicated and scary while giving me very little help. \u00a0At this point I&#8217;m thinking:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What customized settings does this install include? \u00a0What will it change?<\/li>\n<li>What additional programs will it install?<\/li>\n<li>Is there an option to not install the additional programs?<\/li>\n<li>Is there a version that doesn&#8217;t include customized settings and additional programs?<\/li>\n<li>And if so where do I get it from?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>At least I get a link to the license terms but at this point I&#8217;m still clicking cancel. \u00a0I&#8217;ve been bitten before by &#8220;additional programs&#8221; being installed and I don&#8217;t trust Microsoft not to mess up my system.<\/p>\n<p>Back to watching the rugby.<\/p>\n",
