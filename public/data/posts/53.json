This will mean that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The URL will remain the same.<\/li>\n<li>EXCEPT&#8230;if you read a feed this will probably be at a new URL (probably <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/feed\/\">https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/feed\/<\/a>).  As this is a new feed you may initially see posts that you&#8217;ve already seen.<\/li>\n<li>There will be a new look &#8211; which may change again in the near future.  (I&#8217;m working on a Magic Roundabout, road-sign styled theme.  But my graphic design skills aren&#8217;t much good and I don&#8217;t really have the time!  We&#8217;ll see).<\/li>\n<li>You may need a new login to submit comments.  I&#8217;m reviewing how to play this one.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Apologies for the inconvenience.  A detailed explanation (the long of it) is below.<\/p>\n<p>I actually first started Blogging several years ago &#8211; I was an &#8220;early adopter&#8221; if you like.  I made a few posts and then gave up &#8211; partly out of embarassment.<\/p>\n<p>Last year my writing took off, partly as a form of therapy during a difficult time of life, partly as a way to track and report what was going on with me health wise, and it&#8217;s just bumbled on since then.  Regular readers will know that it&#8217;s mostly notes to self that I hope will be informative\/interesting to others, and I hope that my writing will continue in that form.<\/p>\n<p>And alongside this I&#8217;m a big fan off Google&#8217;s online services. \u00a0I know that some think they&#8217;re evil, but things like GMail and Google Reader are so feature-rich and easy to use&#8230;and growing in features too&#8230;that I&#8217;m hooked.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The one service that, in my opinion, hasn&#8217;t kept up and that suffers from being Google&#8217;s, is Blogger &#8211; the software that publishes this blog. \u00a0Specific niggles would be:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Pages are big and take long to download<\/li>\n<li>Templates are tricky to edit (even for a relative expert like me!)<\/li>\n<li>Photos from URLs are a nightmare to add and integration with Google&#8217;s own Picasaweb and the competitor&#8217;s Flickr is non-existent.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>I&#8217;ve recently started hosting my own, private journal over at WordPress.com and it&#8217;s REALLY impressed me. \u00a0It&#8217;s fast, it uses good, open standards, it&#8217;s got a great dashboard (and an even better one with v2.7 which is awesome!) and it&#8217;s being developed at quite a rate of knots.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>So shifting &#8220;Magic Roundabouts&#8230;&#8221; is a no-brainer for me. \u00a0There&#8217;s a little work to do, but WordPress even imports from Blogger &#8211; comments, users and all.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>There MAY in fact be two shifts. \u00a0I&#8217;m contemplating where to host but want to move quick. \u00a0In all cases, I&#8217;ll keep you posted.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Thanks for reading and for bearing with us during non-essential maintenance.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

This will mean that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The URL will remain the same.<\/li>\n<li>EXCEPT&#8230;if you read a feed this will probably be at a new URL (probably <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/feed\/\">https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/feed\/<\/a>).  As this is a new feed you may initially see posts that you&#8217;ve already seen.<\/li>\n<li>There will be a new look &#8211; which may change again in the near future.  (I&#8217;m working on a Magic Roundabout, road-sign styled theme.  But my graphic design skills aren&#8217;t much good and I don&#8217;t really have the time!  We&#8217;ll see).<\/li>\n<li>You may need a new login to submit comments.  I&#8217;m reviewing how to play this one.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Apologies for the inconvenience.  A detailed explanation (the long of it) is below.<\/p>\n<p>I actually first started Blogging several years ago &#8211; I was an &#8220;early adopter&#8221; if you like.  I made a few posts and then gave up &#8211; partly out of embarassment.<\/p>\n<p>Last year my writing took off, partly as a form of therapy during a difficult time of life, partly as a way to track and report what was going on with me health wise, and it&#8217;s just bumbled on since then.  Regular readers will know that it&#8217;s mostly notes to self that I hope will be informative\/interesting to others, and I hope that my writing will continue in that form.<\/p>\n<p>And alongside this I&#8217;m a big fan off Google&#8217;s online services. \u00a0I know that some think they&#8217;re evil, but things like GMail and Google Reader are so feature-rich and easy to use&#8230;and growing in features too&#8230;that I&#8217;m hooked.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The one service that, in my opinion, hasn&#8217;t kept up and that suffers from being Google&#8217;s, is Blogger &#8211; the software that publishes this blog. \u00a0Specific niggles would be:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Pages are big and take long to download<\/li>\n<li>Templates are tricky to edit (even for a relative expert like me!)<\/li>\n<li>Photos from URLs are a nightmare to add and integration with Google&#8217;s own Picasaweb and the competitor&#8217;s Flickr is non-existent.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>I&#8217;ve recently started hosting my own, private journal over at WordPress.com and it&#8217;s REALLY impressed me. \u00a0It&#8217;s fast, it uses good, open standards, it&#8217;s got a great dashboard (and an even better one with v2.7 which is awesome!) and it&#8217;s being developed at quite a rate of knots.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>So shifting &#8220;Magic Roundabouts&#8230;&#8221; is a no-brainer for me. \u00a0There&#8217;s a little work to do, but WordPress even imports from Blogger &#8211; comments, users and all.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>There MAY in fact be two shifts. \u00a0I&#8217;m contemplating where to host but want to move quick. \u00a0In all cases, I&#8217;ll keep you posted.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Thanks for reading and for bearing with us during non-essential maintenance.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

We don&#8217;t like them because we know them &#8211; we like them because we think they do really good music!<\/p>\n<p>They are on the verge of releasing their second album and have just released a freely downloadable EP.  Take a look over at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/ikomusic\">http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/ikomusic<\/a>.  To get the EP you&#8217;ll have to email    ikoauto@ikomusic.com with your name in the subject line.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Social Web<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Web 2.0, the social web, networking, life streaming&#8230;whatever you choose to call it I&#8217;m quite interested in how people use web-based tools to interact, and I&#8217;ve occasionally posted about this in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Lots of people remain skeptical.  Facebook is popular but anything else seems to raise eyebrows and questions about what the point is and why it&#8217;s so complicated.  My wife is sometimes amongst these.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Good &#8211; Ravelry<\/span><\/p>\n<p>But for some there is this thing called the &#8220;Killer App&#8221;.  The one little website or program that gets you excited because it has a real use.  And some of my female friends (including Sally) have been getting excited about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/\">Ravelry<\/a>.  Ravelry is online social-networking for knitters.  You can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>log what bits of wool you&#8217;ve got;<\/li>\n<li>log what projects you&#8217;re working on and your progress with them &#8211; linking to the bits of wool you&#8217;re using in that project;<\/li>\n<li>register who your contacts\/friends are;<\/li>\n<li>see what your friends are making and what their progress is;<\/li>\n<li>view and download patterns.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And so on.  There are lots of cool things you can do with the information on Ravelry too, such as, if you have some wool, you can look up what other people are making with that type\/make\/colour of wool and use it as inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s brilliant site.  A really good example of how the web can bring like-minded people together to share ideas and inspire and encourage one another.  And the best thing is that it&#8217;s NOT full of techie people and it&#8217;s drawn in people who probably wouldn&#8217;t normally use the web for this sort of interaction.<\/p>\n<p>Well done Ravelry!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Bad &#8211; Amazon.com<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is really an excuse for a website rant.  I&#8217;m making a vague tie-in to the social-web theme by claiming that Amazon&#8217;s expansion into social-networking-type activities is killing it.<\/p>\n<p>Well, actually, maybe it was already dead.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s remind ourselves about Amazon.  It was one of the first big online retailers, selling books, music, DVD&#8217;s and so on to the masses across the world.<\/p>\n<p>It has since expanded to sell all manner of things, not just from its own warehouses but from a large number of other &#8220;marketplace&#8221; retailers.  It has a complex product reviewing system and, wish lists and customized recommendations.<\/p>\n<p>It was brilliant, quick, easy to use, and sold lots of things that you just couldn&#8217;t find elsewhere.  And cheap too!<\/p>\n<p>This is all well and good, but it&#8217;s starting to go a little far and, as a result, Amazon&#8217;s website is now complete information overload!!!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d love to paste screen shots but they&#8217;re technically copyrighted to Amazon, so I won&#8217;t.  I will try to describe.  There are some long lists here&#8230;for which I make no apology.<\/p>\n<p>The homepage tells me about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>delivery (and restrictions on delivery)<\/li>\n<li>VAT rates dropped<\/li>\n<li>link to personalised recommendations<\/li>\n<li>link to what to do if I&#8217;m a new customer<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Your Amazon.co.uk&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Deals of the Week<\/li>\n<li>Gift Certificates<\/li>\n<li>Gifts and Wish lists<\/li>\n<li>Search<\/li>\n<li>MP3 downloads<\/li>\n<li>Clearance shoes<\/li>\n<li>Gift certificates (Again)<\/li>\n<li>What other customers are looking at Right Now<\/li>\n<li>Festive streals<\/li>\n<li>New MP3 store<\/li>\n<li>Gift certificates (in case I didn&#8217;t get it the first two times)<\/li>\n<li>Clothing<\/li>\n<li>Phillips Imageo candles (2 for \u00a335)<\/li>\n<li>and all that before I scroll down at which point I get to see Amazon exclusives, email settings, selling and buying stuff on Amazon, more to explore (do I need any more?), web services for developers, perfect gifts for him, UnderArmour performance apparel, Acer notebooks, best sellers in knitwear, shop kickers shoes, powerballs, health and beauty deals of the week, what customers are wishing for in DVD, a Sky TV advert, find great gifts for all the family, featured stores, where&#8217;s my stuff, delivery and returns, help pages, my recent history and a load of inter-site links.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Phew. Oh, and there&#8217;s a list of different shop areas to browse, like Music, Books, Electronics, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Most of this is not what I want to see at all.  I just want to buy a book and then track the order.<\/p>\n<p>First thing then.  I want to buy a book I&#8217;ve seen called &#8220;Living Africa&#8221;.  A quick search for this is simple (hooray!) and results are shown in a nice clean search results page with little clutter.  This is better.  So I select the item I&#8217;m after.<\/p>\n<p>One thing that bugs me about Amazon&#8217;s marketplace is that it&#8217;s not always clear if Amazon are going to ship you the item themselves  or if it will come from a smaller retailer that hasn&#8217;t yet gained my trust.  A small note informs me that this will be dispatched by Amazon (and it&#8217;s \u00a315 than we saw it in the shops for&#8230;bargain!).  While I&#8217;m hear, I think, I may as well check out the customer reviews, to see if it&#8217;s any good.<\/p>\n<p>And&#8230;AAARGRH!  I then get information overload again!  Customer reviews is now 4 pages down the screen.  Here&#8217;s what else I can see from the product page:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information about the Amazon Prime programme<\/li>\n<li>My shopping basket<\/li>\n<li>2 lots of information on delivery<\/li>\n<li>Wish list, wedding list and tell a friend buttons<\/li>\n<li>More buying choices (new and used from other retailers)&#8230;.twice!<\/li>\n<li>Details of other editions<\/li>\n<li>Details of which promotions this book is a part of<\/li>\n<li>Details of another book that is often bought together with this one<\/li>\n<li>List of other things that people who bought this book also bought<\/li>\n<li>Product details (a page and a half down) including more links to other editions and links to update product details and give feedback on images<\/li>\n<li>Sponsored links<\/li>\n<li>Product Description (now two and a half pages down)<\/li>\n<li>Other Africa-related products<\/li>\n<li>Tags (suggested by others and the ability to add tags)<\/li>\n<li>What customers buy after viewing this item<\/li>\n<li>Customer reviews (yay!)<\/li>\n<li>Customer discussions<\/li>\n<li>Listmania<\/li>\n<li>Look for similar items by category<\/li>\n<li>Look for similar items by subject<\/li>\n<li>Feedback on the details of this product<\/li>\n<li>Links to other Amazon &#8220;stores&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Sky TV advert<\/li>\n<li>Where&#8217;s my stuff, delivery and returns and help pages<\/li>\n<li>Your recent history<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Flip!  All I want to do is buy a book!  Don&#8217;t get me wrong.  Some of this is really useful.  But there&#8217;s just too much on one page.  I went back just now to look at the tags section and couldn&#8217;t find it in the 8-screens full of information.  What good is any nugget of information if it&#8217;s drowned out by a forest of other text, links and graphics?<\/p>\n<p>And why would I want to tag a product in a shop anyway?  It&#8217;s great that Amazon remember things that I&#8217;ve looked at recently so that I can find them again, but why would I want to assign keywords to something in a shop?<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s lots of duplicated information (mostly related products presented in a myriad of ways) and the basic information isn&#8217;t prominent enough.<\/p>\n<p>OK, so I placed an order (which I&#8217;m sure happened without a confirmation screen), and I later want to check the status of it.  I&#8217;ve since logged out and navigated back to the front page.<\/p>\n<p>Now, where&#8217;s the<br \/>\nlogin button.  Go on &#8211; check my list of what&#8217;s on the front page and see if you can see a log in link!  There isn&#8217;t one!  I either have to scroll to the bottom of the page and click &#8220;where&#8217;s my stuff&#8221; or, randomly, click on the text &#8220;personal recommendations&#8221;.  Admittedly, this text is part of the sentence &#8220;Sign in to get personal recommendations&#8221;, but it&#8217;s confused by the fact that the linked text is &#8220;personal recommendations&#8221;, not &#8220;sign in&#8221;.  Where do I sign in if I don&#8217;t want to see personal recommendations?  It&#8217;s like writing:<\/p>\n<p>Sign in to <span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,153);text-decoration:underline;\">get charged by an elephant<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Well, OK, it&#8217;s only <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">slightly<\/span> like that.  You get my point.<\/p>\n<p>Having managed to log in, I find that Amazon have some old credit card details (for cards that have expired) and a load of old addresses that need cleaning out.  Oh, and I can now add a user profile so that I can &#8220;Share information about myself&#8221; and &#8220;Connect with friends and other Amazon customers&#8221;.  Quite why I&#8217;d want to do this I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<p>What I&#8217;m saying is that Amazon&#8217;s site is now plagued by chaotic design, seemingly pointless features and information overload to the extent that I&#8217;m reluctant to use it.<\/p>\n<p>Phew.  That was a long rant.  Sorry.<\/p>\n<p>Christmas is coming.  And for once I think I might be jumping in my car to head to the shops rather than doing everything online.  Maybe a few hours browsing Borders would be nice.  Grab a coffee and get lost in the aisles of books and CD&#8217;s.  Yes, that&#8217;s a plan.<\/p>\n<p>Now if Amazon could deliver me a mellow, fairly-traded milky coffee in the next ten minutes without me having to leave the comfort of my sofa.  THAT would be good!<\/p>\n",

We don&#8217;t like them because we know them &#8211; we like them because we think they do really good music!<\/p>\n<p>They are on the verge of releasing their second album and have just released a freely downloadable EP.  Take a look over at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/ikomusic\">http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/ikomusic<\/a>.  To get the EP you&#8217;ll have to email    ikoauto@ikomusic.com with your name in the subject line.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Social Web<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Web 2.0, the social web, networking, life streaming&#8230;whatever you choose to call it I&#8217;m quite interested in how people use web-based tools to interact, and I&#8217;ve occasionally posted about this in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Lots of people remain skeptical.  Facebook is popular but anything else seems to raise eyebrows and questions about what the point is and why it&#8217;s so complicated.  My wife is sometimes amongst these.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Good &#8211; Ravelry<\/span><\/p>\n<p>But for some there is this thing called the &#8220;Killer App&#8221;.  The one little website or program that gets you excited because it has a real use.  And some of my female friends (including Sally) have been getting excited about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/\">Ravelry<\/a>.  Ravelry is online social-networking for knitters.  You can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>log what bits of wool you&#8217;ve got;<\/li>\n<li>log what projects you&#8217;re working on and your progress with them &#8211; linking to the bits of wool you&#8217;re using in that project;<\/li>\n<li>register who your contacts\/friends are;<\/li>\n<li>see what your friends are making and what their progress is;<\/li>\n<li>view and download patterns.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And so on.  There are lots of cool things you can do with the information on Ravelry too, such as, if you have some wool, you can look up what other people are making with that type\/make\/colour of wool and use it as inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s brilliant site.  A really good example of how the web can bring like-minded people together to share ideas and inspire and encourage one another.  And the best thing is that it&#8217;s NOT full of techie people and it&#8217;s drawn in people who probably wouldn&#8217;t normally use the web for this sort of interaction.<\/p>\n<p>Well done Ravelry!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Bad &#8211; Amazon.com<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is really an excuse for a website rant.  I&#8217;m making a vague tie-in to the social-web theme by claiming that Amazon&#8217;s expansion into social-networking-type activities is killing it.<\/p>\n<p>Well, actually, maybe it was already dead.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s remind ourselves about Amazon.  It was one of the first big online retailers, selling books, music, DVD&#8217;s and so on to the masses across the world.<\/p>\n<p>It has since expanded to sell all manner of things, not just from its own warehouses but from a large number of other &#8220;marketplace&#8221; retailers.  It has a complex product reviewing system and, wish lists and customized recommendations.<\/p>\n<p>It was brilliant, quick, easy to use, and sold lots of things that you just couldn&#8217;t find elsewhere.  And cheap too!<\/p>\n<p>This is all well and good, but it&#8217;s starting to go a little far and, as a result, Amazon&#8217;s website is now complete information overload!!!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d love to paste screen shots but they&#8217;re technically copyrighted to Amazon, so I won&#8217;t.  I will try to describe.  There are some long lists here&#8230;for which I make no apology.<\/p>\n<p>The homepage tells me about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>delivery (and restrictions on delivery)<\/li>\n<li>VAT rates dropped<\/li>\n<li>link to personalised recommendations<\/li>\n<li>link to what to do if I&#8217;m a new customer<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Your Amazon.co.uk&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Deals of the Week<\/li>\n<li>Gift Certificates<\/li>\n<li>Gifts and Wish lists<\/li>\n<li>Search<\/li>\n<li>MP3 downloads<\/li>\n<li>Clearance shoes<\/li>\n<li>Gift certificates (Again)<\/li>\n<li>What other customers are looking at Right Now<\/li>\n<li>Festive streals<\/li>\n<li>New MP3 store<\/li>\n<li>Gift certificates (in case I didn&#8217;t get it the first two times)<\/li>\n<li>Clothing<\/li>\n<li>Phillips Imageo candles (2 for \u00a335)<\/li>\n<li>and all that before I scroll down at which point I get to see Amazon exclusives, email settings, selling and buying stuff on Amazon, more to explore (do I need any more?), web services for developers, perfect gifts for him, UnderArmour performance apparel, Acer notebooks, best sellers in knitwear, shop kickers shoes, powerballs, health and beauty deals of the week, what customers are wishing for in DVD, a Sky TV advert, find great gifts for all the family, featured stores, where&#8217;s my stuff, delivery and returns, help pages, my recent history and a load of inter-site links.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Phew. Oh, and there&#8217;s a list of different shop areas to browse, like Music, Books, Electronics, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Most of this is not what I want to see at all.  I just want to buy a book and then track the order.<\/p>\n<p>First thing then.  I want to buy a book I&#8217;ve seen called &#8220;Living Africa&#8221;.  A quick search for this is simple (hooray!) and results are shown in a nice clean search results page with little clutter.  This is better.  So I select the item I&#8217;m after.<\/p>\n<p>One thing that bugs me about Amazon&#8217;s marketplace is that it&#8217;s not always clear if Amazon are going to ship you the item themselves  or if it will come from a smaller retailer that hasn&#8217;t yet gained my trust.  A small note informs me that this will be dispatched by Amazon (and it&#8217;s \u00a315 than we saw it in the shops for&#8230;bargain!).  While I&#8217;m hear, I think, I may as well check out the customer reviews, to see if it&#8217;s any good.<\/p>\n<p>And&#8230;AAARGRH!  I then get information overload again!  Customer reviews is now 4 pages down the screen.  Here&#8217;s what else I can see from the product page:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information about the Amazon Prime programme<\/li>\n<li>My shopping basket<\/li>\n<li>2 lots of information on delivery<\/li>\n<li>Wish list, wedding list and tell a friend buttons<\/li>\n<li>More buying choices (new and used from other retailers)&#8230;.twice!<\/li>\n<li>Details of other editions<\/li>\n<li>Details of which promotions this book is a part of<\/li>\n<li>Details of another book that is often bought together with this one<\/li>\n<li>List of other things that people who bought this book also bought<\/li>\n<li>Product details (a page and a half down) including more links to other editions and links to update product details and give feedback on images<\/li>\n<li>Sponsored links<\/li>\n<li>Product Description (now two and a half pages down)<\/li>\n<li>Other Africa-related products<\/li>\n<li>Tags (suggested by others and the ability to add tags)<\/li>\n<li>What customers buy after viewing this item<\/li>\n<li>Customer reviews (yay!)<\/li>\n<li>Customer discussions<\/li>\n<li>Listmania<\/li>\n<li>Look for similar items by category<\/li>\n<li>Look for similar items by subject<\/li>\n<li>Feedback on the details of this product<\/li>\n<li>Links to other Amazon &#8220;stores&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Sky TV advert<\/li>\n<li>Where&#8217;s my stuff, delivery and returns and help pages<\/li>\n<li>Your recent history<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Flip!  All I want to do is buy a book!  Don&#8217;t get me wrong.  Some of this is really useful.  But there&#8217;s just too much on one page.  I went back just now to look at the tags section and couldn&#8217;t find it in the 8-screens full of information.  What good is any nugget of information if it&#8217;s drowned out by a forest of other text, links and graphics?<\/p>\n<p>And why would I want to tag a product in a shop anyway?  It&#8217;s great that Amazon remember things that I&#8217;ve looked at recently so that I can find them again, but why would I want to assign keywords to something in a shop?<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s lots of duplicated information (mostly related products presented in a myriad of ways) and the basic information isn&#8217;t prominent enough.<\/p>\n<p>OK, so I placed an order (which I&#8217;m sure happened without a confirmation screen), and I later want to check the status of it.  I&#8217;ve since logged out and navigated back to the front page.<\/p>\n<p>Now, where&#8217;s the<br \/>\nlogin button.  Go on &#8211; check my list of what&#8217;s on the front page and see if you can see a log in link!  There isn&#8217;t one!  I either have to scroll to the bottom of the page and click &#8220;where&#8217;s my stuff&#8221; or, randomly, click on the text &#8220;personal recommendations&#8221;.  Admittedly, this text is part of the sentence &#8220;Sign in to get personal recommendations&#8221;, but it&#8217;s confused by the fact that the linked text is &#8220;personal recommendations&#8221;, not &#8220;sign in&#8221;.  Where do I sign in if I don&#8217;t want to see personal recommendations?  It&#8217;s like writing:<\/p>\n<p>Sign in to <span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,153);text-decoration:underline;\">get charged by an elephant<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Well, OK, it&#8217;s only <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">slightly<\/span> like that.  You get my point.<\/p>\n<p>Having managed to log in, I find that Amazon have some old credit card details (for cards that have expired) and a load of old addresses that need cleaning out.  Oh, and I can now add a user profile so that I can &#8220;Share information about myself&#8221; and &#8220;Connect with friends and other Amazon customers&#8221;.  Quite why I&#8217;d want to do this I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<p>What I&#8217;m saying is that Amazon&#8217;s site is now plagued by chaotic design, seemingly pointless features and information overload to the extent that I&#8217;m reluctant to use it.<\/p>\n<p>Phew.  That was a long rant.  Sorry.<\/p>\n<p>Christmas is coming.  And for once I think I might be jumping in my car to head to the shops rather than doing everything online.  Maybe a few hours browsing Borders would be nice.  Grab a coffee and get lost in the aisles of books and CD&#8217;s.  Yes, that&#8217;s a plan.<\/p>\n<p>Now if Amazon could deliver me a mellow, fairly-traded milky coffee in the next ten minutes without me having to leave the comfort of my sofa.  THAT would be good!<\/p>\n",

Pidgin (IM client), Firefox (and extensions), Anti-Virus, Adobe Reader and Flash, Windows, iTunes&#8230;it&#8217;s incessant!  And it means that it&#8217;s about half an hour from pushing the on button to being able to do anything useful.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I could disable all the auto-updates.  What I&#8217;d really like is to be able to click a button that says &#8220;update all my software now&#8221; and run all the updates at once at a time that is convenient to me.<\/p>\n<p>The auto-update problem is only made worse by my second annoyance.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Progress Bars<\/p>\n<p><\/span>We did a module in my computer science degree about Human-Computer Interaction.  In it we were told that a progress bar should tell you three things:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>How much work has been done.<\/li>\n<li>How much work is left.<\/li>\n<li>How quickly the work is progressing.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Some status bars used to achieve this.  Actually, the best ones were usually multi-progress bars that showed how far a job involving lots of smaller jobs had got.  One bar showed overall progress and the other showed progress of the smaller sub-tasks.  Linux installs were always pretty good for this sort of thing.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve not seen a progress bar that does any of the above three things for years now.  I see progress bars that do all of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>start again from zero once they reach 100%<\/li>\n<li>advance at unsteady rates<\/li>\n<li>stop for a long time at a certain percentage and then suddenly leap<\/li>\n<li>advance at a steady rate but then the work is not complete when they reach 100%<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And what&#8217;s really bad is that we now take this for granted.  I mean, what if your car&#8217;s petrol gague suddenly dropped from 3\/4 full to 1\/8 full?  Or if your washing machine showed it was on the last rinse when really it was still doing the pre-wash?  Would we accept that?<\/p>\n<p>We should be telling our software installer vendors that this is unacceptable.  I&#8217;ve wasted many hours staring at progress bars that are telling me a job is nearly done when it&#8217;s really far from completion.  I&#8217;ve been late home and I&#8217;ve been late to bed because of such things.  I bet you could do analysis that shows that businesses are losing millions of man-hours while people wait for things to complete in this way.<\/p>\n<p>We need progress on progress bars!  Who will stand and join with me to reclaim our %-complete&#8217;s and make them what they once were?<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

Pidgin (IM client), Firefox (and extensions), Anti-Virus, Adobe Reader and Flash, Windows, iTunes&#8230;it&#8217;s incessant!  And it means that it&#8217;s about half an hour from pushing the on button to being able to do anything useful.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I could disable all the auto-updates.  What I&#8217;d really like is to be able to click a button that says &#8220;update all my software now&#8221; and run all the updates at once at a time that is convenient to me.<\/p>\n<p>The auto-update problem is only made worse by my second annoyance.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Progress Bars<\/p>\n<p><\/span>We did a module in my computer science degree about Human-Computer Interaction.  In it we were told that a progress bar should tell you three things:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>How much work has been done.<\/li>\n<li>How much work is left.<\/li>\n<li>How quickly the work is progressing.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Some status bars used to achieve this.  Actually, the best ones were usually multi-progress bars that showed how far a job involving lots of smaller jobs had got.  One bar showed overall progress and the other showed progress of the smaller sub-tasks.  Linux installs were always pretty good for this sort of thing.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve not seen a progress bar that does any of the above three things for years now.  I see progress bars that do all of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>start again from zero once they reach 100%<\/li>\n<li>advance at unsteady rates<\/li>\n<li>stop for a long time at a certain percentage and then suddenly leap<\/li>\n<li>advance at a steady rate but then the work is not complete when they reach 100%<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And what&#8217;s really bad is that we now take this for granted.  I mean, what if your car&#8217;s petrol gague suddenly dropped from 3\/4 full to 1\/8 full?  Or if your washing machine showed it was on the last rinse when really it was still doing the pre-wash?  Would we accept that?<\/p>\n<p>We should be telling our software installer vendors that this is unacceptable.  I&#8217;ve wasted many hours staring at progress bars that are telling me a job is nearly done when it&#8217;s really far from completion.  I&#8217;ve been late home and I&#8217;ve been late to bed because of such things.  I bet you could do analysis that shows that businesses are losing millions of man-hours while people wait for things to complete in this way.<\/p>\n<p>We need progress on progress bars!  Who will stand and join with me to reclaim our %-complete&#8217;s and make them what they once were?<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

So we&#8217;ve not been at home much.  Weekday evenings have been busy as well.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s been going on:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Getting rid of the rats<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We finally think we&#8217;ve tackled the rat problem.  A while ago the man from the council came out again with his boss &#8211; the head of Pest Control &#8211; for a second opinion.  He worked out that the rats were probably getting in from the old &#8220;Stink Pipe&#8221;.  The vent connected to the sewer.  This isn&#8217;t used as a vent any more, as a new pipe had been put on the side of the house, but the it hasn&#8217;t been blocked up.  This gives the rats a free run from the sewer up the wall cavity to our loft.<\/p>\n<p>So, we hacked a hole in the side of the old back wall (which has been knocked through into the extension) and shoved a load of chicken wire into the cavity.  I&#8217;m sure that we have heard the odd scratching since, but there&#8217;s very little sign of rat activity anywhere and this has been the case for a while now.<\/p>\n<p>Problem is that rats have now started to take refuge in our compost bin.<\/p>\n<p>AARRGRGHHH!!!!<\/p>\n<p>In the mean time the last one to die has stopped smelling and we now have a plague of flies again.  Hopefully out last!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Ikea<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also been having furniture fun.  Try to follow this.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re borrowing some furniture from my sister, who is waiting to sell a house so that she can buy a house.  When she moves in to the new, bigger house we can give her &#8220;loaned&#8221; furniture back.  At that point we&#8217;ll need basically a whole bedroom suite, including a bed and wardrobes.  We&#8217;d also promised a sofa to a friend of ours in Bristol.  So whenever we were going to go to Ikea (in Bristol) to buy the bedroom furniture, we were going to hire a van and take the sofa on the same trip.<\/p>\n<p>However, we found the ideal piece of furniture to replace the sofa in a sale.  So we bought that and had to expedite the sofa-taking trip.  As we had the van we figured we may as well pop to Ikea as well.<\/p>\n<p>Now, our last experience of Ikea was not good.  I mean NOT good.  It was horrible and we got only about half of what we went for.  So we were psyching ourselves up for this trip.<\/p>\n<p>It turned out not so bad and we got about a 90% hit rate.  Unfortunately this meant that the two main bits of furniture (bed and wardrobe) were incomplete.  We had a head- and foot-board for the bed but no sides, and the wardrobe lacks some drawer fronts.<\/p>\n<p>So on our trip round the country we stopped off at Ikea Leeds to pick up some bed sides (which were crammed into the car next to a gracious Sally for several hundred miles), but the drawer fronts aren&#8217;t due in the country at all for about 6 weeks.<\/p>\n<p>What we have learned along the way is that Ikea&#8217;s phone service is pretty good.  You can do automated stock checks and, if something&#8217;s out of stock, you can get the store to text you when it comes back in stock!  Rather clever really.<\/p>\n",

So we&#8217;ve not been at home much.  Weekday evenings have been busy as well.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s been going on:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Getting rid of the rats<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We finally think we&#8217;ve tackled the rat problem.  A while ago the man from the council came out again with his boss &#8211; the head of Pest Control &#8211; for a second opinion.  He worked out that the rats were probably getting in from the old &#8220;Stink Pipe&#8221;.  The vent connected to the sewer.  This isn&#8217;t used as a vent any more, as a new pipe had been put on the side of the house, but the it hasn&#8217;t been blocked up.  This gives the rats a free run from the sewer up the wall cavity to our loft.<\/p>\n<p>So, we hacked a hole in the side of the old back wall (which has been knocked through into the extension) and shoved a load of chicken wire into the cavity.  I&#8217;m sure that we have heard the odd scratching since, but there&#8217;s very little sign of rat activity anywhere and this has been the case for a while now.<\/p>\n<p>Problem is that rats have now started to take refuge in our compost bin.<\/p>\n<p>AARRGRGHHH!!!!<\/p>\n<p>In the mean time the last one to die has stopped smelling and we now have a plague of flies again.  Hopefully out last!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Ikea<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also been having furniture fun.  Try to follow this.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re borrowing some furniture from my sister, who is waiting to sell a house so that she can buy a house.  When she moves in to the new, bigger house we can give her &#8220;loaned&#8221; furniture back.  At that point we&#8217;ll need basically a whole bedroom suite, including a bed and wardrobes.  We&#8217;d also promised a sofa to a friend of ours in Bristol.  So whenever we were going to go to Ikea (in Bristol) to buy the bedroom furniture, we were going to hire a van and take the sofa on the same trip.<\/p>\n<p>However, we found the ideal piece of furniture to replace the sofa in a sale.  So we bought that and had to expedite the sofa-taking trip.  As we had the van we figured we may as well pop to Ikea as well.<\/p>\n<p>Now, our last experience of Ikea was not good.  I mean NOT good.  It was horrible and we got only about half of what we went for.  So we were psyching ourselves up for this trip.<\/p>\n<p>It turned out not so bad and we got about a 90% hit rate.  Unfortunately this meant that the two main bits of furniture (bed and wardrobe) were incomplete.  We had a head- and foot-board for the bed but no sides, and the wardrobe lacks some drawer fronts.<\/p>\n<p>So on our trip round the country we stopped off at Ikea Leeds to pick up some bed sides (which were crammed into the car next to a gracious Sally for several hundred miles), but the drawer fronts aren&#8217;t due in the country at all for about 6 weeks.<\/p>\n<p>What we have learned along the way is that Ikea&#8217;s phone service is pretty good.  You can do automated stock checks and, if something&#8217;s out of stock, you can get the store to text you when it comes back in stock!  Rather clever really.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Confession<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Having finally, after many months, confessed to having a Wii and telling the world what I think about it.  It&#8217;s time for the next step of my &#8220;coming out&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>We, after a long period of searching, also bought a Wii Fit!<\/p>\n<p>If you have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about then take a look at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nintendo.com\/wiifit\">the Nintendo Site<\/a> about it.  In short, it&#8217;s a balance board.  A small and sturdy (and quite heavy) plinth that you stand on and it works out how much you weight and tracks you as you shift your centre of balance.<\/p>\n<p>They were, at the time, pretty hard to get hold of.  Yet lots of my colleagues at work were raving about them, and the thought of an interactive way to keep fit in your front room sounded pretty good.  And we figured that if the quality of the Wii itself was anything to go by, this should be another more-than-half-decent Nintendo product.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Balance Boards and Body Tests<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The reality turned out to be pretty good too.  The Balance Board is robust and accurate and easy to set up and get going.  The Wii Fit game is good too, after telling it who you are, how old you and, and a few other things (you only do this setup once), you get to do a &#8220;Body Test&#8221;, which weighs you and gives you some balance tests to do.  At the end of the test you are presented (in quite humourous fashion, with your Wii Fit Age.  This is a number between 20 and 99 that represents your &#8216;fitness&#8217;.  Sort of.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;re supposed to repeat the body test daily and the Wii Fit tracks your weight and Wii Fit Age, and you can set targets.  The little animated version of the balance board that talks you through it all, also gives you fitness tips.  These get quite dull after a while and I wish now that there was an option to turn them off.<\/p>\n<p>The Wii Fit also tracks how long you spend on it and rewards you with unlocking extra features as you use it more.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Playing!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The game then allows you to start exercising.  There are four different types of exercise:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yoga &#8211; an onscreen &#8220;instructor&#8221; shows you a pose and you follow.  The Balance Board tracks how well you&#8217;re balancing and the instructor gives you tips or encouragement in response.  At the end you are scored on how well you balanced.<\/li>\n<li>Strength Exercises &#8211; again, the onscreen instructor shows and you follow, with appropriate feedback and scores at the end.<\/li>\n<li>Balance Games &#8211; skiing, snowboarding, riding a bubble, tightrope walking and a &#8216;sitting still&#8217; game.  All good ways to fine tune control of your centre of gravity.  Thought some are much more fun than others.  Again you are scored on how you perform.<\/li>\n<li>Aerobics &#8211; well, hardly.  But you can do jogging on the spot, step classes and a kind of &#8216;boxercise&#8217; type thing.  Some of this is fun, some is pretty pointless in my opinion.  As always, you are given scores for how well you do.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s very easy to get into and the competetive element with scores and tables showing who&#8217;s the best, is a great motivator.  There are exercises in all categories that I don&#8217;t like (the bubble game and the jogging on the spot being two in particular), but I&#8217;ll happily do a bit of each.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">So much potential<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now, I think this is a good product.  BUT, what I really really wish is that it was a GREAT product.  I&#8217;m really happy with the Wii Fit, but I have a load of criticisms that could be easily fixed that would make it SO much better.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It&#8217;s annoying after a while<\/span>.  The talking instructor and animated balance board really need to go away after about 2 weeks.  They&#8217;re good for helping you in but once you know what you&#8217;re doing there really needs to be an option to turn them off.<\/li>\n<li>The competetive element is hampered by the fact that <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">only one person can play at a time<\/span>.  Things like skiing and snowboarding would be much better if you could quickly change between players.  As it is you have to navigate back out to the profile selection screen, and then back in (past the annoying talking balance board) as the next person.  A simple &#8220;Play this as a different user&#8221; option would go far!<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Wii Fit Age is a bit pointless<\/span>.  There&#8217;s one particular balance exercise that I&#8217;m no good at and which gives me an age of about 40.  All the others give me an age between 25 and 35.  But it varies so wildly that it&#8217;s meaningless, and the program&#8217;s critical comments each time I go up are&#8230;yes&#8230;annoying.  This may be related to the fact that&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It doesn&#8217;t cater well for people who are already fit<\/span>.  I expect if you&#8217;re overweight and unfit then this is a great way to ease yourself into some exercise.  But I&#8217;m about the right weight and I&#8217;m pretty healthy and fit.  Yet it demands that I set a target (lose 2lbs this week to aim for your ideal BMI (Body Mass Index), which probably isn&#8217;t really what I need.  Plus it complains if I have a big dinner and put on a couple of lbs.  Big deal.  Now shut up!!!<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It doesn&#8217;t do programs of exercises<\/span>.  I&#8217;d like it to say Monday &#8211; Yoga and Strength work.  Tuesday &#8211; some aerobics.  Wednesday &#8211; Balance Games.  Thursday Aerobics and Strength.  And so on, and to have it guide me through a program of exercies.  As it is you have to select an exercise &#8211; say, a yoga pose &#8211; do it, get scored on it, then go back to the menu and select the next thing.  Occasionally it suggests that you do a yoga pose and a strength exercise together because they complement each other, but you still have to navigate back through the menus to get to the other exercise.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>So, much as I like it, I&#8217;m looking forward to the rumoured other games that are coming out for the balance board.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s made me much fitter, but the balance games are a lot of fun and the Yoga and strength work is great for my posture and core strength, which I need for cycling.<\/p>\n<p>Sally doesn&#8217;t really like the gym, has free time after work and a lower level of fitness and it&#8217;s been a really good way for her to burn some calories and build some strength.<\/p>\n<p>Those last two paragraphs are testimony to the universal appeal of the Wii Fit.  We both get something from it.  It&#8217;s not a replacement for a gym, or for getting outdoors and doing some real exercise, but it&#8217;s a fun way to do some mild exercise.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s hope there&#8217;s a Wii Fit 2 that addresses some of my gripes and really brings the balance board into it&#8217;s own.<\/p>\n<p>Now where&#8217;s my trainers and the TV remote?<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Getting Wii Fit",
        "content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Confession<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Having finally, after many months, confessed to having a Wii and telling the world what I think about it.  It&#8217;s time for the next step of my &#8220;coming out&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>We, after a long period of searching, also bought a Wii Fit!<\/p>\n<p>If you have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about then take a look at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nintendo.com\/wiifit\">the Nintendo Site<\/a> about it.  In short, it&#8217;s a balance board.  A small and sturdy (and quite heavy) plinth that you stand on and it works out how much you weight and tracks you as you shift your centre of balance.<\/p>\n<p>They were, at the time, pretty hard to get hold of.  Yet lots of my colleagues at work were raving about them, and the thought of an interactive way to keep fit in your front room sounded pretty good.  And we figured that if the quality of the Wii itself was anything to go by, this should be another more-than-half-decent Nintendo product.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Balance Boards and Body Tests<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The reality turned out to be pretty good too.  The Balance Board is robust and accurate and easy to set up and get going.  The Wii Fit game is good too, after telling it who you are, how old you and, and a few other things (you only do this setup once), you get to do a &#8220;Body Test&#8221;, which weighs you and gives you some balance tests to do.  At the end of the test you are presented (in quite humourous fashion, with your Wii Fit Age.  This is a number between 20 and 99 that represents your &#8216;fitness&#8217;.  Sort of.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;re supposed to repeat the body test daily and the Wii Fit tracks your weight and Wii Fit Age, and you can set targets.  The little animated version of the balance board that talks you through it all, also gives you fitness tips.  These get quite dull after a while and I wish now that there was an option to turn them off.<\/p>\n<p>The Wii Fit also tracks how long you spend on it and rewards you with unlocking extra features as you use it more.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Playing!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The game then allows you to start exercising.  There are four different types of exercise:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yoga &#8211; an onscreen &#8220;instructor&#8221; shows you a pose and you follow.  The Balance Board tracks how well you&#8217;re balancing and the instructor gives you tips or encouragement in response.  At the end you are scored on how well you balanced.<\/li>\n<li>Strength Exercises &#8211; again, the onscreen instructor shows and you follow, with appropriate feedback and scores at the end.<\/li>\n<li>Balance Games &#8211; skiing, snowboarding, riding a bubble, tightrope walking and a &#8216;sitting still&#8217; game.  All good ways to fine tune control of your centre of gravity.  Thought some are much more fun than others.  Again you are scored on how you perform.<\/li>\n<li>Aerobics &#8211; well, hardly.  But you can do jogging on the spot, step classes and a kind of &#8216;boxercise&#8217; type thing.  Some of this is fun, some is pretty pointless in my opinion.  As always, you are given scores for how well you do.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s very easy to get into and the competetive element with scores and tables showing who&#8217;s the best, is a great motivator.  There are exercises in all categories that I don&#8217;t like (the bubble game and the jogging on the spot being two in particular), but I&#8217;ll happily do a bit of each.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">So much potential<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now, I think this is a good product.  BUT, what I really really wish is that it was a GREAT product.  I&#8217;m really happy with the Wii Fit, but I have a load of criticisms that could be easily fixed that would make it SO much better.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It&#8217;s annoying after a while<\/span>.  The talking instructor and animated balance board really need to go away after about 2 weeks.  They&#8217;re good for helping you in but once you know what you&#8217;re doing there really needs to be an option to turn them off.<\/li>\n<li>The competetive element is hampered by the fact that <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">only one person can play at a time<\/span>.  Things like skiing and snowboarding would be much better if you could quickly change between players.  As it is you have to navigate back out to the profile selection screen, and then back in (past the annoying talking balance board) as the next person.  A simple &#8220;Play this as a different user&#8221; option would go far!<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Wii Fit Age is a bit pointless<\/span>.  There&#8217;s one particular balance exercise that I&#8217;m no good at and which gives me an age of about 40.  All the others give me an age between 25 and 35.  But it varies so wildly that it&#8217;s meaningless, and the program&#8217;s critical comments each time I go up are&#8230;yes&#8230;annoying.  This may be related to the fact that&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It doesn&#8217;t cater well for people who are already fit<\/span>.  I expect if you&#8217;re overweight and unfit then this is a great way to ease yourself into some exercise.  But I&#8217;m about the right weight and I&#8217;m pretty healthy and fit.  Yet it demands that I set a target (lose 2lbs this week to aim for your ideal BMI (Body Mass Index), which probably isn&#8217;t really what I need.  Plus it complains if I have a big dinner and put on a couple of lbs.  Big deal.  Now shut up!!!<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It doesn&#8217;t do programs of exercises<\/span>.  I&#8217;d like it to say Monday &#8211; Yoga and Strength work.  Tuesday &#8211; some aerobics.  Wednesday &#8211; Balance Games.  Thursday Aerobics and Strength.  And so on, and to have it guide me through a program of exercies.  As it is you have to select an exercise &#8211; say, a yoga pose &#8211; do it, get scored on it, then go back to the menu and select the next thing.  Occasionally it suggests that you do a yoga pose and a strength exercise together because they complement each other, but you still have to navigate back through the menus to get to the other exercise.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>So, much as I like it, I&#8217;m looking forward to the rumoured other games that are coming out for the balance board.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s made me much fitter, but the balance games are a lot of fun and the Yoga and strength work is great for my posture and core strength, which I need for cycling.<\/p>\n<p>Sally doesn&#8217;t really like the gym, has free time after work and a lower level of fitness and it&#8217;s been a really good way for her to burn some calories and build some strength.<\/p>\n<p>Those last two paragraphs are testimony to the universal appeal of the Wii Fit.  We both get something from it.  It&#8217;s not a replacement for a gym, or for getting outdoors and doing some real exercise, but it&#8217;s a fun way to do some mild exercise.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s hope there&#8217;s a Wii Fit 2 that addresses some of my gripes and really brings the balance board into it&#8217;s own.<\/p>\n<p>Now where&#8217;s my trainers and the TV remote?<\/p>\n",

I wish.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>But I think that it&#8217;s important to promote cycling, make people realise that you don&#8217;t have to fire up your car to do that short journey. \u00a0I&#8217;m aware that not everyone can commute by bike like I can, and that if you have children or luggage then it&#8217;s not really an available option. \u00a0But there are LOTS of journeys that could be done by bike, and there are lots of good reasons to do them by bike!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>This process has been a real challenge to my faith. \u00a0Cycling isn&#8217;t the only good news I believe I have to share. \u00a0I&#8217;m willing to become renowned in my workplace for being a cyclist? \u00a0Am I willing to become renowned for being a follower of Jesus? \u00a0That&#8217;s a whole world more scary.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Somehow, talking about faith is awkward and embarassing. \u00a0Our culture isn&#8217;t one where we talk much about beliefs, especially if they are controversial. \u00a0Talking about cycling, or what music you like, or what football team you support is OK. \u00a0But I wonder what would happen if I decided that I needed to be, not a Lance Armstrong, but a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Billy_Graham\">Billy Graham<\/a>; telling people not about two-wheels, but about hope and joy and goodness. \u00a0What would the reaction be? \u00a0Would it even be acceptable? \u00a0Could I use my sports and social club to help promote a prayer group or to advertise church services and events?<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I just don&#8217;t know, and, at the moment, I don&#8217;t really know how to start finding out. \u00a0But I should take courage (ah&#8230;that&#8217;s where en<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">courage<\/span>ment comes from);\u00a0I&#8217;ve now been an evangelist, it wasn&#8217;t that scary, it got mixed reactions, but the whole cycle challenge experience has given me a new confidence to talk, not just about cycling, but about my faith too.<\/div>\n",

I wish.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>But I think that it&#8217;s important to promote cycling, make people realise that you don&#8217;t have to fire up your car to do that short journey. \u00a0I&#8217;m aware that not everyone can commute by bike like I can, and that if you have children or luggage then it&#8217;s not really an available option. \u00a0But there are LOTS of journeys that could be done by bike, and there are lots of good reasons to do them by bike!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>This process has been a real challenge to my faith. \u00a0Cycling isn&#8217;t the only good news I believe I have to share. \u00a0I&#8217;m willing to become renowned in my workplace for being a cyclist? \u00a0Am I willing to become renowned for being a follower of Jesus? \u00a0That&#8217;s a whole world more scary.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Somehow, talking about faith is awkward and embarassing. \u00a0Our culture isn&#8217;t one where we talk much about beliefs, especially if they are controversial. \u00a0Talking about cycling, or what music you like, or what football team you support is OK. \u00a0But I wonder what would happen if I decided that I needed to be, not a Lance Armstrong, but a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Billy_Graham\">Billy Graham<\/a>; telling people not about two-wheels, but about hope and joy and goodness. \u00a0What would the reaction be? \u00a0Would it even be acceptable? \u00a0Could I use my sports and social club to help promote a prayer group or to advertise church services and events?<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I just don&#8217;t know, and, at the moment, I don&#8217;t really know how to start finding out. \u00a0But I should take courage (ah&#8230;that&#8217;s where en<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">courage<\/span>ment comes from);\u00a0I&#8217;ve now been an evangelist, it wasn&#8217;t that scary, it got mixed reactions, but the whole cycle challenge experience has given me a new confidence to talk, not just about cycling, but about my faith too.<\/div>\n",

Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes? <\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sup\"><\/span>Those who linger over wine, who go to sample bowls of mixed wine. <\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sup\"><\/span>Do not gaze at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly!<span class=\"sup\"> <\/span> In the end it bites like a snake and poisons like a viper.<span class=\"sup\"><\/span> Your eyes will see strange sights and your mind imagine confusing things.<span class=\"sup\"><\/span> You will be like one sleeping on the high seas, lying on top of the rigging.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sup\"><\/span>&#8216;They hit me,&#8217; you will say, &#8216;but I&#8217;m not hurt! They beat me, but I don&#8217;t feel it! When will I wake up so I can find another drink?&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This advice, all highly relevant in our world today, is straight from the Bible, from the book of Proverbs.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s amazing, both that wisdom from thousands of years ago is still relevant today, and that human nature has moved on so little in that time.<\/p>\n",
