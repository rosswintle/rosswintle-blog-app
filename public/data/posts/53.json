                "rendered": "<p>Fact: I just switched my cloud storage solution&#8217;s billing from monthly to annual and paid for a year up front. Why? Well, mostly because of the volatile pound.<\/p>\n<p>If you run a non-UK-based subscription service, such as a SAAS or product with software licensing, this could be a good marketing opportunity that could pay for your summer holiday, and here&#8217;s why.<\/p>\n<h3>In? Out? Shake it all about?<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure how widely it&#8217;s known in the rest of the world, but the UK is currently part of a thing called the European Union (EU), which essentially means we share some administration and trade and free-movement agreements with the rest of Europe.<\/p>\n<p>And on June 23rd we&#8217;re having a referendum on our membership of the EU. And <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589\">the polls are showing it to be a Very Close Thing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m no economics expert, but I know that market stability is based very much on understanding what the future will look like politically and economically. And the uncertainty about the EU is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/volatile-pound-underscores-market-jitters-as-brexit-vote-looms-1465326028\">making our currency a little volatile<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, many important and far more knowledgable people than I have said that there is a significant economic risk to leaving: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-36273448\">the governor of the bank of England<\/a>, our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36459451\">prime minister<\/a>, our &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2016\/may\/25\/ifs-brexit-extend-austerity-budget-deficit-eu-referendum\">Institute for Fiscal Studies<\/a>&#8220;, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/news\/politics\/670496\/Angela-Markel-EU-referendum-needless-risk-David-Cameron\">German Chanellor<\/a>, and others.<\/p>\n<p>And if there&#8217;s an economic shock, then our pound will almost certainly fall.<\/p>\n<h3>Give me deals!<\/h3>\n<p>If the pound falls, it become expensive for me to buy things in other currencies.<\/p>\n<p>So I can get some insurance on price by buying things in other currencies now.<\/p>\n<p>So I went annual with my cloud storage to minimise the risk of it becoming more expensive. And as I did so I was thinking &#8220;what other services might I be able to extend for a year at this point?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>And I just wondered if there&#8217;s something in here that&#8217;s helpful for software\/service providers and their customers: offer them a &#8220;Pre-Brexit Price Risk-Reduction renewal&#8221; and allow them to extend their subscriptions for a year before the 23rd June, regardless of their renewal date.<\/p>\n<p>It could get you some cash in the bank\u00a0and some happy customers if you get it right!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Fact: I just switched my cloud storage solution&#8217;s billing from monthly to annual and paid for a year up front. Why? Well, mostly because of the volatile pound.<\/p>\n<p>If you run a non-UK-based subscription service, such as a SAAS or product with software licensing, this could be a good marketing opportunity that could pay for your summer holiday, and here&#8217;s why.<\/p>\n<h3>In? Out? Shake it all about?<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure how widely it&#8217;s known in the rest of the world, but the UK is currently part of a thing called the European Union (EU), which essentially means we share some administration and trade and free-movement agreements with the rest of Europe.<\/p>\n<p>And on June 23rd we&#8217;re having a referendum on our membership of the EU. And <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589\">the polls are showing it to be a Very Close Thing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m no economics expert, but I know that market stability is based very much on understanding what the future will look like politically and economically. And the uncertainty about the EU is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/volatile-pound-underscores-market-jitters-as-brexit-vote-looms-1465326028\">making our currency a little volatile<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, many important and far more knowledgable people than I have said that there is a significant economic risk to leaving: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-36273448\">the governor of the bank of England<\/a>, our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36459451\">prime minister<\/a>, our &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2016\/may\/25\/ifs-brexit-extend-austerity-budget-deficit-eu-referendum\">Institute for Fiscal Studies<\/a>&#8220;, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/news\/politics\/670496\/Angela-Markel-EU-referendum-needless-risk-David-Cameron\">German Chanellor<\/a>, and others.<\/p>\n<p>And if there&#8217;s an economic shock, then our pound will almost certainly fall.<\/p>\n<h3>Give me deals!<\/h3>\n<p>If the pound falls, it become expensive for me to buy things in other currencies.<\/p>\n<p>So I can get some insurance on price by buying things in other currencies now.<\/p>\n<p>So I went annual with my cloud storage to minimise the risk of it becoming more expensive. And as I did so I was thinking &#8220;what other services might I be able to extend for a year at this point?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>And I just wondered if there&#8217;s something in here that&#8217;s helpful for software\/service providers and their customers: offer them a &#8220;Pre-Brexit Price Risk-Reduction renewal&#8221; and allow them to extend their subscriptions for a year before the 23rd June, regardless of their renewal date.<\/p>\n<p>It could get you some cash in the bank\u00a0and some happy customers if you get it right!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p><em>TL;DR: We&#8217;re coding for the web all wrong. And it&#8217;s mostly because of the languages we&#8217;re using. We&#8217;re piling hack upon hack upon hack. Good&nbsp;coding principles and practices are becoming more common in web development, but I can&#8217;t help wishing&nbsp;we could take a few steps back and start with tools that help us write better code in the first place.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>WARNING: contains opinions. &nbsp;Some of which may be uninformed.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone involved in software that knows me well will know a couple of things about me:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I have a different approach to web development&nbsp;than a lot of people &#8211; mostly because I have a background in safety critical software, which is written very differently to code for a website.<\/li>\n<li>Despite that background, I&#8217;m pretty pragmatic. Horses are for courses. Tools are just tools.<\/li>\n<li>(Because of that background) l hate JavaScript. Any language that guesses what you want to do seems to me to be unhelpful. PHP is better, but far from perfect.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I mostly write PHP for back end code&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">because<\/span> I&#8217;m pragmatic. It&#8217;s not perfect. It&#8217;s slow. It promotes better discipline than JavaScript. But it&#8217;s also relatively accessible, hugely widespread, easy to deploy.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m always looking to write better PHP. Which is why I&#8217;m currently reading <a href=\"https:\/\/adamwathan.me\/refactoring-to-collections\/\">Adam Wathan&#8217;s Refactoring to Collections<\/a>. A book which tries to apply some declarative&nbsp;programming principles to PHP coding. &nbsp;This, in short, means he&#8217;s come up with some nice ways to write code that says what you more want to get done, and less HOW to get it done.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s great and it&#8217;s already transforming the way that I think.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;and maybe this is addressed in later chapters that I&#8217;ve not read yet&#8230;I can&#8217;t read stuff like this without thinking about simplicity and performance. Here&#8217;s me wanting to do some simple transformations on some arrays, and I need to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>use composer to pull down the package that contains the Collection class;<\/li>\n<li>load an autoloader that loads the dependencies;<\/li>\n<li>probably, in doing so, include a load of code that I&#8217;m never going to run.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And thats before we even write a line of code. Once we have some code written using collections, method chaining, etc, then because I&#8217;m using other people&#8217;s implementations of higher-order functions, I&#8217;m totally removed from how efficient and scalable that code is.<\/p>\n<p>This is a more general problem with declarative programming. It&#8217;s really nice and easy to read, but you don&#8217;t have the implementation detail. So how are you to know if using these collections going to make code that scales?<\/p>\n<p>I find myself thinking &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t collections part of the standard library of PHP?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because, PHP isn&#8217;t a declarative language, it&#8217;s an imperative language. Adding collections to it is a fudge that makes it something that it isn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>So if you really want to do declarative programming nicely, you have two options: use a different language (options limited), or pile layer upon layer of abstraction on top of an existing language to make it something that it isn&#8217;t (options many and varied!).<\/p>\n<p>Which is exactly what we do with JavaScript: all these frameworks and transpilers that we have are really compensating for the fact that vanilla JavaScript is a terribly loose language that needs additional structure and discipline put on top of it to make it something you can work with.<\/p>\n<p>I do lament that the web &#8211; and that I specifically &#8211; ended up with PHP and JavaScript. And I long to learn Elm (yes, complied to JS) or Ruby or Go or Python instead.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m pragmatic too. PHP and JavaScript are the tools I have to work with right now until I learn something new.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I love that coding is so easy and accessible and these open languages have transformed my life for the better. I&#8217;m also really enjoying Refactoring to Collections and it will transform how I code.

        "content": "<p><em>TL;DR: We&#8217;re coding for the web all wrong. And it&#8217;s mostly because of the languages we&#8217;re using. We&#8217;re piling hack upon hack upon hack. Good&nbsp;coding principles and practices are becoming more common in web development, but I can&#8217;t help wishing&nbsp;we could take a few steps back and start with tools that help us write better code in the first place.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>WARNING: contains opinions. &nbsp;Some of which may be uninformed.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone involved in software that knows me well will know a couple of things about me:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I have a different approach to web development&nbsp;than a lot of people &#8211; mostly because I have a background in safety critical software, which is written very differently to code for a website.<\/li>\n<li>Despite that background, I&#8217;m pretty pragmatic. Horses are for courses. Tools are just tools.<\/li>\n<li>(Because of that background) l hate JavaScript. Any language that guesses what you want to do seems to me to be unhelpful. PHP is better, but far from perfect.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I mostly write PHP for back end code&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">because<\/span> I&#8217;m pragmatic. It&#8217;s not perfect. It&#8217;s slow. It promotes better discipline than JavaScript. But it&#8217;s also relatively accessible, hugely widespread, easy to deploy.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m always looking to write better PHP. Which is why I&#8217;m currently reading <a href=\"https:\/\/adamwathan.me\/refactoring-to-collections\/\">Adam Wathan&#8217;s Refactoring to Collections<\/a>. A book which tries to apply some declarative&nbsp;programming principles to PHP coding. &nbsp;This, in short, means he&#8217;s come up with some nice ways to write code that says what you more want to get done, and less HOW to get it done.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s great and it&#8217;s already transforming the way that I think.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;and maybe this is addressed in later chapters that I&#8217;ve not read yet&#8230;I can&#8217;t read stuff like this without thinking about simplicity and performance. Here&#8217;s me wanting to do some simple transformations on some arrays, and I need to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>use composer to pull down the package that contains the Collection class;<\/li>\n<li>load an autoloader that loads the dependencies;<\/li>\n<li>probably, in doing so, include a load of code that I&#8217;m never going to run.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And thats before we even write a line of code. Once we have some code written using collections, method chaining, etc, then because I&#8217;m using other people&#8217;s implementations of higher-order functions, I&#8217;m totally removed from how efficient and scalable that code is.<\/p>\n<p>This is a more general problem with declarative programming. It&#8217;s really nice and easy to read, but you don&#8217;t have the implementation detail. So how are you to know if using these collections going to make code that scales?<\/p>\n<p>I find myself thinking &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t collections part of the standard library of PHP?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because, PHP isn&#8217;t a declarative language, it&#8217;s an imperative language. Adding collections to it is a fudge that makes it something that it isn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>So if you really want to do declarative programming nicely, you have two options: use a different language (options limited), or pile layer upon layer of abstraction on top of an existing language to make it something that it isn&#8217;t (options many and varied!).<\/p>\n<p>Which is exactly what we do with JavaScript: all these frameworks and transpilers that we have are really compensating for the fact that vanilla JavaScript is a terribly loose language that needs additional structure and discipline put on top of it to make it something you can work with.<\/p>\n<p>I do lament that the web &#8211; and that I specifically &#8211; ended up with PHP and JavaScript. And I long to learn Elm (yes, complied to JS) or Ruby or Go or Python instead.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m pragmatic too. PHP and JavaScript are the tools I have to work with right now until I learn something new.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I love that coding is so easy and accessible and these open languages have transformed my life for the better. I&#8217;m also really enjoying Refactoring to Collections and it will transform how I code. And I&#8217;m indebted to and hugely respectful of the open source project creators and maintainers and documenters and book writers that make things like <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/illuminate\/support\">illuminate\/support<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/\">Laravel<\/a>, PHP itself, WordPress, Drupal, heck <a href=\"https:\/\/jquery.com\/\">jQuery<\/a> and all the JavaScript libraries and frameworks and&nbsp;stuff that makes so many amazing things possible and easy.<\/p>\n<p>This is just a pedantic, ex-<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SPARK_(programming_language)\">SPARK95<\/a>-coder&#8217;s rant, wishing that we could choose base-level tools and languages that help us write better code in the first place, inspired by <a href=\"https:\/\/jaco.by\/2016\/08\/04\/todays-software-is-terrible\/\">JJJ<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jasonyeojs\/status\/760456348211433472\">guy who (allegedly) couldn&#8217;t deploy an app because Angular had 40,000 files in it<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It can be better.

Consider this \u201cconstructive feedback\u201d, and I hope you\u2019ll laugh along.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, and welcome to this episode of The Podcast Podcast. The Podcast that tells you about the Podcast about Podcasts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later\n on we\u2019ll tell you about this week\u2019s podcast, but I want to start today \nby telling you all about last weeks podcast which was mostly all about \nlast weeks podcast, but also told you a bit about the week before\u2019s \npodcast, and even, excitingly, gave you a look ahead to this week\u2019s \npodcast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If\n you\u2019ve not already listened then you really should and make sure that \nyou review it on iTunes, share it with all your friends, and subscribe \nin your favourite podcast app so that you never miss and episode.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now\n before I tell you about this week\u2019s podcast we just need to take a \nquick sponsor break but we\u2019ll be back soon with this week\u2019s podcast and \nif you can hold on long enough we may even give a teaser later on of \nwhat in next week\u2019s podcast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll be back after the break.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s sponsor is AudioChimp\u2026.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome\n back to The Podcast Podcast. Before the break we told you what would be\n coming up after the break, which we\u2019ll get to in a minute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s\n episode is actually a listener question. Our listener Chas is an avid \nfollower of The Podcast Podcast and I\u2019d just like to say thank you, \nChas, for listening. The podcast wouldn\u2019t be what it is without our \nlisteners and I\u2019d like to thank each and everyone of them for \nsubscribing and listening and submitting questions. It\u2019s people like \nChas that make The Podcast Podcast worthwhile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So\n Chas submitted a question via The Podcast Podcast website, which is on \npodcastpodcast.not, or you can contact us on Twitter at @podcastpodcast \nwhich you can also do if you have a question. Not all of our episodes \nare listener questions, but they give us something to talk about when \nwe\u2019ve run out of ideas of our own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chas\n actually submitted a question previously on The Podcast Podcast, and if\n you want to hear that then you can look up episode 32 on iTunes or on \nour website at podcastpodcast.lol. It\u2019s truly hard to believe that we\u2019ve\n now been going for 68 episodes and next week we\u2019re expecting to hit \n100,000 downloads which is JUST amazing. I\u2019m so grateful to everyone \nthat listens to the show. It started as just a stupid thing in my spare \ntime, and has now grown into this huge network of podcasts which is just\n incredible. And it\u2019s our goal to provide you with a stack of \ninteresting content week-by-week. So make sure you look up our other \npodcasts too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking\n of interesting content, that\u2019s exactly what Chas\u2019s question is about. \nChas asks \u201cWhy is there not more content on The Podcast Podcast?\u201d. Well,\n Chas, this is a great question, and we\u2019ll answer it after the break \nwhen we\u2019ll come back and actually answer your question and give a teaser\n for next week\u2019s episode.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t go away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week\u2019s second sponsor is Mail Ocean\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome\n back to The Podcast Podcast. Before the break we told you about \nlong-term Podcast Podcast listener Chas\u2019 listener question, and how we \nwere going to answer his question after the last break. So that\u2019s what \nwe\u2019re about to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll remember that Chas\u2019 question was \u201cWhy is there not more content on The Podcast Podcast?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well\n the answer, Chas, is that sponsorship is really important for podcasts \nbecause it pays us to make them. So I\u2019m sure you totally understand the \nneed for that. But as for why we can\u2019t just run an ad, get on with the \ncontent, and then run another ad at the end? Well, I really don\u2019t know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that answers your question Chas and thanks for submitting it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So\n today we\u2019ve looked at what we were going to speak about today, told you\n lots about this podcast, and spent a short time answering a listener \nquestion. In a moment we\u2019re going to tell you about next week\u2019s podcast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But\n first don\u2019t forget that if you, like Chas, have a question for The \nPodcast Podcast then you can submit it through our website at \npodcastpodcast.not, or ask us via Twitter at @podcastpodcast<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next\n week on The Podcast Podcast, we\u2019re going to talk about this week\u2019s \npodcast, next week\u2019s podcast, and maybe even look ahead to the following\n week\u2019s podcast. We\u2019ll even throw in the usual segments where we ask you\n to share our podcast and rate it on iTunes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for listening to The Podcast Podcast, and see you next time!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n",

Here\u2019s a transcript of how not to make a boring piece of audio. With apologies to anyone that makes podcasts\u200a\u2014\u200aI actually admire and respect your work. Consider this \u201cconstructive feedback\u201d, and I hope you\u2019ll laugh along.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, and welcome to this episode of The Podcast Podcast. The Podcast that tells you about the Podcast about Podcasts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later\n on we\u2019ll tell you about this week\u2019s podcast, but I want to start today \nby telling you all about last weeks podcast which was mostly all about \nlast weeks podcast, but also told you a bit about the week before\u2019s \npodcast, and even, excitingly, gave you a look ahead to this week\u2019s \npodcast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If\n you\u2019ve not already listened then you really should and make sure that \nyou review it on iTunes, share it with all your friends, and subscribe \nin your favourite podcast app so that you never miss and episode.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now\n before I tell you about this week\u2019s podcast we just need to take a \nquick sponsor break but we\u2019ll be back soon with this week\u2019s podcast and \nif you can hold on long enough we may even give a teaser later on of \nwhat in next week\u2019s podcast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll be back after the break.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s sponsor is AudioChimp\u2026.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome\n back to The Podcast Podcast. Before the break we told you what would be\n coming up after the break, which we\u2019ll get to in a minute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s\n episode is actually a listener question. Our listener Chas is an avid \nfollower of The Podcast Podcast and I\u2019d just like to say thank you, \nChas, for listening. The podcast wouldn\u2019t be what it is without our \nlisteners and I\u2019d like to thank each and everyone of them for \nsubscribing and listening and submitting questions. It\u2019s people like \nChas that make The Podcast Podcast worthwhile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So\n Chas submitted a question via The Podcast Podcast website, which is on \npodcastpodcast.not, or you can contact us on Twitter at @podcastpodcast \nwhich you can also do if you have a question. Not all of our episodes \nare listener questions, but they give us something to talk about when \nwe\u2019ve run out of ideas of our own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chas\n actually submitted a question previously on The Podcast Podcast, and if\n you want to hear that then you can look up episode 32 on iTunes or on \nour website at podcastpodcast.lol. It\u2019s truly hard to believe that we\u2019ve\n now been going for 68 episodes and next week we\u2019re expecting to hit \n100,000 downloads which is JUST amazing. I\u2019m so grateful to everyone \nthat listens to the show. It started as just a stupid thing in my spare \ntime, and has now grown into this huge network of podcasts which is just\n incredible. And it\u2019s our goal to provide you with a stack of \ninteresting content week-by-week. So make sure you look up our other \npodcasts too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking\n of interesting content, that\u2019s exactly what Chas\u2019s question is about. \nChas asks \u201cWhy is there not more content on The Podcast Podcast?\u201d. Well,\n Chas, this is a great question, and we\u2019ll answer it after the break \nwhen we\u2019ll come back and actually answer your question and give a teaser\n for next week\u2019s episode.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t go away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week\u2019s second sponsor is Mail Ocean\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome\n back to The Podcast Podcast. Before the break we told you about \nlong-term Podcast Podcast listener Chas\u2019 listener question, and how we \nwere going to answer his question after the last break. So that\u2019s what \nwe\u2019re about to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll remember that Chas\u2019 question was \u201cWhy is there not more content on The Podcast Podcast?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well\n the answer, Chas, is that sponsorship is really important for podcasts \nbecause it pays us to make them. So I\u2019m sure you totally understand the \nneed for that. But as for why we can\u2019t just run an ad, get on with the \ncontent, and then run another ad at the end? Well, I really don\u2019t know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that answers your question Chas and thanks for submitting it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So\n today we\u2019ve looked at what we were going to speak about today, told you\n lots about this podcast, and spent a short time answering a listener \nquestion. In a moment we\u2019re going to tell you about next week\u2019s podcast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But\n first don\u2019t forget that if you, like Chas, have a question for The \nPodcast Podcast then you can submit it through our website at \npodcastpodcast.not, or ask us via Twitter at @podcastpodcast<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next\n week on The Podcast Podcast, we\u2019re going to talk about this week\u2019s \npodcast, next week\u2019s podcast, and maybe even look ahead to the following\n week\u2019s podcast. We\u2019ll even throw in the usual segments where we ask you\n to share our podcast and rate it on iTunes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for listening to The Podcast Podcast, and see you next time!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n",

Or that I hit &#8220;the wall&#8221; about 9 hours after waking up and need half an hour of downtime before I can as much as converse with anyone again.<\/p>\n<p>Then Sally points out that, in my twenties, I only ever got properly grumpy or angry about twice a year. Which is totally true. And she pointed out that having kids probably made me these things start happening.<\/p>\n<p>She&#8217;s right &#8211; it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;ve <strong>realised<\/strong> that these things happen, it&#8217;s that these things just didn&#8217;t used to happen. They happen because I&#8217;m doing things &#8211; sleeping and eating &#8211; on someone else&#8217;s schedule. Or, at best\/worst, a combination of someone else&#8217;s schedule AND my schedule.<\/p>\n<p>And so we&#8217;ve come to see that one of the key facts of parenting is that you really truly do start living someone else&#8217;s life.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

Or that I hit &#8220;the wall&#8221; about 9 hours after waking up and need half an hour of downtime before I can as much as converse with anyone again.<\/p>\n<p>Then Sally points out that, in my twenties, I only ever got properly grumpy or angry about twice a year. Which is totally true. And she pointed out that having kids probably made me these things start happening.<\/p>\n<p>She&#8217;s right &#8211; it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;ve <strong>realised<\/strong> that these things happen, it&#8217;s that these things just didn&#8217;t used to happen. They happen because I&#8217;m doing things &#8211; sleeping and eating &#8211; on someone else&#8217;s schedule. Or, at best\/worst, a combination of someone else&#8217;s schedule AND my schedule.<\/p>\n<p>And so we&#8217;ve come to see that one of the key facts of parenting is that you really truly do start living someone else&#8217;s life.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p><em>Note: I&#8217;m posting this to contribute to <a href=\"http:\/\/geekmentalhelp.com\/\">Geek Mental Help Week 2016<\/a>. \u00a0Find out more on <a href=\"http:\/\/geekmentalhelp.com\/\">their website<\/a> where you can read articles, find out about events and contribute your own experiences. \u00a0What I&#8217;m writing about isn&#8217;t a serious mental health condition. But I&#8217;ve found it common &#8211; if not near-universal &#8211; and I wish more people spoke about it.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Tl;dr: I have a real anxiety about illness and travel. It&#8217;s perfectly explainable. It manifests both physically and mentally. I&#8217;m learning to deal with it. Anxiety is NORMAL AND COMMON. Remember that&#8230;it could be affecting someone you know.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>A journey<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m booking a train to London online.<\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t afford the peak-time ticket.<\/p>\n<p>The first off-peak service is always packed. But I need to get it because otherwise I won&#8217;t make my meeting.<\/p>\n<p>I request an aisle seat. I hope it&#8217;s not in the middle of the carriage.<\/p>\n<p>On the day of the journey I board the train and find my booked seat. My stomach is already churning. The seat is occupied. That&#8217;s OK. I&#8217;d rather stand. But I&#8217;m in the huddle of people in amongst the carriage seats. The vestibule (I hate that word in the same way some people hate the word &#8216;moist&#8217;) is rammed.<\/p>\n<p>I think ahead. Will more people get on at Reading? Maybe not so many. This train won&#8217;t be their first off-peak service. It&#8217;ll be their second or third. Will lots of people get off at Reading? Hmm.<\/p>\n<p>The nausea increases.<\/p>\n<p>At Reading I pretend to get off, pushing through the non-existent gaps to disembark.<\/p>\n<p>But when I do I walk down a carriage or two and get back on, ensuring I&#8217;m the last person. At least, now, I&#8217;m by the window of the vestibule.<\/p>\n<p>Headphones on. Find a game. Read Twitter. Occupy my brain. I&#8217;ll not notice the next half hour.<\/p>\n<h2>11 years earlier&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s the day before my stag do. There&#8217;s a large gathering: I won&#8217;t say who or where. Because I don&#8217;t want them to feel bad about what happened. And they shouldn&#8217;t. I really don&#8217;t hold this against anyone.<\/p>\n<p>There is food.<\/p>\n<p>A few hours later, in the early morning of my stag day, I vomit. I have food poisoning.<\/p>\n<p>My stags are awesome. Some of them come anyway. 5 or 6 of my best friends ever. We sit and watch sport on TV most of the day.<\/p>\n<p>In the following weeks I will repeatedly bail out of events, trips, meetings and commutes due to nausea &#8211; genuinely feeling like I&#8217;m going to barf at any moment. My commute is by train. I spent a lot of time on trains feeling nauseous.<\/p>\n<p>The worst was a four hour trip to Leeds. Trapped in a window seat. Staring at the door of an out-of-order toilet in a busy vestibule. Horrid. But I made it.<\/p>\n<p>I eventually see my doctor to no avail. She says I feel sick because I&#8217;m stressed. You&#8217;ll come to see the irony of this.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually I self diagnose as lactose intolerant. It seems the food poisoning took something out of me. Damaged my gut in some way.<\/p>\n<p>The lactose intolerance is temporary.<\/p>\n<p>But the anxiety about being sick while travelling seems permanent.<\/p>\n<h2>My Anxiety<\/h2>\n<p>I genuinely hate long journeys. I&#8217;ve never been physically sick on a long journey, but my brain has become wired with an expectation that I will be&#8230;or that I may be&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll hopefully see from the stories above why this is: repeated train journeys with undiagnosed lactose intolerance &#8211; usually with a latte in hand. Not a great mix as the sugar in the milk can&#8217;t be digested properly and you become bloated, gassy, and nauseous. It&#8217;s really uncomfortable. And it made me want to hover near a bathroom just in case. And it made me cancel journeys and events.<\/p>\n<p>This anxiety is very real. It affects me physically and mentally.<\/p>\n<p>I understand why my brain has become wired that way. And it probably doesn&#8217;t help that I&#8217;m &#8220;highly sensitive&#8221; (which is worth <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2015\/07\/highly-sensitive\/\">reading about too<\/a>). \u00a0But unwiring this from my brain seems much harder.<\/p>\n<h2>Anxiety is normal<\/h2>\n<p>As life has gone on, I&#8217;ve come across anxiety more and more. To the point where &#8211; and I&#8217;m not a doctor and this is purely based on empirical experience &#8211; I believe that anxiety is a normal part of the human condition for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, everyone gets anxious. Sometimes it&#8217;s about big things, like job interviews or performing on stage. Sometimes it&#8217;s about trivial things that are perfectly normal everyday activities for other people. Some people get anxious about work meetings, or social events. Some people get anxious about driving a car or riding a bicycle.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s a hidden trait. Unless someone chooses to tell you, you may never know that they are anxious. They may have developed a complex coping strategy. But they&#8217;re still all knotted up inside and on the verge of a panic attack. They may be using a significant proportion of they&#8217;re mental energy just surviving.<\/p>\n<h2>Coping<\/h2>\n<p>Again, I&#8217;m no expert, but I&#8217;ve found a few ways of coping.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do it anyway<\/strong>. Every time I travel and make another long journey without barfing in the vestibule I have an extra piece of evidence that I can do this; that being ill while travelling doesn&#8217;t actually happen to me &#8211; has never happened to me. I need to gather this evidence to help re-wire my brain. I must confront my anxiety.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make it personal<\/strong>. I heard this tip from someone else. Our fight or flight response that causes anxiety is there to help us. Personify it. Talk to it. Thank it for keeping you safe, but tell it, politely but firmly, that you don&#8217;t need it right now because you&#8217;re not being chased by a lion, you&#8217;re just on a train and everything&#8217;s fine. Identify it, acknowledge it; address it; put it back in its box.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Talk about it<\/strong>. A few people know about this trait in me, and they have my back. I can message them while on a journey, and they know what&#8217;s going on. They can help me through. And they do help me through. And I do this for others too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Be aware &#8211; and care<\/h2>\n<p>The people around you &#8211; your family, your colleagues, your friends, all probably have anxieties. You may never know it. They may have coping strategies. But they may also just avoid certain situations. If they behave weird about a certain thing, perhaps that&#8217;s their coping strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Be aware that there may be things that you consider routine, normal, easy, that some people find totally paralysing.<\/p>\n<p>If I&#8217;ve travelled to a meeting with you and I&#8217;m exhausted, it&#8217;s probably not nerves about the meeting. It was the mental effort needed to get to you.<\/p>\n<p>But this isn&#8217;t about me &#8211; it&#8217;s about everyone else. \u00a0Go easy on people; sometimes you literally don&#8217;t know what they are\u00a0going through.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><em>Note: I&#8217;m posting this to contribute to <a href=\"http:\/\/geekmentalhelp.com\/\">Geek Mental Help Week 2016<\/a>. \u00a0Find out more on <a href=\"http:\/\/geekmentalhelp.com\/\">their website<\/a> where you can read articles, find out about events and contribute your own experiences. \u00a0What I&#8217;m writing about isn&#8217;t a serious mental health condition. But I&#8217;ve found it common &#8211; if not near-universal &#8211; and I wish more people spoke about it.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Tl;dr: I have a real anxiety about illness and travel. It&#8217;s perfectly explainable. It manifests both physically and mentally. I&#8217;m learning to deal with it. Anxiety is NORMAL AND COMMON. Remember that&#8230;it could be affecting someone you know.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>A journey<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m booking a train to London online.<\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t afford the peak-time ticket.<\/p>\n<p>The first off-peak service is always packed. But I need to get it because otherwise I won&#8217;t make my meeting.<\/p>\n<p>I request an aisle seat. I hope it&#8217;s not in the middle of the carriage.<\/p>\n<p>On the day of the journey I board the train and find my booked seat. My stomach is already churning. The seat is occupied. That&#8217;s OK. I&#8217;d rather stand. But I&#8217;m in the huddle of people in amongst the carriage seats. The vestibule (I hate that word in the same way some people hate the word &#8216;moist&#8217;) is rammed.<\/p>\n<p>I think ahead. Will more people get on at Reading? Maybe not so many. This train won&#8217;t be their first off-peak service. It&#8217;ll be their second or third. Will lots of people get off at Reading? Hmm.<\/p>\n<p>The nausea increases.<\/p>\n<p>At Reading I pretend to get off, pushing through the non-existent gaps to disembark.<\/p>\n<p>But when I do I walk down a carriage or two and get back on, ensuring I&#8217;m the last person. At least, now, I&#8217;m by the window of the vestibule.<\/p>\n<p>Headphones on. Find a game. Read Twitter. Occupy my brain. I&#8217;ll not notice the next half hour.<\/p>\n<h2>11 years earlier&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s the day before my stag do. There&#8217;s a large gathering: I won&#8217;t say who or where. Because I don&#8217;t want them to feel bad about what happened. And they shouldn&#8217;t. I really don&#8217;t hold this against anyone.<\/p>\n<p>There is food.<\/p>\n<p>A few hours later, in the early morning of my stag day, I vomit. I have food poisoning.<\/p>\n<p>My stags are awesome. Some of them come anyway. 5 or 6 of my best friends ever. We sit and watch sport on TV most of the day.<\/p>\n<p>In the following weeks I will repeatedly bail out of events, trips, meetings and commutes due to nausea &#8211; genuinely feeling like I&#8217;m going to barf at any moment. My commute is by train. I spent a lot of time on trains feeling nauseous.<\/p>\n<p>The worst was a four hour trip to Leeds. Trapped in a window seat. Staring at the door of an out-of-order toilet in a busy vestibule. Horrid. But I made it.<\/p>\n<p>I eventually see my doctor to no avail. She says I feel sick because I&#8217;m stressed. You&#8217;ll come to see the irony of this.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually I self diagnose as lactose intolerant. It seems the food poisoning took something out of me. Damaged my gut in some way.<\/p>\n<p>The lactose intolerance is temporary.<\/p>\n<p>But the anxiety about being sick while travelling seems permanent.<\/p>\n<h2>My Anxiety<\/h2>\n<p>I genuinely hate long journeys. I&#8217;ve never been physically sick on a long journey, but my brain has become wired with an expectation that I will be&#8230;or that I may be&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll hopefully see from the stories above why this is: repeated train journeys with undiagnosed lactose intolerance &#8211; usually with a latte in hand. Not a great mix as the sugar in the milk can&#8217;t be digested properly and you become bloated, gassy, and nauseous. It&#8217;s really uncomfortable. And it made me want to hover near a bathroom just in case. And it made me cancel journeys and events.<\/p>\n<p>This anxiety is very real. It affects me physically and mentally.<\/p>\n<p>I understand why my brain has become wired that way. And it probably doesn&#8217;t help that I&#8217;m &#8220;highly sensitive&#8221; (which is worth <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2015\/07\/highly-sensitive\/\">reading about too<\/a>). \u00a0But unwiring this from my brain seems much harder.<\/p>\n<h2>Anxiety is normal<\/h2>\n<p>As life has gone on, I&#8217;ve come across anxiety more and more. To the point where &#8211; and I&#8217;m not a doctor and this is purely based on empirical experience &#8211; I believe that anxiety is a normal part of the human condition for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, everyone gets anxious. Sometimes it&#8217;s about big things, like job interviews or performing on stage. Sometimes it&#8217;s about trivial things that are perfectly normal everyday activities for other people. Some people get anxious about work meetings, or social events. Some people get anxious about driving a car or riding a bicycle.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s a hidden trait. Unless someone chooses to tell you, you may never know that they are anxious. They may have developed a complex coping strategy. But they&#8217;re still all knotted up inside and on the verge of a panic attack. They may be using a significant proportion of they&#8217;re mental energy just surviving.<\/p>\n<h2>Coping<\/h2>\n<p>Again, I&#8217;m no expert, but I&#8217;ve found a few ways of coping.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do it anyway<\/strong>. Every time I travel and make another long journey without barfing in the vestibule I have an extra piece of evidence that I can do this; that being ill while travelling doesn&#8217;t actually happen to me &#8211; has never happened to me. I need to gather this evidence to help re-wire my brain. I must confront my anxiety.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make it personal<\/strong>. I heard this tip from someone else. Our fight or flight response that causes anxiety is there to help us. Personify it. Talk to it. Thank it for keeping you safe, but tell it, politely but firmly, that you don&#8217;t need it right now because you&#8217;re not being chased by a lion, you&#8217;re just on a train and everything&#8217;s fine. Identify it, acknowledge it; address it; put it back in its box.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Talk about it<\/strong>. A few people know about this trait in me, and they have my back. I can message them while on a journey, and they know what&#8217;s going on. They can help me through. And they do help me through. And I do this for others too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Be aware &#8211; and care<\/h2>\n<p>The people around you &#8211; your family, your colleagues, your friends, all probably have anxieties. You may never know it. They may have coping strategies. But they may also just avoid certain situations. If they behave weird about a certain thing, perhaps that&#8217;s their coping strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Be aware that there may be things that you consider routine, normal, easy, that some people find totally paralysing.<\/p>\n<p>If I&#8217;ve travelled to a meeting with you and I&#8217;m exhausted, it&#8217;s probably not nerves about the meeting. It was the mental effort needed to get to you.<\/p>\n<p>But this isn&#8217;t about me &#8211; it&#8217;s about everyone else. \u00a0Go easy on people; sometimes you literally don&#8217;t know what they are\u00a0going through.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>There&#8217;s a new notes app out. And, to my joy, it&#8217;s featured in the Apple App Store. Why am I so happy about this? Becuase it&#8217;s my new favourite.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note: I&#8217;m not affiliated with Bear, it&#8217;s just a new product that I love.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bear-writer.com\/\">Bear App<\/a>\u00a0team let me be a beta tester for this app and so I&#8217;ve been using it for a while now. On release I had no hesitation: I installed and bought a pro subscription immediately.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve used many notes apps and Markdown editors. <a href=\"https:\/\/evernote.com\/\">Evernote<\/a> is highly functional but its formatting is weird and the interface is clunky and inconsistent. <a href=\"https:\/\/simplenote.com\/\">SimpleNote<\/a> is great but is pretty bare-bones and just lacks functionality. <a href=\"https:\/\/bywordapp.com\/\">Byword<\/a> is a beautiful editor but lacks any real organisational mechanism other than folders, and there&#8217;s no search ability.<\/p>\n<p>Bear takes the best of all of these: beautiful Markdown editing; a clever tagging system; sophisticated search; an interface that&#8217;s not in-your-face. It&#8217;s a joy.<\/p>\n<p>It won&#8217;t be for everyone. You have to be keen on, or willing to learn to use Markdown (which I am). And it&#8217;s currently iPhone\/iPad\/Mac only. But if you fall into the category of Markdown-using, Apple-device-owning power user, it&#8217;s highly recommended.<\/p>\n<p>My only issues are small, but not insignificant:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It&#8217;s tied to Apple&#8217;s devices and infrastructure when I&#8217;d prefer a more cross-platform solution. That was an engineering decision that they took to make the app viable. Perhaps a web-version will come along at some point?<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s not a &#8220;cloud&#8221; notes app, like Evernote or Simplenote. Notes are synchronised across devices, but are not really stored &#8220;in the cloud&#8221;. \u00a0And as such it has no API &#8211; there&#8217;s no way to send stuff to it from the outside world, such as by using an <a href=\"https:\/\/ifttt.com\/\">IFTTT<\/a> recipe.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Nearly perfect. Great job on the release!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>There&#8217;s a new notes app out. And, to my joy, it&#8217;s featured in the Apple App Store. Why am I so happy about this? Becuase it&#8217;s my new favourite.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note: I&#8217;m not affiliated with Bear, it&#8217;s just a new product that I love.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bear-writer.com\/\">Bear App<\/a>\u00a0team let me be a beta tester for this app and so I&#8217;ve been using it for a while now. On release I had no hesitation: I installed and bought a pro subscription immediately.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve used many notes apps and Markdown editors. <a href=\"https:\/\/evernote.com\/\">Evernote<\/a> is highly functional but its formatting is weird and the interface is clunky and inconsistent. <a href=\"https:\/\/simplenote.com\/\">SimpleNote<\/a> is great but is pretty bare-bones and just lacks functionality. <a href=\"https:\/\/bywordapp.com\/\">Byword<\/a> is a beautiful editor but lacks any real organisational mechanism other than folders, and there&#8217;s no search ability.<\/p>\n<p>Bear takes the best of all of these: beautiful Markdown editing; a clever tagging system; sophisticated search; an interface that&#8217;s not in-your-face. It&#8217;s a joy.<\/p>\n<p>It won&#8217;t be for everyone. You have to be keen on, or willing to learn to use Markdown (which I am). And it&#8217;s currently iPhone\/iPad\/Mac only. But if you fall into the category of Markdown-using, Apple-device-owning power user, it&#8217;s highly recommended.<\/p>\n<p>My only issues are small, but not insignificant:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It&#8217;s tied to Apple&#8217;s devices and infrastructure when I&#8217;d prefer a more cross-platform solution. That was an engineering decision that they took to make the app viable. Perhaps a web-version will come along at some point?<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s not a &#8220;cloud&#8221; notes app, like Evernote or Simplenote. Notes are synchronised across devices, but are not really stored &#8220;in the cloud&#8221;. \u00a0And as such it has no API &#8211; there&#8217;s no way to send stuff to it from the outside world, such as by using an <a href=\"https:\/\/ifttt.com\/\">IFTTT<\/a> recipe.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Nearly perfect. Great job on the release!<\/p>\n",
