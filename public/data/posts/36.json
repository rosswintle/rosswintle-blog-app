Last night I  was feeling fragile and rethinking if I should be cycling on roads, cycling in Swindon feels unsafe right now and that makes me sad. What can I do? I shouted through 2 windows and reported a police driver but apart from individually educating as many people as I can, what can I do to make people give cyclists respect and space??&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had numerous close calls this week. At least one incident each day (apart from today.  I&#8217;ve not been hit or hurt at all, but the sheer lack of space and thoughfulness on the part of drivers has really shaken me up to the point where I&#8217;m really considering my options.<\/p>\n<p>Then @t1mmyb quoted (so he thinks) Benjamin Franklin who said: &#8220;Those who sacrifice a little liberty for temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety&#8221;.  I&#8217;m not sure if he directed that at me at all, or if he had his own reasons for quoting it, but it made me think.<\/p>\n<p>I could give in.  I could revert to using cycle paths more and stay away from cars.  I could sacrifice my right to be on the road.  I could give up the wonderful freedom of being able to cycle fast and direct routes.  I could do all this for my safety.  But should I be giving up my rights and my freedom?<\/p>\n<p>Today was better.  I did a half-decent ride up to Elcombe and back via Croft Road and Old Town &#8211; 11 or so hilly miles.  One guy held back, gave me loads of room and accepted my thankful wave with a smile as he passed.  Someone else in a residential area was very helpful.  My faith in the majority of road users was restored slightly.<\/p>\n<p>I will write more on this topic. I still feel fragile and the events of this week have spurred me to action.  But I might need help.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to all the folks who gave support and encouraged me in little ways.  And if you read anything I wrote and gave a cyclist a bit more room when passing in your car then, really, thank you.  Please spread the word &#8211; cyclists need space on the road, and if you give it us you might get a cheery wave of thanks and the warm glow that you made Swindon a safer place.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>As I just said on Twitter&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8221;s been a tough week, cycling wise. Last night I  was feeling fragile and rethinking if I should be cycling on roads, cycling in Swindon feels unsafe right now and that makes me sad. What can I do? I shouted through 2 windows and reported a police driver but apart from individually educating as many people as I can, what can I do to make people give cyclists respect and space??&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had numerous close calls this week. At least one incident each day (apart from today.  I&#8217;ve not been hit or hurt at all, but the sheer lack of space and thoughfulness on the part of drivers has really shaken me up to the point where I&#8217;m really considering my options.<\/p>\n<p>Then @t1mmyb quoted (so he thinks) Benjamin Franklin who said: &#8220;Those who sacrifice a little liberty for temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety&#8221;.  I&#8217;m not sure if he directed that at me at all, or if he had his own reasons for quoting it, but it made me think.<\/p>\n<p>I could give in.  I could revert to using cycle paths more and stay away from cars.  I could sacrifice my right to be on the road.  I could give up the wonderful freedom of being able to cycle fast and direct routes.  I could do all this for my safety.  But should I be giving up my rights and my freedom?<\/p>\n<p>Today was better.  I did a half-decent ride up to Elcombe and back via Croft Road and Old Town &#8211; 11 or so hilly miles.  One guy held back, gave me loads of room and accepted my thankful wave with a smile as he passed.  Someone else in a residential area was very helpful.  My faith in the majority of road users was restored slightly.<\/p>\n<p>I will write more on this topic. I still feel fragile and the events of this week have spurred me to action.  But I might need help.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to all the folks who gave support and encouraged me in little ways.  And if you read anything I wrote and gave a cyclist a bit more room when passing in your car then, really, thank you.  Please spread the word &#8211; cyclists need space on the road, and if you give it us you might get a cheery wave of thanks and the warm glow that you made Swindon a safer place.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>Actually&#8230;here&#8217;s something I found in my drafts from back when I had my bad-cycling week.  I left it and intended to come back to it, re-read it, and work out what to do with it.<\/p>\n<p>Reading it again, outside of the context of my bad week, it seems quite reasonable, documents my &#8220;bad week&#8221; and expresses some of my frustrations.  The only problems: it&#8217;s a bit long and I don&#8217;t know who should be the recipient!<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>To whom it may concern<\/p>\n<p>I am a cyclist.  I cycle not just for fitness and leisure, I use my bicycle as a form of transport in place of a car or bus.  I have been cycling regularly since I was a teenager, I am experienced and confident on my bike.<\/p>\n<p>The fact that I cycle is good for me, it&#8217;s good for you, it&#8217;s good for our town, and it&#8217;s good for our world:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I&#8217;m fitter and healthier<\/li>\n<li>I take up less space on the roads<\/li>\n<li>I do less damage to roads<\/li>\n<li>I need less space to park<\/li>\n<li>I emit less particulates and greenhouse gases<\/li>\n<li>I don&#8217;t burn our limited reserves of fossil fuels<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Cycling has many benefits for everyone, I try to campaign for and help promote cycling as a good thing that our country should be investing in.  And I love cycling!<\/p>\n<p>And yet, this week has scared me.  It&#8217;s made me nervous.  It&#8217;s made me consider where, how and even IF I use my bicycle as transport.  I&#8217;d like to tell you why, and I&#8217;d like you, if you can, to help.<\/p>\n<p>This has been an exceptional week of encountering bad driving.  I&#8217;ve faced:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> Being overtaken far too close<\/li>\n<li>Being overtaken and cut up too close to a junction (by a Police car!)<\/li>\n<li>Being overtaken and cut up on a blind corner<\/li>\n<li>Cars driving at me when there&#8217;s barely enough space for a car and bike to occupy the road<\/li>\n<li>Being UNDERtaken on a single-lane roundabout<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The final item is the single most dangerous thing that has happened to me in many months and, had I been turning left or going a little faster, would have been incredibly dangerous.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m normally quite placid and let things go but the incidents this week have caused me to complain to two drivers and lodge a complaint with the Police about the driving of one of their officers.<\/p>\n<p>While this week does appear to have been exceptional in volume of events, most of these things, and others, happen to me frequently while cycling.  I&#8217;m currently at the point where I, a cycle campaigner and promoter, don&#8217;t feel I can promote cycling to my friends as a convenient and safe alternative form of transport and I find myself considering, against all my instincts and values, using my car to get to work.<\/p>\n<p>I hope you&#8217;ll agree that this situation is unacceptable.  Oil will run out and our usage must reduce.  Carbon emissions must be cut.  The safety of cyclists and pedestrians and the health of our nation must improve.  And surely one way to achieve all of this is to make cycling convenient and safe.<\/p>\n<p>I have no idea what I, as an individual, can do to change the attitude of motorists to cyclists.  There is a small circle of people that know me and know, because I&#8217;ve told them and explained to them why:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>that they should give cyclists at least as much room as they would give any other vehicle when overtaking (as per rule 163 of the Highway Code); and<\/li>\n<li>that they should NOT overtake approaching or at a road junction on either side of the road (as per rule 167 of the Highway Code)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>but the reach of my education is limited.<\/p>\n<p>I also have ideas about how we might change perceptions and get more drivers to notice cyclists, and to make cycling more convenient and safe:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have specific cycle and pedestrian awareness as part of the driving test &#8211; perhaps even ensuring that all new drivers experience riding a bicycle on the road.<\/li>\n<li>Provide a way of reporting minor incidents that would send drivers a letter reminding them of their responsibilities towards more vulnerable road users.<\/li>\n<li>Run an advertising\/social marketing campaign to educate drivers reminding them of their responsibilities towards more vulnerable road users.<\/li>\n<li>Install more direct cycling routes that make cycling more convenient for longer distances.  Swindon has an extensive network of cycle routes, but they are difficult to navigate, rarely direct, and frequently shared with pedestrians or vehicles.<\/li>\n<li>Install and improve cycle parking.  Ensure all new buildings and developments, as well as public buildings have decent cycle parking.  Here are some places in Swindon that (as far as I can tell) don&#8217;t have cycle parking:\n<ul>\n<li>The new Wichelstowe Development (despite the development&#8217;s goal of &#8220;prioritising pedestrian, cycle and public transport to minimise the use of the private car in a congested urban network.&#8221;)<\/li>\n<li>The Health Centre on Carfax Street<\/li>\n<li>The new central Youth Centre &#8220;The Platform&#8221; which presumably is intended to cater mainly for people who don&#8217;t have cars<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I confess that maybe not all of these ideas are realistic or practical.  I&#8217;m not a travel planner or an expert on cycle training and infrastructure, but they seem to make sense.  And, as with education, my ability to implement these ideas is very limited.<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s over to you.  If you agree that I shouldn&#8217;t feel the way I do about cycling at the moment, my questions to you are these:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are you going to do to make me feel safer cycling around Swindon?<\/li>\n<li>What are you going to do to educate drivers on how much space and attention they should give to more vulnerable road users?<\/li>\n<li>What are you going to do to improve cycle infrastructure and facilities in Swindon?<\/li>\n<li>What are your targets for sustainable transport and how are you going to achieve them?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",

        "content": "<p>Actually&#8230;here&#8217;s something I found in my drafts from back when I had my bad-cycling week.  I left it and intended to come back to it, re-read it, and work out what to do with it.<\/p>\n<p>Reading it again, outside of the context of my bad week, it seems quite reasonable, documents my &#8220;bad week&#8221; and expresses some of my frustrations.  The only problems: it&#8217;s a bit long and I don&#8217;t know who should be the recipient!<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>To whom it may concern<\/p>\n<p>I am a cyclist.  I cycle not just for fitness and leisure, I use my bicycle as a form of transport in place of a car or bus.  I have been cycling regularly since I was a teenager, I am experienced and confident on my bike.<\/p>\n<p>The fact that I cycle is good for me, it&#8217;s good for you, it&#8217;s good for our town, and it&#8217;s good for our world:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I&#8217;m fitter and healthier<\/li>\n<li>I take up less space on the roads<\/li>\n<li>I do less damage to roads<\/li>\n<li>I need less space to park<\/li>\n<li>I emit less particulates and greenhouse gases<\/li>\n<li>I don&#8217;t burn our limited reserves of fossil fuels<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Cycling has many benefits for everyone, I try to campaign for and help promote cycling as a good thing that our country should be investing in.  And I love cycling!<\/p>\n<p>And yet, this week has scared me.  It&#8217;s made me nervous.  It&#8217;s made me consider where, how and even IF I use my bicycle as transport.  I&#8217;d like to tell you why, and I&#8217;d like you, if you can, to help.<\/p>\n<p>This has been an exceptional week of encountering bad driving.  I&#8217;ve faced:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> Being overtaken far too close<\/li>\n<li>Being overtaken and cut up too close to a junction (by a Police car!)<\/li>\n<li>Being overtaken and cut up on a blind corner<\/li>\n<li>Cars driving at me when there&#8217;s barely enough space for a car and bike to occupy the road<\/li>\n<li>Being UNDERtaken on a single-lane roundabout<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The final item is the single most dangerous thing that has happened to me in many months and, had I been turning left or going a little faster, would have been incredibly dangerous.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m normally quite placid and let things go but the incidents this week have caused me to complain to two drivers and lodge a complaint with the Police about the driving of one of their officers.<\/p>\n<p>While this week does appear to have been exceptional in volume of events, most of these things, and others, happen to me frequently while cycling.  I&#8217;m currently at the point where I, a cycle campaigner and promoter, don&#8217;t feel I can promote cycling to my friends as a convenient and safe alternative form of transport and I find myself considering, against all my instincts and values, using my car to get to work.<\/p>\n<p>I hope you&#8217;ll agree that this situation is unacceptable.  Oil will run out and our usage must reduce.  Carbon emissions must be cut.  The safety of cyclists and pedestrians and the health of our nation must improve.  And surely one way to achieve all of this is to make cycling convenient and safe.<\/p>\n<p>I have no idea what I, as an individual, can do to change the attitude of motorists to cyclists.  There is a small circle of people that know me and know, because I&#8217;ve told them and explained to them why:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>that they should give cyclists at least as much room as they would give any other vehicle when overtaking (as per rule 163 of the Highway Code); and<\/li>\n<li>that they should NOT overtake approaching or at a road junction on either side of the road (as per rule 167 of the Highway Code)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>but the reach of my education is limited.<\/p>\n<p>I also have ideas about how we might change perceptions and get more drivers to notice cyclists, and to make cycling more convenient and safe:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have specific cycle and pedestrian awareness as part of the driving test &#8211; perhaps even ensuring that all new drivers experience riding a bicycle on the road.<\/li>\n<li>Provide a way of reporting minor incidents that would send drivers a letter reminding them of their responsibilities towards more vulnerable road users.<\/li>\n<li>Run an advertising\/social marketing campaign to educate drivers reminding them of their responsibilities towards more vulnerable road users.<\/li>\n<li>Install more direct cycling routes that make cycling more convenient for longer distances.  Swindon has an extensive network of cycle routes, but they are difficult to navigate, rarely direct, and frequently shared with pedestrians or vehicles.<\/li>\n<li>Install and improve cycle parking.  Ensure all new buildings and developments, as well as public buildings have decent cycle parking.  Here are some places in Swindon that (as far as I can tell) don&#8217;t have cycle parking:\n<ul>\n<li>The new Wichelstowe Development (despite the development&#8217;s goal of &#8220;prioritising pedestrian, cycle and public transport to minimise the use of the private car in a congested urban network.&#8221;)<\/li>\n<li>The Health Centre on Carfax Street<\/li>\n<li>The new central Youth Centre &#8220;The Platform&#8221; which presumably is intended to cater mainly for people who don&#8217;t have cars<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I confess that maybe not all of these ideas are realistic or practical.  I&#8217;m not a travel planner or an expert on cycle training and infrastructure, but they seem to make sense.  And, as with education, my ability to implement these ideas is very limited.<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s over to you.  If you agree that I shouldn&#8217;t feel the way I do about cycling at the moment, my questions to you are these:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are you going to do to make me feel safer cycling around Swindon?<\/li>\n<li>What are you going to do to educate drivers on how much space and attention they should give to more vulnerable road users?<\/li>\n<li>What are you going to do to improve cycle infrastructure and facilities in Swindon?<\/li>\n<li>What are your targets for sustainable transport and how are you going to achieve them?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",
        "excerpt": "<p>This week has scared me. It&#8217;s made me nervous. It&#8217;s made me consider where, how and even IF I use my bicycle as transport. I&#8217;d like to tell you why, and I&#8217;d like you, if you can, to help.<\/p>\n",
