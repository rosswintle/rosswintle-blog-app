I&#8217;d brainstormed what was bad about my old job, what I wanted from my work, and what I might do.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1077\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1077\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1077\" title=\"My Perfect Jop\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"Brainstorm of my perfect job circa June 2010\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148-300x224.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148-150x112.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1077\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brainstorm of my perfect job<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The things I wanted from a job were nothing like what I was stuck doing, and as time passed it became clear that I was stressed and unhappy.<\/p>\n<p>I should also say that I have a Christian faith and I believe that God does guide us, his followers, in what we&#8217;re doing. \u00a0Friends had been praying about my position and their feedback was encouraging. I felt like my God was telling me it was OK to want to get out and that there was something better for me.<\/p>\n<p>More specifically than that, people believed that God was saying &#8220;I will provide. \u00a0There will always be enough&#8221;, and that I would be led through a difficult place, towards the unknown, but there would be something good at the end of the journey.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I was praying too.<\/p>\n<p>And I was keen! \u00a0There were some long evenings and weekends getting my first few Oikos projects done. \u00a0There was some slowness and stress as I got to grips with proper front-end development, cross-browser compatibility issues and the quirks of CSS and \u00a0JavaScript. \u00a0There were difficult questions about how much to charge people and when I really needed to work and when I really needed to stop. \u00a0There was LOTS of patience on behalf of my ever-loving wife.<\/p>\n<p>In November a few things came to a head. \u00a0We had some savings in the bank and I handed my 3-month notice in. \u00a0To my surprise, no one really thought I was mad. \u00a0Many thought that, despite the uncertainty, I&#8217;d made a very good and wise decision. \u00a0I wasn&#8217;t so sure. \u00a0But I was going crazy and had to go.<\/p>\n<p>Oikos quietly churned away in the background while I handed over my work and finished off my time at C&amp;W. \u00a0Everyone was really good to me and I had a great send off. \u00a0I don&#8217;t miss my work, but I miss my team and colleagues. \u00a0They are good people.<\/p>\n<p>And so, in February, I was cut loose. \u00a0I was officially full-time self employed. \u00a0Or, I would have been had I had enough work.<\/p>\n<p>Starting out on your own is never going to be easy. \u00a0You&#8217;re not going to be rolling in cash or rushed off your feet. \u00a0Most people said two years was a good length of time to get going. \u00a0We didn&#8217;t have two years!<\/p>\n<p>But. \u00a0Well. \u00a0Whether you believe in coincidence, luck, hard work, or &#8211; as I do &#8211; that God is true to his work: there was always enough! \u00a0Every time the work dried up a little more came in. \u00a0There were big projects and small projects. I&#8217;m indebted to friends and contacts who gave me work, and recommended me to others.<\/p>\n<p>Some avenues opened. \u00a0Others closed. \u00a0Sometimes I was picky and chose not to take on work because it wasn&#8217;t what I wanted to do. \u00a0For a short time at least, I could afford to pick and choose what I did whilst building up my skills.<\/p>\n<p>And you know what?<\/p>\n<p>Oikos is having a boom. I&#8217;ve made a great contact who&#8217;s passing me a load of work that&#8217;s exactly what I want to be doing in exactly the sector I want to be doing it in. \u00a0And I&#8217;ve got a couple of smaller projects on the go in the background too.<\/p>\n<p>And you know what else?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m LOVING it.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m learning new things. I&#8217;m using my skills for social good in the charity and non-profit sector. I&#8217;ve got the flexibilty of working from home and for myself. I can train myself up and take on new technologies. I can &#8220;make stuff&#8221; &#8211; be creative and innovative. I&#8217;m in control of what I do. I can work with others who have a similar vision. \u00a0I can invest in myself and my work.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m happy. I&#8217;m physically and mentally stronger. I&#8217;ve not been ill (seriously!).<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m probably slightly more geeky and bonkers than I used to be. But that&#8217;s ME. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m like. That&#8217;s what I enjoy. \u00a0My work is hard, but it&#8217;s fun. I&#8217;m sometimes tired (no change there) but I&#8217;m almost always full of enthusiasm and energy for what I&#8217;m doing.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been an added complication of a little Wintle coming along in November. But even the timing of that is perfect. Had it happened a few months earlier I maybe wouldn&#8217;t have left the stability of employment.<\/p>\n<p>It was a risk to quit. It was a risk to pick and choose my work. It was always going to be a challenge to make enough money to live on in the charity sector. It was going to be hard work. It was going to stretch me and my abilities and my relationships.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m so glad I did it, and I&#8217;m so thankful to those that have encouraged me in it and made it possible.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>This is a little late. \u00a0But the reason it&#8217;s late is that I&#8217;ve been really busy at work. \u00a0And this is a good thing. \u00a0As I shall explain.<\/p>\n<p>Back on 18th June was the anniversary of me officially creating Oikos &#8211; my freelance web development and technology consultancy business.<\/p>\n<p>With a good voluntary project on the go I&#8217;d manage to win, though some close contacts, a paid website development gig. \u00a0I needed paying, so I set up a bank account, registered self-employed and so became, in my own unique way, an entrepreneur.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>At the time I was also full-time employed. \u00a0I guess I&#8217;d fallen into my job by mistake really. \u00a0It was a convenience and, over the time I was there, I&#8217;d gotten quite good at it. \u00a0But I&#8217;d spent a lot of time thinking about how to get out, what to move on to.<\/p>\n<p>And Oikos was somewhat pre-meditated. I&#8217;d brainstormed what was bad about my old job, what I wanted from my work, and what I might do.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1077\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1077\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1077\" title=\"My Perfect Jop\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"Brainstorm of my perfect job circa June 2010\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148-300x224.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148-150x112.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1077\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brainstorm of my perfect job<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The things I wanted from a job were nothing like what I was stuck doing, and as time passed it became clear that I was stressed and unhappy.<\/p>\n<p>I should also say that I have a Christian faith and I believe that God does guide us, his followers, in what we&#8217;re doing. \u00a0Friends had been praying about my position and their feedback was encouraging. I felt like my God was telling me it was OK to want to get out and that there was something better for me.<\/p>\n<p>More specifically than that, people believed that God was saying &#8220;I will provide. \u00a0There will always be enough&#8221;, and that I would be led through a difficult place, towards the unknown, but there would be something good at the end of the journey.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I was praying too.<\/p>\n<p>And I was keen! \u00a0There were some long evenings and weekends getting my first few Oikos projects done. \u00a0There was some slowness and stress as I got to grips with proper front-end development, cross-browser compatibility issues and the quirks of CSS and \u00a0JavaScript. \u00a0There were difficult questions about how much to charge people and when I really needed to work and when I really needed to stop. \u00a0There was LOTS of patience on behalf of my ever-loving wife.<\/p>\n<p>In November a few things came to a head. \u00a0We had some savings in the bank and I handed my 3-month notice in. \u00a0To my surprise, no one really thought I was mad. \u00a0Many thought that, despite the uncertainty, I&#8217;d made a very good and wise decision. \u00a0I wasn&#8217;t so sure. \u00a0But I was going crazy and had to go.<\/p>\n<p>Oikos quietly churned away in the background while I handed over my work and finished off my time at C&amp;W. \u00a0Everyone was really good to me and I had a great send off. \u00a0I don&#8217;t miss my work, but I miss my team and colleagues. \u00a0They are good people.<\/p>\n<p>And so, in February, I was cut loose. \u00a0I was officially full-time self employed. \u00a0Or, I would have been had I had enough work.<\/p>\n<p>Starting out on your own is never going to be easy. \u00a0You&#8217;re not going to be rolling in cash or rushed off your feet. \u00a0Most people said two years was a good length of time to get going. \u00a0We didn&#8217;t have two years!<\/p>\n<p>But. \u00a0Well. \u00a0Whether you believe in coincidence, luck, hard work, or &#8211; as I do &#8211; that God is true to his work: there was always enough! \u00a0Every time the work dried up a little more came in. \u00a0There were big projects and small projects. I&#8217;m indebted to friends and contacts who gave me work, and recommended me to others.<\/p>\n<p>Some avenues opened. \u00a0Others closed. \u00a0Sometimes I was picky and chose not to take on work because it wasn&#8217;t what I wanted to do. \u00a0For a short time at least, I could afford to pick and choose what I did whilst building up my skills.<\/p>\n<p>And you know what?<\/p>\n<p>Oikos is having a boom. I&#8217;ve made a great contact who&#8217;s passing me a load of work that&#8217;s exactly what I want to be doing in exactly the sector I want to be doing it in. \u00a0And I&#8217;ve got a couple of smaller projects on the go in the background too.<\/p>\n<p>And you know what else?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m LOVING it.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m learning new things. I&#8217;m using my skills for social good in the charity and non-profit sector. I&#8217;ve got the flexibilty of working from home and for myself. I can train myself up and take on new technologies. I can &#8220;make stuff&#8221; &#8211; be creative and innovative. I&#8217;m in control of what I do. I can work with others who have a similar vision. \u00a0I can invest in myself and my work.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m happy. I&#8217;m physically and mentally stronger. I&#8217;ve not been ill (seriously!).<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m probably slightly more geeky and bonkers than I used to be. But that&#8217;s ME. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m like. That&#8217;s what I enjoy. \u00a0My work is hard, but it&#8217;s fun. I&#8217;m sometimes tired (no change there) but I&#8217;m almost always full of enthusiasm and energy for what I&#8217;m doing.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been an added complication of a little Wintle coming along in November. But even the timing of that is perfect. Had it happened a few months earlier I maybe wouldn&#8217;t have left the stability of employment.<\/p>\n<p>It was a risk to quit. It was a risk to pick and choose my work. It was always going to be a challenge to make enough money to live on in the charity sector. It was going to be hard work. It was going to stretch me and my abilities and my relationships.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m so glad I did it, and I&#8217;m so thankful to those that have encouraged me in it and made it possible.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m earning less and working from home, so it&#8217;s time to review \u00a0a few things. \u00a0And one change worthy of mention is my broadband supplier.<\/p>\n<p><!--more-->A long, long time ago I had a dial-up connection using NTL. \u00a0Leaving NTL was one of the biggest administration faffs of my life and I actually ended up losing several month&#8217;s line rental to them. \u00a0I was pretty upset and vowed never to use their services again. \u00a0When Virgin Media took NTL over my resentment was passed on to the new owner.<\/p>\n<p>This resentment has not been helped by Virgin&#8217;s frequent and incessant posting of marketing through our letterbox.<\/p>\n<p>When we moved to Swindon our first, rented house had no aerial so our options for TV were Sky or Virgin, and with past experiences in mind, we signed up to Sky. \u00a0Impressed with the service (especially Sky+, which has transformed our TV viewing), we&#8217;ve taken our Sky to the new house we&#8217;ve bought and gradually taken on more Sky services including phone calls and line rental.<\/p>\n<p>But working from home and being a web developer means I&#8217;m using my internet connection a lot more and doing not only lots of uploads, but some fairly hefty downloads too.<\/p>\n<p>And the only way to get quicker broadband round here is to go for Virgin and use the fibre that&#8217;s in our road.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been asking questions and considering the Virgin option and, with a slight reluctance, have now taken the plunge. \u00a0I&#8217;m ditching Sky and going fibre-optic.<\/p>\n<p>I have to say that this is almost purely a decision based on internet speed. \u00a0I&#8217;m expecting service to be roughly equivalent and cost-wise an equivalent Virgin package is about \u00a35 per month more expensive than Sky. \u00a0Well, it&#8217;s not quite equivalent; it includes HD &#8211; we can&#8217;t use HD as we have an old-skool SD, CRT TV, but where Sky do a cheaper SD option, VM don&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>We also benefit greatly from some Quidco.com cashback (\u00a3150&#8217;s worth!) and \u00a3100 credit on our account &#8211; a pretty nice little bonus.<\/p>\n<p>Sky didn&#8217;t put up much of a fight when I cancelled. \u00a0 No one seems to want to haggle these days! \u00a0I was expecting to be offered a cheaper package, but they didn&#8217;t offer me anything!<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s being installed next Tuesday. \u00a0I&#8217;ll let you know how we get on!<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m earning less and working from home, so it&#8217;s time to review \u00a0a few things. \u00a0And one change worthy of mention is my broadband supplier.<\/p>\n<p><!--more-->A long, long time ago I had a dial-up connection using NTL. \u00a0Leaving NTL was one of the biggest administration faffs of my life and I actually ended up losing several month&#8217;s line rental to them. \u00a0I was pretty upset and vowed never to use their services again. \u00a0When Virgin Media took NTL over my resentment was passed on to the new owner.<\/p>\n<p>This resentment has not been helped by Virgin&#8217;s frequent and incessant posting of marketing through our letterbox.<\/p>\n<p>When we moved to Swindon our first, rented house had no aerial so our options for TV were Sky or Virgin, and with past experiences in mind, we signed up to Sky. \u00a0Impressed with the service (especially Sky+, which has transformed our TV viewing), we&#8217;ve taken our Sky to the new house we&#8217;ve bought and gradually taken on more Sky services including phone calls and line rental.<\/p>\n<p>But working from home and being a web developer means I&#8217;m using my internet connection a lot more and doing not only lots of uploads, but some fairly hefty downloads too.<\/p>\n<p>And the only way to get quicker broadband round here is to go for Virgin and use the fibre that&#8217;s in our road.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been asking questions and considering the Virgin option and, with a slight reluctance, have now taken the plunge. \u00a0I&#8217;m ditching Sky and going fibre-optic.<\/p>\n<p>I have to say that this is almost purely a decision based on internet speed. \u00a0I&#8217;m expecting service to be roughly equivalent and cost-wise an equivalent Virgin package is about \u00a35 per month more expensive than Sky. \u00a0Well, it&#8217;s not quite equivalent; it includes HD &#8211; we can&#8217;t use HD as we have an old-skool SD, CRT TV, but where Sky do a cheaper SD option, VM don&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>We also benefit greatly from some Quidco.com cashback (\u00a3150&#8217;s worth!) and \u00a3100 credit on our account &#8211; a pretty nice little bonus.<\/p>\n<p>Sky didn&#8217;t put up much of a fight when I cancelled. \u00a0 No one seems to want to haggle these days! \u00a0I was expecting to be offered a cheaper package, but they didn&#8217;t offer me anything!<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s being installed next Tuesday. \u00a0I&#8217;ll let you know how we get on!<\/p>\n",

Me?<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Yes, I know how this will sound. It will sound like the sad complainings of a person with no friends. And it will sound like a &#8216;Hey, look at me&#8217; post too. But it&#8217;s not either of those. I&#8217;m too old to be bothered about such things now and this is merely an observation and a musing on how technology is changing things.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday was my birthday. And, relative to other people i know, I had surprisingly few happy birthday messages. And by messages I mostly mean people writing or commenting on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Some people pointed out that I didn&#8217;t allow others to see when my birthday was. There&#8217;s a whole post that, frankly I don&#8217;t have time to write, about Facebook&#8217;s complicated security settings and the fact that I had no idea that this was the case. I still don&#8217;t actually know if I&#8217;ve fixed that.<\/p>\n<p>And someone else even said: &#8216;I&#8217;m going to write this in my calendar seeing as you&#8217;re keeping this information from Facebook&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>I observe that two things have changed.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The means by which people are reminded about birthdays<\/strong>. People now depend on Facebook for this information &#8211; at least, for the subset of their contacts that are on Facebook and have their privacy set up right.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The means by which people wish each other a happy birthday. <\/strong>For many people a card is no longer necessary. \u00a0This has an up side: you can probably wish many more people a happy birthday than you previously did. \u00a0And a down-side: because it&#8217;s easier to do it somehow &#8211; in my head at least &#8211; has less value.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I&#8217;m torn about whether or not this is a good thing. \u00a0It&#8217;s hugely convenient, but does it de-value the interaction we have with each other over occasions? \u00a0And that&#8217;s a geuine question&#8230;does it? \u00a0In my heart I think it does, but I can&#8217;t think of any real reason why. \u00a0Of course, I&#8217;m delighted that lots of people can now very easily be reminded of my birthday and very easily wish me a happy one. \u00a0And I too make use of that convenience to celebrate other peoples&#8217; special days too.<\/p>\n<p>However, I note this fact&#8230;it now seems that it&#8217;s my responsibility to publish the fact that it&#8217;s my birthday. \u00a0This is a new piece of knowledge to me. \u00a0I&#8217;ve always assumed that people put these things in their calendars anyway. \u00a0That assumption has been challenged.<\/p>\n<p>What other assumptions that I have about the world might have changed because of social media? \u00a0What else don&#8217;t I know that I don&#8217;t know?<\/p>\n",

Me?<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Yes, I know how this will sound. It will sound like the sad complainings of a person with no friends. And it will sound like a &#8216;Hey, look at me&#8217; post too. But it&#8217;s not either of those. I&#8217;m too old to be bothered about such things now and this is merely an observation and a musing on how technology is changing things.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday was my birthday. And, relative to other people i know, I had surprisingly few happy birthday messages. And by messages I mostly mean people writing or commenting on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Some people pointed out that I didn&#8217;t allow others to see when my birthday was. There&#8217;s a whole post that, frankly I don&#8217;t have time to write, about Facebook&#8217;s complicated security settings and the fact that I had no idea that this was the case. I still don&#8217;t actually know if I&#8217;ve fixed that.<\/p>\n<p>And someone else even said: &#8216;I&#8217;m going to write this in my calendar seeing as you&#8217;re keeping this information from Facebook&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>I observe that two things have changed.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The means by which people are reminded about birthdays<\/strong>. People now depend on Facebook for this information &#8211; at least, for the subset of their contacts that are on Facebook and have their privacy set up right.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The means by which people wish each other a happy birthday. <\/strong>For many people a card is no longer necessary. \u00a0This has an up side: you can probably wish many more people a happy birthday than you previously did. \u00a0And a down-side: because it&#8217;s easier to do it somehow &#8211; in my head at least &#8211; has less value.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I&#8217;m torn about whether or not this is a good thing. \u00a0It&#8217;s hugely convenient, but does it de-value the interaction we have with each other over occasions? \u00a0And that&#8217;s a geuine question&#8230;does it? \u00a0In my heart I think it does, but I can&#8217;t think of any real reason why. \u00a0Of course, I&#8217;m delighted that lots of people can now very easily be reminded of my birthday and very easily wish me a happy one. \u00a0And I too make use of that convenience to celebrate other peoples&#8217; special days too.<\/p>\n<p>However, I note this fact&#8230;it now seems that it&#8217;s my responsibility to publish the fact that it&#8217;s my birthday. \u00a0This is a new piece of knowledge to me. \u00a0I&#8217;ve always assumed that people put these things in their calendars anyway. \u00a0That assumption has been challenged.<\/p>\n<p>What other assumptions that I have about the world might have changed because of social media? \u00a0What else don&#8217;t I know that I don&#8217;t know?<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m going to start cycling into work from next week, I&#8217;ve decided. It&#8217;s a 7 mile ride one way and I&#8217;ve worked out a route which mostly cuts through parks and quiet roads which I&#8217;m happy about. I don&#8217;t have a bike at the moment. This is where I need your advice.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to borrow a bike for a week to see if I can hack it before I spend any money but I&#8217;m basically looking for a road bike which doesn&#8217;t sit me down too low (so a road-mountain hybrid?) and I&#8217;m not willing to spend a lot of money. I mean something that won&#8217;t fall to bits, will do the job and will last for the next 3 or 4 years or so &#8211; all for under \u00a3200ish (or \u00a3150 pref). What do you think? I&#8217;ve looked on the Halfords website and they had 2 suitable ones but it occurred to me that real bike afficianados such as yourself probably have ways and means of getting decent bikes from non-high street chains at better prices.<\/p>\n<p>So any ideas on all of that greatly appreciated if you have the time to reply!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I ended up writing a fairly lengthly reply to his question which I imagine is one that many people will be asking this year. \u00a0I&#8217;ve been given permission to post the message here in case it&#8217;s of use to anyone else. So&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>What Bike?<\/h2>\n<p>Now&#8230;business. I&#8217;m not an expert, but I&#8217;ll happily share my many years of varied experiences and what I do know.<\/p>\n<p>First of all&#8230;well done! Deciding to cycle commute, especially a 7-miler, is a big decision, but SUCH a positive one. I really hope you find yourself enjoying it and finding it fun as well as reaping the health, financial and environmental benefits.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a3200 is a fairly limited budget and you&#8217;ll have to make some trade-offs. I think you&#8217;ve already made the wisest decision which is to NOT by a cheap mountain bike. Off-road tires have greater rolling resistance (drag on the road) and any kind of suspension will sap energy.<\/p>\n<p>You then need to ask questions like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>will you need to carry luggage?<\/li>\n<li>will you be wearing cycle-specific clothing, or aiming to ride in ordinary work-wear?<\/li>\n<li>are you cycling for fitness too, or just pootling slowly to get from A-to-B?<\/li>\n<li>how much work might you be willing to put in to maintenance\/renovation?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Those questions will help you decide what to get.<\/p>\n<p>Next tip &#8211; DON&#8217;T go to Halfords. I&#8217;d really recommend going to a local bike shop, tell them what you want, get some advice, try some bikes out, get fitted properly, ask if they&#8217;ll do a deal (they may throw in lights, helmets, locks, etc), and get to know them &#8211; you WILL go back for maintenance and parts, so get to know them.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to pootle and carry luggage then something like a Raleigh Pioneer is a cheap, sturdy workhorse &#8211; they have racks for luggage, mudguards and a good range of gears. They&#8217;ll handle rough tracks as well as tarmac&#8217;ed roads. They seem to have gone up in price since I got mine! &#8211; shop around and you might get one for under \u00a3200.<\/p>\n<p>For something more sporty &#8211; if you&#8217;re planning going fast and getting fit try looking what tend to be called &#8220;Urban&#8221; bikes. These have flat-bars but are mostly upright. Raleigh do something called the &#8220;Venture&#8221; that looks good for slightly over your \u00a3200.<\/p>\n<p>If you really want to go fast, will be carrying light luggage in a rucksack, and will be mostly on tarmac and dressed in cycle gear then you may want a full-on road bike. I&#8217;m assuming this isn&#8217;t the case, but ask me if it is and I&#8217;ll add some more advice.<\/p>\n<p>If you really don&#8217;t mind taking your time and would like to ride in a more gentlemanly manner, then look up &#8220;Classic&#8221; or &#8220;Dutch-style&#8221; bikes. These tend to be sturdy, low-maintenance, all-weather, upright bikes with enclosed hub gears and brakes, dynamo lights, integrated locks, and features like mudguards chain cases and skirt guards to stop your trousers and coat getting dirty. Google &#8220;cycle chic&#8221; and you&#8217;ll see what I mean!<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a sporty, uber-trendy and slightly bonkers hipster type then look into single-speeds or fixies (PLEASE DON&#8217;T GO FIXIE!!!).<\/p>\n<p>Or just look around &#8211; there&#8217;s loads of schizophrenic hybrid &#8220;mashup&#8221; bikes around these days. I quite like the Trek Portland &#8211; sporty drop bars and high-tech road gearing, with mountain bike brakes and a gentlemanly leather-effect look. Not quite sure what it is, but I like it! (Bit expensive though).<\/p>\n<p>If you really can&#8217;t get something for your money then look at second hand &#8211; eBay even! When looking, check important stuff like brakes, chain, the &#8220;headset&#8221; (joins the handlebars to the forks), and check the pedals\/cranks don&#8217;t have any lateral (side-to-side) movement. Oh, and check for buckled wheels too &#8211; they make for uncomfortable and unsafe riding.<\/p>\n<p>There may even be a local bike recycling\/renovating project like this: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.recyke-y-bike.org\/?What_we_do%3ARecycle_Bikes\">http:\/\/www.recyke-y-bike.org\/?What_we_do%3ARecycle_Bikes<\/a> &#8211; check your council and see what they know! (Actually, that&#8217;s a good tip anyway &#8211; look up your council &#8211; they should have lots of info! &#8211; You may have a local cycle campaign group, or cycling information site too, like this one for Bristol: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.betterbybike.info\/\">http:\/\/www.betterbybike.info\/<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>It might be worth asking if your employer has a &#8220;cycle to work&#8221; scheme. This allows you and your employer to get a tax break on a bicycle for cycling to and from work. The employer buys the bike (VAT-free!) and rents it to you for 12 months (income-tax free!) after which you can buy it on the cheap. Well, actually, they changed the rules recently which made buying it at the end of 12 months more expensive, but they&#8217;ve found ways around it. Read about it here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclescheme.co.uk\/employee,faqs.htm\">http:\/\/www.cyclescheme.co.uk\/employee,faqs.htm<\/a><\/p>\n<p>If your employer does this, or if you can convince them to, then you get a tax-free bike and a 12-month interest-free loan!<\/p>\n<p>Technologically, I don&#8217;t know if you have a smart phone but there&#8217;s plenty of &#8220;Apps&#8221; that can help you track your trips, fitness, and carbon and financial savings if you&#8217;re into that. There are mapping and route apps too (look up Bike Hub!) that do a similar kind of thing to h<a href=\"ttp:\/\/cyclestreets.net\/\">ttp:\/\/cyclestreets.net\/<\/a> (which is also worth knowing about).<\/p>\n<p>Finally, you know I blog, and I did a series of &#8220;controversial commute tips&#8221; that are honest about the pros and cons of cycle commuting. I have my own personal style (I don&#8217;t like to go slow!) and everyone&#8217;s experience is different, but it might be worth a read: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/make-and-do\/controversial-cycle-commute-tips\/\">https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/make-and-do\/controversial-cycle-commute-tips\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a lot of stuff to get you started. Hope its helpful. Don&#8217;t hesitate to ask questions &#8211; blog readers, please use the comments below to ask or to add to my own thoughts on the matter.<\/p>\n<p>God bless and happy cycling!<\/p>\n",

This is where I need your advice.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to borrow a bike for a week to see if I can hack it before I spend any money but I&#8217;m basically looking for a road bike which doesn&#8217;t sit me down too low (so a road-mountain hybrid?) and I&#8217;m not willing to spend a lot of money. I mean something that won&#8217;t fall to bits, will do the job and will last for the next 3 or 4 years or so &#8211; all for under \u00a3200ish (or \u00a3150 pref). What do you think? I&#8217;ve looked on the Halfords website and they had 2 suitable ones but it occurred to me that real bike afficianados such as yourself probably have ways and means of getting decent bikes from non-high street chains at better prices.<\/p>\n<p>So any ideas on all of that greatly appreciated if you have the time to reply!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I ended up writing a fairly lengthly reply to his question which I imagine is one that many people will be asking this year. \u00a0I&#8217;ve been given permission to post the message here in case it&#8217;s of use to anyone else. So&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>What Bike?<\/h2>\n<p>Now&#8230;business. I&#8217;m not an expert, but I&#8217;ll happily share my many years of varied experiences and what I do know.<\/p>\n<p>First of all&#8230;well done! Deciding to cycle commute, especially a 7-miler, is a big decision, but SUCH a positive one. I really hope you find yourself enjoying it and finding it fun as well as reaping the health, financial and environmental benefits.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a3200 is a fairly limited budget and you&#8217;ll have to make some trade-offs. I think you&#8217;ve already made the wisest decision which is to NOT by a cheap mountain bike. Off-road tires have greater rolling resistance (drag on the road) and any kind of suspension will sap energy.<\/p>\n<p>You then need to ask questions like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>will you need to carry luggage?<\/li>\n<li>will you be wearing cycle-specific clothing, or aiming to ride in ordinary work-wear?<\/li>\n<li>are you cycling for fitness too, or just pootling slowly to get from A-to-B?<\/li>\n<li>how much work might you be willing to put in to maintenance\/renovation?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Those questions will help you decide what to get.<\/p>\n<p>Next tip &#8211; DON&#8217;T go to Halfords. I&#8217;d really recommend going to a local bike shop, tell them what you want, get some advice, try some bikes out, get fitted properly, ask if they&#8217;ll do a deal (they may throw in lights, helmets, locks, etc), and get to know them &#8211; you WILL go back for maintenance and parts, so get to know them.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to pootle and carry luggage then something like a Raleigh Pioneer is a cheap, sturdy workhorse &#8211; they have racks for luggage, mudguards and a good range of gears. They&#8217;ll handle rough tracks as well as tarmac&#8217;ed roads. They seem to have gone up in price since I got mine! &#8211; shop around and you might get one for under \u00a3200.<\/p>\n<p>For something more sporty &#8211; if you&#8217;re planning going fast and getting fit try looking what tend to be called &#8220;Urban&#8221; bikes. These have flat-bars but are mostly upright. Raleigh do something called the &#8220;Venture&#8221; that looks good for slightly over your \u00a3200.<\/p>\n<p>If you really want to go fast, will be carrying light luggage in a rucksack, and will be mostly on tarmac and dressed in cycle gear then you may want a full-on road bike. I&#8217;m assuming this isn&#8217;t the case, but ask me if it is and I&#8217;ll add some more advice.<\/p>\n<p>If you really don&#8217;t mind taking your time and would like to ride in a more gentlemanly manner, then look up &#8220;Classic&#8221; or &#8220;Dutch-style&#8221; bikes. These tend to be sturdy, low-maintenance, all-weather, upright bikes with enclosed hub gears and brakes, dynamo lights, integrated locks, and features like mudguards chain cases and skirt guards to stop your trousers and coat getting dirty. Google &#8220;cycle chic&#8221; and you&#8217;ll see what I mean!<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a sporty, uber-trendy and slightly bonkers hipster type then look into single-speeds or fixies (PLEASE DON&#8217;T GO FIXIE!!!).<\/p>\n<p>Or just look around &#8211; there&#8217;s loads of schizophrenic hybrid &#8220;mashup&#8221; bikes around these days. I quite like the Trek Portland &#8211; sporty drop bars and high-tech road gearing, with mountain bike brakes and a gentlemanly leather-effect look. Not quite sure what it is, but I like it! (Bit expensive though).<\/p>\n<p>If you really can&#8217;t get something for your money then look at second hand &#8211; eBay even! When looking, check important stuff like brakes, chain, the &#8220;headset&#8221; (joins the handlebars to the forks), and check the pedals\/cranks don&#8217;t have any lateral (side-to-side) movement. Oh, and check for buckled wheels too &#8211; they make for uncomfortable and unsafe riding.<\/p>\n<p>There may even be a local bike recycling\/renovating project like this: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.recyke-y-bike.org\/?What_we_do%3ARecycle_Bikes\">http:\/\/www.recyke-y-bike.org\/?What_we_do%3ARecycle_Bikes<\/a> &#8211; check your council and see what they know! (Actually, that&#8217;s a good tip anyway &#8211; look up your council &#8211; they should have lots of info! &#8211; You may have a local cycle campaign group, or cycling information site too, like this one for Bristol: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.betterbybike.info\/\">http:\/\/www.betterbybike.info\/<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>It might be worth asking if your employer has a &#8220;cycle to work&#8221; scheme. This allows you and your employer to get a tax break on a bicycle for cycling to and from work. The employer buys the bike (VAT-free!) and rents it to you for 12 months (income-tax free!) after which you can buy it on the cheap. Well, actually, they changed the rules recently which made buying it at the end of 12 months more expensive, but they&#8217;ve found ways around it. Read about it here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclescheme.co.uk\/employee,faqs.htm\">http:\/\/www.cyclescheme.co.uk\/employee,faqs.htm<\/a><\/p>\n<p>If your employer does this, or if you can convince them to, then you get a tax-free bike and a 12-month interest-free loan!<\/p>\n<p>Technologically, I don&#8217;t know if you have a smart phone but there&#8217;s plenty of &#8220;Apps&#8221; that can help you track your trips, fitness, and carbon and financial savings if you&#8217;re into that. There are mapping and route apps too (look up Bike Hub!) that do a similar kind of thing to h<a href=\"ttp:\/\/cyclestreets.net\/\">ttp:\/\/cyclestreets.net\/<\/a> (which is also worth knowing about).<\/p>\n<p>Finally, you know I blog, and I did a series of &#8220;controversial commute tips&#8221; that are honest about the pros and cons of cycle commuting. I have my own personal style (I don&#8217;t like to go slow!) and everyone&#8217;s experience is different, but it might be worth a read: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/make-and-do\/controversial-cycle-commute-tips\/\">https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/make-and-do\/controversial-cycle-commute-tips\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a lot of stuff to get you started. Hope its helpful. Don&#8217;t hesitate to ask questions &#8211; blog readers, please use the comments below to ask or to add to my own thoughts on the matter.<\/p>\n<p>God bless and happy cycling!<\/p>\n",

Pragmatic Environmentalism and; Cycling.<\/p>\n<p><!--more-->Andy&#8217;s posts about user experience have got me thinking a lot about my own experiences of human computer interaction and today has raised an interesting example.<\/p>\n<h2>IE9 for the Average Joe<\/h2>\n<p>As a web developer I like to stay on top of technology so I used a spare moment to get downloading Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer 9.<\/p>\n<p>We should bear in mind that web browsers are a pretty key piece of computer software these days and Microsoft are, of course, competing more and more with Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox, Google&#8217;s Chrome and others. \u00a0So an average man-on-the-street, non-technical person, wanting to take advantage of the new features and increased speed of IE9 should be given a VERY easy time when doing this upgrade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And yet, I &#8211; a highly technical person &#8211; was initially bamboozled at pretty much step one of the install process.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After double-clicking the installer that I&#8217;d downloaded by clicking the big &#8220;Download Now&#8221; button, I got the following message:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020\" title=\"IE9 Install Error\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error.jpg\" alt=\"Internet Explorer 9 Install Error: &quot;Wrong Version of Internet Explorer Installer - This version of setup doesn't support your Windows system type (32\/64 bit)&quot;\" width=\"506\" height=\"145\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error.jpg 506w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-300x85.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-150x42.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>My first thought was, &#8220;wrong version?&#8221;. \u00a0I didn&#8217;t remember having a choice of versions. \u00a0I just clicked the &#8220;Download Now&#8221; button. \u00a0Was there another version?<\/p>\n<p>My second thought was &#8220;What?&#8221;. \u00a0I mean, what is this telling me?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It tells me that I&#8217;ve done something wrong, but it doesn&#8217;t really tell me what I&#8217;ve done wrong.<\/li>\n<li>It uses technical language that a lot of people won&#8217;t understand: &#8220;32-bit\/64-bit&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>It assumes that you know that there are two &#8220;Windows system types&#8221;, which is not necessarily true.<\/li>\n<li>It tells me nothing about how to fix the problem or what I need to do to complete the install.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of particular confusion is the fact that it tells me I&#8217;ve used the wrong installer, but doesn&#8217;t tell me where to get the right installer.<\/p>\n<h2>Giving Up<\/h2>\n<p>I confess, I actually gave up at that point. \u00a0If MS can&#8217;t make this easy for a busy person I&#8217;m wasn&#8217;t going to bother.<\/p>\n<p>For the average user at this point I&#8217;ve got an error I probably don&#8217;t understand and no help in doing the job right. \u00a0There&#8217;s no encouragement to persevere and get it right either.<\/p>\n<h2>A Better Error<\/h2>\n<p>If this message was to remain technical, it should say something more like:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You&#8217;re trying to use the 32-bit installer on a 64-bit Windows system. \u00a0Please use the 64-bit installer instead&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>But, even better, this more technical information should be hidden under a &#8220;More information&#8221; button. \u00a0The error needs to be as simple as possible and give the user the simplest resolution.<\/p>\n<p>I suggest:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You are using the wrong version of the installer for your system. \u00a0Please download and install the right version to continue your upgrade to a faster, better internet experience.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Download Internet Explorer version 9 for your system<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">More Information on this error<\/span>&#8220;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Get it Right First Time<\/h2>\n<p>Even better would be to try to deliver the correct installer anyway &#8211; detect if the user is using 32- or 64-bit and have the download button deliver the correct version. \u00a0This can be easily done in JavaScript by testing the values of:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><code>window.navigator.cpuClass<\/code><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><code>window.navigator.platform<\/code><\/p>\n<p>(I confess to not having used these values before and a quick test shows that, in practice, cpuClass is &#8220;unknown&#8221; for my system and platform is &#8220;Win32&#8221;, so maybe MS try to detect this but it&#8217;s not reported correctly)<\/p>\n<h2>Lessons Learned<\/h2>\n<p>As a techie it&#8217;s easy to assume that everyone knows what I do and to unthoughtfully write error messages that may not be understood. \u00a0But especially for a tool that non-technical people will be installing, errors need to be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>clear;<\/li>\n<li>non-technical (but with an option to get a more technical message); and<\/li>\n<li>help me fix the problem or take the appropriate action to achieve my objective.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the meantime I&#8217;m downloading the 64-bit version and will let you know what I think soon.<\/p>\n<h3>Update<\/h3>\n<p>ARRGH! \u00a0OK, I&#8217;m now running the 64-bit version and I get this message:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024\" title=\"Confusing IE9 Install Dialog\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2.jpg\" alt=\"A confusing IE9 install dialog\" width=\"492\" height=\"190\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2.jpg 492w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2-300x115.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2-150x57.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Which again, suggests something quite complicated and scary while giving me very little help. \u00a0At this point I&#8217;m thinking:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What customized settings does this install include? \u00a0What will it change?<\/li>\n<li>What additional programs will it install?<\/li>\n<li>Is there an option to not install the additional programs?<\/li>\n<li>Is there a version that doesn&#8217;t include customized settings and additional programs?<\/li>\n<li>And if so where do I get it from?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>At least I get a link to the license terms but at this point I&#8217;m still clicking cancel. \u00a0I&#8217;ve been bitten before by &#8220;additional programs&#8221; being installed and I don&#8217;t trust Microsoft not to mess up my system.<\/p>\n<p>Back to watching the rugby.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Bizarrely this is not a post about my job hunting\/exploration of work options. \u00a0It&#8217;s a post about user experience with software.<\/p>\n<p>I did a module at University about human computer interaction and it was fascinating. \u00a0I love exploring psychology and how people interact with each other, themselves and what&#8217;s around them. \u00a0So I&#8217;ve been enjoying <a title=\"Experience not Evangelism - Andy Fryer's Blog\" href=\"http:\/\/andyfryer.blogspot.com\">Andy Fryer&#8217;s blog<\/a> which combines three topics of interest to me: User Experience; Pragmatic Environmentalism and; Cycling.<\/p>\n<p><!--more-->Andy&#8217;s posts about user experience have got me thinking a lot about my own experiences of human computer interaction and today has raised an interesting example.<\/p>\n<h2>IE9 for the Average Joe<\/h2>\n<p>As a web developer I like to stay on top of technology so I used a spare moment to get downloading Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer 9.<\/p>\n<p>We should bear in mind that web browsers are a pretty key piece of computer software these days and Microsoft are, of course, competing more and more with Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox, Google&#8217;s Chrome and others. \u00a0So an average man-on-the-street, non-technical person, wanting to take advantage of the new features and increased speed of IE9 should be given a VERY easy time when doing this upgrade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And yet, I &#8211; a highly technical person &#8211; was initially bamboozled at pretty much step one of the install process.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After double-clicking the installer that I&#8217;d downloaded by clicking the big &#8220;Download Now&#8221; button, I got the following message:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020\" title=\"IE9 Install Error\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error.jpg\" alt=\"Internet Explorer 9 Install Error: &quot;Wrong Version of Internet Explorer Installer - This version of setup doesn't support your Windows system type (32\/64 bit)&quot;\" width=\"506\" height=\"145\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error.jpg 506w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-300x85.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-150x42.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>My first thought was, &#8220;wrong version?&#8221;. \u00a0I didn&#8217;t remember having a choice of versions. \u00a0I just clicked the &#8220;Download Now&#8221; button. \u00a0Was there another version?<\/p>\n<p>My second thought was &#8220;What?&#8221;. \u00a0I mean, what is this telling me?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It tells me that I&#8217;ve done something wrong, but it doesn&#8217;t really tell me what I&#8217;ve done wrong.<\/li>\n<li>It uses technical language that a lot of people won&#8217;t understand: &#8220;32-bit\/64-bit&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>It assumes that you know that there are two &#8220;Windows system types&#8221;, which is not necessarily true.<\/li>\n<li>It tells me nothing about how to fix the problem or what I need to do to complete the install.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of particular confusion is the fact that it tells me I&#8217;ve used the wrong installer, but doesn&#8217;t tell me where to get the right installer.<\/p>\n<h2>Giving Up<\/h2>\n<p>I confess, I actually gave up at that point. \u00a0If MS can&#8217;t make this easy for a busy person I&#8217;m wasn&#8217;t going to bother.<\/p>\n<p>For the average user at this point I&#8217;ve got an error I probably don&#8217;t understand and no help in doing the job right. \u00a0There&#8217;s no encouragement to persevere and get it right either.<\/p>\n<h2>A Better Error<\/h2>\n<p>If this message was to remain technical, it should say something more like:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You&#8217;re trying to use the 32-bit installer on a 64-bit Windows system. \u00a0Please use the 64-bit installer instead&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>But, even better, this more technical information should be hidden under a &#8220;More information&#8221; button. \u00a0The error needs to be as simple as possible and give the user the simplest resolution.<\/p>\n<p>I suggest:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You are using the wrong version of the installer for your system. \u00a0Please download and install the right version to continue your upgrade to a faster, better internet experience.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Download Internet Explorer version 9 for your system<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">More Information on this error<\/span>&#8220;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Get it Right First Time<\/h2>\n<p>Even better would be to try to deliver the correct installer anyway &#8211; detect if the user is using 32- or 64-bit and have the download button deliver the correct version. \u00a0This can be easily done in JavaScript by testing the values of:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><code>window.navigator.cpuClass<\/code><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><code>window.navigator.platform<\/code><\/p>\n<p>(I confess to not having used these values before and a quick test shows that, in practice, cpuClass is &#8220;unknown&#8221; for my system and platform is &#8220;Win32&#8221;, so maybe MS try to detect this but it&#8217;s not reported correctly)<\/p>\n<h2>Lessons Learned<\/h2>\n<p>As a techie it&#8217;s easy to assume that everyone knows what I do and to unthoughtfully write error messages that may not be understood. \u00a0But especially for a tool that non-technical people will be installing, errors need to be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>clear;<\/li>\n<li>non-technical (but with an option to get a more technical message); and<\/li>\n<li>help me fix the problem or take the appropriate action to achieve my objective.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the meantime I&#8217;m downloading the 64-bit version and will let you know what I think soon.<\/p>\n<h3>Update<\/h3>\n<p>ARRGH! \u00a0OK, I&#8217;m now running the 64-bit version and I get this message:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024\" title=\"Confusing IE9 Install Dialog\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2.jpg\" alt=\"A confusing IE9 install dialog\" width=\"492\" height=\"190\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2.jpg 492w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2-300x115.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2-150x57.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Which again, suggests something quite complicated and scary while giving me very little help. \u00a0At this point I&#8217;m thinking:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What customized settings does this install include? \u00a0What will it change?<\/li>\n<li>What additional programs will it install?<\/li>\n<li>Is there an option to not install the additional programs?<\/li>\n<li>Is there a version that doesn&#8217;t include customized settings and additional programs?<\/li>\n<li>And if so where do I get it from?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>At least I get a link to the license terms but at this point I&#8217;m still clicking cancel. \u00a0I&#8217;ve been bitten before by &#8220;additional programs&#8221; being installed and I don&#8217;t trust Microsoft not to mess up my system.<\/p>\n<p>Back to watching the rugby.<\/p>\n",

Not giving too much away, the question was along the lines of:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>What output will you get from the following statements:<\/p>\n<p>x=4;<br \/>\necho x&lt;=6 ? &#8216;less than or equal to&#8217; : &#8216;greater than&#8217; . &#8216; six&#8217;;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: Apologies to those that don&#8217;t code at this point &#8211; this won&#8217;t make a whole load of sense.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a clever question because it lures you into thinking that the code is correct and will print &#8216;less than or equal to six&#8217;, but it actually prints just &#8216;less than or equal to&#8217;, because the precedence of the conditional operator is lower than that of string concatenation. \u00a0In case you&#8217;re wondering, no, I didn&#8217;t look this up as I know that the ternary operator has quite low precedence.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth nothing that this is, in my opinion, ambiguous code and any statement like this should always be written more clearly:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>echo (x &lt;= 6 ? &#8216;less than or equal to&#8217; : &#8216;greater than&#8217; ) . &#8216; six&#8217;;<sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1011-1' id='fnref-1011-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(1011)'>1<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Adding parentheses adds no computational overhead <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1011-2' id='fnref-1011-2' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(1011)'>2<\/a><\/sup> and makes the code easier to understand.<\/p>\n<h2>Learning languages<\/h2>\n<p>Do I also have evidence that learning new tools and languages is easier if you have a good grounding in computer science? \u00a0Well, yes.<\/p>\n<p>I was recently on a training course where we were learning a tool that had a built-in scripting language. \u00a0Some of the other guys on the course didn&#8217;t have my computer science background and theory. <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1011-3' id='fnref-1011-3' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(1011)'>3<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>When we got to doing exercises, they raced ahead for the first few, applying the specific bits of knowledge about the language they&#8217;d picked up from the course slides, while I was slow, asking questions like &#8220;what does that function return?&#8221;, or &#8220;why does that query do what it does?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>However, come the later exercises, where you had to do more than just refer back to the the slides, I&#8217;d gained a deeper understanding of the language and raced ahead.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always believed that a thorough grounding in the principles of programming makes you a better coder than someone who just picked up a book and started writing code. \u00a0Occasionally I see practical evidence of this being the case.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday&#8217;s test proved to me that, while I may not know the exact syntax and purpose of every last PHP function or configuration setting, I can still be a PHP expert, and that I have skills and knowledge that are more valuable than I thought.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps tomorrow I&#8217;ll be a C# expert!<\/p>\n<div class='footnotes' id='footnotes-1011'>\n<div class='footnotedivider'><\/div>\n<ol>\n<li id='fn-1011-1'> You can argue about putting the comparison operator in parentheses too, but it&#8217;s pretty safe to assume that a simple numerical comparison will have greater precedence over the conditional operator. <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-1011-1'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li id='fn-1011-2'> OK, perhaps a TINY overhead when PHP tokenises the script. <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-1011-2'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li id='fn-1011-3'> If they&#8217;re reading, I hope they don&#8217;t mind me sharing this story! <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-1011-3'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n",

        "content": "<p>OK, OK, yes, this post is partly blatent self-promotion, but it&#8217;s also a moment of honesty and a hopefully-interesting reflection on an interesting little test that I did today.<\/p>\n<h2><!--more-->What I do know<\/h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the facts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I do class myself as an expert in software engineering &#8211; the process of solving a given real-world problem using computer software.<\/li>\n<li>I do class myself as a very good developer and can quickly turn my hand to new languages and tools for developing software.<\/li>\n<li>I do class myself as a very good web developer. \u00a0I know back-end technologies like databases, SQL, and server administration; I know application development technologies like PHP and MVC frameworks; and I know front-end technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. \u00a0Plus, importantly, I understand the purposes of each and the interaction between them.<\/li>\n<li>However, I would only class myself as upper-intermediate in my PHP skills. \u00a0Yes, I&#8217;ve been using PHP for 4 years are part of my job, but it&#8217;s not been a full-time occupation and I&#8217;m still learning some of the more detailed aspects of the language.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, to prove my worth as a PHP developer, a recruitment consultant sent me a PHP technical test yesterday, and I was a little surprised by the result. \u00a0I got 95% and was in the top 4th percentile of people who took the test. \u00a0It suggested that, far from being intermediate, I was a PHP expert!!<\/p>\n<h2>A confession<\/h2>\n<p>A slight confession is needed at this point. \u00a0The test had a time limit and I approached this test as I would approach a working situation with a tight deadline. \u00a0If I could quickly look something up and understand it enough to answer the question (like, which parameters get passed to a given function), I did, but if it was going to take a while to understand I would either work it out or skip the question. \u00a0So yes, I did quickly look a couple of things up, but I also skipped those questions that I genuinely didn&#8217;t have a clue about. \u00a0And I completed the test in average time.<\/p>\n<p>Even so, I found the test tricky and felt far from confident at the end. \u00a0Why then, did I manage to do so well?<\/p>\n<h2>Languages are just tools<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s a become a bit of a cliche for me that &#8220;languages are just tools&#8221;, but there is a lot of truth in that. \u00a0My A&#8217; level computing teacher used to say that languages were like screwdrivers or chisels are to a woodworker: a good woodworker can pick up a new tool and use it effectively, the important thing is to know how to do woodwork &#8211; how to fit bits of wood together to build things.<\/p>\n<p>I did well at this test because I have a deep understanding of the building blocks of writing code; things like what functions do, recursion, variable scoping, operator precedence and associativity, objects and classes, bitwise operators, loop invariants, interactions between different elements of the system (the database, back-end and front-end), and so on.<\/p>\n<p>I understand the fundamentals of abstraction, encapsulation and decomposition upon which every program should be based.<\/p>\n<p>These are advanced programming concepts that someone who&#8217;s just learned a bit of PHP out of a book won&#8217;t understand, but which I can apply to pretty much any programming language.<\/p>\n<p>And to demonstrate the point, I&#8217;ve used languages as diverse as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scheme and Miranda (functional);<\/li>\n<li>C, Pascal and Ada (procedural);<\/li>\n<li>assembler (low-level);<\/li>\n<li>SmallTalk (object-oriented);<\/li>\n<li>JavaScript (most of the above, plus event-driven)<\/li>\n<li>Perl and PHP (text processing);<\/li>\n<li>Prolog (logic);<\/li>\n<li>and SQL (declarative, query-based).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;\">An example<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The operator precedence question is a good example. Not giving too much away, the question was along the lines of:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>What output will you get from the following statements:<\/p>\n<p>x=4;<br \/>\necho x&lt;=6 ? &#8216;less than or equal to&#8217; : &#8216;greater than&#8217; . &#8216; six&#8217;;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: Apologies to those that don&#8217;t code at this point &#8211; this won&#8217;t make a whole load of sense.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a clever question because it lures you into thinking that the code is correct and will print &#8216;less than or equal to six&#8217;, but it actually prints just &#8216;less than or equal to&#8217;, because the precedence of the conditional operator is lower than that of string concatenation. \u00a0In case you&#8217;re wondering, no, I didn&#8217;t look this up as I know that the ternary operator has quite low precedence.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth nothing that this is, in my opinion, ambiguous code and any statement like this should always be written more clearly:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>echo (x &lt;= 6 ? &#8216;less than or equal to&#8217; : &#8216;greater than&#8217; ) . &#8216; six&#8217;;<sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1011-1' id='fnref-1011-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(1011)'>1<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Adding parentheses adds no computational overhead <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1011-2' id='fnref-1011-2' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(1011)'>2<\/a><\/sup> and makes the code easier to understand.<\/p>\n<h2>Learning languages<\/h2>\n<p>Do I also have evidence that learning new tools and languages is easier if you have a good grounding in computer science? \u00a0Well, yes.<\/p>\n<p>I was recently on a training course where we were learning a tool that had a built-in scripting language. \u00a0Some of the other guys on the course didn&#8217;t have my computer science background and theory. <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1011-3' id='fnref-1011-3' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(1011)'>3<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>When we got to doing exercises, they raced ahead for the first few, applying the specific bits of knowledge about the language they&#8217;d picked up from the course slides, while I was slow, asking questions like &#8220;what does that function return?&#8221;, or &#8220;why does that query do what it does?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>However, come the later exercises, where you had to do more than just refer back to the the slides, I&#8217;d gained a deeper understanding of the language and raced ahead.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always believed that a thorough grounding in the principles of programming makes you a better coder than someone who just picked up a book and started writing code. \u00a0Occasionally I see practical evidence of this being the case.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday&#8217;s test proved to me that, while I may not know the exact syntax and purpose of every last PHP function or configuration setting, I can still be a PHP expert, and that I have skills and knowledge that are more valuable than I thought.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps tomorrow I&#8217;ll be a C# expert!<\/p>\n<div class='footnotes' id='footnotes-1011'>\n<div class='footnotedivider'><\/div>\n<ol>\n<li id='fn-1011-1'> You can argue about putting the comparison operator in parentheses too, but it&#8217;s pretty safe to assume that a simple numerical comparison will have greater precedence over the conditional operator. <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-1011-1'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li id='fn-1011-2'> OK, perhaps a TINY overhead when PHP tokenises the script. <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-1011-2'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li id='fn-1011-3'> If they&#8217;re reading, I hope they don&#8217;t mind me sharing this story! <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-1011-3'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n",

A quick, and very limited poll of people showed that 2 was probably a maximum. I&#8217;d not only agree with this but I would expand it to any kind of information that&#8217;s not actually the Tweet itself: @mentions, #hashtags and web links all included.<\/p>\n<p>I used, as an example, a charity that I wholeheartedly support the work of, but who I&#8217;ve had an on-and-0ff Twitter following of. \u00a0A couple of days later I used this Tweet from the same organization as another example.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/messy-tweet.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005\" title=\"Messy Tweet\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/messy-tweet.jpg\" alt=\"A Messy Tweet\" width=\"246\" height=\"71\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/messy-tweet.jpg 246w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/messy-tweet-150x43.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Lessons on Giving Feedback<\/h2>\n<p>To cut a long story short, using this as an example lead to another user I follow being incorrectly attributed a comment that I made which resulted in him getting some bad press. \u00a0It all ended well, but \u00a0felt pretty bad about it and have apologised and explained to the charity in more depth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 1<\/strong>: Giving feedback on Twitter is hard &#8211; 140 characters is often not enough to convey a complex piece of constructive criticism.<\/p>\n<p>and<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 2<\/strong>: If you&#8217;re replying to a tweet, make sure you understand who it&#8217;s from and that what you&#8217;re saying about them is correct.<\/p>\n<h2>Lessons on Using Twitter<\/h2>\n<p>The tweet above was not actually a Tweet from the organisation that I follow &#8211; it&#8217;s a &#8220;re-tweet&#8221; of another organisation, and I was even careful to not reveal the name of the organisation that I follow. \u00a0But it&#8217;s a fantastic example of a Tweet that I skim over. \u00a0It has:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>6 @mentions<\/li>\n<li>Two hashtags, one of which is a repeat of an @mention<\/li>\n<li>The RT prefix<\/li>\n<li>A link<\/li>\n<li>A total of 104 character of non-word content (I call this &#8220;meta-data&#8221;, it&#8217;s not the Tweet, it&#8217;s extra information about the Tweet or attached to the Tweet).<\/li>\n<li>Only 30 characters of English word content<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If I see anything like this in my stream I skim right over it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s not esaily readable.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s not clear what it&#8217;s telling me.<\/li>\n<li>It doesn&#8217;t tell me why I should follow the link.<\/li>\n<li>It assumes that I know what the LBLuk hashtag is about.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s a &#8220;Follow Friday&#8221; (a recommendation that I should follow another user), but one that doesn&#8217;t explain why I should follow that other user.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s a &#8220;re-tweet&#8221; &#8211; a sharing of another user&#8217;s tweet &#8211; a &#8220;Follow Friday&#8221; and a link all at the same time; it has three separate purposes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, one question might be: &#8220;OK Ross, so what would you have done?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I think I&#8217;d have not re-tweeted to start with &#8211; the original didn&#8217;t make much sense and RT&#8217;ing it will make it make less sense. \u00a0I&#8217;d have sent two original tweets instead:<\/p>\n<p>Tweet 1. &#8220;Have you seen Live below the Line? \u00a0Trying to live on less than \u00a31 a day &#8211; are you ready? Video here: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/6953cpo #lblUK&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This explains what the link is, suggests why I might click it (to find out about the campaign) and introduces the hashtag which, from the content of the Tweet, I can probably work out the meaning of now.<\/p>\n<p>Tweet 2. &#8220;Follow Friday: The Live Below the Line campaign, @lblUK &#8211; trying to live on less than \u00a31 a day. #lblUK<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think the #ff hashtag is particularly useful. In fact, with Twitter search and trends I don&#8217;t think that turning ordinary words into hashtags is of much use. \u00a0However, specific tags for specific campaigns or events are useful, so I&#8217;ve left in the #lblUK hashtag as we know what it means now and it is probably useful. \u00a0I&#8217;ve given the opportunity for users to follow @lblUK if they want to, which is the intention of the Tweet.<\/p>\n<p>If the other users are important too you could write a third:<\/p>\n<p>Tweet 3: &#8220;Follow Friday: Live Below the Line campaign partners: @SAIDUK, @christian_aid&#8230;.etc&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 3<\/strong>: Some users will not read a tweet if it contains lots of &#8220;meta-data&#8221;. Keep this to a minimum to keep tweets readable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 4<\/strong>: Think about what response your tweet is trying to invoke. Make that response as easy as possible for the reader to understand and action.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 5<\/strong>: Think about hashtags &#8211; they break up the flow of writing. \u00a0Is it really necessary to turn key words into hashtags? \u00a0Does this bring benefit to your users or to you?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 6<\/strong>: If you&#8217;re going to partake in Follow Friday, keep the users you&#8217;re suggesting to a minimum and explain why they may be of interest.<\/p>\n<p>As I thought about this and looked through my Twitter timeline looking for examples and thinking &#8220;what would I skip the reading of&#8221;, I also noticed that I would skip over tweets written in mostly upper case. \u00a0Interesting!<\/p>\n<p>More generally, that screen grab is from my iPhone Twitter app, and I reckon anywhere that there&#8217;s more underlined content than non-underlined content will be automatically ignored by me as too difficult to read and understand quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Volume is also an issue &#8211; for me, organisations that tweet lots of similar content will eventually be ignored or unfollowed. \u00a0Keep it easy to read, relevant, new and interesting. \u00a0Repeat the same messages or bombarding me with content will not make me listen &#8211; quite the opposite.<\/p>\n<h2>Lessons on Learning Social Media Lessons<\/h2>\n<p>There are no rules about how to use Twitter &#8211; that&#8217;s one of the things I like about it. \u00a0Social Media is a new and evolving form of communication. \u00a0We&#8217;re still developing ettiquette, patterns of use and so on. \u00a0The lessons here are mostly based on how I use Twitter as a reader. It may be different for others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 7<\/strong>: There are no rules, but think about how you use social media as a reader, that will probably help you with writing for social media.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, too, that I&#8217;m probably guilty of breaking my own rules and of also writing illegible Tweets. \u00a0I&#8217;m also sorry if I&#8217;ve caused anyone negative feeling or bad press.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 7<\/strong>: No one&#8217;s perfect!<\/p>\n<p>I love that social media has enabled us to have this discussion, and I love that the non-profits I support are actively using it to engage with their supporters.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think? \u00a0What causes you to skip a tweet? \u00a0What individuals or organisations use social media well? \u00a0And what is it about the way they use it that makes it good?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll start with <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ctc_cyclists\">@CTC_Cyclists<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/nationaltrust\">@nationaltrust<\/a>, I think they&#8217;re great examples of using Twitter well.<\/p>\n",

A quick, and very limited poll of people showed that 2 was probably a maximum. I&#8217;d not only agree with this but I would expand it to any kind of information that&#8217;s not actually the Tweet itself: @mentions, #hashtags and web links all included.<\/p>\n<p>I used, as an example, a charity that I wholeheartedly support the work of, but who I&#8217;ve had an on-and-0ff Twitter following of. \u00a0A couple of days later I used this Tweet from the same organization as another example.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/messy-tweet.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005\" title=\"Messy Tweet\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/messy-tweet.jpg\" alt=\"A Messy Tweet\" width=\"246\" height=\"71\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/messy-tweet.jpg 246w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/messy-tweet-150x43.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Lessons on Giving Feedback<\/h2>\n<p>To cut a long story short, using this as an example lead to another user I follow being incorrectly attributed a comment that I made which resulted in him getting some bad press. \u00a0It all ended well, but \u00a0felt pretty bad about it and have apologised and explained to the charity in more depth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 1<\/strong>: Giving feedback on Twitter is hard &#8211; 140 characters is often not enough to convey a complex piece of constructive criticism.<\/p>\n<p>and<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 2<\/strong>: If you&#8217;re replying to a tweet, make sure you understand who it&#8217;s from and that what you&#8217;re saying about them is correct.<\/p>\n<h2>Lessons on Using Twitter<\/h2>\n<p>The tweet above was not actually a Tweet from the organisation that I follow &#8211; it&#8217;s a &#8220;re-tweet&#8221; of another organisation, and I was even careful to not reveal the name of the organisation that I follow. \u00a0But it&#8217;s a fantastic example of a Tweet that I skim over. \u00a0It has:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>6 @mentions<\/li>\n<li>Two hashtags, one of which is a repeat of an @mention<\/li>\n<li>The RT prefix<\/li>\n<li>A link<\/li>\n<li>A total of 104 character of non-word content (I call this &#8220;meta-data&#8221;, it&#8217;s not the Tweet, it&#8217;s extra information about the Tweet or attached to the Tweet).<\/li>\n<li>Only 30 characters of English word content<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If I see anything like this in my stream I skim right over it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s not esaily readable.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s not clear what it&#8217;s telling me.<\/li>\n<li>It doesn&#8217;t tell me why I should follow the link.<\/li>\n<li>It assumes that I know what the LBLuk hashtag is about.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s a &#8220;Follow Friday&#8221; (a recommendation that I should follow another user), but one that doesn&#8217;t explain why I should follow that other user.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s a &#8220;re-tweet&#8221; &#8211; a sharing of another user&#8217;s tweet &#8211; a &#8220;Follow Friday&#8221; and a link all at the same time; it has three separate purposes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, one question might be: &#8220;OK Ross, so what would you have done?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I think I&#8217;d have not re-tweeted to start with &#8211; the original didn&#8217;t make much sense and RT&#8217;ing it will make it make less sense. \u00a0I&#8217;d have sent two original tweets instead:<\/p>\n<p>Tweet 1. &#8220;Have you seen Live below the Line? \u00a0Trying to live on less than \u00a31 a day &#8211; are you ready? Video here: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/6953cpo #lblUK&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This explains what the link is, suggests why I might click it (to find out about the campaign) and introduces the hashtag which, from the content of the Tweet, I can probably work out the meaning of now.<\/p>\n<p>Tweet 2. &#8220;Follow Friday: The Live Below the Line campaign, @lblUK &#8211; trying to live on less than \u00a31 a day. #lblUK<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think the #ff hashtag is particularly useful. In fact, with Twitter search and trends I don&#8217;t think that turning ordinary words into hashtags is of much use. \u00a0However, specific tags for specific campaigns or events are useful, so I&#8217;ve left in the #lblUK hashtag as we know what it means now and it is probably useful. \u00a0I&#8217;ve given the opportunity for users to follow @lblUK if they want to, which is the intention of the Tweet.<\/p>\n<p>If the other users are important too you could write a third:<\/p>\n<p>Tweet 3: &#8220;Follow Friday: Live Below the Line campaign partners: @SAIDUK, @christian_aid&#8230;.etc&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 3<\/strong>: Some users will not read a tweet if it contains lots of &#8220;meta-data&#8221;. Keep this to a minimum to keep tweets readable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 4<\/strong>: Think about what response your tweet is trying to invoke. Make that response as easy as possible for the reader to understand and action.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 5<\/strong>: Think about hashtags &#8211; they break up the flow of writing. \u00a0Is it really necessary to turn key words into hashtags? \u00a0Does this bring benefit to your users or to you?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 6<\/strong>: If you&#8217;re going to partake in Follow Friday, keep the users you&#8217;re suggesting to a minimum and explain why they may be of interest.<\/p>\n<p>As I thought about this and looked through my Twitter timeline looking for examples and thinking &#8220;what would I skip the reading of&#8221;, I also noticed that I would skip over tweets written in mostly upper case. \u00a0Interesting!<\/p>\n<p>More generally, that screen grab is from my iPhone Twitter app, and I reckon anywhere that there&#8217;s more underlined content than non-underlined content will be automatically ignored by me as too difficult to read and understand quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Volume is also an issue &#8211; for me, organisations that tweet lots of similar content will eventually be ignored or unfollowed. \u00a0Keep it easy to read, relevant, new and interesting. \u00a0Repeat the same messages or bombarding me with content will not make me listen &#8211; quite the opposite.<\/p>\n<h2>Lessons on Learning Social Media Lessons<\/h2>\n<p>There are no rules about how to use Twitter &#8211; that&#8217;s one of the things I like about it. \u00a0Social Media is a new and evolving form of communication. \u00a0We&#8217;re still developing ettiquette, patterns of use and so on. \u00a0The lessons here are mostly based on how I use Twitter as a reader. It may be different for others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 7<\/strong>: There are no rules, but think about how you use social media as a reader, that will probably help you with writing for social media.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, too, that I&#8217;m probably guilty of breaking my own rules and of also writing illegible Tweets. \u00a0I&#8217;m also sorry if I&#8217;ve caused anyone negative feeling or bad press.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson 7<\/strong>: No one&#8217;s perfect!<\/p>\n<p>I love that social media has enabled us to have this discussion, and I love that the non-profits I support are actively using it to engage with their supporters.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think? \u00a0What causes you to skip a tweet? \u00a0What individuals or organisations use social media well? \u00a0And what is it about the way they use it that makes it good?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll start with <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ctc_cyclists\">@CTC_Cyclists<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/nationaltrust\">@nationaltrust<\/a>, I think they&#8217;re great examples of using Twitter well.<\/p>\n",
