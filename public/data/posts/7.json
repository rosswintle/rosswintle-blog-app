                "rendered": "\n<p>I have a client with a WordPress site who is getting lots of spam form submissions. For a long time I have used Ben Marshall&#8217;s excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/zero-spam\/\">WordPress Zero Spam plugin<\/a>, which was originally a simple implementation of a <a href=\"https:\/\/davidwalsh.name\/wordpress-comment-spam\">simple idea from David Walsh<\/a> for preventing spam.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>David&#8217;s idea was kinda like a reverse honeypot. A traditional honeypot is a hidden HTML input that is empty. It tempts the bots into filling it in with a value. Because it&#8217;s hidden a human won&#8217;t see it and fill it in, so a submitted honeypot value probably means a bot filled the form in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Walsh used JavaScript to ADD an input to the form, and the spam test was to detect this additional input. All this really did was say &#8220;this form was submitted by a browser that runs JavaScript&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two problems with this method.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, it requires JavaScript to be working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And secondly, spam is clearly an arms race, and the game is to stay one step ahead of the bots. Most bots, it seems, aren&#8217;t currently running headless browsers that run JavaScript. I always though the David Walsh method would soon be defeated but it&#8217;s been working well for the many years I&#8217;ve been using it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230; Ben Marshall (note: I&#8217;m REALLY grateful for Ben&#8217;s work and I have every respect for him) removed the David Walsh method from version 5 of his plugin, and then added it back in, but it only currently seems to work for comment forms and WordPress registration forms. And I need it to integrate with WP Forms and Gravity Forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another implementation of the David Walsh method exists in <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/binarymoon\">Ben Gillbanks<\/a>&#8216;s excellent, multi-purpose &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-toolbelt\/\">Toolbelt<\/a>&#8221; plugin. But this only works for Gravity Forms and Jetpack in addition to the standard WordPress forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NOW&#8230; both these plugins are open source, so I could pull-request the features I need into the plugins. And I may do that, but it will take time to understand the plugin structure and add it and get the changes approved and published by the authors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My client needs a quick fix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s always bugged me that JavaScript is needed for the David Walsh method. So I got thinking&#8230; can we do something without JavaScript?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An idea<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s the idea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the bots don&#8217;t seem to be running browsers, I assume they are just scraping the form, figuring out the input fields, and POST&#8217;ing responses to the action URLs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I thought: we don&#8217;t want JavaScript, but what might we do with CSS? I eventually settled on the idea that we can load an image with CSS and this can hit a server endpoint. If we can do this conditionally based on some user action then we can tell the server we are real.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The server can then add the IP address of the browser to an allow list temporarily (we&#8217;ll come back to this) and allow form submissions from it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially I thought you could use the &#8220;active&#8221; state on the submit button element to trigger a load of a background image &#8220;pixel&#8221; on an adjacent element using something like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: css; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\ninput&#x5B;type=&quot;submit&quot;]:active + .pixel {\n  background-image: url(&lt;pixel-url&gt;);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I chose <code>active<\/code> over <code>focus<\/code> because I wasn&#8217;t sure if a mobile device button press would trigger focus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with <code>active<\/code> is: does this give enough time before the form submits to do the allow-listing that the pixel URL\/endpoint does?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my tests the answer was no. I thought I would get a race condition, but it actually seemed that the browser cancelled the background-image load to submit the form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I needed another approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I eventually discovered the <code>focus-within<\/code> state. This state is set on an element when any child element has focus. And this meant that I could load the pixel and do the allow-listing when the user is filling in the form using CSS like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: css; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nform:focus-within .pixel {\n  background-image: url(&lt;pixel-url&gt;);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>We can then use the pixel URL endpoint to add the browser&#8217;s IP address to the allow-list for a set period of time (would have to be long enough for the user to fill in the form), and then check the allow list when the form is submitted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I initially tested this as a proof of concept with a simple Laravel application form:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"CSS only spam\/allow-listing CAPTCHA thingy proof of concept\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/529274399?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This worked and proved the concept. But as a real test I needed to get it quickly onto my client&#8217;s site that had lots of spam, so I quickly cooked up <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/0f65bea09a59b19d4486f190c46198bb\">a one-file WordPress plugin<\/a> that integrated this method with WP Forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tested this locally with success:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"CSS only spam\/allow-listing captcha thingy in WP Forms\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/529279362?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"326\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And then deployed to the client site to see what happened. I wait to see if it works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Update: My client has had two days with no spam, the logs I&#8217;m creating show that spam is being blocked, and we&#8217;re also seeing genuine enquiries getting through. It WORKS!! (I think!!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Questions and explanations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some things I&#8217;ve got questions about and some things that I&#8217;ve already thought through.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How is this better than a traditional honeypot?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bots seem to have figured out how to circumvent some traditional honeypots. I&#8217;ve always found the David Walsh technique to be more effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How is this better than the David Walsh technique?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t use JavaScript. And it&#8217;s MINE!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Storing the allow-list<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This, like all spam-prevention solutions, is not perfect. For one thing I&#8217;m using transients to store the allow-listed IP addresses. The reason for this is that if I stored a single option with a list of IP addresses in then this could have race conditions that caused IP addresses to not make it on the list. This will clutter up the options table with transient entries. So I need to re-think that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generating a testing a nonce has been suggested as an alternative. These are not stored in the database so are cleaner. But there&#8217;s probably page-caching issues. I will investigate this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Won&#8217;t bots just allow-list themselves by hitting the pixel URL?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess the idea here is that this is not a widely-known spam prevention measure. The aim is to get another step ahead of the bots. The bots go for the easy wins &#8211; they attack the holes that are likely to get them access across a large number of sites. So diversity of spam prevention solutions seems good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I could get another step ahead by periodically changing the pixel URL and the class name on the pixel element.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Won&#8217;t this stop working once bots start using headless browsers?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. But I think at that point, aside from implementing proper (Re)CAPTCHAs, I think we&#8217;re probably screwed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Accessibility and screen-readers and browser support<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I probably need to make a couple of accessibility improvements, mainly properly hiding the pixel element from screen readers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also not sure how this will work with some screen readers. Can I assume that screen readers set the focus state? Do screen readers support the focus-within state?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And focus-within doesn&#8217;t work on IE11.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thought I&#8217;d has is that you could detect focus and enable the pixel using Javascript as well as CSS. Then CSS acts as a fallback for when Javascript isn&#8217;t available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What if CSS is disabled<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems this can be done. But I wonder what the probably that both CSS and JS are unavailable in the real world is? My CSS is inlined, so it doesn&#8217;t need an extra file to be loaded. The only case would be if someone had deliberately disabled CSS. Does anyone do that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are there privacy\/data protection\/GDPR issues?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>IP addresses are classed as personal data. But if someone&#8217;s sending you a form submission then you&#8217;re probably already collecting personal data. I would just be clear in our the privacy policy that the IP address is stored temporarily for spam prevention purposes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Will you be making this into a WordPress plugin\/Laravel package?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, you can see <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/0f65bea09a59b19d4486f190c46198bb\">the simple WordPress plugin code I got working with WP Forms<\/a>. That&#8217;s currently being tested on a site that I know gets spam form entries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can take that and try to make your own integrations\/plugins\/packages. I&#8217;d love people to take this concept and run with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

        "title": "Idea: CSS-only spam prevention with a simple allow-list and CAPTCHA",
        "content": "\n<p>I have a client with a WordPress site who is getting lots of spam form submissions. For a long time I have used Ben Marshall&#8217;s excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/zero-spam\/\">WordPress Zero Spam plugin<\/a>, which was originally a simple implementation of a <a href=\"https:\/\/davidwalsh.name\/wordpress-comment-spam\">simple idea from David Walsh<\/a> for preventing spam.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>David&#8217;s idea was kinda like a reverse honeypot. A traditional honeypot is a hidden HTML input that is empty. It tempts the bots into filling it in with a value. Because it&#8217;s hidden a human won&#8217;t see it and fill it in, so a submitted honeypot value probably means a bot filled the form in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Walsh used JavaScript to ADD an input to the form, and the spam test was to detect this additional input. All this really did was say &#8220;this form was submitted by a browser that runs JavaScript&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two problems with this method.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, it requires JavaScript to be working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And secondly, spam is clearly an arms race, and the game is to stay one step ahead of the bots. Most bots, it seems, aren&#8217;t currently running headless browsers that run JavaScript. I always though the David Walsh method would soon be defeated but it&#8217;s been working well for the many years I&#8217;ve been using it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230; Ben Marshall (note: I&#8217;m REALLY grateful for Ben&#8217;s work and I have every respect for him) removed the David Walsh method from version 5 of his plugin, and then added it back in, but it only currently seems to work for comment forms and WordPress registration forms. And I need it to integrate with WP Forms and Gravity Forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another implementation of the David Walsh method exists in <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/binarymoon\">Ben Gillbanks<\/a>&#8216;s excellent, multi-purpose &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-toolbelt\/\">Toolbelt<\/a>&#8221; plugin. But this only works for Gravity Forms and Jetpack in addition to the standard WordPress forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NOW&#8230; both these plugins are open source, so I could pull-request the features I need into the plugins. And I may do that, but it will take time to understand the plugin structure and add it and get the changes approved and published by the authors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My client needs a quick fix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s always bugged me that JavaScript is needed for the David Walsh method. So I got thinking&#8230; can we do something without JavaScript?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An idea<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s the idea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the bots don&#8217;t seem to be running browsers, I assume they are just scraping the form, figuring out the input fields, and POST&#8217;ing responses to the action URLs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I thought: we don&#8217;t want JavaScript, but what might we do with CSS? I eventually settled on the idea that we can load an image with CSS and this can hit a server endpoint. If we can do this conditionally based on some user action then we can tell the server we are real.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The server can then add the IP address of the browser to an allow list temporarily (we&#8217;ll come back to this) and allow form submissions from it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially I thought you could use the &#8220;active&#8221; state on the submit button element to trigger a load of a background image &#8220;pixel&#8221; on an adjacent element using something like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: css; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\ninput&#x5B;type=&quot;submit&quot;]:active + .pixel {\n  background-image: url(&lt;pixel-url&gt;);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I chose <code>active<\/code> over <code>focus<\/code> because I wasn&#8217;t sure if a mobile device button press would trigger focus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with <code>active<\/code> is: does this give enough time before the form submits to do the allow-listing that the pixel URL\/endpoint does?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my tests the answer was no. I thought I would get a race condition, but it actually seemed that the browser cancelled the background-image load to submit the form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I needed another approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I eventually discovered the <code>focus-within<\/code> state. This state is set on an element when any child element has focus. And this meant that I could load the pixel and do the allow-listing when the user is filling in the form using CSS like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: css; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nform:focus-within .pixel {\n  background-image: url(&lt;pixel-url&gt;);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>We can then use the pixel URL endpoint to add the browser&#8217;s IP address to the allow-list for a set period of time (would have to be long enough for the user to fill in the form), and then check the allow list when the form is submitted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I initially tested this as a proof of concept with a simple Laravel application form:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"CSS only spam\/allow-listing CAPTCHA thingy proof of concept\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/529274399?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This worked and proved the concept. But as a real test I needed to get it quickly onto my client&#8217;s site that had lots of spam, so I quickly cooked up <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/0f65bea09a59b19d4486f190c46198bb\">a one-file WordPress plugin<\/a> that integrated this method with WP Forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tested this locally with success:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"CSS only spam\/allow-listing captcha thingy in WP Forms\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/529279362?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"326\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And then deployed to the client site to see what happened. I wait to see if it works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Update: My client has had two days with no spam, the logs I&#8217;m creating show that spam is being blocked, and we&#8217;re also seeing genuine enquiries getting through. It WORKS!! (I think!!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Questions and explanations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some things I&#8217;ve got questions about and some things that I&#8217;ve already thought through.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How is this better than a traditional honeypot?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bots seem to have figured out how to circumvent some traditional honeypots. I&#8217;ve always found the David Walsh technique to be more effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How is this better than the David Walsh technique?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t use JavaScript. And it&#8217;s MINE!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Storing the allow-list<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This, like all spam-prevention solutions, is not perfect. For one thing I&#8217;m using transients to store the allow-listed IP addresses. The reason for this is that if I stored a single option with a list of IP addresses in then this could have race conditions that caused IP addresses to not make it on the list. This will clutter up the options table with transient entries. So I need to re-think that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generating a testing a nonce has been suggested as an alternative. These are not stored in the database so are cleaner. But there&#8217;s probably page-caching issues. I will investigate this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Won&#8217;t bots just allow-list themselves by hitting the pixel URL?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess the idea here is that this is not a widely-known spam prevention measure. The aim is to get another step ahead of the bots. The bots go for the easy wins &#8211; they attack the holes that are likely to get them access across a large number of sites. So diversity of spam prevention solutions seems good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I could get another step ahead by periodically changing the pixel URL and the class name on the pixel element.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Won&#8217;t this stop working once bots start using headless browsers?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. But I think at that point, aside from implementing proper (Re)CAPTCHAs, I think we&#8217;re probably screwed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Accessibility and screen-readers and browser support<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I probably need to make a couple of accessibility improvements, mainly properly hiding the pixel element from screen readers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also not sure how this will work with some screen readers. Can I assume that screen readers set the focus state? Do screen readers support the focus-within state?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And focus-within doesn&#8217;t work on IE11.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thought I&#8217;d has is that you could detect focus and enable the pixel using Javascript as well as CSS. Then CSS acts as a fallback for when Javascript isn&#8217;t available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What if CSS is disabled<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems this can be done. But I wonder what the probably that both CSS and JS are unavailable in the real world is? My CSS is inlined, so it doesn&#8217;t need an extra file to be loaded. The only case would be if someone had deliberately disabled CSS. Does anyone do that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are there privacy\/data protection\/GDPR issues?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>IP addresses are classed as personal data. But if someone&#8217;s sending you a form submission then you&#8217;re probably already collecting personal data. I would just be clear in our the privacy policy that the IP address is stored temporarily for spam prevention purposes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Will you be making this into a WordPress plugin\/Laravel package?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, you can see <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/0f65bea09a59b19d4486f190c46198bb\">the simple WordPress plugin code I got working with WP Forms<\/a>. That&#8217;s currently being tested on a site that I know gets spam form entries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can take that and try to make your own integrations\/plugins\/packages. I&#8217;d love people to take this concept and run with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>So I wanted to have a play with <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/8.x\/starter-kits#laravel-breeze\">Laravel Breeze<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/jetstream.laravel.com\/\">Jetstream<\/a>. In doing so I noticed that the instructions for Breeze (and for Laravel in general) suggest a Docker-based <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/8.x\/sail\">Laravel Sail<\/a> install by default.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had not looked into Docker despite a lot of hype around it recently in my tech world. So I used the new Laravel encouragements to give it a shot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;I have the slight problem that I have an ARM\/Apple Silicon\/M1 MacBook, and, while a <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.docker.com\/docker-for-mac\/apple-m1\/\">Docker Tech Preview (beta) exists for this<\/a>, it has issues, and there are some things that aren&#8217;t suppored &#8211; including MySQL!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This post is a super-quick overview of Sail, the issues I had on Apple Silicon and how I fixed them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Overview of Docker and Laravel Sail<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is covered in much more detail elsewhere, but Docker is a way of making lightweight virtual machines called &#8220;containers&#8221;. Rather than running a full blown operating system, these make use of what is already there in the existing operating system and they only add or change what is not there or different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/olilafleur\">Olivier Lafleur<\/a> recommended <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/shanselman\">Scott Hanselman&#8217;s<\/a> excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0oEsMwSxBsk\">video introduction<\/a> if you want more detail on this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel Sail is a set of scripts and configurations that allow you to fire up a bunch of containers running services that, together, get a Laravel application up and running. These services include MySQL and PHP but you get others too like Redis and Mailhog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may, after digging in a bit, note that there is no web server (Apache\/nginx) and this is because Sail uses PHP&#8217;s built-in web server. You can see it starting up <a href=\"http:\/\/command=\/usr\/bin\/php -d variables_order=EGPCS \/var\/www\/html\/artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80\">in the supervisord.conf file<\/a> of the Laravel container.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that the containers are, for the most part, temporary\/ephemeral and kinda don&#8217;t save their state. They get created. And they get destroyed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exception to this is the MySql container which uses a Docker &#8220;volume&#8221; to store its data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with Docker and aren&#8217;t interested in its internals then what you need to know is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Your Laravel project files are mapped into the container. Any changes you make locally are reflected inside the container immediately.<\/li><li>Your database is persisted. (I believe Redis state is too, but I&#8217;m not sure what the benefit of this is.)<\/li><li>Everything else is destroyed when you shut Sail down. Mostly because it doesn&#8217;t NEED to be saved. You just recreate everything in its default state the next time you need it.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/osteel\">Yannick<\/a>&#8216;s <a href=\"https:\/\/tech.osteel.me\/posts\/you-dont-need-laravel-sail\">awesome post<\/a> gives an excellent and very detailed overview of both Docker and Sail that I&#8217;ve yet to read in full. And the free <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/whats-new-in-laravel-8\/episodes\/12\">Laracasts video<\/a> was also pretty helpful in understanding Sail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be a Valet or MAMP user who&#8217;s wondering what the benefits of this approach are. And I think that for smaller projects there probably aren&#8217;t many benefits. But for bigger projects there definitely are, such as ensuring the development and live environments are the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My own curiosity came from the fact that I&#8217;d been thinking about security and how all these node and composer packages could be doing anything on my laptop. Putting them inside a container limited their ability to run amok on my laptop when doing local development. So I wanted to try it out from that point of view.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Issues with Apple Silicon\/M1<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summary: Sail doesn&#8217;t quite work<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sail, out of the box, doesn&#8217;t work with Apple Silicon\/M1 computers. But you can make most of it work. If you know how.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given this, I found it pretty surprising that it&#8217;s now the recommended way to get up and running with Laravel. If you&#8217;re a beginner then following the installation instructions and immediately hitting a very-complicated-to-resolve failure may put you right off. I&#8217;m NOT a beginner, but I&#8217;m empathetic and often see different sides of an experience. This would not be a good experience for a new-to-Laravel developer on an M1 Mac.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sail advertises itself as &#8220;a great starting point for building a Laravel application using PHP, MySQL, and Redis without requiring prior Docker experience&#8221;, but on my machine, I needed to learn an awful lot of Docker to make it work and understand a few other things too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could argue that Docker for the M1 Mac&#8217;s is in tech preview\/beta, so you should not expect things to work. But I still think that people will want to try it, the documentation around it isn&#8217;t good enough, and there are some small changes that would really help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These instructions assume you have a new Laravel project created with Sail, or you&#8217;ve installed Sail into an existing Laravel project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fix 1: Remove Meilisearch<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Meilisearch is broken. You can build the Docker images with it in place, and you can start Sail up, but when you try to interact with Sail you get an error and Sail shuts down:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$ vendor\/bin\/sail shell\nbreeze_meilisearch_1    tini -- \/bin\/sh -c .\/meili ...   Exit 1\nShutting down old Sail processes...\nSail is not running.\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Meilisearch feels like a very optional requirement. So I removed it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Edit the docker-compose.yml in the root of your Laravel project and remove <code>meilisearch<\/code> from the <code>depends_on<\/code> section of the <code>laravel.test<\/code> service:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: yaml; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n        depends_on:\n            - mariadb\n            - redis\n            - selenium\n            - meilisearch\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Then you can delete, or if you&#8217;re hopeful of a future fix comment out, the lines for the <code>meilisearch<\/code> service lower down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then rebuild your containers with <code>vendor\/bin\/sail build<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: I believe that if you&#8217;re installing Sail interactively then you are prompted to choose which services to install. You can just not install Meilisearch at this point and skip this first fix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fix 2: Swap MySql for MariaDB<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Next you&#8217;ll find that the <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.docker.com\/_\/mysql\">MySql Docker image<\/a> doesn&#8217;t support ARM processors like the M1. This is even <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.docker.com\/docker-for-mac\/apple-m1\/#known-issues\">documented by Docker<\/a> with two solutions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Run with the <code>--platform linux\/amd64<\/code> flag, which I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to do.<\/li><li>Use MariaDB instead. This <em>seemed<\/em> like an easier option, and would perform better as it would run native.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this you need to modify a couple of things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, edit the <code>docker-compose.yml<\/code> file in the root of your project and replace <code>mysql<\/code> with <code>mariadb<\/code> in the <code>depends_on<\/code> section of the <code>laravel.test<\/code> service:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n        depends_on:\n            - mariadb\n            - redis\n            - selenium\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll then want to rename the <code>mysql<\/code> service as a <code>mariadb<\/code> service and install the right Docker image (this needs a version number but I don&#8217;t know what to give, so I&#8217;m just using the latest I guess?)<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: yaml; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n    mariadb:\n        image: 'mariadb'\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Leave the rest of the mysql config intact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then again, rebuild the containers with <code>vendor\/bin\/sail build<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This installs MariaDB instead of MySQL which will nicely run native, but if you try to do anything with your database at this point you&#8217;ll get connection errors:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"474\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-10.54.57@2x-1024x474.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9973\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-10.54.57@2x-1024x474.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-10.54.57@2x-300x139.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-10.54.57@2x-768x356.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-10.54.57@2x-1536x712.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-10.54.57@2x-2048x949.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>but you need to configure your app to talk to the right service on the network, so edit your <code>.env<\/code> and change the <code>DB_HOST<\/code> from <code>mysql<\/code> to <code>mariadb<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nDB_HOST=mariadb\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to rebuild your containers for this.

It makes use of <a href=\"https:\/\/beyondco.de\/\">Beyond Code<\/a>&#8216;s open-source <a href=\"https:\/\/beyondco.de\/docs\/expose\/introduction\">Expose<\/a> product which sets up tunnels similar to ngrok and the &#8220;valet share&#8221; command if you&#8217;ve ever used that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this also fails.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This appears to run and set up a connections, but it seems that something somewhere just isn&#8217;t running.

I&#8217;ve copied <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/laravel\/sail\/blob\/f7a857531a135c756c980f6df1bc47978577ca8e\/bin\/sail#L268\">the command from the Sail script<\/a> and tried running it manually with the platform flag:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\ndocker run --platform linux\/amd64 --init beyondcodegmbh\/expose-server share http:\/\/host.docker.internal:&quot;$APP_PORT&quot; \\\n            --server-host=laravel-sail.site \\\n            --server-port=8080\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>This gets rid of the platform error, but this still didn&#8217;t work, so maybe it&#8217;s a wider expose problem. I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where are my volumes\/databases?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, there&#8217;s this very hidden-away bit of Docker that I really wanted to understand but couldn&#8217;t: volumes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d wondered if I could see the database files and maybe run a non-Docker database against them. But for all my hunting I could not find any data files for my application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The closest I got was running <code>docker inspect &lt;volume name&gt;<\/code>, which gave me this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$ docker inspect breeze_sailmysql\n&#x5B;\n    {\n        &quot;CreatedAt&quot;: &quot;2021-03-02T10:53:58Z&quot;,\n        &quot;Driver&quot;: &quot;local&quot;,\n        &quot;Labels&quot;: {\n            &quot;com.docker.compose.project&quot;: &quot;breeze&quot;,\n            &quot;com.docker.compose.version&quot;: &quot;1.28.2&quot;,\n            &quot;com.docker.compose.volume&quot;: &quot;sailmysql&quot;\n        },\n        &quot;Mountpoint&quot;: &quot;\/var\/lib\/docker\/volumes\/breeze_sailmysql\/_data&quot;,\n        &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;breeze_sailmysql&quot;,\n        &quot;Options&quot;: null,\n        &quot;Scope&quot;: &quot;local&quot;\n    }\n]\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And I figured I should look for <code>\/var\/lib\/docker\/volumes\/breeze_sailmysql\/_data<\/code>, but I couldn&#8217;t find this or anything like it anywhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Searching my local filesystem for Docker stuff revealed a 60GB file at <code>\/Users\/rosswintle\/Library\/Containers\/com.docker.docker\/Data\/vms\/0\/data\/Docker.raw<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is referenced in the Docker preferences:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"641\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-11.31.42@2x-1024x641.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9977\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-11.31.42@2x-1024x641.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-11.31.42@2x-300x188.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-11.31.42@2x-768x481.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-11.31.42@2x-1536x961.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-11.31.42@2x-2048x1282.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m assuming this is some kind of virtual filesystem thing that stores my containers volumes locally.

So I used the new Laravel encouragements to give it a shot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;I have the slight problem that I have an ARM\/Apple Silicon\/M1 MacBook, and, while a <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.docker.com\/docker-for-mac\/apple-m1\/\">Docker Tech Preview (beta) exists for this<\/a>, it has issues, and there are some things that aren&#8217;t suppored &#8211; including MySQL!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This post is a super-quick overview of Sail, the issues I had on Apple Silicon and how I fixed them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Overview of Docker and Laravel Sail<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is covered in much more detail elsewhere, but Docker is a way of making lightweight virtual machines called &#8220;containers&#8221;. Rather than running a full blown operating system, these make use of what is already there in the existing operating system and they only add or change what is not there or different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/olilafleur\">Olivier Lafleur<\/a> recommended <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/shanselman\">Scott Hanselman&#8217;s<\/a> excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0oEsMwSxBsk\">video introduction<\/a> if you want more detail on this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel Sail is a set of scripts and configurations that allow you to fire up a bunch of containers running services that, together, get a Laravel application up and running. These services include MySQL and PHP but you get others too like Redis and Mailhog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may, after digging in a bit, note that there is no web server (Apache\/nginx) and this is because Sail uses PHP&#8217;s built-in web server. You can see it starting up <a href=\"http:\/\/command=\/usr\/bin\/php -d variables_order=EGPCS \/var\/www\/html\/artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80\">in the supervisord.conf file<\/a> of the Laravel container.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that the containers are, for the most part, temporary\/ephemeral and kinda don&#8217;t save their state. They get created. And they get destroyed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exception to this is the MySql container which uses a Docker &#8220;volume&#8221; to store its data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with Docker and aren&#8217;t interested in its internals then what you need to know is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Your Laravel project files are mapped into the container. Any changes you make locally are reflected inside the container immediately.<\/li><li>Your database is persisted. (I believe Redis state is too, but I&#8217;m not sure what the benefit of this is.)<\/li><li>Everything else is destroyed when you shut Sail down. Mostly because it doesn&#8217;t NEED to be saved. You just recreate everything in its default state the next time you need it.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/osteel\">Yannick<\/a>&#8216;s <a href=\"https:\/\/tech.osteel.me\/posts\/you-dont-need-laravel-sail\">awesome post<\/a> gives an excellent and very detailed overview of both Docker and Sail that I&#8217;ve yet to read in full. And the free <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/whats-new-in-laravel-8\/episodes\/12\">Laracasts video<\/a> was also pretty helpful in understanding Sail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be a Valet or MAMP user who&#8217;s wondering what the benefits of this approach are. And I think that for smaller projects there probably aren&#8217;t many benefits. But for bigger projects there definitely are, such as ensuring the development and live environments are the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My own curiosity came from the fact that I&#8217;d been thinking about security and how all these node and composer packages could be doing anything on my laptop. Putting them inside a container limited their ability to run amok on my laptop when doing local development. So I wanted to try it out from that point of view.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Issues with Apple Silicon\/M1<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summary: Sail doesn&#8217;t quite work<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sail, out of the box, doesn&#8217;t work with Apple Silicon\/M1 computers. But you can make most of it work. If you know how.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given this, I found it pretty surprising that it&#8217;s now the recommended way to get up and running with Laravel. If you&#8217;re a beginner then following the installation instructions and immediately hitting a very-complicated-to-resolve failure may put you right off. I&#8217;m NOT a beginner, but I&#8217;m empathetic and often see different sides of an experience. This would not be a good experience for a new-to-Laravel developer on an M1 Mac.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sail advertises itself as &#8220;a great starting point for building a Laravel application using PHP, MySQL, and Redis without requiring prior Docker experience&#8221;, but on my machine, I needed to learn an awful lot of Docker to make it work and understand a few other things too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could argue that Docker for the M1 Mac&#8217;s is in tech preview\/beta, so you should not expect things to work. But I still think that people will want to try it, the documentation around it isn&#8217;t good enough, and there are some small changes that would really help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These instructions assume you have a new Laravel project created with Sail, or you&#8217;ve installed Sail into an existing Laravel project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fix 1: Remove Meilisearch<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Meilisearch is broken. You can build the Docker images with it in place, and you can start Sail up, but when you try to interact with Sail you get an error and Sail shuts down:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$ vendor\/bin\/sail shell\nbreeze_meilisearch_1    tini -- \/bin\/sh -c .\/meili ...   Exit 1\nShutting down old Sail processes...\nSail is not running.\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Meilisearch feels like a very optional requirement. So I removed it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Edit the docker-compose.yml in the root of your Laravel project and remove <code>meilisearch<\/code> from the <code>depends_on<\/code> section of the <code>laravel.test<\/code> service:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: yaml; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n        depends_on:\n            - mariadb\n            - redis\n            - selenium\n            - meilisearch\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Then you can delete, or if you&#8217;re hopeful of a future fix comment out, the lines for the <code>meilisearch<\/code> service lower down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then rebuild your containers with <code>vendor\/bin\/sail build<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: I believe that if you&#8217;re installing Sail interactively then you are prompted to choose which services to install. You can just not install Meilisearch at this point and skip this first fix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fix 2: Swap MySql for MariaDB<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Next you&#8217;ll find that the <a href=\"https:\/\/hub.docker.com\/_\/mysql\">MySql Docker image<\/a> doesn&#8217;t support ARM processors like the M1. This is even <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.docker.com\/docker-for-mac\/apple-m1\/#known-issues\">documented by Docker<\/a> with two solutions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Run with the <code>--platform linux\/amd64<\/code> flag, which I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to do.<\/li><li>Use MariaDB instead. This <em>seemed<\/em> like an easier option, and would perform better as it would run native.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this you need to modify a couple of things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, edit the <code>docker-compose.yml<\/code> file in the root of your project and replace <code>mysql<\/code> with <code>mariadb<\/code> in the <code>depends_on<\/code> section of the <code>laravel.test<\/code> service:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n        depends_on:\n            - mariadb\n            - redis\n            - selenium\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll then want to rename the <code>mysql<\/code> service as a <code>mariadb<\/code> service and install the right Docker image (this needs a version number but I don&#8217;t know what to give, so I&#8217;m just using the latest I guess?)<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: yaml; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n    mariadb:\n        image: 'mariadb'\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Leave the rest of the mysql config intact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then again, rebuild the containers with <code>vendor\/bin\/sail build<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This installs MariaDB instead of MySQL which will nicely run native, but if you try to do anything with your database at this point you&#8217;ll get connection errors:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"474\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-10.54.57@2x-1024x474.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9973\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-10.54.57@2x-1024x474.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-10.54.57@2x-300x139.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-10.54.57@2x-768x356.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-10.54.57@2x-1536x712.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-10.54.57@2x-2048x949.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>but you need to configure your app to talk to the right service on the network, so edit your <code>.env<\/code> and change the <code>DB_HOST<\/code> from <code>mysql<\/code> to <code>mariadb<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nDB_HOST=mariadb\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to rebuild your containers for this.

It makes use of <a href=\"https:\/\/beyondco.de\/\">Beyond Code<\/a>&#8216;s open-source <a href=\"https:\/\/beyondco.de\/docs\/expose\/introduction\">Expose<\/a> product which sets up tunnels similar to ngrok and the &#8220;valet share&#8221; command if you&#8217;ve ever used that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this also fails.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This appears to run and set up a connections, but it seems that something somewhere just isn&#8217;t running.

I&#8217;ve copied <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/laravel\/sail\/blob\/f7a857531a135c756c980f6df1bc47978577ca8e\/bin\/sail#L268\">the command from the Sail script<\/a> and tried running it manually with the platform flag:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: bash; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\ndocker run --platform linux\/amd64 --init beyondcodegmbh\/expose-server share http:\/\/host.docker.internal:&quot;$APP_PORT&quot; \\\n            --server-host=laravel-sail.site \\\n            --server-port=8080\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>This gets rid of the platform error, but this still didn&#8217;t work, so maybe it&#8217;s a wider expose problem. I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where are my volumes\/databases?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, there&#8217;s this very hidden-away bit of Docker that I really wanted to understand but couldn&#8217;t: volumes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d wondered if I could see the database files and maybe run a non-Docker database against them. But for all my hunting I could not find any data files for my application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The closest I got was running <code>docker inspect &lt;volume name&gt;<\/code>, which gave me this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$ docker inspect breeze_sailmysql\n&#x5B;\n    {\n        &quot;CreatedAt&quot;: &quot;2021-03-02T10:53:58Z&quot;,\n        &quot;Driver&quot;: &quot;local&quot;,\n        &quot;Labels&quot;: {\n            &quot;com.docker.compose.project&quot;: &quot;breeze&quot;,\n            &quot;com.docker.compose.version&quot;: &quot;1.28.2&quot;,\n            &quot;com.docker.compose.volume&quot;: &quot;sailmysql&quot;\n        },\n        &quot;Mountpoint&quot;: &quot;\/var\/lib\/docker\/volumes\/breeze_sailmysql\/_data&quot;,\n        &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;breeze_sailmysql&quot;,\n        &quot;Options&quot;: null,\n        &quot;Scope&quot;: &quot;local&quot;\n    }\n]\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And I figured I should look for <code>\/var\/lib\/docker\/volumes\/breeze_sailmysql\/_data<\/code>, but I couldn&#8217;t find this or anything like it anywhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Searching my local filesystem for Docker stuff revealed a 60GB file at <code>\/Users\/rosswintle\/Library\/Containers\/com.docker.docker\/Data\/vms\/0\/data\/Docker.raw<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is referenced in the Docker preferences:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"641\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-11.31.42@2x-1024x641.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9977\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-11.31.42@2x-1024x641.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-11.31.42@2x-300x188.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-11.31.42@2x-768x481.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-11.31.42@2x-1536x961.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/CleanShot-2021-03-02-at-11.31.42@2x-2048x1282.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m assuming this is some kind of virtual filesystem thing that stores my containers volumes locally.

They are around:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Business\/strategy &#8211; how there may (or may not) be benefit in positioning yourself as a sustainable web designer\/developer.<\/li><li>UX &#8211; there are some nuggets around user journeys that I&#8217;d not considered before. Reducing page loads is good!<\/li><li>Spaceflight (!) &#8211; as an aviation geek and wannabe engineer I&#8217;m fascinated by space flight tech, and there&#8217;s some interesting stuff about the emissions from SpaceX&#8217;s Starlink satellite launches.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve often wondered about carbon emissions of spaceflight and satellite deployment, but apparently a SpaceX Starlink launch is &#8220;roughly equivalent to 5 full passenger planes journeying from London to Sydney&#8221; and &#8220;a fraction of what it would take to build physical infrastructure&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This stat is from The Smithsonian via <a href=\"https:\/\/wholegraindigital.com\/curiously-green\/issue-2\/\">Wholegrain&#8217;s newsletter<\/a> and it looks like it&#8217;s actually ONLY the fuel burning cost, so includes none of the embodied energy in the vehicle (energy used to make the rocket and fuel).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have to wonder how much energy is needed to make liquid oxygen and create and move around these colossal metal structures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Aside: I have so many questions about the use of super-cold liquid fuels in rockets!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing from the book that terrified me is the thought that so much of the UK&#8217;s internet backbone is in Docklands and could be flooded. If we lost a good proportion of our internet backbone I dread to think what would happen. Supply chains would collapse. My work would disappear overnight. Etc, etc. I&#8217;m sure there are backups and backups of backups for critical stuff like this but even so. Plus, the flooding map of London&#8230; ARGH!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I close with this quote from the book&#8217;s conclusion:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There is no downside to a sustainable web, and creating it isn\u2019t fundamentally difficult. In fact, it\u2019s one of the most tangible and achievable steps in the zero-carbon revolution we\u2019re embarking on.&#8221;<\/p>\n",

Reducing page loads is good!<\/li><li>Spaceflight (!) &#8211; as an aviation geek and wannabe engineer I&#8217;m fascinated by space flight tech, and there&#8217;s some interesting stuff about the emissions from SpaceX&#8217;s Starlink satellite launches.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve often wondered about carbon emissions of spaceflight and satellite deployment, but apparently a SpaceX Starlink launch is &#8220;roughly equivalent to 5 full passenger planes journeying from London to Sydney&#8221; and &#8220;a fraction of what it would take to build physical infrastructure&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This stat is from The Smithsonian via <a href=\"https:\/\/wholegraindigital.com\/curiously-green\/issue-2\/\">Wholegrain&#8217;s newsletter<\/a> and it looks like it&#8217;s actually ONLY the fuel burning cost, so includes none of the embodied energy in the vehicle (energy used to make the rocket and fuel).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have to wonder how much energy is needed to make liquid oxygen and create and move around these colossal metal structures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Aside: I have so many questions about the use of super-cold liquid fuels in rockets!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing from the book that terrified me is the thought that so much of the UK&#8217;s internet backbone is in Docklands and could be flooded. If we lost a good proportion of our internet backbone I dread to think what would happen. Supply chains would collapse. My work would disappear overnight. Etc, etc. I&#8217;m sure there are backups and backups of backups for critical stuff like this but even so. Plus, the flooding map of London&#8230; ARGH!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I close with this quote from the book&#8217;s conclusion:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There is no downside to a sustainable web, and creating it isn\u2019t fundamentally difficult. In fact, it\u2019s one of the most tangible and achievable steps in the zero-carbon revolution we\u2019re embarking on.&#8221;<\/p>\n",

You kinda have to pay for a small hosting account just to do the redirects. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, today I went looking into whether you can do this for free with GitHub Pages or Netlify or something, and <a href=\"https:\/\/netlify.com\/\">Netlify<\/a> has come up trumps!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out you can add a <code>_redirects<\/code> file to your Netlify site. This file lets you do reasonably sophisticated redirecting with wildcards and placeholders and status code control. Neat! Map your domain, and you get HTTPS for free too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can add a site to Netlify by dragging and dropping files into the &#8220;Dropzone&#8221; or, if you&#8217;re happy using Git, you can deploy from a Git repository.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/CleanShot-2021-02-05-at-18.37.53-1024x694.png\" alt=\"Screengrab showing Netlify's &quot;Dropzone&quot; for creating new sites\" class=\"wp-image-9891\" width=\"768\" height=\"521\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/CleanShot-2021-02-05-at-18.37.53-1024x694.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/CleanShot-2021-02-05-at-18.37.53-300x203.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/CleanShot-2021-02-05-at-18.37.53-768x520.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/CleanShot-2021-02-05-at-18.37.53.png 1258w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Netlify&#8217;s documentation explains the details of how this works and the redirects file format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.netlify.com\/routing\/redirects\/\">Details of the redirection feature<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.netlify.com\/routing\/redirects\/redirect-options\/\">_redirects file format<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The one gotcha I found is that you do actually have to deploy a file other than <code>_redirects<\/code> into your Netlify site. Otherwise the deployment gets stuck. But don&#8217;t create an index.html as this will be served as a default for the domain breaking any fallback redirect. So I suggest creating a <code>404.html<\/code> or something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Process<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Create a folder on your computer with a <code>404.html<\/code> (this can contain whatever you need) and a <code>_redirects<\/code> file.<\/li><li>Edit the redirects file to add the rules you need<\/li><li>Log in to Netlify &#8211; create an account if you don&#8217;t have one<\/li><li>Click &#8220;Sites&#8221; in the Netlify menu and scroll down (if you need to) to the Dropzone (as seen in the image above)<\/li><li>Drag and drop the folder from your cpmputer into the drop zone to create the site (you can drag and drop the folder to update the site&#8217;s files too)<\/li><li>In the Netlify site settings, map your domain (for the source URLs) and then go to your DNS provider and update your DNS according to the instructions provided by Netlify.<\/li><li>LetsEncrypt HTTPS certificates will be provided automatically by Netlify when DNS has propagated.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Using Git<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can deploy from a Git repository too. If you&#8217;re happy with doing this then I&#8217;m doing to assume you&#8217;re tech-savvy enough to figure this out for yourself. Sorry if that&#8217;s an incorrect assumption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other uses&#8230;?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I&#8217;m even thinking this could be a very simple way to run a free custom URL shortener.

        "content": "\n<p><em>Note: I&#8217;m jotting this down quickly while I remember &#8211; I may expand it with example code in future.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s always frustrated me that to redirect one domain to another domain can be tricky and costly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, some domain\/DNS providers let you do this, but not all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yes, you might be able to add the source domain to the hosting for the target domain. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if, for some reason, you can&#8217;t do either of those things. You kinda have to pay for a small hosting account just to do the redirects. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, today I went looking into whether you can do this for free with GitHub Pages or Netlify or something, and <a href=\"https:\/\/netlify.com\/\">Netlify<\/a> has come up trumps!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out you can add a <code>_redirects<\/code> file to your Netlify site. This file lets you do reasonably sophisticated redirecting with wildcards and placeholders and status code control. Neat! Map your domain, and you get HTTPS for free too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can add a site to Netlify by dragging and dropping files into the &#8220;Dropzone&#8221; or, if you&#8217;re happy using Git, you can deploy from a Git repository.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/CleanShot-2021-02-05-at-18.37.53-1024x694.png\" alt=\"Screengrab showing Netlify's &quot;Dropzone&quot; for creating new sites\" class=\"wp-image-9891\" width=\"768\" height=\"521\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/CleanShot-2021-02-05-at-18.37.53-1024x694.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/CleanShot-2021-02-05-at-18.37.53-300x203.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/CleanShot-2021-02-05-at-18.37.53-768x520.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/CleanShot-2021-02-05-at-18.37.53.png 1258w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Netlify&#8217;s documentation explains the details of how this works and the redirects file format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.netlify.com\/routing\/redirects\/\">Details of the redirection feature<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.netlify.com\/routing\/redirects\/redirect-options\/\">_redirects file format<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The one gotcha I found is that you do actually have to deploy a file other than <code>_redirects<\/code> into your Netlify site. Otherwise the deployment gets stuck. But don&#8217;t create an index.html as this will be served as a default for the domain breaking any fallback redirect. So I suggest creating a <code>404.html<\/code> or something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Process<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Create a folder on your computer with a <code>404.html<\/code> (this can contain whatever you need) and a <code>_redirects<\/code> file.<\/li><li>Edit the redirects file to add the rules you need<\/li><li>Log in to Netlify &#8211; create an account if you don&#8217;t have one<\/li><li>Click &#8220;Sites&#8221; in the Netlify menu and scroll down (if you need to) to the Dropzone (as seen in the image above)<\/li><li>Drag and drop the folder from your cpmputer into the drop zone to create the site (you can drag and drop the folder to update the site&#8217;s files too)<\/li><li>In the Netlify site settings, map your domain (for the source URLs) and then go to your DNS provider and update your DNS according to the instructions provided by Netlify.<\/li><li>LetsEncrypt HTTPS certificates will be provided automatically by Netlify when DNS has propagated.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Using Git<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can deploy from a Git repository too. If you&#8217;re happy with doing this then I&#8217;m doing to assume you&#8217;re tech-savvy enough to figure this out for yourself. Sorry if that&#8217;s an incorrect assumption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other uses&#8230;?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I&#8217;m even thinking this could be a very simple way to run a free custom URL shortener.

And so I thought it was time to get some rambling thoughts down on paper about WP-UI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"What is WP-UI?\">What is WP-UI?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wpui_app\">WP-UI<\/a> is a desktop app I\u2019m building in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.electronjs.org\/\">Electron<\/a> that makes working with WordPress quick and easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s quite hard to explain, but:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If you know what <a href=\"https:\/\/wp-cli.org\/\">WP-CLI<\/a> is, then the aim is for it to be a GUI version of that.<\/li><li>If you know what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.phpmyadmin.net\/\">PHPMyAdmin<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adminer.org\/\">Adminer<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/sequelpro.com\/\">Sequel Pro<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/sequel-ace.com\/\">Sequel Ace<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.araelium.com\/querious\">Querious<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tableplus.io\/\">Table Plus<\/a> are then it\u2019s like a WordPress-aware version of that that requires no SQL knowledge.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen-1024x649.jpg\" alt=\"Screen grab of WP-UI\" class=\"wp-image-9787\" width=\"768\" height=\"487\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen-1024x649.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen-300x190.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen-768x487.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen.jpg 1365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><figcaption>Screengrab of WP-UI showing a post list<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>WP-UI lets you inspect WordPress data quickly and easily. And ultimately I\u2019d like you to be able to modify data through it and take actions like managing plugins and themes, deleting transients, running cron jobs &#8211; lots of the things WP-CLI lets you do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Why I\u2019m building it\">Why I\u2019m building it<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kinda because I wanted it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d seen a product called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/invoker.dev\/\">Invoker<\/a>\u201d that does a similar thing for Laravel applications, and thought \u201cI\u2019d love this for WordPress\u201d. And I had <a href=\"https:\/\/desktopappswithelectron.com\/\">a video course on building Electron apps<\/a>. So I put the two together and started building to see what was possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My initial aim was to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>See if my initial ideas were possible<\/li><li>Learn some more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.electronjs.org\/\">Electron<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/vuejs.org\/\">Vue.js<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/\">Tailwind CSS<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But I got in quite deep beyond an initial prototype!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"How I\u2019m building WP-UI\">How I\u2019m building WP-UI<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.electronjs.org\/\">Electron<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/vuejs.org\/\">VueJS.<\/a> I currently use <a href=\"https:\/\/router.vuejs.org\/\">vue-router<\/a>, but not <a href=\"https:\/\/vuex.vuejs.org\/\">vuex<\/a>. I\u2019m kinda putting off adding vuex into the mix because it seems to come with warnings of \u201cyou probably don\u2019t need this\u201d, yet I think it\u2019s inevitable for what I\u2019m doing here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m styling with <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/\">TailwindCSS<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\/\">TailwindUI<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the abstractions I currently have that power the thing, I have a bunch of Vue components for things like table headers, rows and data items. These help componentise the markup, which is essential for using Tailwind without going crazy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a fairly good abstraction for running PHP\/WordPress. Electron has a node back-end that lets me call command line commands. So I\u2019m running a PHP command line instance and passing it some PHP code to run, then catching the output of the command.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The abstraction automatically uses the PHP binary set in the applications options, and loads <code class=\"code-inline\">wp-load.php<\/code> (I should do this more intelligently &#8211; it assumes it\u2019s in the root of your project for now).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This PHP code has to echo something out that we can get back into JavaScript for display. You usually end with something like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code class=\"code-inline\">echo json_encode( [ ... some stuff you need \u2026 ] );<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, back in JavaScript\/Vue land you JSON.parse the output back into a usable object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This all works nicely and doesn\u2019t require any plugins or anything to be installed into WordPress. Writing PHP code inside a JavaScript string is pretty weird but I\u2019m not doing anything hugely complex. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a better way though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should add that I\u2019m trying, where possible, to use WordPress APIs rather than going straight to writing SQL queries, though in some cases SQL is needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an extra abstraction, the application uses lots of \u201cpost lists\u201d. So I\u2019ve build a post list API that runs instances of <code>WP_Query<\/code> for you and populates a table. You pass it query options and it creates the table for you. It adds pagination, search, and (I hope, eventually) sorting in for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Posts are kinda special and used a lot though, and I\u2019m considering what other abstractions would be helpful. This is where the \u201cam I building a framework?\u201d thing comes in. More on this later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Security\">Security<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I need to jot things down about security while I think of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve honestly not thought through security properly yet. But I guess it works on the principle that if you can use WP-UI on a WordPress install you\u2019ve got shell access anyways so all bets are off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I am thinking through things like: can someone store something in the WordPress database that when I pull it out could do weird stuff on your local machine?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Definitely needs more thought though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"What is your plan for it?\">What is your plan for it?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not entirely sure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d like it to be a paid product of some sort, but there are a LOT of steps to get to that point (licensing, allowing trials, payments and eCommerce, support processes, documentation, legal stuff, tax stuff like VAT, marketing, to name but a few).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several people have asked if I will open source it? But I\u2019ve put a fair bit of time into this now and I consider it an \u201casset\u201d that I think has value and would like to make some money from if I can. And I hope it\u2019s a tool that will have value for others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Will this need to be GPL licensed?\">Will this need to be GPL licensed?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there\u2019s this thing about tools that integrate with WordPress needing to be GPL licensed. I think this is possible without making the source code public. And if I\u2019m to keep it as a paid product then this is what I will want to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Thoughts about extending WP-UI\">Thoughts about extending WP-UI<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where Caleb and Daniel\u2019s discussion application code vs framework code and the iterations of framework code got me thinking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of their conversation was about how, eventually, if you\u2019re writing a framework, it\u2019s good to be super-modular. They talk about how good frameworks seem to end up with \u201cloader\u201d files that contain a bunch of lines that just import functionality from discrete packages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would LOVE for WP-UI to be like this and, subsequently, extendable by others in this sort of way. This is how WP-CLI works. And I think Invoker will eventually have extensions that work like this too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is a REALLY interesting space. I\u2019m kinda chuffed that my brain has gone down the route of thinking like this. I feel like it\u2019s a pretty advanced thing to be thinking of this in abstract enough terms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>RIGHT NOW I\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m almost daily, when working on WP-UI, having to decide if I make a layer abstract or not. Whether to do something quickly so that I can deliver WP-UI into the hands of people, or whether to spend time on refactor to make things more abstract and extendable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, I have a couple of good abstractions as mentioned above:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>One for running PHP (though this could be better) &#8211; a JavaScript class\/object that I can pass some PHP code to and have that code executed in the context of the currently-configured WordPress project.<\/li><li>One for lists of WordPress posts (you basically pass it a set of WP_Query options and it builds the data table)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I think Post Lists will always be \u201cspecial\u201d because they\u2019re quite complex. But I feel like the other tables probably need to be abstracted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can see a world where an extension:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Defines a new \u201cPage\u201d in the app<\/li><li>Gives some PHP code to run that produces output matching a specific format<\/li><li>Specifies how that data output is converted into tables (by specifying column types, which columns are searchable and sortable, for example)<\/li><li>Specifies how rows in the data table map to other, \u201csingle-entry\u201d screens.<\/li><li>Somehow specifies \u201cactions\u201d for rows in the data table that can run PHP code to make stuff happen &#8211; this probably needs variables\/placeholders to be made available somehow.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These \u201cdo I abstract?\u201d questions are huge at this point, because I\u2019m accumulating technical debt. I\u2019m deciding to add work to the pile for myself if I want to make the abstraction later on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m tending towards thinking that I need to get a version 1 out that\u2019s less frameworky and extendable. I want people to be able to use this thing! So that\u2019s v1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then v2 will be a big refactor that makes it more frameworky. Build the internal APIs, define the data formats, then refactor all my internal pages to use those APIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my main App file should become a loader file that contains a bunch of lines that import the pages of the app from discrete packages! Win!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does this mean I\u2019m building a framework? This isn\u2019t what I set out to do!! But maybe I AM! Eeeek!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, something like this would allow you to do stuff like extend WP-UI to allow it to act as a desktop app for managing WooCommerce orders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonkers! (In a good way)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"A brief aside on datatables and UI libraries\">A brief aside on datatables and UI libraries<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While writing this I looked into some datatable libraries like <a href=\"https:\/\/datatables.net\/\">https:\/\/datatables.net\/<\/a> and I came across the <a href=\"https:\/\/vuetifyjs.com\/en\/\">Vuetify<\/a> design framework too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It got me wondering if it would be possible and beneficial to use something like this rather than crafting everything myself with Tailwind UI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the initial phase of this project it\u2019s been SUPER helpful for me to build things by myself with just Tailwind UI taking care of the layout and some styling. I\u2019ve learned a LOT of Vue along the way and really feel like a JavaScript application programmer (which I never thought I would say).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But maybe I\u2019ll eject out into a UI framework like this in future. It certainly seems like I\u2019ve re-invented the wheel a bit! In some cases this may be necessary, but in many I suspect it\u2019s not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"What else would you like it to do?\">What else would you like it to do?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a roadmap with a bunch of minor tweaks, and some bigger ideas. Eventually I\u2019d like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>To allow editing as well as just viewing of data<\/li><li>To handle serialised data nicely somehow<\/li><li>To be able to use with remote (live?!) sites over SSH<\/li><li>To allow actions to be taken, such as updating plugins, or expiring transients<\/li><li>There was also a cool idea that someone suggested where the application could show you the code that it runs. This would allow you to visually build a query or action in WP-UI by selecting the page, filters, pagination options, sorting, etc and then get the WP_Query or other PHP code to paste back into your theme\/plugin\/whatever.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So\u2026lots of ideas. But\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"How does this fit with the block editor and full site editing?\">How does this fit with the block editor and full site editing?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a really interesting question I\u2019ve asked myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block editing, full-site-editing and so on are (in my opinion) turning WordPress away from general content management and towards being a publishing platform that cares less for structure data. Data is being pushed into in-post HTML-comments rather than being made available in a structured way in WordPress\u2019s relational database.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And WP-UI is really a relational database explorer. Most of my use cases are exploring things like post meta and options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don\u2019t know if this tool even has a medium\/long term future given the direction of WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I march onwards anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s see where we get to. Follow along at <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wpui_app\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/wpui_app<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A website is coming soon!<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Building WP-UI",
        "content": "\n<p>I was listening to the <a href=\"https:\/\/noplanstomerge.com\/63\">No Plans To Merge guys today discussing the rebuild of Laravel Livewire<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a segment where they were talking about the difference between building an application and building a framework and how you start to build things one way that\u2019s a bit hacky to get things going and then completely rework things later on to make it more modular.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I realised that this is KINDA what I\u2019m doing with building <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wpui_app\">WP-UI<\/a>. And so I thought it was time to get some rambling thoughts down on paper about WP-UI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"What is WP-UI?\">What is WP-UI?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wpui_app\">WP-UI<\/a> is a desktop app I\u2019m building in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.electronjs.org\/\">Electron<\/a> that makes working with WordPress quick and easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s quite hard to explain, but:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If you know what <a href=\"https:\/\/wp-cli.org\/\">WP-CLI<\/a> is, then the aim is for it to be a GUI version of that.<\/li><li>If you know what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.phpmyadmin.net\/\">PHPMyAdmin<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adminer.org\/\">Adminer<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/sequelpro.com\/\">Sequel Pro<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/sequel-ace.com\/\">Sequel Ace<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.araelium.com\/querious\">Querious<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tableplus.io\/\">Table Plus<\/a> are then it\u2019s like a WordPress-aware version of that that requires no SQL knowledge.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen-1024x649.jpg\" alt=\"Screen grab of WP-UI\" class=\"wp-image-9787\" width=\"768\" height=\"487\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen-1024x649.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen-300x190.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen-768x487.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen.jpg 1365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><figcaption>Screengrab of WP-UI showing a post list<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>WP-UI lets you inspect WordPress data quickly and easily. And ultimately I\u2019d like you to be able to modify data through it and take actions like managing plugins and themes, deleting transients, running cron jobs &#8211; lots of the things WP-CLI lets you do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Why I\u2019m building it\">Why I\u2019m building it<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kinda because I wanted it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d seen a product called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/invoker.dev\/\">Invoker<\/a>\u201d that does a similar thing for Laravel applications, and thought \u201cI\u2019d love this for WordPress\u201d. And I had <a href=\"https:\/\/desktopappswithelectron.com\/\">a video course on building Electron apps<\/a>. So I put the two together and started building to see what was possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My initial aim was to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>See if my initial ideas were possible<\/li><li>Learn some more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.electronjs.org\/\">Electron<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/vuejs.org\/\">Vue.js<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/\">Tailwind CSS<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But I got in quite deep beyond an initial prototype!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"How I\u2019m building WP-UI\">How I\u2019m building WP-UI<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.electronjs.org\/\">Electron<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/vuejs.org\/\">VueJS.<\/a> I currently use <a href=\"https:\/\/router.vuejs.org\/\">vue-router<\/a>, but not <a href=\"https:\/\/vuex.vuejs.org\/\">vuex<\/a>. I\u2019m kinda putting off adding vuex into the mix because it seems to come with warnings of \u201cyou probably don\u2019t need this\u201d, yet I think it\u2019s inevitable for what I\u2019m doing here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m styling with <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/\">TailwindCSS<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\/\">TailwindUI<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the abstractions I currently have that power the thing, I have a bunch of Vue components for things like table headers, rows and data items. These help componentise the markup, which is essential for using Tailwind without going crazy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a fairly good abstraction for running PHP\/WordPress. Electron has a node back-end that lets me call command line commands. So I\u2019m running a PHP command line instance and passing it some PHP code to run, then catching the output of the command.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The abstraction automatically uses the PHP binary set in the applications options, and loads <code class=\"code-inline\">wp-load.php<\/code> (I should do this more intelligently &#8211; it assumes it\u2019s in the root of your project for now).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This PHP code has to echo something out that we can get back into JavaScript for display. You usually end with something like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code class=\"code-inline\">echo json_encode( [ ... some stuff you need \u2026 ] );<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, back in JavaScript\/Vue land you JSON.parse the output back into a usable object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This all works nicely and doesn\u2019t require any plugins or anything to be installed into WordPress. Writing PHP code inside a JavaScript string is pretty weird but I\u2019m not doing anything hugely complex. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a better way though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should add that I\u2019m trying, where possible, to use WordPress APIs rather than going straight to writing SQL queries, though in some cases SQL is needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an extra abstraction, the application uses lots of \u201cpost lists\u201d. So I\u2019ve build a post list API that runs instances of <code>WP_Query<\/code> for you and populates a table. You pass it query options and it creates the table for you. It adds pagination, search, and (I hope, eventually) sorting in for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Posts are kinda special and used a lot though, and I\u2019m considering what other abstractions would be helpful. This is where the \u201cam I building a framework?\u201d thing comes in. More on this later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Security\">Security<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I need to jot things down about security while I think of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve honestly not thought through security properly yet. But I guess it works on the principle that if you can use WP-UI on a WordPress install you\u2019ve got shell access anyways so all bets are off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I am thinking through things like: can someone store something in the WordPress database that when I pull it out could do weird stuff on your local machine?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Definitely needs more thought though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"What is your plan for it?\">What is your plan for it?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not entirely sure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d like it to be a paid product of some sort, but there are a LOT of steps to get to that point (licensing, allowing trials, payments and eCommerce, support processes, documentation, legal stuff, tax stuff like VAT, marketing, to name but a few).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several people have asked if I will open source it? But I\u2019ve put a fair bit of time into this now and I consider it an \u201casset\u201d that I think has value and would like to make some money from if I can. And I hope it\u2019s a tool that will have value for others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Will this need to be GPL licensed?\">Will this need to be GPL licensed?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there\u2019s this thing about tools that integrate with WordPress needing to be GPL licensed. I think this is possible without making the source code public. And if I\u2019m to keep it as a paid product then this is what I will want to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Thoughts about extending WP-UI\">Thoughts about extending WP-UI<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where Caleb and Daniel\u2019s discussion application code vs framework code and the iterations of framework code got me thinking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of their conversation was about how, eventually, if you\u2019re writing a framework, it\u2019s good to be super-modular. They talk about how good frameworks seem to end up with \u201cloader\u201d files that contain a bunch of lines that just import functionality from discrete packages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would LOVE for WP-UI to be like this and, subsequently, extendable by others in this sort of way. This is how WP-CLI works. And I think Invoker will eventually have extensions that work like this too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is a REALLY interesting space. I\u2019m kinda chuffed that my brain has gone down the route of thinking like this. I feel like it\u2019s a pretty advanced thing to be thinking of this in abstract enough terms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>RIGHT NOW I\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m almost daily, when working on WP-UI, having to decide if I make a layer abstract or not. Whether to do something quickly so that I can deliver WP-UI into the hands of people, or whether to spend time on refactor to make things more abstract and extendable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, I have a couple of good abstractions as mentioned above:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>One for running PHP (though this could be better) &#8211; a JavaScript class\/object that I can pass some PHP code to and have that code executed in the context of the currently-configured WordPress project.<\/li><li>One for lists of WordPress posts (you basically pass it a set of WP_Query options and it builds the data table)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I think Post Lists will always be \u201cspecial\u201d because they\u2019re quite complex. But I feel like the other tables probably need to be abstracted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can see a world where an extension:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Defines a new \u201cPage\u201d in the app<\/li><li>Gives some PHP code to run that produces output matching a specific format<\/li><li>Specifies how that data output is converted into tables (by specifying column types, which columns are searchable and sortable, for example)<\/li><li>Specifies how rows in the data table map to other, \u201csingle-entry\u201d screens.<\/li><li>Somehow specifies \u201cactions\u201d for rows in the data table that can run PHP code to make stuff happen &#8211; this probably needs variables\/placeholders to be made available somehow.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These \u201cdo I abstract?\u201d questions are huge at this point, because I\u2019m accumulating technical debt. I\u2019m deciding to add work to the pile for myself if I want to make the abstraction later on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m tending towards thinking that I need to get a version 1 out that\u2019s less frameworky and extendable. I want people to be able to use this thing! So that\u2019s v1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then v2 will be a big refactor that makes it more frameworky. Build the internal APIs, define the data formats, then refactor all my internal pages to use those APIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my main App file should become a loader file that contains a bunch of lines that import the pages of the app from discrete packages! Win!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does this mean I\u2019m building a framework? This isn\u2019t what I set out to do!! But maybe I AM! Eeeek!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, something like this would allow you to do stuff like extend WP-UI to allow it to act as a desktop app for managing WooCommerce orders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonkers! (In a good way)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"A brief aside on datatables and UI libraries\">A brief aside on datatables and UI libraries<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While writing this I looked into some datatable libraries like <a href=\"https:\/\/datatables.net\/\">https:\/\/datatables.net\/<\/a> and I came across the <a href=\"https:\/\/vuetifyjs.com\/en\/\">Vuetify<\/a> design framework too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It got me wondering if it would be possible and beneficial to use something like this rather than crafting everything myself with Tailwind UI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the initial phase of this project it\u2019s been SUPER helpful for me to build things by myself with just Tailwind UI taking care of the layout and some styling. I\u2019ve learned a LOT of Vue along the way and really feel like a JavaScript application programmer (which I never thought I would say).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But maybe I\u2019ll eject out into a UI framework like this in future. It certainly seems like I\u2019ve re-invented the wheel a bit! In some cases this may be necessary, but in many I suspect it\u2019s not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"What else would you like it to do?\">What else would you like it to do?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a roadmap with a bunch of minor tweaks, and some bigger ideas. Eventually I\u2019d like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>To allow editing as well as just viewing of data<\/li><li>To handle serialised data nicely somehow<\/li><li>To be able to use with remote (live?!) sites over SSH<\/li><li>To allow actions to be taken, such as updating plugins, or expiring transients<\/li><li>There was also a cool idea that someone suggested where the application could show you the code that it runs. This would allow you to visually build a query or action in WP-UI by selecting the page, filters, pagination options, sorting, etc and then get the WP_Query or other PHP code to paste back into your theme\/plugin\/whatever.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So\u2026lots of ideas. But\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"How does this fit with the block editor and full site editing?\">How does this fit with the block editor and full site editing?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a really interesting question I\u2019ve asked myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block editing, full-site-editing and so on are (in my opinion) turning WordPress away from general content management and towards being a publishing platform that cares less for structure data. Data is being pushed into in-post HTML-comments rather than being made available in a structured way in WordPress\u2019s relational database.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And WP-UI is really a relational database explorer. Most of my use cases are exploring things like post meta and options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don\u2019t know if this tool even has a medium\/long term future given the direction of WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I march onwards anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s see where we get to. Follow along at <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wpui_app\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/wpui_app<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A website is coming soon!<\/p>\n",

I don&#8217;t have an answer &#8211; maybe you do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a WP multisite running in sub-DIRECTORIES. And it has a domain alias pointing at it. There are some redirection plugins installed but these turned out to be irrelevant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The domain alias was redirecting to the main domain BUT\u2026 it was stripping any path off. So:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>https:\/\/my-domain-alias.com\/some-path<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>was being redirected to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>https:\/\/my-domain.com\/<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which was annoying because I wanted the path so I could do further redirects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I experimented and eliminated the other redirection plugins as a cause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I added some stuff to <code>wp-config.php<\/code> to trap my requests. These WERE being triggered and so I eliminated the web server as a cause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I figured WordPress core was doing a redirect to the main domain without the URL.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/maybe_redirect_404\/\"><code>maybe_redirect_404<\/code><\/a> function that seems to do the redirect I&#8217;m describing and runs in multisite IF a <code>NOBLOGREDIRECT<\/code> constant is set. But this constant was NOT set.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then tried trapping the request in a must-use plugin, figuring that this was the earliest I could load anything custom, but this code wasn&#8217;t being hit!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this redirect was happening AFTER loading <code>wp-config.php<\/code> but before mu-plugins are loaded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really odd. I&#8217;ve added the hacky fix of redirecting from <code>wp-config.php<\/code> but I&#8217;m not very happy about doing so!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does anyone with WP Multisite internals knowlegde know what&#8217;s going on here?<\/p>\n",

And it has a domain alias pointing at it. There are some redirection plugins installed but these turned out to be irrelevant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The domain alias was redirecting to the main domain BUT\u2026 it was stripping any path off. So:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>https:\/\/my-domain-alias.com\/some-path<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>was being redirected to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>https:\/\/my-domain.com\/<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which was annoying because I wanted the path so I could do further redirects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I experimented and eliminated the other redirection plugins as a cause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I added some stuff to <code>wp-config.php<\/code> to trap my requests. These WERE being triggered and so I eliminated the web server as a cause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I figured WordPress core was doing a redirect to the main domain without the URL.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/maybe_redirect_404\/\"><code>maybe_redirect_404<\/code><\/a> function that seems to do the redirect I&#8217;m describing and runs in multisite IF a <code>NOBLOGREDIRECT<\/code> constant is set. But this constant was NOT set.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then tried trapping the request in a must-use plugin, figuring that this was the earliest I could load anything custom, but this code wasn&#8217;t being hit!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this redirect was happening AFTER loading <code>wp-config.php<\/code> but before mu-plugins are loaded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really odd. I&#8217;ve added the hacky fix of redirecting from <code>wp-config.php<\/code> but I&#8217;m not very happy about doing so!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does anyone with WP Multisite internals knowlegde know what&#8217;s going on here?<\/p>\n",

Which is odd. This MUST be configurable from somewhere, but I didn&#8217;t get to finding out where it was. <code>\/some\/homebrew\/path\/etc<\/code> would be the obvious place. And there is a file there, but it doesn&#8217;t have much config in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll have to dig in to this to find out yourself. I would assume MySQL has some default location it&#8217;s reading from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Starting and stopping MySQL\/MariaDB using homebrew<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Worth a quick note that you can start and stop homebrew-installed MySQL\/MariaDB as a service using:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>\/some\/homebrew\/path\/bin\/brew services start &lt;servicename><\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>\/some\/homebrew\/path\/bin\/brew services start mariadb@10.4<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What even IS DBngin?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DBngin is a free MacOS app that lets you install\/start\/stop different databases. I figured all this out while I was moving to a new Mac and so thought I&#8217;d give it a go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s limited in that it doesn&#8217;t include MariaDB yet. One of my big issues was &#8211; I think &#8211; incompatibilities between MariaDB and MySQL when reading data files.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where are DBngin MySQL binaries?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DBngin puts binaries in <code>\/Users\/Shared\/DBngin\/mysql\/&lt;version><\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where does DBngin put data files?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DBngin puts data files in <code>\/Users\/&lt;you>\/Library\/Application Support\/com.tinyapp.DBngin\/engines\/mysql\/&lt;some ID><\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I discovered while doing this migration that if there are not files called <code>auto.cnf<\/code> and <code>com.tinyapp.DBngin.mysqld-&lt;some ID>.plist<\/code> in this directory then the whole directory will be wiped clean when you use DBngin to start up the database.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you empty this directory and copy a bunch of existing data files into it then you&#8217;ll immediately have them all deleted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">That&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>is all I got!<\/p>\n",

Which is odd. This MUST be configurable from somewhere, but I didn&#8217;t get to finding out where it was. <code>\/some\/homebrew\/path\/etc<\/code> would be the obvious place. And there is a file there, but it doesn&#8217;t have much config in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll have to dig in to this to find out yourself. I would assume MySQL has some default location it&#8217;s reading from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Starting and stopping MySQL\/MariaDB using homebrew<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Worth a quick note that you can start and stop homebrew-installed MySQL\/MariaDB as a service using:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>\/some\/homebrew\/path\/bin\/brew services start &lt;servicename><\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>\/some\/homebrew\/path\/bin\/brew services start mariadb@10.4<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What even IS DBngin?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DBngin is a free MacOS app that lets you install\/start\/stop different databases. I figured all this out while I was moving to a new Mac and so thought I&#8217;d give it a go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s limited in that it doesn&#8217;t include MariaDB yet. One of my big issues was &#8211; I think &#8211; incompatibilities between MariaDB and MySQL when reading data files.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where are DBngin MySQL binaries?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DBngin puts binaries in <code>\/Users\/Shared\/DBngin\/mysql\/&lt;version><\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where does DBngin put data files?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DBngin puts data files in <code>\/Users\/&lt;you>\/Library\/Application Support\/com.tinyapp.DBngin\/engines\/mysql\/&lt;some ID><\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I discovered while doing this migration that if there are not files called <code>auto.cnf<\/code> and <code>com.tinyapp.DBngin.mysqld-&lt;some ID>.plist<\/code> in this directory then the whole directory will be wiped clean when you use DBngin to start up the database.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you empty this directory and copy a bunch of existing data files into it then you&#8217;ll immediately have them all deleted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">That&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>is all I got!<\/p>\n",

And it raises a whole weird load of questions about how Rosetta works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>yarn and npm both seem to work OK. But if I understand correctly, lib-sass was a compiled binary, and it refused to run with the usual webpack\/npm\/webpack barf, including:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nModule build failed: ModuleBuildError: Module build failed: Error: Node Sass does not yet support your current environment: OS X Unsupported architecture (arm64) with Unsupported runtime (88)\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>So why does everything else seem to run fine under Rosetta, but not this one thing?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, I eventually found a way to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>update <code>node-sass<\/code> to <code>dart-sass<\/code><\/li><li>update the <code>sass-loader<\/code> (v10 is too high &#8211; I get more barf and errors &#8211; v7.1 seems to work)<\/li><li>update the sass-loader config<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This then all runs under node 15, which I have compiled for ARM\/M1. And&#8230;YAY!!! I can successfully build the project I need to put live VERY SOON!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>20:18<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gosh I have a LOT of software!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is going pretty well considering. HOWEVER&#8230;  brew and node are pretty confusing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve basically got brew working, but it&#8217;s giving me this nudge to run it with Rosetta which I have no idea how to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have node v15 installed using <code>brew install -s node<\/code> (I had to run it a few times to get it to work)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can&#8217;t get the &#8216;<code>n<\/code>&#8216; node version manager to do anything &#8211; it&#8217;s installed but won&#8217;t list or install any versions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can&#8217;t get node@10 or node@12 to install with homebrew.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up &#8211; can I actually compile a project that uses node?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>16:28<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While pretty much every download-to-your-applicaitons folder app seems fine, the problems are on command-line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got Homebrew installed. And seem to have compiled my own version of PHP with <code>brew install -s php<\/code>, but I can&#8217;t get a build of nodeJs to compile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps there&#8217;s a better way than homebrew for this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>15:29<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be honest, this is going pretty well. I&#8217;ve not got some system utilities like Moom, Better Touch Tool, Bartender and the Harvest time tracking app installed. I&#8217;ve yet to set them up properly but they all seem to be working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have Sequel Ace for databases and Wavebox for managing some web apps &#8211; this is an Electron app and I thought there was issues with Electron. But seems it&#8217;s OK!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dashdocs, Tweetbot and iTerm are all doing fine now too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nice that MacOS now has zsh by default but there&#8217;s some dotfiles I&#8217;ll need to recover!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14:43<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a school run to do&#8230; back later!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14:17<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have Homebrew and am attempting a PHP 7.4 install. Not sure what&#8217;s gonna happen!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14:15<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tinkerwell and HELO installed. I have iTunes\/Music set up. I&#8217;ve attempted ClamXAV install but need to get a new license. Hmmm&#8230; Hurrying through now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:54<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weird &#8211; having installed the MacOS command-line tools, Firefox seems much happier! Perhaps extensions need some command line thing installed to work?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slack is installed and fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:10<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime I have an update from the Apple Service centre about my old MacBook &#8211; they can&#8217;t do anything. What diagnostics they can do are showing &#8211; surprise! &#8211; logic board failures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s back to Apple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:16<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to have to do some real work now. But just to add:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Homebrew not properly supported yet &#8211; it says to run it under Rosetta, but I don&#8217;t know how you do that from the command line! Work ongoing <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Homebrew\/brew\/issues\/7857\">here<\/a>. Another dev linked from that issue also has <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mikelxc\/Workarounds-for-ARM-mac\">a list of fixes and workarounds<\/a> for things.<\/li><li>PHP 7.3 in installed by default. I have composer running.<\/li><li>Git not installed by default? Having to download Apple&#8217;s command line utilities &#8211; this could take a while!<\/li><li>SourceTree is incoming&#8230;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Also &#8211; I will need to find a way to copy over, or recreate a LOT of configuration from my old machine. Not just dot files, but other stuff too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fun few days ahead!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:07<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not able to specifically point to anything wrong with Firefox extensions, but they generally seem broken. I turned them all off, and I could get a couple of them back on, but the Containers extension and React Dev tools seemed to just break Firefox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This needs sorting FAST!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12:54<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I&#8217;m gonna call it: Something in Firefox doesn&#8217;t work! It kinda opens tabs, but doesn&#8217;t load them. Incognito windows are fine. So it&#8217;s probably extension related.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blazing through app installs &#8211; I have a lot of stuff to install.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this my first Apple Silicon issue though? Wow! Not where I expected it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"368\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-1024x368.png\" alt=\"Operating system error sating &quot;Google Chrome quit unexpectedly&quot;\" class=\"wp-image-9658\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-1024x368.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-300x108.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-768x276.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25.png 1036w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>11:52<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weird that the 1Password APP wouldn&#8217;t take a physical security key. That was a test.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dropbox seems fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firefox and Chrome are incoming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No issues as yet. How do I know if apps are using Rosetta or are built for ARM?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:37<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, so far so good. I have 1Password (was a good test of my own security getting in on a new device!). I have Telegram and WhatsApp for chatting to some people. I have Alfred because I&#8217;m an option-space person, not a Cmd-space one! I&#8217;m downloading Dropbox&#8230;  argh! Is that going to work?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:23<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK &#8211; here I am in WordPress in Safari. First step: Get 1Password up and running so I can log in to stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Install from App Store was OK. But then it wouldn&#8217;t open. Eventually found a little window asking me to install Rosetta. Surprised 1Password isn&#8217;t a universal build yet! But it&#8217;s open and working!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No I\u2019m not \u201cunboxing\u201d it. You don\u2019t care about that. You want to know what software runs on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a dongle. You don\u2019t need a photo of that! ?<br><br>11:04<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/31318691-B160-46B0-BD72-11B2917399CA-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9647\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/31318691-B160-46B0-BD72-11B2917399CA-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/31318691-B160-46B0-BD72-11B2917399CA-300x225.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>11:00<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we are then. I have travelled to the stars (OK, to Cirencester) and I have forged new elements (OK, I have a new laptop with Apple Silicon)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big question is: can I get WordPress on my phone to upload photos?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9:10<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should say that this isn\u2019t some vain, impulse buy. It\u2019s well thought through. I\u2019ve been wanting to upgrade for about two years, but wanted a robust keyboard. That came along from Apple last year. And then Apple Silicon was announced and it\u2019s a call between a) how long before software stops working on Intel and b) how long before it starts working on M1?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I NEED to get a new laptop and I\u2019m trying to play the long game. If I want this machine to be running all my software in 5 or 6 years, the new chips seem to be the right choice. I hope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>8:40<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people have been warning me about compatibility of software and I do have concerns. But I\u2019ve researched and discussed this with people and let me say where I\u2019m at:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t do much\/any virtualisation. I don\u2019t use Docker &#8211; which I know doesn\u2019t work. What virtualisation I do is minimal and not mission-critical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looks like some software that integrates with the OS at low level like screen recorders and audio tools might struggle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There seem to have been concerns around Electron apps but I couldn\u2019t find anything concrete. It looks like Electron apps will build. But I\u2019m not sure what specific tools are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have concerns about Homebrew, PHP, composer, databases. But these are all Linux things right? Creating ARM binaries &#8211; if they don\u2019t already exist &#8211; should be OK?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well &#8211; that\u2019s what we\u2019re about to find out!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8:15 am: My late 2013 MacBook Pro has failed. Totally bricked. Others are reporting this failure too and a fix could be weeks away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m normally a risk-averse person. But for some stupid reason I\u2019ve decided to jump in on day 1 with an Apple Silicon M1 MacBook Air that I\u2019m collecting this morning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will I sink or swim? I know not everything will work on day 1. But will it be disastrous? Or just mildly annoying?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow along and see how it goes. If nothing else it might be an insight into the tools of this full-stack PHP\/WordPress\/Laravel developer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ll post updates here rather than Twitter. I guess you have to revisit occasionally to see what\u2019s going on!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Follow up &#8211; day 3!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, overall I&#8217;m pretty happy with the 8GB M1 Air. Outstanding issues I have are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>ScreenFlow and some Rogue Amoeba audio apps don&#8217;t work &#8211; I guess these are doing some clever low-level stuff.<\/li><li>I&#8217;m having issues importing my MySQL databases from backup. This is not really an M1 specific issue, apart from the fact that I can&#8217;t use homebrew to install anything other than the latest version of MariaDB.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some useful links that have helped me out along the way:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Homebrew\/brew\/issues\/7857\">Status of Homebrew on Apple Silicon<\/a><\/li><li>&#8220;Sam&#8221; has <a href=\"https:\/\/soffes.blog\/homebrew-on-apple-silicon\">a tip on running command line stuff using Rosetta<\/a><\/li><li>A clever person figured out that if you make a copy of terminal (or iTerm) and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.notion.so\/Run-x86-Apps-including-homebrew-in-the-Terminal-on-Apple-Silicon-8350b43d97de4ce690f283277e958602\">set it to &#8220;Run as Rosetta&#8221;<\/a> it seems to run any sub-commands using Rosetta too.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll have some write ups &#8211; or possibly unstructured brain dumps &#8211; on stuff I&#8217;ve learned along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>22:42<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside: yarn and npm are the one thing that I&#8217;ve noticed it REALLY FREAKING FAST on this machine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>22:32<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes &#8211; I&#8217;m still at it &#8211; in between other things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;d heard from a friend that lib-sass or node-sass &#8211; I don&#8217;t recall which &#8211; maybe both would fail to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s true. And it raises a whole weird load of questions about how Rosetta works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>yarn and npm both seem to work OK. But if I understand correctly, lib-sass was a compiled binary, and it refused to run with the usual webpack\/npm\/webpack barf, including:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nModule build failed: ModuleBuildError: Module build failed: Error: Node Sass does not yet support your current environment: OS X Unsupported architecture (arm64) with Unsupported runtime (88)\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>So why does everything else seem to run fine under Rosetta, but not this one thing?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, I eventually found a way to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>update <code>node-sass<\/code> to <code>dart-sass<\/code><\/li><li>update the <code>sass-loader<\/code> (v10 is too high &#8211; I get more barf and errors &#8211; v7.1 seems to work)<\/li><li>update the sass-loader config<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This then all runs under node 15, which I have compiled for ARM\/M1. And&#8230;YAY!!! I can successfully build the project I need to put live VERY SOON!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>20:18<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gosh I have a LOT of software!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is going pretty well considering. HOWEVER&#8230;  brew and node are pretty confusing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve basically got brew working, but it&#8217;s giving me this nudge to run it with Rosetta which I have no idea how to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have node v15 installed using <code>brew install -s node<\/code> (I had to run it a few times to get it to work)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can&#8217;t get the &#8216;<code>n<\/code>&#8216; node version manager to do anything &#8211; it&#8217;s installed but won&#8217;t list or install any versions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can&#8217;t get node@10 or node@12 to install with homebrew.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up &#8211; can I actually compile a project that uses node?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>16:28<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While pretty much every download-to-your-applicaitons folder app seems fine, the problems are on command-line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got Homebrew installed. And seem to have compiled my own version of PHP with <code>brew install -s php<\/code>, but I can&#8217;t get a build of nodeJs to compile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps there&#8217;s a better way than homebrew for this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>15:29<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be honest, this is going pretty well. I&#8217;ve not got some system utilities like Moom, Better Touch Tool, Bartender and the Harvest time tracking app installed. I&#8217;ve yet to set them up properly but they all seem to be working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have Sequel Ace for databases and Wavebox for managing some web apps &#8211; this is an Electron app and I thought there was issues with Electron. But seems it&#8217;s OK!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dashdocs, Tweetbot and iTerm are all doing fine now too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nice that MacOS now has zsh by default but there&#8217;s some dotfiles I&#8217;ll need to recover!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14:43<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a school run to do&#8230; back later!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14:17<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have Homebrew and am attempting a PHP 7.4 install. Not sure what&#8217;s gonna happen!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14:15<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tinkerwell and HELO installed. I have iTunes\/Music set up. I&#8217;ve attempted ClamXAV install but need to get a new license. Hmmm&#8230; Hurrying through now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:54<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weird &#8211; having installed the MacOS command-line tools, Firefox seems much happier! Perhaps extensions need some command line thing installed to work?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slack is installed and fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:10<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime I have an update from the Apple Service centre about my old MacBook &#8211; they can&#8217;t do anything. What diagnostics they can do are showing &#8211; surprise! &#8211; logic board failures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s back to Apple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:16<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to have to do some real work now. But just to add:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Homebrew not properly supported yet &#8211; it says to run it under Rosetta, but I don&#8217;t know how you do that from the command line! Work ongoing <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Homebrew\/brew\/issues\/7857\">here<\/a>. Another dev linked from that issue also has <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mikelxc\/Workarounds-for-ARM-mac\">a list of fixes and workarounds<\/a> for things.<\/li><li>PHP 7.3 in installed by default. I have composer running.<\/li><li>Git not installed by default? Having to download Apple&#8217;s command line utilities &#8211; this could take a while!<\/li><li>SourceTree is incoming&#8230;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Also &#8211; I will need to find a way to copy over, or recreate a LOT of configuration from my old machine. Not just dot files, but other stuff too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fun few days ahead!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:07<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not able to specifically point to anything wrong with Firefox extensions, but they generally seem broken. I turned them all off, and I could get a couple of them back on, but the Containers extension and React Dev tools seemed to just break Firefox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This needs sorting FAST!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12:54<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I&#8217;m gonna call it: Something in Firefox doesn&#8217;t work! It kinda opens tabs, but doesn&#8217;t load them. Incognito windows are fine. So it&#8217;s probably extension related.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blazing through app installs &#8211; I have a lot of stuff to install.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this my first Apple Silicon issue though? Wow! Not where I expected it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"368\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-1024x368.png\" alt=\"Operating system error sating &quot;Google Chrome quit unexpectedly&quot;\" class=\"wp-image-9658\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-1024x368.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-300x108.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-768x276.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25.png 1036w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>11:52<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weird that the 1Password APP wouldn&#8217;t take a physical security key. That was a test.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dropbox seems fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firefox and Chrome are incoming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No issues as yet. How do I know if apps are using Rosetta or are built for ARM?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:37<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, so far so good. I have 1Password (was a good test of my own security getting in on a new device!). I have Telegram and WhatsApp for chatting to some people. I have Alfred because I&#8217;m an option-space person, not a Cmd-space one! I&#8217;m downloading Dropbox&#8230;  argh! Is that going to work?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:23<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK &#8211; here I am in WordPress in Safari. First step: Get 1Password up and running so I can log in to stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Install from App Store was OK. But then it wouldn&#8217;t open. Eventually found a little window asking me to install Rosetta. Surprised 1Password isn&#8217;t a universal build yet! But it&#8217;s open and working!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No I\u2019m not \u201cunboxing\u201d it. You don\u2019t care about that. You want to know what software runs on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a dongle. You don\u2019t need a photo of that! ?<br><br>11:04<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/31318691-B160-46B0-BD72-11B2917399CA-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9647\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/31318691-B160-46B0-BD72-11B2917399CA-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/31318691-B160-46B0-BD72-11B2917399CA-300x225.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>11:00<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we are then. I have travelled to the stars (OK, to Cirencester) and I have forged new elements (OK, I have a new laptop with Apple Silicon)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big question is: can I get WordPress on my phone to upload photos?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9:10<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should say that this isn\u2019t some vain, impulse buy. It\u2019s well thought through. I\u2019ve been wanting to upgrade for about two years, but wanted a robust keyboard. That came along from Apple last year. And then Apple Silicon was announced and it\u2019s a call between a) how long before software stops working on Intel and b) how long before it starts working on M1?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I NEED to get a new laptop and I\u2019m trying to play the long game. If I want this machine to be running all my software in 5 or 6 years, the new chips seem to be the right choice. I hope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>8:40<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people have been warning me about compatibility of software and I do have concerns. But I\u2019ve researched and discussed this with people and let me say where I\u2019m at:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t do much\/any virtualisation. I don\u2019t use Docker &#8211; which I know doesn\u2019t work. What virtualisation I do is minimal and not mission-critical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looks like some software that integrates with the OS at low level like screen recorders and audio tools might struggle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There seem to have been concerns around Electron apps but I couldn\u2019t find anything concrete. It looks like Electron apps will build. But I\u2019m not sure what specific tools are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have concerns about Homebrew, PHP, composer, databases. But these are all Linux things right? Creating ARM binaries &#8211; if they don\u2019t already exist &#8211; should be OK?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well &#8211; that\u2019s what we\u2019re about to find out!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8:15 am: My late 2013 MacBook Pro has failed. Totally bricked. Others are reporting this failure too and a fix could be weeks away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m normally a risk-averse person. But for some stupid reason I\u2019ve decided to jump in on day 1 with an Apple Silicon M1 MacBook Air that I\u2019m collecting this morning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will I sink or swim? I know not everything will work on day 1. But will it be disastrous? Or just mildly annoying?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow along and see how it goes. If nothing else it might be an insight into the tools of this full-stack PHP\/WordPress\/Laravel developer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ll post updates here rather than Twitter. I guess you have to revisit occasionally to see what\u2019s going on!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

            },
            "content": {
                "rendered": "\n<p>I have a confession: despite being a WordPress developer since 2010, I&#8217;ve rarely used WooCommerce! Where I have I&#8217;ve only done the very basics. And now I&#8217;m knee deep in a custom WooCommerce project with a lot to figure out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating custom fields on the checkout was a particular area of confusion. Here&#8217;s what I needed:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A bunch of custom fields&#8230;<\/li><li>with conditional logic (i.e. some fields are only sometimes visible depending on values of other fields)&#8230;<\/li><li>that save in the order (and get displayed in the back-end order screen, and, potentially, in emails)&#8230;<\/li><li>and that can be passed to MailChimp &#8211; again, conditionally, based on the values of some fields.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The logic is something like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Ask if a user is over 18.<\/li><li>If they are collect their year of birth and send it to MailChimp as part of the ordering process.<\/li><li>If they aren&#8217;t collect their date of birth, and only let them order if they are over 13, and send the date of birth to MailChimp as part of the ordering process.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially I was thinking that I could do this with some custom fields plugin maybe? But I consulted with some expert friends and they encouraged me to code this myself. Which, for this application with two interacting integrations (custom fields and MailChimp) and the conditional logic and stuff was probably a good idea. Bullying off-the-shelf plugins into doing this was never going to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that WooCommerce has <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.woocommerce.com\/document\/tutorial-customising-checkout-fields-using-actions-and-filters\/\">a pretty good guide<\/a> to doing most of this. And they have REALLY EXTENSIVE <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.woocommerce.com\/document\/introduction-to-hooks-actions-and-filters\/\">action and filter hooks<\/a> &#8211; so much so that it&#8217;s hard to know what you should be hooking into.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was one thing that tripped me up along the way though. I was trying to write some JavaScript to work on some markup that was added with the <code>woocommerce_checkout_before_terms_and_conditions<\/code> hook, just above the button to make the purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any event handlers added to input in this area were inactive. It was like WooCommerce was removing them or intercepting them somehow, and despite <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/woocommerce\/woocommerce\/blob\/4dd42309315b8938beb47b3e877d0ae8dc56db83\/assets\/js\/frontend\/checkout.js#L247\">source-diving<\/a> a little I&#8217;ve still not quite figured out what it was doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that every time the cart updates via AJAX on the checkout page, the HTML elements are re-created. And there is an update when the page first loads. So any event handlers I added during page initialisation were immediately overridden or remvoed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution was to add my event handlers when the <code>updated_checkout<\/code> event fired in JavaScript. This ensured that after the checkout update, my handlers were added to the elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phew!<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Custom WooCommerce Checkout Fields",
        "content": "\n<p>I have a confession: despite being a WordPress developer since 2010, I&#8217;ve rarely used WooCommerce! Where I have I&#8217;ve only done the very basics. And now I&#8217;m knee deep in a custom WooCommerce project with a lot to figure out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating custom fields on the checkout was a particular area of confusion. Here&#8217;s what I needed:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A bunch of custom fields&#8230;<\/li><li>with conditional logic (i.e. some fields are only sometimes visible depending on values of other fields)&#8230;<\/li><li>that save in the order (and get displayed in the back-end order screen, and, potentially, in emails)&#8230;<\/li><li>and that can be passed to MailChimp &#8211; again, conditionally, based on the values of some fields.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The logic is something like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Ask if a user is over 18.<\/li><li>If they are collect their year of birth and send it to MailChimp as part of the ordering process.<\/li><li>If they aren&#8217;t collect their date of birth, and only let them order if they are over 13, and send the date of birth to MailChimp as part of the ordering process.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially I was thinking that I could do this with some custom fields plugin maybe? But I consulted with some expert friends and they encouraged me to code this myself. Which, for this application with two interacting integrations (custom fields and MailChimp) and the conditional logic and stuff was probably a good idea. Bullying off-the-shelf plugins into doing this was never going to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that WooCommerce has <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.woocommerce.com\/document\/tutorial-customising-checkout-fields-using-actions-and-filters\/\">a pretty good guide<\/a> to doing most of this. And they have REALLY EXTENSIVE <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.woocommerce.com\/document\/introduction-to-hooks-actions-and-filters\/\">action and filter hooks<\/a> &#8211; so much so that it&#8217;s hard to know what you should be hooking into.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was one thing that tripped me up along the way though. I was trying to write some JavaScript to work on some markup that was added with the <code>woocommerce_checkout_before_terms_and_conditions<\/code> hook, just above the button to make the purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any event handlers added to input in this area were inactive. It was like WooCommerce was removing them or intercepting them somehow, and despite <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/woocommerce\/woocommerce\/blob\/4dd42309315b8938beb47b3e877d0ae8dc56db83\/assets\/js\/frontend\/checkout.js#L247\">source-diving<\/a> a little I&#8217;ve still not quite figured out what it was doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that every time the cart updates via AJAX on the checkout page, the HTML elements are re-created. And there is an update when the page first loads. So any event handlers I added during page initialisation were immediately overridden or remvoed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution was to add my event handlers when the <code>updated_checkout<\/code> event fired in JavaScript. This ensured that after the checkout update, my handlers were added to the elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phew!<\/p>\n",

That&#8217;s really NOT my intention. I&#8217;ve tried to say that I think Laravel and Jetstream are amazing things and Taylor has my utmost respect and thanks. My comments are meant to be entirely constructive. And I&#8217;ve presented small, concrete things that I think could improve first-time experience with Jetstream for some audiences.<\/li><li>I come at this from the point of view of someone who&#8217;s far from a Laravel expert &#8211; I&#8217;m really still learning. But that&#8217;s part of my point: for someone in my position, Jetstream feels a bit inaccessible.<\/li><li>Taylor Otwell (the creator of Laravel) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=krn39HjxPTs\">has clarified<\/a> that he made Jetstream as the kind of thing that HE would use. So in some ways, any critique of it from a less-experienced Laravel developer&#8217;s perspective (which is what this article presents) isn&#8217;t valid. Is it fair to say that it seems this is not a tool intended for beginners with the framework?<\/li><li>However, I feel that with a few small changes and some additions to the documentation, it could be made more accessible for beginners and this would be a good thing for everyone.<\/li><li>Yes, I should have read more of the docs before diving in. But Jetstream seems too inviting, I dived in headfirst and so got stuck. That&#8217;s a lesson for me. <\/li><li>It&#8217;s because I think Laravel and Jetstream are awesome that I&#8217;d love them to be more accessible to more developers. Jetstream is actually a really good example of a set of components and classes at work, and it could serve as some easily explorable code demonstrating good practices. Auth scaffolding is like the &#8220;Hello world&#8221; of Laravel and I&#8217;d love for it to be as easy for the first time Laravel dev to explore as it is for the experienced one.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel 8 is out today, along with the amazing new &#8220;Jetstream&#8221; authentication scaffolding that has been built.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve just worked through doing a quick install and had a poke around and it is incredible what you get out of the box now. But also, I have two issues with it. This isn&#8217;t really a rant, I do love it. Just observations and possible things that could be thought about for the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. The barrier to entry is too high now<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you install Laravel + Jetstream (the Livewire version), you are now faced with this as your welcome template:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;x-app-layout&gt;\n    &lt;x-slot name=&quot;header&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;h2 class=&quot;font-semibold text-xl text-gray-800 leading-tight&quot;&gt;\n            Dashboard\n        &lt;\/h2&gt;\n    &lt;\/x-slot&gt;\n\n    &lt;div class=&quot;py-12&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;max-w-7xl mx-auto sm:px-6 lg:px-8&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;bg-white overflow-hidden shadow-xl sm:rounded-lg&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;x-jet-welcome \/&gt;\n            &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/x-app-layout&gt;\n\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>My first question was &#8220;How can I customise the welcome component? That <code>&lt;x-jet-welcome \/&gt;<\/code> bit?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I spent half an hour tracking down the <code>JetstreamServiceProvider.php<\/code> which registers all the components using this method:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nprotected function registerComponent(string $component)\n    {\n        Blade::component('jetstream::components.'.$component, 'jet-'.$component);\n    }\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And what&#8217;s super-annoying about this is that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>a) Because the <code>registerComponent()<\/code> method dynamically prefixes the component name with <code>'jet-<\/code>&#8216;, you can&#8217;t search the code for the full component name and find where it&#8217;s registered<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>b) Even if you could, it wouldn&#8217;t help very much finding the component template, but it would at least leave you able to search for the component name and find something!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So anyone without a pretty good grasp of Blade components and how to dive around in the vendor directory to find stuff, is going to be a bit stuck!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless they notice that you can publish the components (if you know what that means), which you need to do to modify them. Sure, you can find out about publishing the components by reading <a href=\"https:\/\/jetstream.laravel.com\/1.x\/installation.html#livewire-components\">the Jetstream docs<\/a>. But I was keen to dive in and thought it would be easy to see how to edit what is effectively the &#8220;Hello world&#8221; page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like if I came from basic PHP, or some other eco system into Laravel now, I&#8217;d get stuck pretty quickly. There&#8217;s a LOT of implied knowledge needed to get started: Tailwind; Blade Components; Livewire\/Inertia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That barrier to entry just got a whole heap higher!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. There&#8217;s too much out of the box<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>[Note: Taylor took note of people&#8217;s feedback on this and has disabled the API and profile photos by default as of <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/laravel\/jetstream\/releases\/tag\/v1.3.2\">version 1.3.2<\/a>!]<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E8pZvl6L5N4\">a live-streamed chat<\/a> with some WordPress friends today about the benefits of looking into Laravel if you&#8217;re a WordPress developer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one thing I said was that so often with WordPress core and many plugins, I find myself with too much stuff and wanting to turn some of it off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really think that the out-of-the box Laravel Jetstream setup has too much turned on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>API tokens<\/li><li>Profile photos<\/li><li>2FA<\/li><li>Account deleting<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I LOVE that I could turn these on with a single-line-of-code change, but, perhaps with the exception of 2FA, should these really all be on by default? I&#8217;m really not sure they should, and my first step on many projects will be to turn some of these features off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is easy enough to do: the <code>config\/jetstream.php<\/code> file has a features array that allows you to turn off profile pictures and the API bits:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n    'features' =&gt; &#x5B;\n        Features::profilePhotos(),\n        Features::api(),\n        \/\/ Features::teams(),\n    ],\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p> But I still think they should be off by default!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">In summary<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a slightly-experienced Laravel developer, this is all really exciting stuff, if a little enigmatic in places &#8211; how DOES this stuff work!?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as someone who wants to introduce people to Laravel as a way to build cool stuff, I really feel like there are some issues here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But who am I to say? Kudos to Taylor and the team for an awesome release.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m off to build something!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>UPDATE &#8211; 6\/10\/2020<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article was written before the Jetstream Drama over the weekend and it&#8217;s worth clarifying a few things, and saying what I&#8217;ve learned from the drama.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>I really hope I didn&#8217;t contribute any hate. That&#8217;s really NOT my intention. I&#8217;ve tried to say that I think Laravel and Jetstream are amazing things and Taylor has my utmost respect and thanks. My comments are meant to be entirely constructive. And I&#8217;ve presented small, concrete things that I think could improve first-time experience with Jetstream for some audiences.<\/li><li>I come at this from the point of view of someone who&#8217;s far from a Laravel expert &#8211; I&#8217;m really still learning. But that&#8217;s part of my point: for someone in my position, Jetstream feels a bit inaccessible.<\/li><li>Taylor Otwell (the creator of Laravel) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=krn39HjxPTs\">has clarified<\/a> that he made Jetstream as the kind of thing that HE would use. So in some ways, any critique of it from a less-experienced Laravel developer&#8217;s perspective (which is what this article presents) isn&#8217;t valid. Is it fair to say that it seems this is not a tool intended for beginners with the framework?<\/li><li>However, I feel that with a few small changes and some additions to the documentation, it could be made more accessible for beginners and this would be a good thing for everyone.<\/li><li>Yes, I should have read more of the docs before diving in. But Jetstream seems too inviting, I dived in headfirst and so got stuck. That&#8217;s a lesson for me. <\/li><li>It&#8217;s because I think Laravel and Jetstream are awesome that I&#8217;d love them to be more accessible to more developers. Jetstream is actually a really good example of a set of components and classes at work, and it could serve as some easily explorable code demonstrating good practices. Auth scaffolding is like the &#8220;Hello world&#8221; of Laravel and I&#8217;d love for it to be as easy for the first time Laravel dev to explore as it is for the experienced one.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel 8 is out today, along with the amazing new &#8220;Jetstream&#8221; authentication scaffolding that has been built.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve just worked through doing a quick install and had a poke around and it is incredible what you get out of the box now. But also, I have two issues with it. This isn&#8217;t really a rant, I do love it. Just observations and possible things that could be thought about for the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. The barrier to entry is too high now<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you install Laravel + Jetstream (the Livewire version), you are now faced with this as your welcome template:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;x-app-layout&gt;\n    &lt;x-slot name=&quot;header&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;h2 class=&quot;font-semibold text-xl text-gray-800 leading-tight&quot;&gt;\n            Dashboard\n        &lt;\/h2&gt;\n    &lt;\/x-slot&gt;\n\n    &lt;div class=&quot;py-12&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;max-w-7xl mx-auto sm:px-6 lg:px-8&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;bg-white overflow-hidden shadow-xl sm:rounded-lg&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;x-jet-welcome \/&gt;\n            &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/x-app-layout&gt;\n\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>My first question was &#8220;How can I customise the welcome component? That <code>&lt;x-jet-welcome \/&gt;<\/code> bit?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I spent half an hour tracking down the <code>JetstreamServiceProvider.php<\/code> which registers all the components using this method:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nprotected function registerComponent(string $component)\n    {\n        Blade::component('jetstream::components.'.$component, 'jet-'.$component);\n    }\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And what&#8217;s super-annoying about this is that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>a) Because the <code>registerComponent()<\/code> method dynamically prefixes the component name with <code>'jet-<\/code>&#8216;, you can&#8217;t search the code for the full component name and find where it&#8217;s registered<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>b) Even if you could, it wouldn&#8217;t help very much finding the component template, but it would at least leave you able to search for the component name and find something!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So anyone without a pretty good grasp of Blade components and how to dive around in the vendor directory to find stuff, is going to be a bit stuck!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless they notice that you can publish the components (if you know what that means), which you need to do to modify them. Sure, you can find out about publishing the components by reading <a href=\"https:\/\/jetstream.laravel.com\/1.x\/installation.html#livewire-components\">the Jetstream docs<\/a>. But I was keen to dive in and thought it would be easy to see how to edit what is effectively the &#8220;Hello world&#8221; page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like if I came from basic PHP, or some other eco system into Laravel now, I&#8217;d get stuck pretty quickly. There&#8217;s a LOT of implied knowledge needed to get started: Tailwind; Blade Components; Livewire\/Inertia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That barrier to entry just got a whole heap higher!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. There&#8217;s too much out of the box<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>[Note: Taylor took note of people&#8217;s feedback on this and has disabled the API and profile photos by default as of <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/laravel\/jetstream\/releases\/tag\/v1.3.2\">version 1.3.2<\/a>!]<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E8pZvl6L5N4\">a live-streamed chat<\/a> with some WordPress friends today about the benefits of looking into Laravel if you&#8217;re a WordPress developer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one thing I said was that so often with WordPress core and many plugins, I find myself with too much stuff and wanting to turn some of it off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really think that the out-of-the box Laravel Jetstream setup has too much turned on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>API tokens<\/li><li>Profile photos<\/li><li>2FA<\/li><li>Account deleting<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I LOVE that I could turn these on with a single-line-of-code change, but, perhaps with the exception of 2FA, should these really all be on by default? I&#8217;m really not sure they should, and my first step on many projects will be to turn some of these features off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is easy enough to do: the <code>config\/jetstream.php<\/code> file has a features array that allows you to turn off profile pictures and the API bits:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n    'features' =&gt; &#x5B;\n        Features::profilePhotos(),\n        Features::api(),\n        \/\/ Features::teams(),\n    ],\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p> But I still think they should be off by default!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">In summary<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a slightly-experienced Laravel developer, this is all really exciting stuff, if a little enigmatic in places &#8211; how DOES this stuff work!?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as someone who wants to introduce people to Laravel as a way to build cool stuff, I really feel like there are some issues here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But who am I to say? Kudos to Taylor and the team for an awesome release.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m off to build something!<\/p>\n",
