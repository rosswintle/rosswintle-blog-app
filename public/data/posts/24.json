It\u2019s pretty simple as I see it:<\/p>\n<p>1) There are bad (narrow) integrated cycle lanes. These are generally too narrow as to be dangerous (the car thinks that everything that\u2019s not the cycle lane is theirs).<br \/>\n2) There are integrated cycle lanes in silly places that cars are allowed to park in (wishing I had photos of Uxbridge Road in Shepherds Bush, London, to demonstrate this)<br \/>\n3) There are good integrated cycle lanes<br \/>\n4) There are (at least) two types of cyclist.<br \/>\na) those that can usefully and safely use segregated cycle lanes\/shared pedestrain paths &#8211; usually people who want to easily and safely get from A to B, or families on outings<br \/>\nb) those serious MTB\u2019ers or road bike riders who aren\u2019t going anywhere, but who want to ride fast and hard &#8211; it\u2019s usually not appropriate for these people (I include myself among them) to be on a segregated lane with other, slower, cyclists.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore:<br \/>\n&#8211; Integrated cycle lanes are good if they\u2019re well designed, which is not always the case; badly designed cycle lanes do treat cyclists badly.<br \/>\n&#8211; Segregated cycle lanes are good, but not for everyone<br \/>\n&#8211; Cyclists should be allowed to use or not use special cycle lanes as they see fit. If they choose not to use them it\u2019s at the risk of the cyclist.<\/p>\n<p>Is any of that debatable?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The response from the blog author goes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Looking at much of the provision we have, I\u2019d say no: local authorities <em>generally<\/em> go for option 1.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>To which I think:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Hah!  Agreed.  <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http:\/\/karlmccracken.sweat365.com\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\"-)\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Many cycle lanes are token gestures to cyclists rather than being of any real benefit. My home town (Swindon) has some good segregated lanes shared with pedestrians, which I use on my daily commute, and some good shared bus lanes that let cyclists take some nice quiet shortcuts. But the on-road stuff may as well not be there.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe I\u2019ll try and get some photos &#8211; once the snow has gone and we can see the lines again.<\/p>\n<p>The debate, in my opinion, needs to be how we get from a state where cycling is for the minority and therefore funding is low, to a state where cycling is popular, and funding increases\u2026<\/p>\n<p>or possibly:<\/p>\n<p>from a state where funding is low and so cycling is for the minority, to a state where funding increases, raising popularity.<\/p>\n<p>Chicken?  Egg?<\/p>\n<p>Hmm\u2026<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There&#8217;s also some interesting <a title=\"cycle-related Bad Science\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/Kco1\">cycle-related &#8220;Bad Science&#8221;<\/a> in the Guardian today.<\/p>\n<p>As for me, I&#8217;ve not been on the bike this week due to the snow&#8230;but that&#8217;s a whole other story.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;m part way through writing a post about my thoughts on taking up cycle campaigning (whatever that might be), but some things have come up today that I want to note more immediately.<\/p>\n<p>First off, <a title=\"link to post\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1UKMeN\">here&#8217;s a post<\/a> from a guy I&#8217;ve recently come across, which:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>contains some great cycling photos!<\/li>\n<li>poses an interesting question about cycle lanes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;ve commented with some of my own thoughts, copied here for reference:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Are dedicated bike lanes protecting you from cagers or treating cyclists as 2nd class road users?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t really get why people debate this.  It\u2019s pretty simple as I see it:<\/p>\n<p>1) There are bad (narrow) integrated cycle lanes. These are generally too narrow as to be dangerous (the car thinks that everything that\u2019s not the cycle lane is theirs).<br \/>\n2) There are integrated cycle lanes in silly places that cars are allowed to park in (wishing I had photos of Uxbridge Road in Shepherds Bush, London, to demonstrate this)<br \/>\n3) There are good integrated cycle lanes<br \/>\n4) There are (at least) two types of cyclist.<br \/>\na) those that can usefully and safely use segregated cycle lanes\/shared pedestrain paths &#8211; usually people who want to easily and safely get from A to B, or families on outings<br \/>\nb) those serious MTB\u2019ers or road bike riders who aren\u2019t going anywhere, but who want to ride fast and hard &#8211; it\u2019s usually not appropriate for these people (I include myself among them) to be on a segregated lane with other, slower, cyclists.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore:<br \/>\n&#8211; Integrated cycle lanes are good if they\u2019re well designed, which is not always the case; badly designed cycle lanes do treat cyclists badly.<br \/>\n&#8211; Segregated cycle lanes are good, but not for everyone<br \/>\n&#8211; Cyclists should be allowed to use or not use special cycle lanes as they see fit. If they choose not to use them it\u2019s at the risk of the cyclist.<\/p>\n<p>Is any of that debatable?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The response from the blog author goes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Looking at much of the provision we have, I\u2019d say no: local authorities <em>generally<\/em> go for option 1.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>To which I think:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Hah!  Agreed.  <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http:\/\/karlmccracken.sweat365.com\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\"-)\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Many cycle lanes are token gestures to cyclists rather than being of any real benefit. My home town (Swindon) has some good segregated lanes shared with pedestrians, which I use on my daily commute, and some good shared bus lanes that let cyclists take some nice quiet shortcuts. But the on-road stuff may as well not be there.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe I\u2019ll try and get some photos &#8211; once the snow has gone and we can see the lines again.<\/p>\n<p>The debate, in my opinion, needs to be how we get from a state where cycling is for the minority and therefore funding is low, to a state where cycling is popular, and funding increases\u2026<\/p>\n<p>or possibly:<\/p>\n<p>from a state where funding is low and so cycling is for the minority, to a state where funding increases, raising popularity.<\/p>\n<p>Chicken?  Egg?<\/p>\n<p>Hmm\u2026<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There&#8217;s also some interesting <a title=\"cycle-related Bad Science\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/Kco1\">cycle-related &#8220;Bad Science&#8221;<\/a> in the Guardian today.<\/p>\n<p>As for me, I&#8217;ve not been on the bike this week due to the snow&#8230;but that&#8217;s a whole other story.<\/p>\n",

How very generous of her!  It has been an interesting thing to be signed up to and I may well write more about it at a later date.<\/p>\n<h3>The activities of an old friend<\/h3>\n<p>An old friend of mine from Bath, who I&#8217;ve reconnected with through some fancy social web malarkey, is as much, if not more, of an avid cyclist as I am.  It&#8217;s been great chatting to him, sharing experiences of commuting in all weathers, following his recommended reading on the subject (lots of links to <a title=\"Link to copenhagenize.com\" href=\"http:\/\/www.copenhagenize.com\/\">Copenhagenize<\/a> and <a title=\"Link to Amsterdamize.com\" href=\"http:\/\/amsterdamize.com\/\">Amsterdamize<\/a>) and, more recently, finding out about his participation in some cycle campaigning.\u00a0 He&#8217;s gotten involved with the <a title=\"Link to Bath Cycling Campaign\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bathcyclingcampaign.org.uk\/\">Bath Cycling Campaign<\/a> and has recently been making some noise about removal of &#8220;the ramp&#8221; (and, I might add, moving of the cycle park) at Bath Spa station.<\/p>\n<p>He&#8217;s generally helped along my own thinking about cycle campaigning and encouraged me to get involved.<\/p>\n<h2>Do what??<\/h2>\n<p>That&#8217;s really the first question.\u00a0 What is cycle campaigning about?\u00a0 What are cycle campaigners trying to change.<\/p>\n<p>My own take on this would be that some cyclists are trying to do the following things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>get other people to realise the benefits of cycling;<\/li>\n<li>encourage investment in cycling infrastructure (bike parking, paths, priority schemes, and other safety features);<\/li>\n<li>make cycling safer;<\/li>\n<li>have the government recognise the benefits of cycling to the community and the economy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There may be more.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, as a keen cyclist and cycle commuter who lives in a small town where most people drive cars on short journeys, I&#8217;m definitely up for all of this.\u00a0 Heck, I&#8217;m even a <a title=\"link to previous post about being a cycle evangelist\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/11\/07\/eek-im-an-evangelist\/\">self-confessed cycle-evangelist<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h2>Getting Started<\/h2>\n<p>But how do I get involved in this sort of thing?\u00a0 What is there to do? How can I make a difference?<\/p>\n<p>Well, of course, there&#8217;s my own personal sharing about my own cycling and how quick it is, how it&#8217;s good for my health, how it&#8217;s often better than using the car for getting around, and how enjoyable it is.\u00a0 That&#8217;s easy and ongoing.<\/p>\n<p>But what can I do to get the government and local authorities to do more to promote cycling?\u00a0 I&#8217;d love for Swindon to become like some of the European towns where up to 80% of people keep cycling even through the winter.\u00a0 Or even like Oxford or Cambridge, where cycling is so popular.\u00a0 I would have loved it if, this week, with all the snow and ice that we&#8217;ve had, cycle lanes could have seen a bit of grit and been made safe for me to cycle to work &#8211; just like they do <a href=\"http:\/\/hembrow.blogspot.com\/2009\/01\/priorities-when-it-snows.html\">in the Netherlands where priorities are different<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Barriers<\/h2>\n<p>But how do you start getting momentum on moving towards towns like these?\u00a0 Do you start by getting more people cycling and hope that the authorities recognise this and make the facilities better?\u00a0 Or do you convince the authorities to make the facilities better and hope that this will encourage people to cycle more?\u00a0 (This was pretty much what I said yesterday).<\/p>\n<p>I suspect a bit of both is necessary.\u00a0 But it&#8217;s chicken and egg.<\/p>\n<p>And it raises some difficult questions.\u00a0 How do you convince a cash-strapped council to improve facilities that are currently only used by a minority in the hope that more people will in the long term start using them?\u00a0 When the priority for the town has to be roads because they&#8217;re the main way into, out of, and around the town &#8211; they&#8217;re the paths of commerce and industry.\u00a0 And when our culture is one where people need to travel great distances to work, shop, and visit friends and family.<\/p>\n<p>Things like the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swindoncyclechallenge.org.uk\/\">Swindon Cycle Challenge<\/a> help and I&#8217;ve emailed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ctc.org.uk\/desktopdefault.aspx?tabid=4916\">our town&#8217;s CTC cycle champion<\/a> (though, disappointingly, with no response as yet).\u00a0 Perhaps there are opportunities with doing cycle training, to help people have confidence on the roads, or to bring up the next generation with the idea that cycling is a good thing.\u00a0 And maybe writing to the local MP or to the council will help.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all a bit unknown and it&#8217;s hard to see how little old me can make a difference.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully being a CTC member will help and there will be ideas in their magazines and lots of encouragement and support from others with similar hopes.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I&#8217;ll be writing more about this if, as and when I get involved.\u00a0 Perhaps in a few years time I&#8217;ll be writing about the successes and joys of sharing the many, well-maintained cycle lanes with more Swindoners.<\/p>\n",

How very generous of her!  It has been an interesting thing to be signed up to and I may well write more about it at a later date.<\/p>\n<h3>The activities of an old friend<\/h3>\n<p>An old friend of mine from Bath, who I&#8217;ve reconnected with through some fancy social web malarkey, is as much, if not more, of an avid cyclist as I am.  It&#8217;s been great chatting to him, sharing experiences of commuting in all weathers, following his recommended reading on the subject (lots of links to <a title=\"Link to copenhagenize.com\" href=\"http:\/\/www.copenhagenize.com\/\">Copenhagenize<\/a> and <a title=\"Link to Amsterdamize.com\" href=\"http:\/\/amsterdamize.com\/\">Amsterdamize<\/a>) and, more recently, finding out about his participation in some cycle campaigning.\u00a0 He&#8217;s gotten involved with the <a title=\"Link to Bath Cycling Campaign\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bathcyclingcampaign.org.uk\/\">Bath Cycling Campaign<\/a> and has recently been making some noise about removal of &#8220;the ramp&#8221; (and, I might add, moving of the cycle park) at Bath Spa station.<\/p>\n<p>He&#8217;s generally helped along my own thinking about cycle campaigning and encouraged me to get involved.<\/p>\n<h2>Do what??<\/h2>\n<p>That&#8217;s really the first question.\u00a0 What is cycle campaigning about?\u00a0 What are cycle campaigners trying to change.<\/p>\n<p>My own take on this would be that some cyclists are trying to do the following things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>get other people to realise the benefits of cycling;<\/li>\n<li>encourage investment in cycling infrastructure (bike parking, paths, priority schemes, and other safety features);<\/li>\n<li>make cycling safer;<\/li>\n<li>have the government recognise the benefits of cycling to the community and the economy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There may be more.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, as a keen cyclist and cycle commuter who lives in a small town where most people drive cars on short journeys, I&#8217;m definitely up for all of this.\u00a0 Heck, I&#8217;m even a <a title=\"link to previous post about being a cycle evangelist\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/11\/07\/eek-im-an-evangelist\/\">self-confessed cycle-evangelist<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h2>Getting Started<\/h2>\n<p>But how do I get involved in this sort of thing?\u00a0 What is there to do? How can I make a difference?<\/p>\n<p>Well, of course, there&#8217;s my own personal sharing about my own cycling and how quick it is, how it&#8217;s good for my health, how it&#8217;s often better than using the car for getting around, and how enjoyable it is.\u00a0 That&#8217;s easy and ongoing.<\/p>\n<p>But what can I do to get the government and local authorities to do more to promote cycling?\u00a0 I&#8217;d love for Swindon to become like some of the European towns where up to 80% of people keep cycling even through the winter.\u00a0 Or even like Oxford or Cambridge, where cycling is so popular.\u00a0 I would have loved it if, this week, with all the snow and ice that we&#8217;ve had, cycle lanes could have seen a bit of grit and been made safe for me to cycle to work &#8211; just like they do <a href=\"http:\/\/hembrow.blogspot.com\/2009\/01\/priorities-when-it-snows.html\">in the Netherlands where priorities are different<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Barriers<\/h2>\n<p>But how do you start getting momentum on moving towards towns like these?\u00a0 Do you start by getting more people cycling and hope that the authorities recognise this and make the facilities better?\u00a0 Or do you convince the authorities to make the facilities better and hope that this will encourage people to cycle more?\u00a0 (This was pretty much what I said yesterday).<\/p>\n<p>I suspect a bit of both is necessary.\u00a0 But it&#8217;s chicken and egg.<\/p>\n<p>And it raises some difficult questions.\u00a0 How do you convince a cash-strapped council to improve facilities that are currently only used by a minority in the hope that more people will in the long term start using them?\u00a0 When the priority for the town has to be roads because they&#8217;re the main way into, out of, and around the town &#8211; they&#8217;re the paths of commerce and industry.\u00a0 And when our culture is one where people need to travel great distances to work, shop, and visit friends and family.<\/p>\n<p>Things like the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swindoncyclechallenge.org.uk\/\">Swindon Cycle Challenge<\/a> help and I&#8217;ve emailed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ctc.org.uk\/desktopdefault.aspx?tabid=4916\">our town&#8217;s CTC cycle champion<\/a> (though, disappointingly, with no response as yet).\u00a0 Perhaps there are opportunities with doing cycle training, to help people have confidence on the roads, or to bring up the next generation with the idea that cycling is a good thing.\u00a0 And maybe writing to the local MP or to the council will help.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all a bit unknown and it&#8217;s hard to see how little old me can make a difference.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully being a CTC member will help and there will be ideas in their magazines and lots of encouragement and support from others with similar hopes.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I&#8217;ll be writing more about this if, as and when I get involved.\u00a0 Perhaps in a few years time I&#8217;ll be writing about the successes and joys of sharing the many, well-maintained cycle lanes with more Swindoners.<\/p>\n",

Not really personal stuff&#8230;of course!  But, I guess this blog is really about things I&#8217;m learning.  The tag line contines to be true &#8220;Discovering new things in an old home&#8221;.  And so I&#8217;m slowly learning how to keep my body from failing under the various strains of things like stress and cycling.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Sally, my wife, pointed out the other day that I&#8217;d not written anything about the huge amount of snow that we&#8217;ve had lately.  Truth is, I&#8217;m not that interested in it (though there is a post in my head about the cool ways that people have used the internet and social networking during the snow time).<\/p>\n<p>But I have discovered one of the dangers of snow!  And it&#8217;s caused me an injury.<\/p>\n<p>Some facts about the snow:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s made me stop exercising, not just cycling, but generally, I&#8217;ve been moving around less.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s getting quite dangerous to walk on round here.\u00a0 Not that it&#8217;s hard-packed ice, it&#8217;s not nice, and as I drove (yeah, I&#8217;ve been driving to work&#8230;bad form I know!) out of my street this morning, people were choosing to walk on the well-gritted road rather than the pavement.<\/li>\n<li>There have been <a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/uk_politics\/3453039.stm\">some articles in the press about clearing paths of snow<\/a>, but I quite like the idea of communities pulling together with their spades to clear the paths and make them safe to walk on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, attempting to set a precedent, I went out with my spade on Sunday and cleared the path and two parking spaces outside our house.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, this sudden exertion seems to have brought on some back pain.<\/p>\n<p>Actually, I think it&#8217;s a combination of doing nothing, sudden exertion, and then doing nothing again.\u00a0 I actually spent most of Sunday afternoon slumped in a chair with the laptop typing out a huge long essay on &#8220;How to read the Bible&#8221; and I&#8217;m sure that did me no good either.\u00a0 In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/01\/10\/coughing-my-way-into-the-new-year\/\">the last time I did my back in<\/a> I&#8217;d spent too much time slumped in comfy furniture.<\/p>\n<p>My back is an on-and-off source of trouble.\u00a0 I think I know what causes it and I have long periods of being pain free between minor incidents.\u00a0 But I was thinking last night about the fact that I&#8217;m probably somewhere between a fifth and quarter of the way through my working life and if bad posture is occasionally a problem now, I really need to get it sorted out in the long term, or I&#8217;ll end up seizing up entirely!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>There&#8217;s been a few more hits and even a comment lately, which suggests new readers.  Hello!!!<\/p>\n<p>I will, at some point write some &#8220;pages&#8221; that explain a bit about me and why this blog is here&#8230;watch this space.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, one of the reasons I started writing stuff down was to track various health things that were going on.  Not really personal stuff&#8230;of course!  But, I guess this blog is really about things I&#8217;m learning.  The tag line contines to be true &#8220;Discovering new things in an old home&#8221;.  And so I&#8217;m slowly learning how to keep my body from failing under the various strains of things like stress and cycling.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Sally, my wife, pointed out the other day that I&#8217;d not written anything about the huge amount of snow that we&#8217;ve had lately.  Truth is, I&#8217;m not that interested in it (though there is a post in my head about the cool ways that people have used the internet and social networking during the snow time).<\/p>\n<p>But I have discovered one of the dangers of snow!  And it&#8217;s caused me an injury.<\/p>\n<p>Some facts about the snow:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s made me stop exercising, not just cycling, but generally, I&#8217;ve been moving around less.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s getting quite dangerous to walk on round here.\u00a0 Not that it&#8217;s hard-packed ice, it&#8217;s not nice, and as I drove (yeah, I&#8217;ve been driving to work&#8230;bad form I know!) out of my street this morning, people were choosing to walk on the well-gritted road rather than the pavement.<\/li>\n<li>There have been <a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/uk_politics\/3453039.stm\">some articles in the press about clearing paths of snow<\/a>, but I quite like the idea of communities pulling together with their spades to clear the paths and make them safe to walk on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, attempting to set a precedent, I went out with my spade on Sunday and cleared the path and two parking spaces outside our house.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, this sudden exertion seems to have brought on some back pain.<\/p>\n<p>Actually, I think it&#8217;s a combination of doing nothing, sudden exertion, and then doing nothing again.\u00a0 I actually spent most of Sunday afternoon slumped in a chair with the laptop typing out a huge long essay on &#8220;How to read the Bible&#8221; and I&#8217;m sure that did me no good either.\u00a0 In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/01\/10\/coughing-my-way-into-the-new-year\/\">the last time I did my back in<\/a> I&#8217;d spent too much time slumped in comfy furniture.<\/p>\n<p>My back is an on-and-off source of trouble.\u00a0 I think I know what causes it and I have long periods of being pain free between minor incidents.\u00a0 But I was thinking last night about the fact that I&#8217;m probably somewhere between a fifth and quarter of the way through my working life and if bad posture is occasionally a problem now, I really need to get it sorted out in the long term, or I&#8217;ll end up seizing up entirely!<\/p>\n",

But I managed to stay &#8220;rubber side down&#8221; as they say.  It was also VERY cold and I was numb even through my winter SealSkins AND thermal inners.<\/p>\n<p>Things had improved by evening time and, despite the darkness, I put in a fairly useful 9 urban miles or so.  And I felt pretty strong too!<\/p>\n<p>You know, I might have said this a thousand times before but I just LOVE cycling.  I think I&#8217;m the sort of person that thrives on intense exercise, so that sways my opinion, but I feel so much better in so many ways for having put a few miles in.<\/p>\n",

It was also VERY cold and I was numb even through my winter SealSkins AND thermal inners.<\/p>\n<p>Things had improved by evening time and, despite the darkness, I put in a fairly useful 9 urban miles or so.  And I felt pretty strong too!<\/p>\n<p>You know, I might have said this a thousand times before but I just LOVE cycling.  I think I&#8217;m the sort of person that thrives on intense exercise, so that sways my opinion, but I feel so much better in so many ways for having put a few miles in.<\/p>\n",

I mean, I only follow about 40 people and that&#8217;s too much. \u00a0Most people seem to have HUNDREDS! \u00a0And it baffles me how you would keep up with such numbers.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this more deeply lately too, and I think there&#8217;s another problem. \u00a0The Social Web, Web 2.0, or whatever you want to call it, is becoming too self-referential. \u00a0What do I mean by that? \u00a0Well, so much stuff that&#8217;s on the web is about&#8230; the web. \u00a0Even I&#8217;m doing it. \u00a0Right now!!<\/p>\n<p>People twitter about Twitter and blog about Blogs. \u00a0I even read blogs that tell me about useful tools for making my web presence more effective, or for being more efficient at doing stuff online. \u00a0Stuff that I wouldn&#8217;t need if I wasn&#8217;t online reading all these blogs&#8230;hmmm.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, sometimes I&#8217;m \u00a0is useful and I&#8217;ve discovered lots of really interesting things through social networking, but I coped without all that stuff before and I have a sense that the web actually makes work for me, and then gives me ways to cope with the extra work.<\/p>\n<p>It feels like the volume of &#8220;real stuff&#8221; being talked about on the internet is decreasing. \u00a0And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s interesting to me.<\/p>\n<p>Does anyone else get this sense at all?<\/p>\n<p>And so to the last few days &#8211; real friends are joining. \u00a0I was going to ask &#8220;Would Twitter with real friends be different?&#8221;, but it seems, I&#8217;m about to find out.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because I have a 9-5, full-time job and Twitter isn&#8217;t a great form of communication for someone like me. \u00a0Perhaps it&#8217;s more suited to self-employed, consultancy types, or people who&#8217;s job it is to work with web-based media. \u00a0I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<p>So, go on, convince me to stay!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;ve been contemplating my presence on Twitter for a while and I&#8217;m at quite an odd juncture with it as, all of a sudden, more people that I know in real life are joining. \u00a0 I&#8217;ll try to be brief with my thoughts but I think this will turn into a bit of an essay.<\/p>\n<p>I <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/02\/01\/taking-up-twittering-as-facebook-flops\/\">joined Twitter<\/a> just over a year ago and when I did so my feeling was very much that Facebook had got too complicated and Twitter would represent a simpler way of keeping tabs on my real friends.<\/p>\n<p>But no one else really joined and Facebook remined the de facto way to see what people were up to.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter remained a minor interest at first, but over time my interest grew. \u00a0Factors that contributed to that growth of interest were:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finding more people with common interests (mostly other cyclists).<\/li>\n<li>Use of <a href=\"http:\/\/search.twitter.com\">Twitter&#8217;s search functionality<\/a>, which gives interesting ways of seeing what people are saying about a given topic.<\/li>\n<li>Interesting uses, like when we had lots of snow and people started using Twitter with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hashtags.org\">Hashtags<\/a>\u00a0(like <a href=\"http:\/\/hashtags.org\/tag\/uksnow\">#uksnow<\/a>) and scripts and maps to do interesting things like track the snow in real time&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>&#8230;or when GMail went down and Twitter became a great way to track what was going on with that and who it was affecting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Heck, even my wife claimed that &#8220;Twitter is useful after all&#8221; when I discovered I was following someone who worked for the Cyclists Touring Club (CTC) and who could help put me in touch with the Swindon Cycle Champion. \u00a0Hooray!<\/p>\n<p>Now, I REALLY hope that this doesn&#8217;t offend anyone that I follow (please, debate in the comments below if you think I&#8217;m missing something), but, as time went on, these useful bits and bobs started to make up only a small portion of the stuff I read on Twitter. \u00a0Heck, if I&#8217;m honest, I wouldn&#8217;t follow myself &#8211; I&#8217;m far from interesting.<\/p>\n<p>Please, followees, it&#8217;s not that you&#8217;re boring &#8211; far from it, that&#8217;s why I follow &#8211; but it&#8217;s hard to keep up with you all sometimes, and it&#8217;s becoming my opinion that the value that I get from it isn&#8217;t in proportion to the time I put into it.<\/p>\n<p>Now, there is a part of me that thinks that I&#8217;m doing something wrong. \u00a0Perhaps there&#8217;s a Twitter client out there that will help me get more value? I mean, I only follow about 40 people and that&#8217;s too much. \u00a0Most people seem to have HUNDREDS! \u00a0And it baffles me how you would keep up with such numbers.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this more deeply lately too, and I think there&#8217;s another problem. \u00a0The Social Web, Web 2.0, or whatever you want to call it, is becoming too self-referential. \u00a0What do I mean by that? \u00a0Well, so much stuff that&#8217;s on the web is about&#8230; the web. \u00a0Even I&#8217;m doing it. \u00a0Right now!!<\/p>\n<p>People twitter about Twitter and blog about Blogs. \u00a0I even read blogs that tell me about useful tools for making my web presence more effective, or for being more efficient at doing stuff online. \u00a0Stuff that I wouldn&#8217;t need if I wasn&#8217;t online reading all these blogs&#8230;hmmm.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, sometimes I&#8217;m \u00a0is useful and I&#8217;ve discovered lots of really interesting things through social networking, but I coped without all that stuff before and I have a sense that the web actually makes work for me, and then gives me ways to cope with the extra work.<\/p>\n<p>It feels like the volume of &#8220;real stuff&#8221; being talked about on the internet is decreasing. \u00a0And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s interesting to me.<\/p>\n<p>Does anyone else get this sense at all?<\/p>\n<p>And so to the last few days &#8211; real friends are joining. \u00a0I was going to ask &#8220;Would Twitter with real friends be different?&#8221;, but it seems, I&#8217;m about to find out.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because I have a 9-5, full-time job and Twitter isn&#8217;t a great form of communication for someone like me. \u00a0Perhaps it&#8217;s more suited to self-employed, consultancy types, or people who&#8217;s job it is to work with web-based media. \u00a0I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<p>So, go on, convince me to stay!<\/p>\n",
