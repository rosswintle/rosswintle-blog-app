I&#8217;ve rewritten it in <a href=\"http:\/\/laravel.com\">Laravel<\/a>: a PHP-based rapid application development framework. And one thing I learned is that launching even a super, super simple web application in public is a far from rapid process.<\/p>\n<p>Hasyourbabyarrivedyet.com is basically a big red button that changes the word &#8220;NO&#8221; to the word &#8220;YES&#8221;. Other than that function the app needs user registration, and log in and log out functionality. And yes, that&#8217;s pretty much it.<\/p>\n<p>Except, if you&#8217;re making a thing like this public, search-engine indexable, social-media optimised, responsive\/mobile friendly, secure and spam free. If you want it to handle outgoing email well, include analytics and be user friendly. And probably a host of things that I&#8217;ve not considered.<\/p>\n<p>At one point, the app was, to all intents and purposes, functionally complete. \u00a0But my todo list for it looked something like this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add analytics<\/li>\n<li>Write privacy\/cookie policy for cookies and basic terms and conditions<\/li>\n<li>Add welcome notice after login<\/li>\n<li>Add ReCapthca to prevent spam<\/li>\n<li>Configure transactional email (MailGun)<\/li>\n<li>Send email to admin on signup<\/li>\n<li>Explain form fields<\/li>\n<li>Add OpenGraph and other meta data and sort titles<\/li>\n<li>Test in Facebook debugger<\/li>\n<li>Add favicons<\/li>\n<li>Add about page<\/li>\n<li>Configure email forwarding<\/li>\n<li>Add sitemap<\/li>\n<li>Make sure webmaster tools works<\/li>\n<li>Add to uptime and domain monitoring<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And so on.<\/p>\n<p>I knew all of these things had to be done, and it didn&#8217;t take me long to rattle through the list, but the process reminded me that rapidly developing an application is one thing. But there&#8217;s so much ancillary stuff that you need to do to make something public on the internet.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be fooled. Tools help developers achieve great things in short spaces of time. But a good launch requires thought, planning and knowledge of quite a few things that go beyond the realms of just coding something.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I forgot some things too. If I did please let me know in the comments.<\/p>\n<p>And feel free to share the site with any friends you have that are expecting. Being constantly asked &#8220;has your baby arrived yet&#8221; is a bit of a bore. ?<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ve rewritten it in <a href=\"http:\/\/laravel.com\">Laravel<\/a>: a PHP-based rapid application development framework. And one thing I learned is that launching even a super, super simple web application in public is a far from rapid process.<\/p>\n<p>Hasyourbabyarrivedyet.com is basically a big red button that changes the word &#8220;NO&#8221; to the word &#8220;YES&#8221;. Other than that function the app needs user registration, and log in and log out functionality. And yes, that&#8217;s pretty much it.<\/p>\n<p>Except, if you&#8217;re making a thing like this public, search-engine indexable, social-media optimised, responsive\/mobile friendly, secure and spam free. If you want it to handle outgoing email well, include analytics and be user friendly. And probably a host of things that I&#8217;ve not considered.<\/p>\n<p>At one point, the app was, to all intents and purposes, functionally complete. \u00a0But my todo list for it looked something like this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add analytics<\/li>\n<li>Write privacy\/cookie policy for cookies and basic terms and conditions<\/li>\n<li>Add welcome notice after login<\/li>\n<li>Add ReCapthca to prevent spam<\/li>\n<li>Configure transactional email (MailGun)<\/li>\n<li>Send email to admin on signup<\/li>\n<li>Explain form fields<\/li>\n<li>Add OpenGraph and other meta data and sort titles<\/li>\n<li>Test in Facebook debugger<\/li>\n<li>Add favicons<\/li>\n<li>Add about page<\/li>\n<li>Configure email forwarding<\/li>\n<li>Add sitemap<\/li>\n<li>Make sure webmaster tools works<\/li>\n<li>Add to uptime and domain monitoring<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And so on.<\/p>\n<p>I knew all of these things had to be done, and it didn&#8217;t take me long to rattle through the list, but the process reminded me that rapidly developing an application is one thing. But there&#8217;s so much ancillary stuff that you need to do to make something public on the internet.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be fooled. Tools help developers achieve great things in short spaces of time. But a good launch requires thought, planning and knowledge of quite a few things that go beyond the realms of just coding something.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I forgot some things too. If I did please let me know in the comments.<\/p>\n<p>And feel free to share the site with any friends you have that are expecting. Being constantly asked &#8220;has your baby arrived yet&#8221; is a bit of a bore. ?<\/p>\n",

I didn&#8217;t really want to publish it until I had the full quote, which I managed to acquire this week. I think it&#8217;s still relevant.<\/p>\n<p>All sorts of things are &#8216;speaking&#8217; to me at the moment about life.<\/p>\n<p>Last night we did a bit of TV catchup and saw the jungle episode of the BBC&#8217;s brilliant &#8216;Human Planet&#8217;. And while the programme as a whole was extraordinary what got me was the little &#8216;the making of&#8217; documentary at the end.<\/p>\n<p>For those that missed it they&#8217;d done a section on a tribe of people who, with primitive tools, had built a tree house&#8230;in a 35m-high tree!! The tribesmen climbed to the treetops using not more than sticks and vines and strength and stamina. Yet, in the making-of we see the BBC crew all safety-harnessed up with lines and backup lines, helmets, etc.<\/p>\n<p>At the end they interviewed one of the crew. What had he learned from his visit?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I find I judge my own inadequacies against their expertise and knowledge. You know, you come here and you&#8217;ve got boots on in case of snake bites, you&#8217;ve got sun cream on because of the sun. You know, you&#8217;ve got twin safety ropes to make sure if one fails you&#8217;re caught on the other one. And these guys? OK, maybe they have a higher mortality rate, but they&#8217;re much freer in their lifestyle. You know, they&#8217;ll shimmy up and down these trees. I think I&#8217;d much rather lead a fuller, shorter life like they do out here.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The impact of a simpler, freer life is clear.

I think it&#8217;s still relevant.<\/p>\n<p>All sorts of things are &#8216;speaking&#8217; to me at the moment about life.<\/p>\n<p>Last night we did a bit of TV catchup and saw the jungle episode of the BBC&#8217;s brilliant &#8216;Human Planet&#8217;. And while the programme as a whole was extraordinary what got me was the little &#8216;the making of&#8217; documentary at the end.<\/p>\n<p>For those that missed it they&#8217;d done a section on a tribe of people who, with primitive tools, had built a tree house&#8230;in a 35m-high tree!! The tribesmen climbed to the treetops using not more than sticks and vines and strength and stamina. Yet, in the making-of we see the BBC crew all safety-harnessed up with lines and backup lines, helmets, etc.<\/p>\n<p>At the end they interviewed one of the crew. What had he learned from his visit?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I find I judge my own inadequacies against their expertise and knowledge.

You know, you&#8217;ve got twin safety ropes to make sure if one fails you&#8217;re caught on the other one. And these guys? OK, maybe they have a higher mortality rate, but they&#8217;re much freer in their lifestyle. You know, they&#8217;ll shimmy up and down these trees. I think I&#8217;d much rather lead a fuller, shorter life like they do out here.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The impact of a simpler, freer life is clear.

                "rendered": "<h4>An all-round, family adventure and commuting bike that brings out the inner hooligan. Bought from a fantastic local bike shop in Swindon centre.<\/h4>\n<h2>Me and my bikes<\/h2>\n<p>So, a bit of history. I love bikes and cycling, as you can probably tell. But my stable has until now consisted of only a cheap Raleigh Pioneer hybrid, and a low-to-mid-range Felt Road bike.<\/p>\n<p>When we first moved to Swindon, the Raleigh was a great starting point, but I quickly become fed up with the upright position &#8211; I wanted something more sporty.<\/p>\n<p>This was about 8 years ago when bikes were either mountain, road (or tourer) or simple hybrid. Though Cyclocross bikes were an option too, albeit an unusual one at the time.<\/p>\n<p>So, when I decided to add a second bike, I really had to choose between trail or road. I chose road. Mostly because I&#8217;m surrounded by nice, meandering country roads, and most real off-road trail riding is quite a way away.<\/p>\n<p>In the years that followed, the hybrid world seemed to go crazy. I remember seeing a <a href=\"http:\/\/road.cc\/content\/review\/24161-trek-portland\">Trek Portland<\/a> &#8211; an urban road\/cyclocross combo in retro brown-leather styling, but with disc brakes. WHAT?!?! \u00a0And ever since the hybrid spectrum seems to have gone nuts.<\/p>\n<p>More recently, I&#8217;ve had a small child to carry around. Deciding that the skinny, lightweight frame of my road bike wouldn&#8217;t like a 5kg bike seat and (now) 13kg toddler clinging to the seat tube and wobbling around, the road bike has pretty much been consigned to the shed while I pootle around, commuting in &#8220;normal clothes&#8221;, on the old faithful Raleigh. \u00a0Credit where credit&#8217;s due: that bike has taken a beating over the years and held up well for it&#8217;s \u00a3180 price tag and occasional service and spare part.<\/p>\n<p>And me? I&#8217;m truly post-MAMIL. I&#8217;m having a mid-life bike crisis. I&#8217;m a &#8220;Middle Aged Dad in Normal Clothes&#8221; &#8211; a MADINC! And I need something different.<\/p>\n<h2>Choosing a new steed<\/h2>\n<p>The Raleigh was getting rusty, and I was longing to get some sportiness back into my commute. I wanted a bike that would:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Let me carry Isaac to nursery, and on family adventures<\/li>\n<li>Let me cycle to work quickly and efficiently<\/li>\n<li>Let me do longer on-road, and possibly off-road (easy trails, not gnarly singletrack) rides for fitness<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I was sort-of inspired when I accidentally looked at a Boardman hybrid that seemed sporty but practical and had front suspension forks that with a quick-lock-out mechanism. &#8220;This could be it!&#8221;, I thought, &#8220;the do-everything hybrid&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So when we came into a little extra cash one day, we decided that we would buy some new bikes. And I got researching properly.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll spare you the long story, but I eliminated a load of bikes, shops, and brands, and ended up looking at Ridgebacks, which seemed to do a really good part of the spectrum of hybrids, and looked cool too. I&#8217;m not a visual person but I took a fancy to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ridgeback.co.uk\/bike\/x1\">X1<\/a> (you&#8217;ll notice the similarities to the Portland mentioned above), but wanted to check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ridgeback.co.uk\/bike\/mx4\">MX4<\/a> too with more nobbly tyres and suspension fork.<\/p>\n<p>I was torn about the fork. Would my use case really need suspension? Would it encourage me off road more? Or was it an unnecessary extra?<\/p>\n<p>In looking at the Ridgebacks we also came across Marin Bikes. I sat on a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marinbikes.com\/gb\/bikes\/description\/2015-fairfax-sc3\">Fairfax<\/a>: a rugged-looking, speedy urban commuter and really liked the feel from the word go. I then tried a slightly-chunkier <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marinbikes.com\/gb\/bikes\/description\/2015-muirwoods-29er\">Muirwoods 29er<\/a> and wrote it off because I didn&#8217;t like the really wide handlebar.<\/p>\n<p>A quick &#8211; no, it wasn&#8217;t quick, it was quite lengthly &#8211; chat with a guy who knows a lot about bikes decided at least one thing for me: I didn&#8217;t want a cheap suspension fork, and I couldn&#8217;t afford an expensive suspension fork. So a solid fork it was. Which meant the MX4 was out of the equation, and it was between the Ridgeback X1 and the Marins &#8211; probably the Fairfax.<\/p>\n<p>So I went back to the shop and tried them all. Initially they didn&#8217;t have the X1 in, and I tried the Fairfax and Muirwoods again. And&#8230;to my surprise&#8230;ended up preferring the more mountain-bikey Muirwoods. \u00a0The X1 demo bike hadn&#8217;t arrived, so I went away to mull things over.<\/p>\n<p>The Muirwoods just felt&#8230;FUN! I looked up reviews. Reviews of the specific bikes I&#8217;d been looking at were hard to come across, but the Muirwoods had one:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Fun, tough, practical<\/em><\/p>\n<p>said <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/gear\/category\/bikes\/urban\/product\/review-marin-muirwoods-29er-10-37582\/\">Bike Radar<\/a>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>[The Muirwoods] encourages a belligerent approach to your commute that your mum wouldn\u2019t like. It brings out the inner hooligan as you look for every opportunity to carve a corner or dive through a gap. It&#8217;s huge fun.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Yes. Yes it was. I could tell just taking it for a quick spin outside the shop. It was fun. It wanted to play.<\/p>\n<p>And that feeling prevailed when I went back to compare the Muirwoods with the X1. I sat on the X1. It looked great. It was really comfortable. It rode well. It would probably have been a great all-rounder of a bike capable of doing all the things that I wanted to do. But when I sat on it, I felt like I was riding to the office.<\/p>\n<p>When I sat on the Muirwoods, I felt like I was riding to the skate park, or the forest. I felt like I could do Danny Macaskill tricks on my way to work. But also that it would get me around on the roads in speed and with comfort too.<\/p>\n<p>I ordered the Muirwoods. I was undecided for about an afternoon about whether or not I&#8217;d done the right thing. I&#8217;d never met my inner-hooligan before. What was about to happen?!<\/p>\n<p>The indecision soon passed. It was play time!<\/p>\n<h2>The Marin<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had the Marin for a few months now. It&#8217;s a great bike. I love it to bits. It&#8217;s a true all-rounder. Here&#8217;s some of what&#8217;s different, good and bad about it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s to like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I like the extra-wide handlebar. It took a while to get used to, but it adds to the fun of the ride. It does, however, sometimes make it difficult to park in a busy bike rack!<\/p>\n<p>I like the disc brakes. My first experience of them, and I&#8217;m totally convinced so far.<\/p>\n<p>I like the big, wide pedals. They make it really easy to hop on and off and just get going.<\/p>\n<p>I like the subtle reflective decals and reflective tyre walls. Neat little touches. And I&#8217;m glad that reflective tyres seem more common these days &#8211; especially in a town with lots of roundabouts when side-on visibility is key.<\/p>\n<p>I like that it has eyelets and space for mud guards as they&#8217;re essential for a commuter. The guys in the bike shop got me some great guards and spent a good time getting them fitted well.<\/p>\n<p>I like that it&#8217;s black.<\/p>\n<p>I like the big wheels and choice of tyres. It rolls nicely both off and on-road.<\/p>\n<p>I like the MTB shifters. They&#8217;re fast, accessible, accurate. Yes, the cables stretch over time, but these work well. The components are at a good level here.<\/p>\n<p>I like that it doesn&#8217;t have suspension. It turns out that I really don&#8217;t need it and it&#8217;s one thing less to worry about.<\/p>\n<p>I like that I can happily carry my three-year-old around on it in his seat. Fitting the bracket for the seat was easy and he&#8217;s quite happy on it.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s lots to like! From the bigger-picture overall feel of the thing, right down to tiny details like the decals and reflectives.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It has this steel frame.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Which is kinda weird. Bike nerds please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong here but I&#8217;ll try to explain what I know.<\/p>\n<p>Steel is less stiff; it flexes more. \u00a0But it&#8217;s stronger; it&#8217;s less likely to break or bend. Steel is also heavier. But because of the increased strength you need less of it. So it has these really thin tubes made of really thin metal. And this makes the bike &#8220;ring&#8221; slightly. There&#8217;s actually this odd noise when the frame is tapped or knocked or it experiences a jolt. \u00a0This sound take a while to get used to and it does give the bike a whole different character. I wasn&#8217;t sure what I was riding at first.<\/p>\n<p>Steel also feels different. It&#8217;s hard to explain this. It&#8217;s highly qualitative. It&#8217;s just weird. You&#8217;ll have to take my word for it. But you get used to it. And it&#8217;s not bad &#8211; just different.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It feels like it has a &#8220;missing gear&#8221;.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Between cogs\u00a05 and 6. It needs an extra 5-and-a-half&#8217;th gear. Which is kinda awkward because at a reasonable pace 5th gear is too low, and 6th is too high. This comes up in the reviews. And it&#8217;s totally true.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I THINK it needs different grips.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The grips are OK but not very comfortable. \u00a0They&#8217;re round and flat. I always felt like they were intended to make you hold on for dear life, which, given the nature of the bike, isn&#8217;t a bad idea. They felt especially harsh at first, but I&#8217;ve got used to them. \u00a0I&#8217;m not sure how I&#8217;d get on with them on a longer ride though.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I THINK it needs a different saddle.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is a similar story to the grips. It felt really harsh at first but I&#8217;ve grown accustomed to it. You may want to add a more comfortable saddle of your own choosing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stupid\u00a0cable\/hose clips<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Details, details. The other crazy thing is the C-shaped cable\/hose clips used to hold the cables\/hoses to the frame are plastic and, well, they just fall off. Perhaps there&#8217;s a good reason for their use, but I quickly replaced them with proper cable ties. A tiny thing, but annoying none the less.<\/p>\n<h2>The Bike Shop: @thehub, Swindon<\/h2>\n<p>I want to give an extra special plug to the guys that sold us our new bikes: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.atthehub.website\/\">@thehub<\/a>. They are a new, startup, bike shop and coffee shop in central Swindon.<\/p>\n<p>@thehub is\u00a0a new business, and I went in to chat with them when they first opened. They&#8217;re brilliant. Super-friendly, proper helpful. The staff have gone totally out of their way to give us advice, let us try things out, and generally provide awesome customer service &#8211; even down to making sure my mudguards were installed JUST right. Their attention to detail is superb, as is their coffee and hot chocolate.<\/p>\n<p>As a new, and fairly small bike shop they have limited stock. But if you are in the market for a new bike or for a service or parts, I highly recommend them and would urge you to support this new local business. It&#8217;s a real asset to our town centre.<\/p>\n<h2>In summary<\/h2>\n<p>My mid-life crisis is complete. The lycra is gone. I&#8217;m a jeans-and-trainers wearing hooligan on a stealthy beast of a bike that goes everywhere and does everything. Family adventures here we come!<\/p>\n",

        "title": "New Friend: Marin Muirwoods 29er review",
        "content": "<h4>An all-round, family adventure and commuting bike that brings out the inner hooligan. Bought from a fantastic local bike shop in Swindon centre.<\/h4>\n<h2>Me and my bikes<\/h2>\n<p>So, a bit of history. I love bikes and cycling, as you can probably tell. But my stable has until now consisted of only a cheap Raleigh Pioneer hybrid, and a low-to-mid-range Felt Road bike.<\/p>\n<p>When we first moved to Swindon, the Raleigh was a great starting point, but I quickly become fed up with the upright position &#8211; I wanted something more sporty.<\/p>\n<p>This was about 8 years ago when bikes were either mountain, road (or tourer) or simple hybrid. Though Cyclocross bikes were an option too, albeit an unusual one at the time.<\/p>\n<p>So, when I decided to add a second bike, I really had to choose between trail or road. I chose road. Mostly because I&#8217;m surrounded by nice, meandering country roads, and most real off-road trail riding is quite a way away.<\/p>\n<p>In the years that followed, the hybrid world seemed to go crazy. I remember seeing a <a href=\"http:\/\/road.cc\/content\/review\/24161-trek-portland\">Trek Portland<\/a> &#8211; an urban road\/cyclocross combo in retro brown-leather styling, but with disc brakes. WHAT?!?! \u00a0And ever since the hybrid spectrum seems to have gone nuts.<\/p>\n<p>More recently, I&#8217;ve had a small child to carry around. Deciding that the skinny, lightweight frame of my road bike wouldn&#8217;t like a 5kg bike seat and (now) 13kg toddler clinging to the seat tube and wobbling around, the road bike has pretty much been consigned to the shed while I pootle around, commuting in &#8220;normal clothes&#8221;, on the old faithful Raleigh. \u00a0Credit where credit&#8217;s due: that bike has taken a beating over the years and held up well for it&#8217;s \u00a3180 price tag and occasional service and spare part.<\/p>\n<p>And me? I&#8217;m truly post-MAMIL. I&#8217;m having a mid-life bike crisis. I&#8217;m a &#8220;Middle Aged Dad in Normal Clothes&#8221; &#8211; a MADINC! And I need something different.<\/p>\n<h2>Choosing a new steed<\/h2>\n<p>The Raleigh was getting rusty, and I was longing to get some sportiness back into my commute. I wanted a bike that would:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Let me carry Isaac to nursery, and on family adventures<\/li>\n<li>Let me cycle to work quickly and efficiently<\/li>\n<li>Let me do longer on-road, and possibly off-road (easy trails, not gnarly singletrack) rides for fitness<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I was sort-of inspired when I accidentally looked at a Boardman hybrid that seemed sporty but practical and had front suspension forks that with a quick-lock-out mechanism. &#8220;This could be it!&#8221;, I thought, &#8220;the do-everything hybrid&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So when we came into a little extra cash one day, we decided that we would buy some new bikes. And I got researching properly.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll spare you the long story, but I eliminated a load of bikes, shops, and brands, and ended up looking at Ridgebacks, which seemed to do a really good part of the spectrum of hybrids, and looked cool too. I&#8217;m not a visual person but I took a fancy to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ridgeback.co.uk\/bike\/x1\">X1<\/a> (you&#8217;ll notice the similarities to the Portland mentioned above), but wanted to check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ridgeback.co.uk\/bike\/mx4\">MX4<\/a> too with more nobbly tyres and suspension fork.<\/p>\n<p>I was torn about the fork. Would my use case really need suspension? Would it encourage me off road more? Or was it an unnecessary extra?<\/p>\n<p>In looking at the Ridgebacks we also came across Marin Bikes. I sat on a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marinbikes.com\/gb\/bikes\/description\/2015-fairfax-sc3\">Fairfax<\/a>: a rugged-looking, speedy urban commuter and really liked the feel from the word go. I then tried a slightly-chunkier <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marinbikes.com\/gb\/bikes\/description\/2015-muirwoods-29er\">Muirwoods 29er<\/a> and wrote it off because I didn&#8217;t like the really wide handlebar.<\/p>\n<p>A quick &#8211; no, it wasn&#8217;t quick, it was quite lengthly &#8211; chat with a guy who knows a lot about bikes decided at least one thing for me: I didn&#8217;t want a cheap suspension fork, and I couldn&#8217;t afford an expensive suspension fork. So a solid fork it was. Which meant the MX4 was out of the equation, and it was between the Ridgeback X1 and the Marins &#8211; probably the Fairfax.<\/p>\n<p>So I went back to the shop and tried them all. Initially they didn&#8217;t have the X1 in, and I tried the Fairfax and Muirwoods again. And&#8230;to my surprise&#8230;ended up preferring the more mountain-bikey Muirwoods. \u00a0The X1 demo bike hadn&#8217;t arrived, so I went away to mull things over.<\/p>\n<p>The Muirwoods just felt&#8230;FUN! I looked up reviews. Reviews of the specific bikes I&#8217;d been looking at were hard to come across, but the Muirwoods had one:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Fun, tough, practical<\/em><\/p>\n<p>said <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/gear\/category\/bikes\/urban\/product\/review-marin-muirwoods-29er-10-37582\/\">Bike Radar<\/a>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>[The Muirwoods] encourages a belligerent approach to your commute that your mum wouldn\u2019t like. It brings out the inner hooligan as you look for every opportunity to carve a corner or dive through a gap. It&#8217;s huge fun.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Yes. Yes it was. I could tell just taking it for a quick spin outside the shop. It was fun. It wanted to play.<\/p>\n<p>And that feeling prevailed when I went back to compare the Muirwoods with the X1. I sat on the X1. It looked great. It was really comfortable. It rode well. It would probably have been a great all-rounder of a bike capable of doing all the things that I wanted to do. But when I sat on it, I felt like I was riding to the office.<\/p>\n<p>When I sat on the Muirwoods, I felt like I was riding to the skate park, or the forest. I felt like I could do Danny Macaskill tricks on my way to work. But also that it would get me around on the roads in speed and with comfort too.<\/p>\n<p>I ordered the Muirwoods. I was undecided for about an afternoon about whether or not I&#8217;d done the right thing. I&#8217;d never met my inner-hooligan before. What was about to happen?!<\/p>\n<p>The indecision soon passed. It was play time!<\/p>\n<h2>The Marin<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had the Marin for a few months now. It&#8217;s a great bike. I love it to bits. It&#8217;s a true all-rounder. Here&#8217;s some of what&#8217;s different, good and bad about it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s to like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I like the extra-wide handlebar. It took a while to get used to, but it adds to the fun of the ride. It does, however, sometimes make it difficult to park in a busy bike rack!<\/p>\n<p>I like the disc brakes. My first experience of them, and I&#8217;m totally convinced so far.<\/p>\n<p>I like the big, wide pedals. They make it really easy to hop on and off and just get going.<\/p>\n<p>I like the subtle reflective decals and reflective tyre walls. Neat little touches. And I&#8217;m glad that reflective tyres seem more common these days &#8211; especially in a town with lots of roundabouts when side-on visibility is key.<\/p>\n<p>I like that it has eyelets and space for mud guards as they&#8217;re essential for a commuter. The guys in the bike shop got me some great guards and spent a good time getting them fitted well.<\/p>\n<p>I like that it&#8217;s black.<\/p>\n<p>I like the big wheels and choice of tyres. It rolls nicely both off and on-road.<\/p>\n<p>I like the MTB shifters. They&#8217;re fast, accessible, accurate. Yes, the cables stretch over time, but these work well. The components are at a good level here.<\/p>\n<p>I like that it doesn&#8217;t have suspension. It turns out that I really don&#8217;t need it and it&#8217;s one thing less to worry about.<\/p>\n<p>I like that I can happily carry my three-year-old around on it in his seat. Fitting the bracket for the seat was easy and he&#8217;s quite happy on it.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s lots to like! From the bigger-picture overall feel of the thing, right down to tiny details like the decals and reflectives.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It has this steel frame.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Which is kinda weird. Bike nerds please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong here but I&#8217;ll try to explain what I know.<\/p>\n<p>Steel is less stiff; it flexes more. \u00a0But it&#8217;s stronger; it&#8217;s less likely to break or bend. Steel is also heavier. But because of the increased strength you need less of it. So it has these really thin tubes made of really thin metal. And this makes the bike &#8220;ring&#8221; slightly. There&#8217;s actually this odd noise when the frame is tapped or knocked or it experiences a jolt. \u00a0This sound take a while to get used to and it does give the bike a whole different character. I wasn&#8217;t sure what I was riding at first.<\/p>\n<p>Steel also feels different. It&#8217;s hard to explain this. It&#8217;s highly qualitative. It&#8217;s just weird. You&#8217;ll have to take my word for it. But you get used to it. And it&#8217;s not bad &#8211; just different.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It feels like it has a &#8220;missing gear&#8221;.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Between cogs\u00a05 and 6. It needs an extra 5-and-a-half&#8217;th gear. Which is kinda awkward because at a reasonable pace 5th gear is too low, and 6th is too high. This comes up in the reviews. And it&#8217;s totally true.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I THINK it needs different grips.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The grips are OK but not very comfortable. \u00a0They&#8217;re round and flat. I always felt like they were intended to make you hold on for dear life, which, given the nature of the bike, isn&#8217;t a bad idea. They felt especially harsh at first, but I&#8217;ve got used to them. \u00a0I&#8217;m not sure how I&#8217;d get on with them on a longer ride though.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I THINK it needs a different saddle.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is a similar story to the grips. It felt really harsh at first but I&#8217;ve grown accustomed to it. You may want to add a more comfortable saddle of your own choosing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stupid\u00a0cable\/hose clips<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Details, details. The other crazy thing is the C-shaped cable\/hose clips used to hold the cables\/hoses to the frame are plastic and, well, they just fall off. Perhaps there&#8217;s a good reason for their use, but I quickly replaced them with proper cable ties. A tiny thing, but annoying none the less.<\/p>\n<h2>The Bike Shop: @thehub, Swindon<\/h2>\n<p>I want to give an extra special plug to the guys that sold us our new bikes: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.atthehub.website\/\">@thehub<\/a>. They are a new, startup, bike shop and coffee shop in central Swindon.<\/p>\n<p>@thehub is\u00a0a new business, and I went in to chat with them when they first opened. They&#8217;re brilliant. Super-friendly, proper helpful. The staff have gone totally out of their way to give us advice, let us try things out, and generally provide awesome customer service &#8211; even down to making sure my mudguards were installed JUST right. Their attention to detail is superb, as is their coffee and hot chocolate.<\/p>\n<p>As a new, and fairly small bike shop they have limited stock. But if you are in the market for a new bike or for a service or parts, I highly recommend them and would urge you to support this new local business. It&#8217;s a real asset to our town centre.<\/p>\n<h2>In summary<\/h2>\n<p>My mid-life crisis is complete. The lycra is gone. I&#8217;m a jeans-and-trainers wearing hooligan on a stealthy beast of a bike that goes everywhere and does everything. Family adventures here we come!<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ve been wondering about whether or not anyone does split testing in the real world with physical things.<\/p>\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, split testing is where you do an experiment where you change something for a proportion of people to see how they react and measure the effect. If the proportion experiencing the change react more favourably (for a given definition of favourably) then you make the change for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>An example is email subject lines. Marketing and campaigning emails are frequently split tested. The subject line or message has some variation and you measure the response (how many people open the email, how many people click a link in the email). If the variation has a higher response rate then you adopt that change in the future.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m SURE they do this kind of thing in the real world, but I&#8217;ve been trying to think of examples.<\/p>\n<p>Now, recently there was a story about Leicestershire police ignoring attempted burglaries at odd numbered houses. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-leicestershire-33788264\">BBC actually gave a fairly accurate report<\/a>,\u00a0as did some other places, but the headline clearly didn&#8217;t communicate the reality.<\/p>\n<p>And the reality was that this was a real-world split test! Burglaries were attended, but the forensics team were previously being sent to every case. Forensics were only helping in a very small number of cases, so they decided it wasn&#8217;t worth doing, but wanted to know if the public would mind forensics NOT being sent in to every case.<\/p>\n<p>So they tested public reaction with a split test. Forensics would only be sent to critical cases, and in non-critical cases, only to burglaries with odd house numbers.<\/p>\n<p>Strangely fascinating.

        "content": "<p>Here&#8217;s a quick interesting thing. I&#8217;ve been wondering about whether or not anyone does split testing in the real world with physical things.<\/p>\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, split testing is where you do an experiment where you change something for a proportion of people to see how they react and measure the effect. If the proportion experiencing the change react more favourably (for a given definition of favourably) then you make the change for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>An example is email subject lines. Marketing and campaigning emails are frequently split tested. The subject line or message has some variation and you measure the response (how many people open the email, how many people click a link in the email). If the variation has a higher response rate then you adopt that change in the future.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m SURE they do this kind of thing in the real world, but I&#8217;ve been trying to think of examples.<\/p>\n<p>Now, recently there was a story about Leicestershire police ignoring attempted burglaries at odd numbered houses. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-leicestershire-33788264\">BBC actually gave a fairly accurate report<\/a>,\u00a0as did some other places, but the headline clearly didn&#8217;t communicate the reality.<\/p>\n<p>And the reality was that this was a real-world split test! Burglaries were attended, but the forensics team were previously being sent to every case. Forensics were only helping in a very small number of cases, so they decided it wasn&#8217;t worth doing, but wanted to know if the public would mind forensics NOT being sent in to every case.<\/p>\n<p>So they tested public reaction with a split test. Forensics would only be sent to critical cases, and in non-critical cases, only to burglaries with odd house numbers.<\/p>\n<p>Strangely fascinating.

                "rendered": "<p>I&#8217;m nervous about writing this, mostly because it contains some stuff that&#8217;s about my own personality traits. But it&#8217;s been such a revelation to us that I have to share it.<\/p>\n<p>This post is an explanation of a character trait that we (are very glad we) found out about. It&#8217;s a summary of our own learnings and experiences. It will duplicate some things that you can read much more polished and detailed accounts of elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever felt different, shy, like you understand some things that other people don&#8217;t, or that you dwell on things deeply and thoughtfully &#8211; or if you have a bright and curious small child that seems to be highly attentive and sensitive, and WON&#8217;T SLEEP &#8211; then this may be worth reading. It may be a complete revelation!<\/p>\n<h2>Highly sensitive small people<\/h2>\n<p>As we and our friends reached the having-children stage of life, we started noticing a trait in some of the small children. Children who are highly attentive even from an early age. Children who seem to have extreme emotions. Children who are awful sleepers. Children who are AMAZING at spotting patterns and who are really interested in the tiny details of things. Some practical examples of some of these things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feeding and sleeping in a public places might be very difficult. Hiding away in a dark, quiet room may be the only way to feed the child or to get them to sleep for a nap.<\/li>\n<li>They may be very bright, learning numbers and letters, learning basic reading early on, counting and knowing lots of colours.<\/li>\n<li>Being fussy about food: often rejecting things because they are &#8220;broken&#8221; or wrong in some way, or because they have been contaminated with some other food.<\/li>\n<li>Finding busy public spaces totally over-stimulating: where other kids seem to adapt to that environment or just fall asleep, this kid just can&#8217;t switch off from the noise.<\/li>\n<li>Being both very highly distractable AND, seeming to totally zone out and focus on certain activities to the exclusion of the whole rest of the world.<\/li>\n<li>Having an extreme dislike of certain bits of furniture or a car seat. Being a very difficult traveller. Finding it difficult to be comfortable. Maybe having an extreme preference for or dislike of a particular way of being moved around or carried, be it in a buggy\/stroller, sling, being carried, or wanting to walk and get around under their own steam.<\/li>\n<li>Developing a clever sense of humour, engaging in word-play and abstraction, at quite an early age.<\/li>\n<li>Early potty-training, maybe potty training easily without much encouragement.<\/li>\n<li>Seeming to understand emotions well and how their actions will affect themselves and others.<\/li>\n<li>Being difficult to discipline or &#8216;train&#8217; (e.g. sleep training) with most efforts failing with spectacular, unending tantrums.<\/li>\n<li>Hating dummies and bottles and tooth-brushing and other things that you might put in their mouth or on their body. Again, with violent and outright rejection.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to judge other people&#8217;s children as you don&#8217;t spend all day every day with them, but we had noticed these traits as common things in particular kids<\/p>\n<p>There definitely seemed to be two types of child: those that do lots of the things above, and others that children fall asleep in restaurants, cafes, churches or other busy places. Those who are rarely content, and often bothered or distracted, and those who happily sit in buggies and stare into the distance, ignoring everything around them. Stuff like that.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes we wondered if some of the bothered\/distracted children were somewhere on the autistic scale. But they often had good social skills and other things about them just weren&#8217;t extreme enough.<\/p>\n<p>But it nagged us that some of these children seemed different somehow.<\/p>\n<h2>And me&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s me. I&#8217;m logical, deep-thinking, cautious. I make &#8216;anxious predictions&#8217; about the future, usually based on dwelled-upon past experiences. I worry about what other people think. A LOT!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m an ambivert. I think I&#8217;m mostly an introvert, but I&#8217;ve learned to deal with people quite well. I have a quite analytical approach to being extroverted &#8211; probably based on past experiences &#8211; and when that approach doesn&#8217;t work I get very left out.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a stickler for detail. I notice things that others don&#8217;t and they bother me. Interestingly, I&#8217;m not a very visual person &#8211; it&#8217;s almost a family joke that I don&#8217;t remember people by hair colour! I think this is because there&#8217;s less thinking to be done about visual things. I find people&#8217;s characters more interesting than their appearance.<\/p>\n<p>I &#8216;zone out&#8217; in activities.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m really hesitant to start doing things when I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing. Computers are an exception, but with DIY for example, I overthink everything before starting and it\u00a0makes it hard to get going with things that I&#8217;m not confident in.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a careful driver with high hazard perception. I love escaping to nature. I hate being too hot. I find some materials really cringy &#8211; tights and rough synthetic fabrics bring me out in goose bumps.<\/p>\n<p>I find travel hard. I think because I worry about all the things that could go wrong. Not big things like air crashes, but little things like being stuck in place where no one speaks English.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember much of my childhood, but the things I do remember are things that I know I dwelled on a lot at the time. Minor incidents that I thought over for weeks, and still occasionally think back to: I felt so stupid; why did I do it that way?<\/p>\n<p>I hate, hate, hate being punished or thought badly of. I got detention once at school. Most people just seemed to brush this off, but I was devastated. I think the teacher ended up letting me off as it was my first time ever. But it was massively emotional for me.<\/p>\n<h2>HSP<\/h2>\n<p>These kind of traits, it turns out, are associated with a genetic character trait known under various names, but which I&#8217;ll refer to as &#8220;high sensitivity&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Discovering high sensitivity was one of the biggest &#8220;aha!&#8221; moments of my life.<\/p>\n<p>High sensitivity is present in around 20-25% of people (and a similar percentage in some animals), and it&#8217;s more easy to see in small children &#8211; adults developing coping mechanisms, so it&#8217;s not always as clear. This totally fits with our observations about other children.<\/p>\n<p>Highly sensitive people don&#8217;t get more sensory input, but they do appear to process it more intensely. You can probably see how this results in a lot of the traits mentioned above, but let me give an example that applies to small children: reading. Some kids just breeze through a book. But have you ever come across a child who doesn&#8217;t just let the story go in; who points all all the tiny details in the pictures, and asks questions about crazy-detailed things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>That owl has yellow feet!<\/li>\n<li>What is the owl doing?<\/li>\n<li>What is his name?<\/li>\n<li>Is the grass wet?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Stuff like that. I mean, kids ask these kinds of questions. But with with some it seems almost relentless.<\/p>\n<p>And highly sensitive people think harder about things. That&#8217;s definitely not saying that non-highly-sensitive people always think less; but the highly sensitive person will tend to think things through more. They will more readily make predictions based on previous experiences. They will get more emotional. They will be more cautious and conscientious.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the behaviour of highly sensitive people is explained in terms of reflexes. You can think of people as having a &#8220;go-ahead&#8221; reflex, and a &#8220;hold on&#8221; reflex. In highly sensitive people the &#8220;hold on&#8221; reflex is stronger, causing them to hesitate and think things through. It&#8217;s not that they don&#8217;t have the &#8220;go ahead&#8221; reflex, it&#8217;s just countered or balanced out more. What this can mean is that a highly sensitive person can be more hesitant at first, but once they&#8217;ve decided something is safe or good, they will go at it with great energy and excitement.<\/p>\n<h2>Society and HSP&#8217;s<\/h2>\n<p>Society doesn&#8217;t always value the trait of high sensitivity. This has bothered me, personally, greatly in my life.<\/p>\n<p>Take the travel thing. I&#8217;m a home bird. I like things that are familiar And where I know how they work. Going to places where I don&#8217;t speak the native language, where I don&#8217;t know if the natives will speak my language, and where I don&#8217;t know how things work, freaks me out.<\/p>\n<p>Even really simple things like going to a cafe. Cafes work differently in different parts of the world. Am I supposed to sit down and be served? Or order at the bar? If I order at the bar, will they bring my food over or do I take it with me? Do I pay when I order or before we leave? What if I sit down and they come over to ask what I want and I don&#8217;t understand what they&#8217;re saying and they don&#8217;t speak English and I can&#8217;t point at things on display to show what I want. I&#8217;ll look really stupid and we won&#8217;t be able to get lunch and&#8230;oh&#8230;why are we abroad?!?<\/p>\n<p>From what I can tell, most people just think: &#8220;Ah, well get by!&#8221; and get on with it. But these are genuine things that I think and worry about, and that I dwell on afterwards for hours.<\/p>\n<p>Classic high sensitivity.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also not an explorer. I don&#8217;t care all that much for seeing\/experiencing new things. Though whether that&#8217;s an innate part of me, or simply an it&#8217;s-not-worth-the-hassle response to finding being in new places difficult I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, where was I going with this? Ah yes. Society.<\/p>\n<p>Society thinks I&#8217;m odd because I don&#8217;t like travel.<\/p>\n<p>Seriously: how many people do you know that approach the subject of foreign holidays with dread? Or that would rather stay in the UK? And how many people do you know that think &#8220;It&#8217;s great that that person doesn&#8217;t want to travel. I totally understand their desire to go somewhere familiar and comfortable and not expand their horizons?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s not many. Society doesn&#8217;t think that this is a positive thing. Society sees this as being afraid or xenophobic. My fears are made out to be silly or easy to overcome. But the truth is that every time I push myself and go on a foreign holiday I have a mid-week meltdown and want to go home. Holidays should be restful and easy, not panic-inducing stress-fests!<\/p>\n<p>What else? Shyness is generally seen as bad. &#8216;Adventurous&#8217; is a quality to aspire to, and those who aren&#8217;t are seen as boring. Risk taking is rewarded, while thinking carefully and planning things out is seen as anal or risk-averse. A &#8216;who cares&#8217; attitude generally seems to get you by better in life than worrying about what others will think.<\/p>\n<p>I feel like other people can easily decide to do exciting and adventurous things, whereas I&#8217;m cautious and immediately see things that need fixing before I can do something adventurous, and that, somehow, makes me feel inferior.<\/p>\n<p>And the children?<\/p>\n<p>Well, let&#8217;s take a look at primary schools. I know of modern primary schools that have large year 1 classes that are effectively in a shared space with a pre-school. This means up to about 60 or 70 little people and their carers all occupying the same space. A space which has lots of displays and activities to do. Lots of people potentially engaging in lots of different things at the same time. Lots of noise. Lots of multi-sensory stimuli.<\/p>\n<p>This sounds like a nightmare kind of environment for ME to be in, let alone a 3 year old person with little emotional intelligence and who is likely to be highly stimulated by all this stuff all day long.<\/p>\n<p>Primary Schools, to me, do not seem to cater very well for highly sensitive children. It seems to me like they try to be stimulating learning environments, when that&#8217;s exactly not what the highly sensitive child needs.<\/p>\n<p>Society seems to think that a loud, busy environment is normal and good for children, and that if a child is sat quietly and intently assembling Lego and ignoring the children around him then that is bad.<\/p>\n<p>Then there are children&#8217;s films. Some films, even U rated, are absolutely chock full of scary stuff. &#8216;Finding Nemo&#8217;, for example, is just wall-to-wall mild peril; a series of mini-disaster movies plugged together with an over-arching narrative which is also one of strong emotions and minor catastrophe.<\/p>\n<p>It seems like children are expected to take stories like this in their stride; appreciate the comedy in them; enjoy the ride. But if you&#8217;re three, and you&#8217;re thinking about every detail and you&#8217;re experiencing the music and images more intensely, and you&#8217;re empathising with the characters and worrying about what they might be going through&#8230;then films like these are pretty terrifying.<\/p>\n<p>Generally the world is a loud and busy place and children are expected to just deal with it. Some seem to sail through. But others are distracted by it, intrigued by it, over-stimulated by it, scared by it, or bothered by it.<\/p>\n<p>This is both a huge problem, and a huge opportunity. But the world doesn&#8217;t always seem to see it that way.<\/p>\n<h2>Acceptance and the joy of being highly sensitive<\/h2>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve said, it&#8217;s been a complete revelation to me, understanding why I am like I am, but also understanding why these children we know are like they are too, and some of the ways in which that might help us to help them.<\/p>\n<p>There is a certain amount of acceptance involved. I&#8217;m now much more conscious of highly stimulating environments, and of my need to take time out to recover after being in busy places, or after being stimulated for too long.<\/p>\n<p>Understanding high sensitivity definitely helps in this way, but it also help me to see that other people don&#8217;t experience things in the same way that I do, and that&#8217;s helpful too. That makes me feel less like I&#8217;m shy or silly, and more &#8211; well, more like I&#8217;m just me and that&#8217;s OK.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also help me see the opportunities of being highly sensitive. This trait enables me to be a person that has a high level of attention to detail, which is great in my line of work. And not just visually, but, I think, empathically too. I think hard about the consequences of what I do on other people.<\/p>\n<p>Technical training is a great example. A long time ago now, I was delivering some technical training for a client alongside another, far more senior engineer. I was only actually teaching a few modules but was otherwise there to facilitate and help out during workshops. In a module prior to one that I was to teach, I was really aware that the senior trainer was using some technical language that had not been introduced. I let him complete his module then stepped up to teach my module. The first time I hit the same technical language I put it out there &#8220;Who knows what this means?&#8221; (very few people). &#8220;Who doesn&#8217;t know what this means?&#8221; (almost everyone).<\/p>\n<p>That empathy, that consciousness of what others might be thinking, can be REALLY helpful and I make use of my sensitivity to it a lot when having technical conversations with non-technical people.<\/p>\n<p>It also think it makes me really interested in things. Deep, difficult, interesting, obscure things. I&#8217;ve always said that I&#8217;d like to go back to University to study something weird like Philosophy of Maths; what&#8217;s the history of mathematical concepts, and how do we relate abstract mathematical concepts to real world things. I can look at 5 apples, they are countable. But what does the square root of 5 look like? Why is that useful? This kind of thing intrigues\u00a0me.<\/p>\n<p>I think the trait makes me a grammar pedant. Which is a good thing. It&#8217;s a good thing to know the difference between &#8220;knowing your shit&#8221; and &#8220;knowing you&#8217;re shit&#8221;, right?<\/p>\n<p>With highly sensitive children, they may be natural spotter of patterns; remarkable with numbers and letters; reading far above their age level.<\/p>\n<h2>What does all this mean?<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve written this because I want people to understand other people who may be highly sensitive.<\/p>\n<p>I want people to know that a child walking into a busy room might find it difficult and need time to adjust &#8211; and then some time out later.<\/p>\n<p>I want people to know that people who seem shy or quiet might be really struggling.<\/p>\n<p>I want people to know that being outgoing and outrageous and carefree aren&#8217;t the only &#8220;good&#8221; ways to be. Quiet, thoughtful, sensitive people are important in our world too and we should seek to understand them, value them, and nurture them.<\/p>\n<p>As I said earlier, discovering high-sensitivity has been a revelation to me and to my immediate family. It explains so much about me and about some of these children that we have observed, and it gives us some tools and strategies for accepting ourselves and each other, and for understanding each other too.<\/p>\n<p>This has been long, but I hope it has been useful. If any of it resonates, I recommend looking up <a href=\"http:\/\/hsperson.com\/\">Elaine Aron and her research and books<\/a> or do a Google Search to find out more by reading useful articles like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2014\/02\/26\/highly-sensitive-people-signs-habits_n_4810794.html\">this<\/a>, or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.parents.com\/toddlers-preschoolers\/development\/behavioral\/how-to-help-your-sensitive-child\/\">this<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps it will be a revelation to you too?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;m nervous about writing this, mostly because it contains some stuff that&#8217;s about my own personality traits. But it&#8217;s been such a revelation to us that I have to share it.<\/p>\n<p>This post is an explanation of a character trait that we (are very glad we) found out about. It&#8217;s a summary of our own learnings and experiences. It will duplicate some things that you can read much more polished and detailed accounts of elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever felt different, shy, like you understand some things that other people don&#8217;t, or that you dwell on things deeply and thoughtfully &#8211; or if you have a bright and curious small child that seems to be highly attentive and sensitive, and WON&#8217;T SLEEP &#8211; then this may be worth reading. It may be a complete revelation!<\/p>\n<h2>Highly sensitive small people<\/h2>\n<p>As we and our friends reached the having-children stage of life, we started noticing a trait in some of the small children. Children who are highly attentive even from an early age. Children who seem to have extreme emotions. Children who are awful sleepers. Children who are AMAZING at spotting patterns and who are really interested in the tiny details of things. Some practical examples of some of these things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feeding and sleeping in a public places might be very difficult. Hiding away in a dark, quiet room may be the only way to feed the child or to get them to sleep for a nap.<\/li>\n<li>They may be very bright, learning numbers and letters, learning basic reading early on, counting and knowing lots of colours.<\/li>\n<li>Being fussy about food: often rejecting things because they are &#8220;broken&#8221; or wrong in some way, or because they have been contaminated with some other food.<\/li>\n<li>Finding busy public spaces totally over-stimulating: where other kids seem to adapt to that environment or just fall asleep, this kid just can&#8217;t switch off from the noise.<\/li>\n<li>Being both very highly distractable AND, seeming to totally zone out and focus on certain activities to the exclusion of the whole rest of the world.<\/li>\n<li>Having an extreme dislike of certain bits of furniture or a car seat. Being a very difficult traveller. Finding it difficult to be comfortable. Maybe having an extreme preference for or dislike of a particular way of being moved around or carried, be it in a buggy\/stroller, sling, being carried, or wanting to walk and get around under their own steam.<\/li>\n<li>Developing a clever sense of humour, engaging in word-play and abstraction, at quite an early age.<\/li>\n<li>Early potty-training, maybe potty training easily without much encouragement.<\/li>\n<li>Seeming to understand emotions well and how their actions will affect themselves and others.<\/li>\n<li>Being difficult to discipline or &#8216;train&#8217; (e.g. sleep training) with most efforts failing with spectacular, unending tantrums.<\/li>\n<li>Hating dummies and bottles and tooth-brushing and other things that you might put in their mouth or on their body. Again, with violent and outright rejection.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to judge other people&#8217;s children as you don&#8217;t spend all day every day with them, but we had noticed these traits as common things in particular kids<\/p>\n<p>There definitely seemed to be two types of child: those that do lots of the things above, and others that children fall asleep in restaurants, cafes, churches or other busy places. Those who are rarely content, and often bothered or distracted, and those who happily sit in buggies and stare into the distance, ignoring everything around them. Stuff like that.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes we wondered if some of the bothered\/distracted children were somewhere on the autistic scale. But they often had good social skills and other things about them just weren&#8217;t extreme enough.<\/p>\n<p>But it nagged us that some of these children seemed different somehow.<\/p>\n<h2>And me&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s me. I&#8217;m logical, deep-thinking, cautious. I make &#8216;anxious predictions&#8217; about the future, usually based on dwelled-upon past experiences. I worry about what other people think. A LOT!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m an ambivert. I think I&#8217;m mostly an introvert, but I&#8217;ve learned to deal with people quite well. I have a quite analytical approach to being extroverted &#8211; probably based on past experiences &#8211; and when that approach doesn&#8217;t work I get very left out.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a stickler for detail. I notice things that others don&#8217;t and they bother me. Interestingly, I&#8217;m not a very visual person &#8211; it&#8217;s almost a family joke that I don&#8217;t remember people by hair colour! I think this is because there&#8217;s less thinking to be done about visual things. I find people&#8217;s characters more interesting than their appearance.<\/p>\n<p>I &#8216;zone out&#8217; in activities.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m really hesitant to start doing things when I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing. Computers are an exception, but with DIY for example, I overthink everything before starting and it\u00a0makes it hard to get going with things that I&#8217;m not confident in.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a careful driver with high hazard perception. I love escaping to nature. I hate being too hot. I find some materials really cringy &#8211; tights and rough synthetic fabrics bring me out in goose bumps.<\/p>\n<p>I find travel hard. I think because I worry about all the things that could go wrong. Not big things like air crashes, but little things like being stuck in place where no one speaks English.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember much of my childhood, but the things I do remember are things that I know I dwelled on a lot at the time. Minor incidents that I thought over for weeks, and still occasionally think back to: I felt so stupid; why did I do it that way?<\/p>\n<p>I hate, hate, hate being punished or thought badly of. I got detention once at school. Most people just seemed to brush this off, but I was devastated. I think the teacher ended up letting me off as it was my first time ever. But it was massively emotional for me.<\/p>\n<h2>HSP<\/h2>\n<p>These kind of traits, it turns out, are associated with a genetic character trait known under various names, but which I&#8217;ll refer to as &#8220;high sensitivity&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Discovering high sensitivity was one of the biggest &#8220;aha!&#8221; moments of my life.<\/p>\n<p>High sensitivity is present in around 20-25% of people (and a similar percentage in some animals), and it&#8217;s more easy to see in small children &#8211; adults developing coping mechanisms, so it&#8217;s not always as clear. This totally fits with our observations about other children.<\/p>\n<p>Highly sensitive people don&#8217;t get more sensory input, but they do appear to process it more intensely. You can probably see how this results in a lot of the traits mentioned above, but let me give an example that applies to small children: reading. Some kids just breeze through a book. But have you ever come across a child who doesn&#8217;t just let the story go in; who points all all the tiny details in the pictures, and asks questions about crazy-detailed things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>That owl has yellow feet!<\/li>\n<li>What is the owl doing?<\/li>\n<li>What is his name?<\/li>\n<li>Is the grass wet?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Stuff like that. I mean, kids ask these kinds of questions. But with with some it seems almost relentless.<\/p>\n<p>And highly sensitive people think harder about things. That&#8217;s definitely not saying that non-highly-sensitive people always think less; but the highly sensitive person will tend to think things through more. They will more readily make predictions based on previous experiences. They will get more emotional. They will be more cautious and conscientious.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the behaviour of highly sensitive people is explained in terms of reflexes. You can think of people as having a &#8220;go-ahead&#8221; reflex, and a &#8220;hold on&#8221; reflex. In highly sensitive people the &#8220;hold on&#8221; reflex is stronger, causing them to hesitate and think things through. It&#8217;s not that they don&#8217;t have the &#8220;go ahead&#8221; reflex, it&#8217;s just countered or balanced out more. What this can mean is that a highly sensitive person can be more hesitant at first, but once they&#8217;ve decided something is safe or good, they will go at it with great energy and excitement.<\/p>\n<h2>Society and HSP&#8217;s<\/h2>\n<p>Society doesn&#8217;t always value the trait of high sensitivity. This has bothered me, personally, greatly in my life.<\/p>\n<p>Take the travel thing. I&#8217;m a home bird. I like things that are familiar And where I know how they work. Going to places where I don&#8217;t speak the native language, where I don&#8217;t know if the natives will speak my language, and where I don&#8217;t know how things work, freaks me out.<\/p>\n<p>Even really simple things like going to a cafe. Cafes work differently in different parts of the world. Am I supposed to sit down and be served? Or order at the bar? If I order at the bar, will they bring my food over or do I take it with me? Do I pay when I order or before we leave? What if I sit down and they come over to ask what I want and I don&#8217;t understand what they&#8217;re saying and they don&#8217;t speak English and I can&#8217;t point at things on display to show what I want. I&#8217;ll look really stupid and we won&#8217;t be able to get lunch and&#8230;oh&#8230;why are we abroad?!?<\/p>\n<p>From what I can tell, most people just think: &#8220;Ah, well get by!&#8221; and get on with it. But these are genuine things that I think and worry about, and that I dwell on afterwards for hours.<\/p>\n<p>Classic high sensitivity.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also not an explorer. I don&#8217;t care all that much for seeing\/experiencing new things. Though whether that&#8217;s an innate part of me, or simply an it&#8217;s-not-worth-the-hassle response to finding being in new places difficult I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, where was I going with this? Ah yes. Society.<\/p>\n<p>Society thinks I&#8217;m odd because I don&#8217;t like travel.<\/p>\n<p>Seriously: how many people do you know that approach the subject of foreign holidays with dread? Or that would rather stay in the UK? And how many people do you know that think &#8220;It&#8217;s great that that person doesn&#8217;t want to travel. I totally understand their desire to go somewhere familiar and comfortable and not expand their horizons?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s not many. Society doesn&#8217;t think that this is a positive thing. Society sees this as being afraid or xenophobic. My fears are made out to be silly or easy to overcome. But the truth is that every time I push myself and go on a foreign holiday I have a mid-week meltdown and want to go home. Holidays should be restful and easy, not panic-inducing stress-fests!<\/p>\n<p>What else? Shyness is generally seen as bad. &#8216;Adventurous&#8217; is a quality to aspire to, and those who aren&#8217;t are seen as boring. Risk taking is rewarded, while thinking carefully and planning things out is seen as anal or risk-averse. A &#8216;who cares&#8217; attitude generally seems to get you by better in life than worrying about what others will think.<\/p>\n<p>I feel like other people can easily decide to do exciting and adventurous things, whereas I&#8217;m cautious and immediately see things that need fixing before I can do something adventurous, and that, somehow, makes me feel inferior.<\/p>\n<p>And the children?<\/p>\n<p>Well, let&#8217;s take a look at primary schools. I know of modern primary schools that have large year 1 classes that are effectively in a shared space with a pre-school. This means up to about 60 or 70 little people and their carers all occupying the same space. A space which has lots of displays and activities to do. Lots of people potentially engaging in lots of different things at the same time. Lots of noise. Lots of multi-sensory stimuli.<\/p>\n<p>This sounds like a nightmare kind of environment for ME to be in, let alone a 3 year old person with little emotional intelligence and who is likely to be highly stimulated by all this stuff all day long.<\/p>\n<p>Primary Schools, to me, do not seem to cater very well for highly sensitive children. It seems to me like they try to be stimulating learning environments, when that&#8217;s exactly not what the highly sensitive child needs.<\/p>\n<p>Society seems to think that a loud, busy environment is normal and good for children, and that if a child is sat quietly and intently assembling Lego and ignoring the children around him then that is bad.<\/p>\n<p>Then there are children&#8217;s films. Some films, even U rated, are absolutely chock full of scary stuff. &#8216;Finding Nemo&#8217;, for example, is just wall-to-wall mild peril; a series of mini-disaster movies plugged together with an over-arching narrative which is also one of strong emotions and minor catastrophe.<\/p>\n<p>It seems like children are expected to take stories like this in their stride; appreciate the comedy in them; enjoy the ride. But if you&#8217;re three, and you&#8217;re thinking about every detail and you&#8217;re experiencing the music and images more intensely, and you&#8217;re empathising with the characters and worrying about what they might be going through&#8230;then films like these are pretty terrifying.<\/p>\n<p>Generally the world is a loud and busy place and children are expected to just deal with it. Some seem to sail through. But others are distracted by it, intrigued by it, over-stimulated by it, scared by it, or bothered by it.<\/p>\n<p>This is both a huge problem, and a huge opportunity. But the world doesn&#8217;t always seem to see it that way.<\/p>\n<h2>Acceptance and the joy of being highly sensitive<\/h2>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve said, it&#8217;s been a complete revelation to me, understanding why I am like I am, but also understanding why these children we know are like they are too, and some of the ways in which that might help us to help them.<\/p>\n<p>There is a certain amount of acceptance involved. I&#8217;m now much more conscious of highly stimulating environments, and of my need to take time out to recover after being in busy places, or after being stimulated for too long.<\/p>\n<p>Understanding high sensitivity definitely helps in this way, but it also help me to see that other people don&#8217;t experience things in the same way that I do, and that&#8217;s helpful too. That makes me feel less like I&#8217;m shy or silly, and more &#8211; well, more like I&#8217;m just me and that&#8217;s OK.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also help me see the opportunities of being highly sensitive. This trait enables me to be a person that has a high level of attention to detail, which is great in my line of work. And not just visually, but, I think, empathically too. I think hard about the consequences of what I do on other people.<\/p>\n<p>Technical training is a great example. A long time ago now, I was delivering some technical training for a client alongside another, far more senior engineer. I was only actually teaching a few modules but was otherwise there to facilitate and help out during workshops. In a module prior to one that I was to teach, I was really aware that the senior trainer was using some technical language that had not been introduced. I let him complete his module then stepped up to teach my module. The first time I hit the same technical language I put it out there &#8220;Who knows what this means?&#8221; (very few people). &#8220;Who doesn&#8217;t know what this means?&#8221; (almost everyone).<\/p>\n<p>That empathy, that consciousness of what others might be thinking, can be REALLY helpful and I make use of my sensitivity to it a lot when having technical conversations with non-technical people.<\/p>\n<p>It also think it makes me really interested in things. Deep, difficult, interesting, obscure things. I&#8217;ve always said that I&#8217;d like to go back to University to study something weird like Philosophy of Maths; what&#8217;s the history of mathematical concepts, and how do we relate abstract mathematical concepts to real world things. I can look at 5 apples, they are countable. But what does the square root of 5 look like? Why is that useful? This kind of thing intrigues\u00a0me.<\/p>\n<p>I think the trait makes me a grammar pedant. Which is a good thing. It&#8217;s a good thing to know the difference between &#8220;knowing your shit&#8221; and &#8220;knowing you&#8217;re shit&#8221;, right?<\/p>\n<p>With highly sensitive children, they may be natural spotter of patterns; remarkable with numbers and letters; reading far above their age level.<\/p>\n<h2>What does all this mean?<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve written this because I want people to understand other people who may be highly sensitive.<\/p>\n<p>I want people to know that a child walking into a busy room might find it difficult and need time to adjust &#8211; and then some time out later.<\/p>\n<p>I want people to know that people who seem shy or quiet might be really struggling.<\/p>\n<p>I want people to know that being outgoing and outrageous and carefree aren&#8217;t the only &#8220;good&#8221; ways to be. Quiet, thoughtful, sensitive people are important in our world too and we should seek to understand them, value them, and nurture them.<\/p>\n<p>As I said earlier, discovering high-sensitivity has been a revelation to me and to my immediate family. It explains so much about me and about some of these children that we have observed, and it gives us some tools and strategies for accepting ourselves and each other, and for understanding each other too.<\/p>\n<p>This has been long, but I hope it has been useful. If any of it resonates, I recommend looking up <a href=\"http:\/\/hsperson.com\/\">Elaine Aron and her research and books<\/a> or do a Google Search to find out more by reading useful articles like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2014\/02\/26\/highly-sensitive-people-signs-habits_n_4810794.html\">this<\/a>, or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.parents.com\/toddlers-preschoolers\/development\/behavioral\/how-to-help-your-sensitive-child\/\">this<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps it will be a revelation to you too?<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>I feel bad about writing this. And I&#8217;m not quite sure it&#8217;s ready to publish. And I&#8217;m not entirely sure that it&#8217;s an accurate representation of the thoughts in my head. But here goes.<\/p>\n<h2>Before we begin<\/h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of difficult conversations going on about WordPress in the last few months and it&#8217;s got quite hurtful and personal at times. So I&#8217;d like to begin by saying that I LIKE the WordPress project and community. It has an amazing bunch\u00a0of people building it, and building stuff using it. I&#8217;m a part of that community and it&#8217;s benefitted me hugely, and I hope that I&#8217;ve given back where I can and where it&#8217;s been appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>And I really want to say that, though this post is influenced by lots of individuals and lots of smaller conversations, it&#8217;s attempting to sum up what appears to me to be a higher-level problem. I don&#8217;t begrudge anyone anything, and I have the utmost respect for all of my peers in the community. This is definitely not personal.<\/p>\n<p>But these are my thoughts, and I feel it&#8217;s right to attempt to record and publish them at this time.<\/p>\n<h2>Concern<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m concerned about the future of WordPress &#8211; the open source content management system. I&#8217;m concerned that it&#8217;s failing in its mission to &#8220;Democratise publishing&#8221;. I&#8217;m concerned that it&#8217;s now too complex and, possibly, too popular. And I&#8217;m concerned that money is starting to influence its development more and more and that this is reducing the project&#8217;s open-ness.<\/p>\n<h2>WordPress.com and Commercialisation<\/h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of stuff going on in the WordPress community of late that has been pretty big and interesting news. Two that spring to mind are the Automattic acquisition of WooThemes and the big discussion about whether or not the menu admin should move into the customizer (sic) or not.<\/p>\n<p>(At this point, if I&#8217;ve lost you or you don&#8217;t know what these things are, then you&#8217;re reading the wrong blog post and should probably head off elsewhere. Sorry about that!)<\/p>\n<p>So, here&#8217;s some things I get:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a very large part of WordPress&#8217;s success is down to Automattic &#8211; without Automattic&#8217;s backing we wouldn&#8217;t have a lot of the infrastructure that powers things like downloads, trac, make.wordpress.org, the plugin and theme repositories, and auto-updates, plus lots of developer and support resources.<\/li>\n<li>Automattic are a business. They have investors. They need to turn a profit.<\/li>\n<li>Automattic are a business tha operates in the CMS space, and they have competition from CMS companies like Squarespace and Wix, and commercial SAAS eCommerce systems like Shopify.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Therefore, Automattic MUST be in the business of making WordPress a piece of software that competes with those other systems.<\/p>\n<p>The acquisition of WooThemes and their WooCommerce eCommerce platform looked, to me, like a strategic move to help WordPress.com have an eCommerce feature that could compete with Shopify and the like.<\/p>\n<p>And the continual movement of features into the customizer seems to be an attempt to make WordPress&#8217;s user experience more like the visual builders that you get with other content managment systems like SquareSpace.<\/p>\n<p>WordPress&#8217;s continual drive for greater market share is an imperative for Automattic. And Automattic need to build a competetive product for this to happen.<\/p>\n<p>But what does this mean for the WordPress community outside of Automattic?<\/p>\n<h2>Open Source and Community<\/h2>\n<p>WordPress is open source software. This is one of it&#8217;s great selling points. And it has an amazing, global community of ordinary, non-Automattic people who contribute to it and support it. This is another of its great selling points.<\/p>\n<p>But I fear for these things.<\/p>\n<p>I fear that the community&#8217;s voice isn&#8217;t being heard. I fear that WordPress&#8217;s goal of &#8220;democratizing publishing&#8221; is at risk as it becomes increasingly commercialised.<\/p>\n<p>I also listen to a few WordPress-themed podcasts (doing so has definitely inspired and informed this post), and I&#8217;m part of some in-depth developer and business communities, and there is so much talk on them these days about how to turn free and open source tools into closed, commercial tools.<\/p>\n<p>There is talk of mergers and acquisitions being a good sign that WordPress is maturing.<\/p>\n<p>I even heard someone say, regarding themes that they develop, words to the effect of &#8220;Hell, no, I don&#8217;t give stuff I develop away for free; I want to make as much money as possible out of it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Wait, wait, just wait a second&#8230;.<\/h2>\n<p>This makes me real sad.<\/p>\n<p>Again, don&#8217;t get me wrong. I think it&#8217;s amazing that WordPress is a freely available, freely customisable tool that people can use to make a living from. Even I do that. I&#8217;m massively grateful for it.<\/p>\n<p>And I get that supporting an open source tool with thousands of users is nigh-on impossible if you don&#8217;t make any money from it. It ends up being a drain.<\/p>\n<p>But are we not beginning to bury all of the open source goodness and community?<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s one main reason I don&#8217;t recommend people use SAAS CMS&#8217;s like Wix: they appear to be cheap on the face of it, but they suck you in with a minimal set of features and then charge you high costs for adding stuff that probably knew you&#8217;d need from the start but they didn&#8217;t give you because they know they need to make money.<\/p>\n<p>Is WordPress not headed down this same road? I feel like, yeah, WordPress is &#8220;free&#8221;, but the minute you want to start doing anything sophisticated with it you have to buy &#8220;pro&#8221; this and &#8220;premium&#8221; that.<\/p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t get me wrong (or: Keep Using WordPress!!)<\/h2>\n<p>Again, don&#8217;t get me wrong. Really, don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not about to stop using WordPress or developing with and for it. I don&#8217;t think anything drastic is about to happen in the near future. It powers 23% of the web and has by far the largest share of CMS usage and it continues to have the best balance (in my opinion) of usability and extensibility.<\/p>\n<p>In the last few days, I&#8217;ve even started to have my eyes opened to all the amazingness that is actually built into WordPress: it&#8217;s actually a really good publishing platform!<\/p>\n<p>And I don&#8217;t hold it against the people that put time into developing these new features and making WordPress more competetive. This is a really good thing.<\/p>\n<p>And I should also add that Automattic is a great company with a mission that I wholly support, and the WordPress community are great bunch of dedicated, friendly, clever people that I&#8217;m proud to be a part of.<\/p>\n<p>I just think I see a gradual erosion of open-ness around WordPress and that concerns me.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think? If you read this far you&#8217;re probably interested and have an opinion. Have I got it all wrong? Is commercialisation of WordPress the best thing since admin colour schemes? Or are you also worried about the continual drive to see WordPress as something to get money out of rather than something to use to make the world better and something to contribute to.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I feel bad about writing this. And I&#8217;m not quite sure it&#8217;s ready to publish. And I&#8217;m not entirely sure that it&#8217;s an accurate representation of the thoughts in my head. But here goes.<\/p>\n<h2>Before we begin<\/h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of difficult conversations going on about WordPress in the last few months and it&#8217;s got quite hurtful and personal at times. So I&#8217;d like to begin by saying that I LIKE the WordPress project and community. It has an amazing bunch\u00a0of people building it, and building stuff using it. I&#8217;m a part of that community and it&#8217;s benefitted me hugely, and I hope that I&#8217;ve given back where I can and where it&#8217;s been appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>And I really want to say that, though this post is influenced by lots of individuals and lots of smaller conversations, it&#8217;s attempting to sum up what appears to me to be a higher-level problem. I don&#8217;t begrudge anyone anything, and I have the utmost respect for all of my peers in the community. This is definitely not personal.<\/p>\n<p>But these are my thoughts, and I feel it&#8217;s right to attempt to record and publish them at this time.<\/p>\n<h2>Concern<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m concerned about the future of WordPress &#8211; the open source content management system. I&#8217;m concerned that it&#8217;s failing in its mission to &#8220;Democratise publishing&#8221;. I&#8217;m concerned that it&#8217;s now too complex and, possibly, too popular. And I&#8217;m concerned that money is starting to influence its development more and more and that this is reducing the project&#8217;s open-ness.<\/p>\n<h2>WordPress.com and Commercialisation<\/h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of stuff going on in the WordPress community of late that has been pretty big and interesting news. Two that spring to mind are the Automattic acquisition of WooThemes and the big discussion about whether or not the menu admin should move into the customizer (sic) or not.<\/p>\n<p>(At this point, if I&#8217;ve lost you or you don&#8217;t know what these things are, then you&#8217;re reading the wrong blog post and should probably head off elsewhere. Sorry about that!)<\/p>\n<p>So, here&#8217;s some things I get:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a very large part of WordPress&#8217;s success is down to Automattic &#8211; without Automattic&#8217;s backing we wouldn&#8217;t have a lot of the infrastructure that powers things like downloads, trac, make.wordpress.org, the plugin and theme repositories, and auto-updates, plus lots of developer and support resources.<\/li>\n<li>Automattic are a business. They have investors. They need to turn a profit.<\/li>\n<li>Automattic are a business tha operates in the CMS space, and they have competition from CMS companies like Squarespace and Wix, and commercial SAAS eCommerce systems like Shopify.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Therefore, Automattic MUST be in the business of making WordPress a piece of software that competes with those other systems.<\/p>\n<p>The acquisition of WooThemes and their WooCommerce eCommerce platform looked, to me, like a strategic move to help WordPress.com have an eCommerce feature that could compete with Shopify and the like.<\/p>\n<p>And the continual movement of features into the customizer seems to be an attempt to make WordPress&#8217;s user experience more like the visual builders that you get with other content managment systems like SquareSpace.<\/p>\n<p>WordPress&#8217;s continual drive for greater market share is an imperative for Automattic. And Automattic need to build a competetive product for this to happen.<\/p>\n<p>But what does this mean for the WordPress community outside of Automattic?<\/p>\n<h2>Open Source and Community<\/h2>\n<p>WordPress is open source software. This is one of it&#8217;s great selling points. And it has an amazing, global community of ordinary, non-Automattic people who contribute to it and support it. This is another of its great selling points.<\/p>\n<p>But I fear for these things.<\/p>\n<p>I fear that the community&#8217;s voice isn&#8217;t being heard. I fear that WordPress&#8217;s goal of &#8220;democratizing publishing&#8221; is at risk as it becomes increasingly commercialised.<\/p>\n<p>I also listen to a few WordPress-themed podcasts (doing so has definitely inspired and informed this post), and I&#8217;m part of some in-depth developer and business communities, and there is so much talk on them these days about how to turn free and open source tools into closed, commercial tools.<\/p>\n<p>There is talk of mergers and acquisitions being a good sign that WordPress is maturing.<\/p>\n<p>I even heard someone say, regarding themes that they develop, words to the effect of &#8220;Hell, no, I don&#8217;t give stuff I develop away for free; I want to make as much money as possible out of it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Wait, wait, just wait a second&#8230;.<\/h2>\n<p>This makes me real sad.<\/p>\n<p>Again, don&#8217;t get me wrong. I think it&#8217;s amazing that WordPress is a freely available, freely customisable tool that people can use to make a living from. Even I do that. I&#8217;m massively grateful for it.<\/p>\n<p>And I get that supporting an open source tool with thousands of users is nigh-on impossible if you don&#8217;t make any money from it. It ends up being a drain.<\/p>\n<p>But are we not beginning to bury all of the open source goodness and community?<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s one main reason I don&#8217;t recommend people use SAAS CMS&#8217;s like Wix: they appear to be cheap on the face of it, but they suck you in with a minimal set of features and then charge you high costs for adding stuff that probably knew you&#8217;d need from the start but they didn&#8217;t give you because they know they need to make money.<\/p>\n<p>Is WordPress not headed down this same road? I feel like, yeah, WordPress is &#8220;free&#8221;, but the minute you want to start doing anything sophisticated with it you have to buy &#8220;pro&#8221; this and &#8220;premium&#8221; that.<\/p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t get me wrong (or: Keep Using WordPress!!)<\/h2>\n<p>Again, don&#8217;t get me wrong. Really, don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not about to stop using WordPress or developing with and for it. I don&#8217;t think anything drastic is about to happen in the near future. It powers 23% of the web and has by far the largest share of CMS usage and it continues to have the best balance (in my opinion) of usability and extensibility.<\/p>\n<p>In the last few days, I&#8217;ve even started to have my eyes opened to all the amazingness that is actually built into WordPress: it&#8217;s actually a really good publishing platform!<\/p>\n<p>And I don&#8217;t hold it against the people that put time into developing these new features and making WordPress more competetive. This is a really good thing.<\/p>\n<p>And I should also add that Automattic is a great company with a mission that I wholly support, and the WordPress community are great bunch of dedicated, friendly, clever people that I&#8217;m proud to be a part of.<\/p>\n<p>I just think I see a gradual erosion of open-ness around WordPress and that concerns me.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think? If you read this far you&#8217;re probably interested and have an opinion. Have I got it all wrong? Is commercialisation of WordPress the best thing since admin colour schemes? Or are you also worried about the continual drive to see WordPress as something to get money out of rather than something to use to make the world better and something to contribute to.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>Oh my. You know what? Raising a child sometimes requires a bit of re-programming of your brain. Inquisitive pre-schoolers cause you to re-evaluate so many of your rules and routines. Things that you&#8217;ve known or done for years, that are programmed into muscle memory or &#8230; whatever the mental equivalent of muscle memory is &#8230; are suddenly questioned at every turn. Things that were sure are dismantled and torn apart. Things that were good and true are suddenly uncertain and relative.<\/p>\n<p>This is happening a lot at the moment, and I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s me or the young explorer we&#8217;ve raised.<\/p>\n<p>Raising a child\u00a0<strong>could<\/strong> be really simple. I could just say &#8220;Don&#8217;t do that&#8221; and be done with it.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m trying to be sensitive and allow my child to explore the world and find out some things for himself, while also not imposing upon him the baggage that I&#8217;ve acquired through many years of adult-hood.<\/p>\n<p>And all while making sure that there are some boundaries, that he&#8217;s safe, and that adults are respected.<\/p>\n<p>And sometimes, just sometimes, I want to enter into that child-like inquisitiveness with him, abandon my own rules and see things with open eyes.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s exhausting!<\/p>\n<p>And so it is that a simple activity, like trying to plug a hose into a water butt, turns into a mind-bending philosophical monologue where you often end up questioning everything you&#8217;ve ever learned and wondering if you child will one day get horrifically injured in some stupid accident involving a wooden spoon, a bowl of dry rice and a tea towel or something.<\/p>\n<p>Before I write this down, it&#8217;s worth noting that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>this is but one minor example of stuff that happens all day long at the moment;<\/li>\n<li>it&#8217;s probably related to something called &#8220;high sensitivity&#8221; which I&#8217;m in the process of writing a blog post about; and<\/li>\n<li>yes, Isaac has seen me plugging a hose into a water butt in the past, so he is only copying something that I do sometimes when watering the garden.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So it goes something like this:<\/p>\n<p>Me: &#8220;Please don&#8217;t play with the hose&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>My Brain: &#8220;Why can&#8217;t he play with the hose&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Me (to my brain): &#8220;Err, well, I don&#8217;t want him to because it doesn&#8217;t really work as a watering-the-garden method, and the water butt isn&#8217;t very full and I don&#8217;t want to waste the water, and he&#8217;ll get wet which will mean I need to change his clothes before tea and he can&#8217;t just play with anything because some things aren&#8217;t toys and he needs to learn that some things are for doing jobs and some things are for playing with and&#8230;look there isn&#8217;t really any one good stand-out reason that I can explain succinctly in a small enough number of words that he won&#8217;t get bored and distracted half way through the sentence, I&#8217;d just rather he didn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>My Brain: &#8220;But he&#8217;s just exploring and experimenting, he&#8217;s not doing anyone or himself and harm, and what&#8217;s a little bit of water between friends?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Isaac (pipes up): &#8220;Why?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Me (gently, to Isaac, not my brain): &#8220;What do you want to play with the hose for?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>My brain: &#8220;Because it&#8217;s interesting and he&#8217;s seen you doing it and he wants to be like you, which is kinda cute, right?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Isaac: &#8220;I want to fill it up&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Me: &#8220;Why do you want to fill it up?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Isaac: &#8220;So I can squirt it&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>My brain: &#8220;You have to admit, he&#8217;s got some ambition and his problem-solving logic is good?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Me (to both): &#8220;Look&#8230;I&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Me (to myself): &#8220;OK&#8230;OK&#8230;what&#8217;s the worst that can happen? He&#8217;ll get a little wet? He&#8217;ll learn that plugging the hose into the water butt doesn&#8217;t really do anything and certainly won&#8217;t &#8216;squirt&#8217;. But more importantly, he&#8217;ll think he can do anything he likes with things in the garden which is really dangerous. Neither my brain nor Isaac is gonna respond well to a straight don&#8217;t-do-it so I need to get creative. Man&#8230;I&#8217;m so tired right now and I&#8217;ve had 74 internal monologues like this today, I don&#8217;t think I can take any more. OK&#8230;here&#8217;s the plan. Distraction. Err. OK. \u00a0Go&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Me (to Isaac): &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you play in the sand pit?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Isaac: &#8220;But I want to squirt the hose!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Me: &#8220;You can have fun in the sand pit. You love the sand pit. Look, here&#8217;s your digger.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>(Isaac puts the hose down and takes his shorts <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">and pants<\/span> off)<\/p>\n<p>Me (to myself): &#8220;Oh crikey, he&#8217;ll get sand up his bum and in his willy&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Me: &#8220;Isaac, please put your pants back on&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Isaac: &#8220;But&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>My brain: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Me: &#8220;Don&#8217;t&#8230;just DON&#8217;T!!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>My brain: &#8220;Make it 75&#8221;<\/p>\n",

Things that you&#8217;ve known or done for years, that are programmed into muscle memory or &#8230; whatever the mental equivalent of muscle memory is &#8230; are suddenly questioned at every turn. Things that were sure are dismantled and torn apart. Things that were good and true are suddenly uncertain and relative.<\/p>\n<p>This is happening a lot at the moment, and I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s me or the young explorer we&#8217;ve raised.<\/p>\n<p>Raising a child\u00a0<strong>could<\/strong> be really simple. I could just say &#8220;Don&#8217;t do that&#8221; and be done with it.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m trying to be sensitive and allow my child to explore the world and find out some things for himself, while also not imposing upon him the baggage that I&#8217;ve acquired through many years of adult-hood.<\/p>\n<p>And all while making sure that there are some boundaries, that he&#8217;s safe, and that adults are respected.<\/p>\n<p>And sometimes, just sometimes, I want to enter into that child-like inquisitiveness with him, abandon my own rules and see things with open eyes.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s exhausting!<\/p>\n<p>And so it is that a simple activity, like trying to plug a hose into a water butt, turns into a mind-bending philosophical monologue where you often end up questioning everything you&#8217;ve ever learned and wondering if you child will one day get horrifically injured in some stupid accident involving a wooden spoon, a bowl of dry rice and a tea towel or something.<\/p>\n<p>Before I write this down, it&#8217;s worth noting that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>this is but one minor example of stuff that happens all day long at the moment;<\/li>\n<li>it&#8217;s probably related to something called &#8220;high sensitivity&#8221; which I&#8217;m in the process of writing a blog post about; and<\/li>\n<li>yes, Isaac has seen me plugging a hose into a water butt in the past, so he is only copying something that I do sometimes when watering the garden.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So it goes something like this:<\/p>\n<p>Me: &#8220;Please don&#8217;t play with the hose&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>My Brain: &#8220;Why can&#8217;t he play with the hose&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Me (to my brain): &#8220;Err, well, I don&#8217;t want him to because it doesn&#8217;t really work as a watering-the-garden method, and the water butt isn&#8217;t very full and I don&#8217;t want to waste the water, and he&#8217;ll get wet which will mean I need to change his clothes before tea and he can&#8217;t just play with anything because some things aren&#8217;t toys and he needs to learn that some things are for doing jobs and some things are for playing with and&#8230;look there isn&#8217;t really any one good stand-out reason that I can explain succinctly in a small enough number of words that he won&#8217;t get bored and distracted half way through the sentence, I&#8217;d just rather he didn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>My Brain: &#8220;But he&#8217;s just exploring and experimenting, he&#8217;s not doing anyone or himself and harm, and what&#8217;s a little bit of water between friends?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Isaac (pipes up): &#8220;Why?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Me (gently, to Isaac, not my brain): &#8220;What do you want to play with the hose for?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>My brain: &#8220;Because it&#8217;s interesting and he&#8217;s seen you doing it and he wants to be like you, which is kinda cute, right?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Isaac: &#8220;I want to fill it up&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Me: &#8220;Why do you want to fill it up?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Isaac: &#8220;So I can squirt it&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>My brain: &#8220;You have to admit, he&#8217;s got some ambition and his problem-solving logic is good?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Me (to both): &#8220;Look&#8230;I&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Me (to myself): &#8220;OK&#8230;OK&#8230;what&#8217;s the worst that can happen? He&#8217;ll get a little wet? He&#8217;ll learn that plugging the hose into the water butt doesn&#8217;t really do anything and certainly won&#8217;t &#8216;squirt&#8217;. But more importantly, he&#8217;ll think he can do anything he likes with things in the garden which is really dangerous. Neither my brain nor Isaac is gonna respond well to a straight don&#8217;t-do-it so I need to get creative. Man&#8230;I&#8217;m so tired right now and I&#8217;ve had 74 internal monologues like this today, I don&#8217;t think I can take any more. OK&#8230;here&#8217;s the plan. Distraction. Err. OK. \u00a0Go&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Me (to Isaac): &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you play in the sand pit?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Isaac: &#8220;But I want to squirt the hose!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Me: &#8220;You can have fun in the sand pit. You love the sand pit. Look, here&#8217;s your digger.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>(Isaac puts the hose down and takes his shorts <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">and pants<\/span> off)<\/p>\n<p>Me (to myself): &#8220;Oh crikey, he&#8217;ll get sand up his bum and in his willy&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Me: &#8220;Isaac, please put your pants back on&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Isaac: &#8220;But&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>My brain: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Me: &#8220;Don&#8217;t&#8230;just DON&#8217;T!!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>My brain: &#8220;Make it 75&#8221;<\/p>\n",
