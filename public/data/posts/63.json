WHAT IS THIS?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been working on a little re-brand of my personal blog site. Here&#8217;s the low down on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What have you done?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, quite. I actually have no idea if this is a great idea or a terrible one. But I&#8217;ve removed the long-standing &#8220;Which Way Now&#8221; branding and made the whole thing much more &#8220;me&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve implemented a new theme that I&#8217;ve created from scratch. I&#8217;ve 100% embraced the fact that I&#8217;m not a designer and removed pretty much all the images (apart from those in posts) and added a geeky, mono-spaced font look that&#8217;s hopefully appealing to my core audience. And the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/\">homepage<\/a> has a fun section for those-who-know to try out with plenty of Easter eggs to find<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also tried to embrace modern web technologies &#8211; more about this in the &#8220;How?&#8221; section, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still need to re-work a lot of out of date pages and do a bit more work on presenting content and adding what I want in the navigation\/sidebar. The structure is\/will be somewhat inspired by <a href=\"http:\/\/jvns.ca\/blog\/2019\/02\/17\/organizing-this-blog-into-categories\/\">Julia Evans&#8217;s ideas<\/a> about categorising her blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other inspiration is from:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/changelog.com\/\">Changelog.com<\/a><\/li><li>My friend <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/keiron\">@keiron&#8217;s<\/a> &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.geekeryasaservice.co.uk\/\">Geekery as a Service<\/a>&#8220;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why have you done this?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I think my audience has changed &#8211; it&#8217;s more technical people now and less general folk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the things I write and the reasons I write have changed &#8211; it&#8217;s less of a life journal and more of a set of technical articles and stuff about technology and work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will sounds horribly vain, I know &#8211; when I started working freelance I set up <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/\">Oikos<\/a> as my business, but I was never sure if it would be more important to promote the business or to promote myself. Over the last few years it&#8217;s become evident that my personal &#8220;brand&#8221; is more important to my work, so I&#8217;m really focussing in on that with this change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to show that I could build my own theme for my own site, gain greater control over the structure of it, learn some new things, try some new things, and tinker with technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, I&#8217;m not a designer and I always had a sense that my personal site didn&#8217;t need to be image-heavy; why load a bunch of impersonal stock images or off-the-shelf icons that actually say nothing about me? So I&#8217;ve gone all in on the geeky coding theme and it&#8217;s super fast and light-weight as a result, with fun things for my core audience to play with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How did you make it?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s built with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>WordPress<\/li><li>Plain CSS (including flexbox)<\/li><li>A little plain vanilla, framework-free JavaScript (ES6 to be precise, might struggle on IE11)<\/li><li>My <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/oiko_s\/tree\/SUCSS\">own super-simple starter theme<\/a> based on <a href=\"http:\/\/underscores.me\/\">_s<\/a> (&#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/underscores.me\/\">underscores<\/a>&#8220;) &#8211; I&#8217;m working on a branch that removes the SASS and Webkit build process<\/li><li>ZERO build process<\/li><li>ZERO cookie-based analytics or social media tracking codes &#8211; I use my own <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/\">Kownter<\/a> (still early work in progress) for anonymised, private analytics<\/li><li>100% system font stacks &#8211; I ship you NO font files. I&#8217;m actually not entirely happy with the system mono-spaced fonts, I wanted something more Courier&#8217;y really<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been years in the thinking, but not actually that long in the making. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed doing it and I&#8217;m pleased with the result&#8230;I think?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s still not quite finished, and I&#8217;m totally up for feedback. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s easy enough to read, so if you think the idea of the design is terrible then do tell me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, all good websites have a quote from my friend <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/smp303\">Simon Pollard<\/a>, so here&#8217;s the obligatory hat tip to him:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It is missing a quote from me &#8211; all good sites have a quote from me<\/p><cite>Simon Pollard<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>If you&#8217;re a regular visitor you&#8217;ll notice things look VERY different around here today. If you&#8217;re not then you&#8217;re probably thinking WOAH!?!?! WHAT IS THIS?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been working on a little re-brand of my personal blog site. Here&#8217;s the low down on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What have you done?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, quite. I actually have no idea if this is a great idea or a terrible one. But I&#8217;ve removed the long-standing &#8220;Which Way Now&#8221; branding and made the whole thing much more &#8220;me&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve implemented a new theme that I&#8217;ve created from scratch. I&#8217;ve 100% embraced the fact that I&#8217;m not a designer and removed pretty much all the images (apart from those in posts) and added a geeky, mono-spaced font look that&#8217;s hopefully appealing to my core audience. And the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/\">homepage<\/a> has a fun section for those-who-know to try out with plenty of Easter eggs to find<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also tried to embrace modern web technologies &#8211; more about this in the &#8220;How?&#8221; section, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still need to re-work a lot of out of date pages and do a bit more work on presenting content and adding what I want in the navigation\/sidebar. The structure is\/will be somewhat inspired by <a href=\"http:\/\/jvns.ca\/blog\/2019\/02\/17\/organizing-this-blog-into-categories\/\">Julia Evans&#8217;s ideas<\/a> about categorising her blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other inspiration is from:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/changelog.com\/\">Changelog.com<\/a><\/li><li>My friend <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/keiron\">@keiron&#8217;s<\/a> &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.geekeryasaservice.co.uk\/\">Geekery as a Service<\/a>&#8220;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why have you done this?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I think my audience has changed &#8211; it&#8217;s more technical people now and less general folk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the things I write and the reasons I write have changed &#8211; it&#8217;s less of a life journal and more of a set of technical articles and stuff about technology and work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will sounds horribly vain, I know &#8211; when I started working freelance I set up <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/\">Oikos<\/a> as my business, but I was never sure if it would be more important to promote the business or to promote myself. Over the last few years it&#8217;s become evident that my personal &#8220;brand&#8221; is more important to my work, so I&#8217;m really focussing in on that with this change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to show that I could build my own theme for my own site, gain greater control over the structure of it, learn some new things, try some new things, and tinker with technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, I&#8217;m not a designer and I always had a sense that my personal site didn&#8217;t need to be image-heavy; why load a bunch of impersonal stock images or off-the-shelf icons that actually say nothing about me? So I&#8217;ve gone all in on the geeky coding theme and it&#8217;s super fast and light-weight as a result, with fun things for my core audience to play with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How did you make it?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s built with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>WordPress<\/li><li>Plain CSS (including flexbox)<\/li><li>A little plain vanilla, framework-free JavaScript (ES6 to be precise, might struggle on IE11)<\/li><li>My <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/oiko_s\/tree\/SUCSS\">own super-simple starter theme<\/a> based on <a href=\"http:\/\/underscores.me\/\">_s<\/a> (&#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/underscores.me\/\">underscores<\/a>&#8220;) &#8211; I&#8217;m working on a branch that removes the SASS and Webkit build process<\/li><li>ZERO build process<\/li><li>ZERO cookie-based analytics or social media tracking codes &#8211; I use my own <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/\">Kownter<\/a> (still early work in progress) for anonymised, private analytics<\/li><li>100% system font stacks &#8211; I ship you NO font files. I&#8217;m actually not entirely happy with the system mono-spaced fonts, I wanted something more Courier&#8217;y really<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been years in the thinking, but not actually that long in the making. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed doing it and I&#8217;m pleased with the result&#8230;I think?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s still not quite finished, and I&#8217;m totally up for feedback. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s easy enough to read, so if you think the idea of the design is terrible then do tell me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, all good websites have a quote from my friend <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/smp303\">Simon Pollard<\/a>, so here&#8217;s the obligatory hat tip to him:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It is missing a quote from me &#8211; all good sites have a quote from me<\/p><cite>Simon Pollard<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n",

The government&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/\">petitions site<\/a> gives you <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/archived\/petitions\/131215.json\">the data<\/a> in a quite usable form (called JSON) but it&#8217;s only an instantaneous snapshot of values. It doesn&#8217;t record the history of the petition&#8217;s growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I built <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/\">a little tool<\/a> to collect the number of signatures every 5 minutes and store it so I could <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/131215\">plot charts of growth<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now&#8230;you may have noticed that <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/petitions\/241584\">a little petition<\/a> has gone a bit &#8220;viral&#8221; in the last couple of days! So I kinda turn, temporarily, into petition data geek.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not just me that is <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/241584\">tracking it<\/a>. Various other people are doing interesting things with the data. So here&#8217;s a little list of Revoke Article 50 petition resources. If you want to add yours then <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\">drop me a line<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tracking over time<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>My petition tracker (will track any petition you tell it to): <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/241584\">https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/241584<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/odileeds\">ODI Leeds<\/a> Tracker (seems to be a one-off for this petition): <a href=\"https:\/\/odileeds.org\/projects\/petitions\/241584\">https:\/\/odileeds.org\/projects\/petitions\/241584<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/livefrombrexit\"><\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/theosanderson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">Theo Sanderson<\/a> has made a simple tracker with a real-time counter too: <a href=\"https:\/\/splasho.com\/petitions\/index.php?petition=241584\">https:\/\/splasho.com\/petitions\/index.php?petition=241584<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/milliams\">Matt Williams<\/a>  has taken my data and made much better rate-of-change  (signatures-per-minute) charts from it and added some simple growth  predictions: <a href=\"http:\/\/petitionstats.eu\/\">http:\/\/petitionstats.eu\/<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jonty\/\">Jonty Wareing<\/a> has made a simple predictor of when the next million will be hit: <a href=\"https:\/\/predictition.jonty.now.sh\/\">https:\/\/predictition.jonty.now.sh\/<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/codekipple\">Carl Hughes<\/a> has made a Twitter bot that tweets out the number of signatures every 15 mins or so: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/revoke50bot\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/revoke50bot<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/milliams\"><\/a> (there are several of these now!)<\/li><li>&#8220;Ben&#8221; has <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRS-5ggYBN3OP47_vExFwhe4ALl2DdtpksIQgy-h7NxoVLyr3BP8jGWZg3JYKLai2Ma18cLDazujybj\/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true\">a tracking spreadsheet<\/a> he&#8217;s updating manually every now and then.

        "content": "\n<p><strong>Update August 2019<\/strong>: Another <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/petitions\/269157\">petition about proroguing\/suspending parliament<\/a> has been taking off and got 1,000,000 signatures in a day! So I&#8217;ve updated this list with some resources related to that as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that many of the tools listed here have a 6-digit petition ID in the URL, so if you change that from 241584 to 269157 you&#8217;ll get the equivalent analysis\/data for the proroguing petition. Happy petitioning!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of years back I was intrigued by the seemingly-very-uniform growth of <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/archived\/petitions\/131215\">a large and fast-growing government petition<\/a>. The government&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/\">petitions site<\/a> gives you <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/archived\/petitions\/131215.json\">the data<\/a> in a quite usable form (called JSON) but it&#8217;s only an instantaneous snapshot of values. It doesn&#8217;t record the history of the petition&#8217;s growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I built <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/\">a little tool<\/a> to collect the number of signatures every 5 minutes and store it so I could <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/131215\">plot charts of growth<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now&#8230;you may have noticed that <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/petitions\/241584\">a little petition<\/a> has gone a bit &#8220;viral&#8221; in the last couple of days! So I kinda turn, temporarily, into petition data geek.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not just me that is <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/241584\">tracking it<\/a>. Various other people are doing interesting things with the data. So here&#8217;s a little list of Revoke Article 50 petition resources.

        "content": "\n<p>So my government petition tracker has been pretty heavily used in the last couple of days. I thought it was worth putting together a little article on how it works and how it&#8217;s handling being (a little bit) busy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How it&#8217;s made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The tool is built with Laravel on PHP and MySQL<\/li><li>It has no login or back-end as such<\/li><li>It uses the government petition site&#8217;s JSON API: you can stick &#8216;.json&#8217; on the end of a URL and get a snapshot of the current count and the current counts by geographic region<\/li><li>The system only collects data for petitions it knows about. You have to tell it to collect data for a specific petition. It does not collect data for all petitions.<\/li><li>For each petition, the system collects the count data every 5 minutes (if it can! the goverenment&#8217;s system has been struggling this week)<\/li><li>I only store the global count and a &#8220;delta&#8221; &#8211; the different between the current point and the precious point, to get an idea of growth rate<\/li><li>The delta&#8217;s are a bit rubbish. I should average them out over the time since the last count was collected. It&#8217;s on my list!<\/li><li>It runs on a $10 Digital Ocean droplet\/VPS alongside a few other side projects of mine.<\/li><li>I deploy using Git and <a href=\"https:\/\/forge.laravel.com\/\">Laravel Forge<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How&#8217;s it doing?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, unlike the government site, it has stayed up! And it&#8217;s been performing fine. It&#8217;s not had HUGE traffic, but&#8230;well&#8230;here&#8217;s some stats. Bear in mind that I use <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/\">my own very simple privacy-aware analytics<\/a>, so numbers are helpful but won&#8217;t be the kind of super-accurate stuff you get from more sophisticated analytics tools:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The petition tracker has had 22,500 page views in the last 24 hours (to 09:45 on Friday 22nd)<\/li><li>It&#8217;s only had 30,100 page views in the last year, so 75% of the year&#8217;s traffic has been in the last 24 hours.<\/li><li>The server peaked at 36.14% CPU and has averaged about 15% throughout the day<\/li><li>Memory usage is pretty flat<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"677\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-09.50.50-1024x677.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4706\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-09.50.50-1024x677.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-09.50.50-300x198.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-09.50.50-768x507.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-09.50.50.png 1704w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Charts of server utilisation over last 24 hours<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And this despite me not really having any caching in place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, so I&#8217;m getting 1,000&#8217;s views per day rather than per minute, but I&#8217;m pretty happy with this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though I am a bit scared that a retweet from the <del>wrong<\/del>right person could take the thing down!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s see how today goes!<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ve been chatting with other speakers in the Speaker&#8217;s Slack Channel and I popped in and asked for tips:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Who has super speaker tips? Assume nothing. I want all the basics.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I gave a couple of my own for starters:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Quit All Your Apps when presenting (other than your presenting app)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Mute all notifications! Mac users can enable Do Not Disturb mode if you click the notification centre &#8211; top right &#8211; and scroll up to the toggle, or just Alt-Click the notification centre icon in the menu bar. There&#8217;s probably a Windows equivalent.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a tip that is WordCamp London venue-specific:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Also, if you&#8217;re speaking in track A, the Great Hall, it sounds stupid but there&#8217;s a HUGE clock on the back wall and one year it was about 4 minutes slow. Take note of if this clock is accurate cos you don&#8217;t want to look at it and think you&#8217;ve got lots of time that you haven&#8217;t!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>But this probably translates into more of a general &#8220;Check out your environment beforehand. Stand on the stage. Find out what you will be looking at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/danmaby\">Dan Maby<\/a> had a few useful nuggets:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I use Owly to keep my mac awake too https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/owly-prevent-display-sleep\/id882812218?mt=12<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Drink water<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>(which I followed with &#8220;but not too much water!&#8221;)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Breath<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Pause, giving yourself a second to catch up with yourself is good for everyone<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Pause Dropbox\/Google Drive\/One Drive etc.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Make sure your Google Slides are available off-line<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tnash\">Tim Nash<\/a> is super-experienced. And his experience suggests that the following are good ideas:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Don&#8217;t fall of the stage<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Don&#8217;t panic, if words are coming out of your mouth its probably ok<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Don&#8217;t open the file called passwords.txt<\/p><p><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Clean and hide your desktop if you like to use that space as a general place to dump files. Inevitably you will minimise your presentation and you never know what files are there.<\/p><p><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I followed up with my own tip: Even if it means shoving everything into a &#8220;Things that were on my desktop&#8221; folder temporarily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When you&#8217;re on stage, if you can, get away from the lectern, it both obscures you but also will make you hunch which will make it harder to project. It sometimes feels safe behind there but it really is worth trying to avoid that space entirely<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/karmatosed\">Tammie Lister<\/a>, who is also a very experienced speaker, countered this and made her own wise suggestions too:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Standing by lectern is OK. For those of us that need notes and have poor eyesight or reading hurdles it&#8217;s OK. Just be comfortable.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Turn off your wifi, seriously stop doing live demos &#8211; if wifi is off you can&#8217;t get notifications<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Don&#8217;t focus on one person, move your eyes over everyone.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Which prompted a related, WordPress-specific tech tip from me:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>If you&#8217;re demoing WordPress locally, you can use this to speed it up and stop network stuff happening too: https:\/\/github.com\/norcross\/airplane-mode<br><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/swissspidy\">Pascal Birchler<\/a> suggests you:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Arrive on time for your talk <\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Which got some follow ups:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Early even!<br><\/p><p>And sit in the audience if you can for a talk in your track, if you not been in the room before. It will give you a rough idea of what they the audience can see\/hear.<\/p><cite>Tim Nash<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Yes. Definitely scout the room. Have a chat with the AV\/sound people in a break before your talk if you can. They&#8217;re super helpful.<\/p><cite>Ross Wintle<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There were some lightning-talk specific tips and tips on Q&amp;A&#8217;s afterwards too:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Perhaps a bit late and very much my take, but front load your talk, you have a very short amount of time, so don&#8217;t spend to long talking about yourself, or your background, so if you have slides like about you put them at the end, so you can say I was &lt;whoever you are> come find me afterwards. Similarly keep resources to the end, as otherwise folks will start trying to find links to sites etc, while your talking and miss like half the talk<br><\/p><p>I think more so for a lightning talk its all about giving folks things to go away and think and research. It&#8217;s also one of the few times, where its OK to be a little fast paced just don&#8217;t trip over yourself.<\/p><p>Also don&#8217;t be afraid to say, I will take questions at the end<\/p><cite>Tim Nash<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>For lightning talks, leverage the Happiness Bar (the &#8220;tech support zone&#8221;  of a WordCamp) heavily. Only talk about the important things, and at the end of your talk say &#8220;I&#8217;m going to the Happiness Bar right now to answer any more questions&#8221;<\/p><cite>Topher DeRosia<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;, is the most powerful answer to a question ever, don&#8217;t be afraid to say it, no one will think less of you. If anything the opposite, I am much more likely to respect a speaker, who when asked a question they don&#8217;t know the answer to says I don&#8217;t know, but if you remind me later I might be able to find out.<\/p><cite>Tim Nash<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, as Tim Nash says<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Have fun!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I&#8217;m speaking at <a href=\"https:\/\/2019.london.wordcamp.org\/\">WordCamp London<\/a> on Sunday. And I ALWAYS learn something new when public speaking. I&#8217;ve been chatting with other speakers in the Speaker&#8217;s Slack Channel and I popped in and asked for tips:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Who has super speaker tips? Assume nothing. I want all the basics.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I gave a couple of my own for starters:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Quit All Your Apps when presenting (other than your presenting app)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Mute all notifications! Mac users can enable Do Not Disturb mode if you click the notification centre &#8211; top right &#8211; and scroll up to the toggle, or just Alt-Click the notification centre icon in the menu bar. There&#8217;s probably a Windows equivalent.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a tip that is WordCamp London venue-specific:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Also, if you&#8217;re speaking in track A, the Great Hall, it sounds stupid but there&#8217;s a HUGE clock on the back wall and one year it was about 4 minutes slow. Take note of if this clock is accurate cos you don&#8217;t want to look at it and think you&#8217;ve got lots of time that you haven&#8217;t!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>But this probably translates into more of a general &#8220;Check out your environment beforehand. Stand on the stage. Find out what you will be looking at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/danmaby\">Dan Maby<\/a> had a few useful nuggets:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I use Owly to keep my mac awake too https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/owly-prevent-display-sleep\/id882812218?mt=12<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Drink water<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>(which I followed with &#8220;but not too much water!&#8221;)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Breath<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Pause, giving yourself a second to catch up with yourself is good for everyone<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Pause Dropbox\/Google Drive\/One Drive etc.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Make sure your Google Slides are available off-line<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tnash\">Tim Nash<\/a> is super-experienced. And his experience suggests that the following are good ideas:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Don&#8217;t fall of the stage<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Don&#8217;t panic, if words are coming out of your mouth its probably ok<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Don&#8217;t open the file called passwords.txt<\/p><p><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Clean and hide your desktop if you like to use that space as a general place to dump files. Inevitably you will minimise your presentation and you never know what files are there.<\/p><p><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I followed up with my own tip: Even if it means shoving everything into a &#8220;Things that were on my desktop&#8221; folder temporarily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When you&#8217;re on stage, if you can, get away from the lectern, it both obscures you but also will make you hunch which will make it harder to project. It sometimes feels safe behind there but it really is worth trying to avoid that space entirely<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/karmatosed\">Tammie Lister<\/a>, who is also a very experienced speaker, countered this and made her own wise suggestions too:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Standing by lectern is OK. For those of us that need notes and have poor eyesight or reading hurdles it&#8217;s OK. Just be comfortable.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Turn off your wifi, seriously stop doing live demos &#8211; if wifi is off you can&#8217;t get notifications<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Don&#8217;t focus on one person, move your eyes over everyone.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Which prompted a related, WordPress-specific tech tip from me:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>If you&#8217;re demoing WordPress locally, you can use this to speed it up and stop network stuff happening too: https:\/\/github.com\/norcross\/airplane-mode<br><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/swissspidy\">Pascal Birchler<\/a> suggests you:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Arrive on time for your talk <\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Which got some follow ups:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Early even!<br><\/p><p>And sit in the audience if you can for a talk in your track, if you not been in the room before. It will give you a rough idea of what they the audience can see\/hear.<\/p><cite>Tim Nash<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Yes. Definitely scout the room. Have a chat with the AV\/sound people in a break before your talk if you can. They&#8217;re super helpful.<\/p><cite>Ross Wintle<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There were some lightning-talk specific tips and tips on Q&amp;A&#8217;s afterwards too:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Perhaps a bit late and very much my take, but front load your talk, you have a very short amount of time, so don&#8217;t spend to long talking about yourself, or your background, so if you have slides like about you put them at the end, so you can say I was &lt;whoever you are> come find me afterwards. Similarly keep resources to the end, as otherwise folks will start trying to find links to sites etc, while your talking and miss like half the talk<br><\/p><p>I think more so for a lightning talk its all about giving folks things to go away and think and research. It&#8217;s also one of the few times, where its OK to be a little fast paced just don&#8217;t trip over yourself.<\/p><p>Also don&#8217;t be afraid to say, I will take questions at the end<\/p><cite>Tim Nash<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>For lightning talks, leverage the Happiness Bar (the &#8220;tech support zone&#8221;  of a WordCamp) heavily. Only talk about the important things, and at the end of your talk say &#8220;I&#8217;m going to the Happiness Bar right now to answer any more questions&#8221;<\/p><cite>Topher DeRosia<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;, is the most powerful answer to a question ever, don&#8217;t be afraid to say it, no one will think less of you. If anything the opposite, I am much more likely to respect a speaker, who when asked a question they don&#8217;t know the answer to says I don&#8217;t know, but if you remind me later I might be able to find out.<\/p><cite>Tim Nash<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, as Tim Nash says<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Have fun!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n",

In this application we are using resource controllers (with typical resource methods like <code>index<\/code>, <code>create<\/code>, <code>store<\/code>, etc) and manually authorizing in the controllers using the controller helper method described in <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/authorization#via-controller-helpers\">the documentation<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$this-&gt;authorize('create', Post::class);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>or, for methods that require authorization for a particular object\/model:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function update(Request $request, Post $post)\n{\n    $this-&gt;authorize('update', $post);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The problem<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem I had here is that in the latter example, it&#8217;s kinda unclear which policy is being used. In the first example above it&#8217;s explicit &#8211; we&#8217;re using using the <code>PostPolicy<\/code> because we passed in <code>Post::class<\/code> to specify which model we are using.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second example the Policy is not specified &#8211; I&#8217;m guessing that the class of the type-hinted <code>Post<\/code> is used to determine which policy is called. But it&#8217;s not clear especially when&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The use case &#8211; and why the problem is a problem<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In my case I&#8217;m authorizing users to edit users, so my controllers looked like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function update(Request $request, User $user)\n{\n    $this-&gt;authorize('update', $user);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>But then I wanted <a href=\"https:\/\/tighten.co\/blog\/extending-models-in-eloquent\">some child classes<\/a> of the <code>User<\/code> model, which look like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nclass SuperAdmin extends User\n{\n    protected $table = 'users';\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Now, if a SuperAdmin is passed to the UserController, which Policy is used? And &#8211; I know I probably shouldn&#8217;t but &#8211; if I wanted to use a specific policy here, what do I do? My only option is to change the type hint, isn&#8217;t it? And I may not want to do that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The solution!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, no. It&#8217;s not the only option. It turns out you can pass an array to the <code>authorize<\/code> helper which seems to let you specify both the object you are trying to authorize for, and a specific class\/policy:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$this-&gt;authorize('update', &#x5B;SuperAdmin::class, $user]);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>So yay! Now, there&#8217;s probably a whole bunch of reasons you wouldn&#8217;t\/shouldn&#8217;t do this, but that&#8217;s not the point. I want to remember that you can choose a policy by specifying a class name. And&#8230;job done!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I&#8217;m working on a Laravel application right now and I got myself in a bit of a tangle about authorization policies because of an undocumented way of using them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Overview of policies<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In Laravel, Policies are a way of specifying who can take particular actions. In this application we are using resource controllers (with typical resource methods like <code>index<\/code>, <code>create<\/code>, <code>store<\/code>, etc) and manually authorizing in the controllers using the controller helper method described in <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/authorization#via-controller-helpers\">the documentation<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$this-&gt;authorize('create', Post::class);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>or, for methods that require authorization for a particular object\/model:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function update(Request $request, Post $post)\n{\n    $this-&gt;authorize('update', $post);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The problem<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem I had here is that in the latter example, it&#8217;s kinda unclear which policy is being used. In the first example above it&#8217;s explicit &#8211; we&#8217;re using using the <code>PostPolicy<\/code> because we passed in <code>Post::class<\/code> to specify which model we are using.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second example the Policy is not specified &#8211; I&#8217;m guessing that the class of the type-hinted <code>Post<\/code> is used to determine which policy is called. But it&#8217;s not clear especially when&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The use case &#8211; and why the problem is a problem<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In my case I&#8217;m authorizing users to edit users, so my controllers looked like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function update(Request $request, User $user)\n{\n    $this-&gt;authorize('update', $user);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>But then I wanted <a href=\"https:\/\/tighten.co\/blog\/extending-models-in-eloquent\">some child classes<\/a> of the <code>User<\/code> model, which look like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nclass SuperAdmin extends User\n{\n    protected $table = 'users';\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Now, if a SuperAdmin is passed to the UserController, which Policy is used? And &#8211; I know I probably shouldn&#8217;t but &#8211; if I wanted to use a specific policy here, what do I do? My only option is to change the type hint, isn&#8217;t it? And I may not want to do that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The solution!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, no. It&#8217;s not the only option. It turns out you can pass an array to the <code>authorize<\/code> helper which seems to let you specify both the object you are trying to authorize for, and a specific class\/policy:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$this-&gt;authorize('update', &#x5B;SuperAdmin::class, $user]);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>So yay! Now, there&#8217;s probably a whole bunch of reasons you wouldn&#8217;t\/shouldn&#8217;t do this, but that&#8217;s not the point. I want to remember that you can choose a policy by specifying a class name. And&#8230;job done!<\/p>\n",

But this felt new today and is definitely worth remembering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re using forms in Laravel, you sometimes want a &#8220;cancel&#8221; or &#8220;back&#8221; button or link that takes you to where you were before. And Laravel provides a handy <code>url()<\/code> helper that gets a URL builder that you can add a <code>previous()<\/code> method call to get the referring URL:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nurl()-&gt;previous()\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>So you can put this as the <code>href<\/code> of a link and you&#8217;re done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well&#8230;unless&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, if you submit your form with errors, and Laravel&#8217;s validation is being used, your POST request, will result in the form page being reloaded. And the referrer &#8211; and therefore the <code>previous()<\/code> URL &#8211; will be the form page, because that&#8217;s where you came from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you need to remember the original previous URL between loads of the form page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always with Laravel there&#8217;s many ways to skin that cat. But I like this one: put a hidden field in your form to remember the original previous URL.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot;\n       name=&quot;back_to&quot;\n       value=&quot;{{ old('back_to') ?: url()-&gt;previous() }}&quot;&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And then use that in your back\/cancel button link:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;a class=&quot;btn btn-default&quot;\n   href=&quot;{{ old('back_to') ?: url()-&gt;previous() }}&gt;\n  Cancel\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Note the use of the <code>old()<\/code> helper &#8211; because the POST to the form results in a redirect which loses the request data &#8211; so we need to grab it from the session.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s a note to self, but maybe it helped you too.<\/p>\n",

And Laravel provides a handy <code>url()<\/code> helper that gets a URL builder that you can add a <code>previous()<\/code> method call to get the referring URL:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nurl()-&gt;previous()\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>So you can put this as the <code>href<\/code> of a link and you&#8217;re done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well&#8230;unless&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, if you submit your form with errors, and Laravel&#8217;s validation is being used, your POST request, will result in the form page being reloaded. And the referrer &#8211; and therefore the <code>previous()<\/code> URL &#8211; will be the form page, because that&#8217;s where you came from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you need to remember the original previous URL between loads of the form page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always with Laravel there&#8217;s many ways to skin that cat. But I like this one: put a hidden field in your form to remember the original previous URL.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot;\n       name=&quot;back_to&quot;\n       value=&quot;{{ old('back_to') ?: url()-&gt;previous() }}&quot;&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And then use that in your back\/cancel button link:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;a class=&quot;btn btn-default&quot;\n   href=&quot;{{ old('back_to') ?: url()-&gt;previous() }}&gt;\n  Cancel\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Note the use of the <code>old()<\/code> helper &#8211; because the POST to the form results in a redirect which loses the request data &#8211; so we need to grab it from the session.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s a note to self, but maybe it helped you too.<\/p>\n",

They don&#8217;t have to, but a lot of the time you need to make some kind of CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) interface for objects, and you so end up needing simple forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Laravel uses &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Convention_over_configuration\">convention over configuration<\/a>&#8221; to determine a lot of things. For example, rather than getting the developer to explicitly say &#8220;The <code>User<\/code> model uses the <code>users<\/code> table&#8221;, the framework assumes a default by convention:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>By convention, the &#8220;snake case&#8221;, plural name of the class will be used as the table name unless another name is explicitly specified<\/p><cite><a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/eloquent#eloquent-model-conventions\">https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/eloquent#eloquent-model-conventions<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is great because once you&#8217;ve learned the conventions, you can get on with coding without having to be explicit about a load of things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Form validation is easy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And Laravel also lets you take a lot of shortcuts with creating forms. Such as the built-in validation. This lets you set a bunch of rules about the data submitted in a request, and the framework:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Applies the rules<\/li><li>Sanitises the inputs<\/li><li>Redirects on failure and&#8230;<\/li><li>&#8230;stores errors in the session.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is great. Under certain circumstances. But you can&#8217;t just set the rules and go. You still need to pay attention to what&#8217;s going on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The wrong error<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One place that this beautifully-automatic system falls down is with error messages. It does its best, but really it needs a little more work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say you have a simple profile-updating form for a company object. You could have an <code>input<\/code> named <code>name<\/code>, but your label for this input is <code>Company Name<\/code>:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;h3&gt;Your company details&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;input-group&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;label for=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Company name&lt;\/label&gt;\n  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; id=&quot;name&quot;&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>You can validate this for, say, required-ness in your controller like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$validatedRequest = $request-&gt;validate(&#x5B;\n  'name' =&gt; 'required'\n]);\n\n\/\/ Do stuff with the request\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>The framework does its best to be clever here if validation fails, and it sill stores an error in the session that you can print in your template. BUT&#8230;the error will say that &#8220;The <strong>name<\/strong> field is required&#8221; (or similar &#8211; emphasis mine) and it will use the input&#8217;s name rather than the label. This is confusing for the user because the label for the input was &#8220;Company name&#8221; so the error should be &#8220;The <strong>Company name<\/strong> field is required&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Custom error messages<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can create custom error messages for validations, but you have to use a more verbose form of validation. This is <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/validation#custom-error-messages\">documented here<\/a>, and I won&#8217;t go into too much detail, but you basically create an array of new messages like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$messages = &#x5B;\n  'name.required' =&gt; 'You must provide a company name',\n];\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>There are various ways to pass this to the validator &#8211; check the docs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this all works nicely. So far so good. But&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A complication<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s a slight complication for my application: I&#8217;m using <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/validation#form-request-validation\">form requests!<\/a> These allow you to group authorisation, validation, and so on into a single class for handling the input, and to have lots of that taken care of for you. Their usage in a controller looks like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function store(CompanyUpdate $request)\n{\n  $validated = $request-&gt;validated();\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve created the <code>CompanyUpdate<\/code> request class here, authorisation is automatic, and validation is taken care of in that single line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But where, then, do I put my custom messages?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The solution<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I confess that custom error messages for form requests <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/validation#customizing-the-error-messages\">ARE documented<\/a>, and I just missed them, which is why I&#8217;ve ended up writing this up for my own sanity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To customise the error messages in your form request you can override the <code>messages<\/code> method in your form request class:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function messages()\n{\n  return &#x5B;\n    'name.required' =&gt; 'You must provide a company name',\n    ];\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Simple. But a kinda-tucked away, done-by-convention feature of form requests that&#8217;s really useful to know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoepfully, like my future self, you&#8217;re now happy that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>you need to customise your form validation messages; and<\/li><li>you can now do this however you are doing your validations&#8230;<\/li><li>&#8230;even if they are within a form request!<\/li><\/ul>\n",

        "title": "Laravel: Custom error messages in form requests",
        "content": "\n<p>Another thing where I feel like: &#8220;I must have done this a hundred times before, but it feels new&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CRUDdy conventions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel apps generally use forms a lot. They don&#8217;t have to, but a lot of the time you need to make some kind of CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) interface for objects, and you so end up needing simple forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Laravel uses &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Convention_over_configuration\">convention over configuration<\/a>&#8221; to determine a lot of things. For example, rather than getting the developer to explicitly say &#8220;The <code>User<\/code> model uses the <code>users<\/code> table&#8221;, the framework assumes a default by convention:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>By convention, the &#8220;snake case&#8221;, plural name of the class will be used as the table name unless another name is explicitly specified<\/p><cite><a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/eloquent#eloquent-model-conventions\">https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/eloquent#eloquent-model-conventions<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is great because once you&#8217;ve learned the conventions, you can get on with coding without having to be explicit about a load of things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Form validation is easy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And Laravel also lets you take a lot of shortcuts with creating forms. Such as the built-in validation. This lets you set a bunch of rules about the data submitted in a request, and the framework:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Applies the rules<\/li><li>Sanitises the inputs<\/li><li>Redirects on failure and&#8230;<\/li><li>&#8230;stores errors in the session.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is great. Under certain circumstances. But you can&#8217;t just set the rules and go. You still need to pay attention to what&#8217;s going on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The wrong error<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One place that this beautifully-automatic system falls down is with error messages. It does its best, but really it needs a little more work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say you have a simple profile-updating form for a company object. You could have an <code>input<\/code> named <code>name<\/code>, but your label for this input is <code>Company Name<\/code>:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;h3&gt;Your company details&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;input-group&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;label for=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Company name&lt;\/label&gt;\n  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; id=&quot;name&quot;&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>You can validate this for, say, required-ness in your controller like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$validatedRequest = $request-&gt;validate(&#x5B;\n  'name' =&gt; 'required'\n]);\n\n\/\/ Do stuff with the request\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>The framework does its best to be clever here if validation fails, and it sill stores an error in the session that you can print in your template. BUT&#8230;the error will say that &#8220;The <strong>name<\/strong> field is required&#8221; (or similar &#8211; emphasis mine) and it will use the input&#8217;s name rather than the label. This is confusing for the user because the label for the input was &#8220;Company name&#8221; so the error should be &#8220;The <strong>Company name<\/strong> field is required&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Custom error messages<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can create custom error messages for validations, but you have to use a more verbose form of validation. This is <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/validation#custom-error-messages\">documented here<\/a>, and I won&#8217;t go into too much detail, but you basically create an array of new messages like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$messages = &#x5B;\n  'name.required' =&gt; 'You must provide a company name',\n];\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>There are various ways to pass this to the validator &#8211; check the docs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this all works nicely. So far so good. But&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A complication<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s a slight complication for my application: I&#8217;m using <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/validation#form-request-validation\">form requests!<\/a> These allow you to group authorisation, validation, and so on into a single class for handling the input, and to have lots of that taken care of for you. Their usage in a controller looks like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function store(CompanyUpdate $request)\n{\n  $validated = $request-&gt;validated();\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve created the <code>CompanyUpdate<\/code> request class here, authorisation is automatic, and validation is taken care of in that single line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But where, then, do I put my custom messages?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The solution<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I confess that custom error messages for form requests <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/validation#customizing-the-error-messages\">ARE documented<\/a>, and I just missed them, which is why I&#8217;ve ended up writing this up for my own sanity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To customise the error messages in your form request you can override the <code>messages<\/code> method in your form request class:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function messages()\n{\n  return &#x5B;\n    'name.required' =&gt; 'You must provide a company name',\n    ];\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Simple. But a kinda-tucked away, done-by-convention feature of form requests that&#8217;s really useful to know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoepfully, like my future self, you&#8217;re now happy that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>you need to customise your form validation messages; and<\/li><li>you can now do this however you are doing your validations&#8230;<\/li><li>&#8230;even if they are within a form request!<\/li><\/ul>\n",

Like this site it&#8217;s kinda deliberately minimalist because I&#8217;m not a designer, and yes, it&#8217;s better than previous iterations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s so much I don&#8217;t like about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m working, behind the scenes, with <a href=\"https:\/\/statamic.com\/\">Statamic<\/a>, trying to get to a point where I can use it on client projects. I started trying to rebuild my blog on Statamic and I got so far, but there&#8217;s reasons I don&#8217;t think this will work for MY particular blog (that&#8217;s not to say I wouldn&#8217;t use Statamic for other blogs &#8211; it&#8217;s just that my blog is actually a bit more than a blog right now).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My business site, however, is perfect for converting to Statamic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So off I set.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The super-minimal SUCSS approach<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve writing about <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/my-new-css-framework-sucss\/\">my jokingly-named &#8220;SUCSS&#8221; approach to CSS<\/a> before. But the basic premise is that I&#8217;m fed up of node-based build tools and complex frameworks, and CSS now has things like custom properties (i.e. variables) and calc and flexbox that are supported well enough to make them OK to use in vanilla form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my aim is &#8211;  for small sites at least &#8211; to ditch the build process entirely, work in vanilla CSS (and vanilla JS where needed too) and, for my own site, just keep things as small and simple as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a designer and I&#8217;m embracing that with few images and a super-simple design. This will aid page weight and load times and make my site clean, lean and green! Nice!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I confess that my starting point was, for whatever reason, a compiled, vanilla-CSS version of Bootstrap 4. I&#8217;ve ditched 95% of it, but I know the grid and can work easily with the grid, so I&#8217;ve kept that, and used the rest as a &#8220;reset&#8221; and built upon it. This has worked out just fine!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Centre-align is a cheap trick that doesn&#8217;t always work<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At one point I kinda forgot to add <code>text-align: centre<\/code> to a block and when I looked at it it looked better! So I started left-aligning everything and it actually &#8211; I think &#8211; looks neater and smarter. Who&#8217;d have thought &#8211; I was blindly following trends in my own non-designery way, and it turns out that centre-aligning stuff isn&#8217;t always the best way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I&#8217;m still learning. Lots. Every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"853\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30-1024x853.png\" alt=\"Old Oikos site with WordPress and a page builder\" class=\"wp-image-8405\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30-1024x853.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30-300x250.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30-768x640.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30.png 1210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Old Oikos site with WordPress and a page builder<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"860\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20-1024x860.png\" alt=\"New, Statamic-powered, vanilla CSS, site with no page-builder!\" class=\"wp-image-8407\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20-1024x860.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20-300x252.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20-768x645.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20.png 1177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>New, Statamic-powered, vanilla CSS, site with no page-builder!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Results<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, and this is without adding in a navigation, search or my <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\">Kownter analytics<\/a>, I&#8217;ve got the homepage down from 1.74MB over 33 requests to 67.5K over 4 requests.

I started trying to rebuild my blog on Statamic and I got so far, but there&#8217;s reasons I don&#8217;t think this will work for MY particular blog (that&#8217;s not to say I wouldn&#8217;t use Statamic for other blogs &#8211; it&#8217;s just that my blog is actually a bit more than a blog right now).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My business site, however, is perfect for converting to Statamic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So off I set.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The super-minimal SUCSS approach<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve writing about <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/my-new-css-framework-sucss\/\">my jokingly-named &#8220;SUCSS&#8221; approach to CSS<\/a> before. But the basic premise is that I&#8217;m fed up of node-based build tools and complex frameworks, and CSS now has things like custom properties (i.e. variables) and calc and flexbox that are supported well enough to make them OK to use in vanilla form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my aim is &#8211;  for small sites at least &#8211; to ditch the build process entirely, work in vanilla CSS (and vanilla JS where needed too) and, for my own site, just keep things as small and simple as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a designer and I&#8217;m embracing that with few images and a super-simple design. This will aid page weight and load times and make my site clean, lean and green! Nice!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I confess that my starting point was, for whatever reason, a compiled, vanilla-CSS version of Bootstrap 4. I&#8217;ve ditched 95% of it, but I know the grid and can work easily with the grid, so I&#8217;ve kept that, and used the rest as a &#8220;reset&#8221; and built upon it. This has worked out just fine!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Centre-align is a cheap trick that doesn&#8217;t always work<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At one point I kinda forgot to add <code>text-align: centre<\/code> to a block and when I looked at it it looked better! So I started left-aligning everything and it actually &#8211; I think &#8211; looks neater and smarter. Who&#8217;d have thought &#8211; I was blindly following trends in my own non-designery way, and it turns out that centre-aligning stuff isn&#8217;t always the best way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I&#8217;m still learning. Lots. Every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"853\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30-1024x853.png\" alt=\"Old Oikos site with WordPress and a page builder\" class=\"wp-image-8405\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30-1024x853.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30-300x250.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30-768x640.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30.png 1210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Old Oikos site with WordPress and a page builder<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"860\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20-1024x860.png\" alt=\"New, Statamic-powered, vanilla CSS, site with no page-builder!\" class=\"wp-image-8407\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20-1024x860.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20-300x252.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20-768x645.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20.png 1177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>New, Statamic-powered, vanilla CSS, site with no page-builder!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Results<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, and this is without adding in a navigation, search or my <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\">Kownter analytics<\/a>, I&#8217;ve got the homepage down from 1.74MB over 33 requests to 67.5K over 4 requests.

To inform people they produced a leaflet explaining which materials should go in which boxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I could stick the leaflet on my fridge. But&#8230;if I did so there wouldn&#8217;t be room for any cute pictures that my kids drew, or of those stupid ClubCard vouchers that I keep forgetting to spend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9555-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Swindon's new recycling leaflet\" class=\"wp-image-8435\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9555-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9555-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9555-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Swindon&#8217;s new recycling information leaflet<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s HUGE! (I do not have Donald Trump-sized hands!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I saw this I immediately thought: wouldn&#8217;t it be great if there was a simple app or something where I could search for materials to quickly find out if they are recyclable and which bin\/box\/bag they should go in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apps are generally overkill, but I quickly realised you could do this with a simple piece of JavaScript website code. And that I&#8217;d already built <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/javascript30\/06%20-%20Type%20Ahead\/index.html\">a nice filterable list<\/a> as part of a <a href=\"https:\/\/javascript30.com\/\">free coding course<\/a> that a chap called Wes Bos put together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So within about an hour I&#8217;d re-cycled the code from the course, tweaked it, and added some of the recycling information to make a <a href=\"https:\/\/swindon-recycling.netlify.com\/\">quick prototype<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"281\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-09.53.18-281x300.png\" alt=\"Screen shot of prototype filterable recycling list\" class=\"wp-image-8436\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-09.53.18-281x300.png 281w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-09.53.18-768x819.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-09.53.18.png 930w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" \/><figcaption>Try it: <a href=\"https:\/\/swindon-recycling.netlify.com\/\">https:\/\/swindon-recycling.netlify.com\/<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside: Having done this, I thought &#8220;Oh, maybe the council already have a list like this on their website?&#8221;. They do have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/info\/20015\/bins_rubbish_and_recycling\/138\/recycling_guide\/6\">a full, indexed, A-Z list<\/a>, but it&#8217;s not as good as a filterable one, and adding a filter seems like a relatively simple but very welcome enhancement:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"166\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-10.10.15-166x300.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8437\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-10.10.15-166x300.png 166w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-10.10.15-566x1024.png 566w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-10.10.15.png 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 166px) 100vw, 166px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A good citizen?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I did a bit to promote this idea, and it got a little traction and love. My super local councilor, Jim Robbins, did his best to promote it to the powers that be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a few days later a local journalist asked if he could to a story about it to promote it. To which Jim Robbins replied: &#8220;Swindon Council should be encouraging great citizen engagement like this&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I&#8217;m a bit shy, and the local press (not necessarily this specific journalist) doesn&#8217;t have a great reputation for presenting things accurately. They can make a story out of nothing sometimes &#8211; welcome to <a href=\"https:\/\/apiln.blogspot.com\/\">local journalism<\/a>! So I wasn&#8217;t sure how this would go down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this comment about encouraging citizen engagement was interesting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other reason I&#8217;m hesitant to have a story about this prototype at this point is that&#8230;well&#8230;am I ALLOWED to make something like this? The leaflet has no copyright notice on it so it is copyright by default. The website is explicitly copyrighted by the council.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So can I take this data and re-purpose it? Would I be at risk of hindering the council in doing this, for example, if the list got out of date? Would I be at risk of impersonating the council and making something that looks official even though it definitely isn&#8217;t?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, in the words of my councillor, making a tool like this is &#8220;great citizen engagement&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data reuse and recycling<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve got involved in making tech that aids government and democracy. I made a <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/\">Petition Tracker<\/a> that tracks the signatories on government petitions over time. This blew up recently when the &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/241584\">Revoke Article 50 Petition<\/a>&#8221; took off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was able to make the Petition Tracker because the government petition data is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>available in a structured format called JSON that I can process easily with computer code<\/li><li>&#8220;open&#8221; &#8211; that is, I&#8217;m explicitly and freely allowed to use it under a license called the &#8220;Open Government License&#8221;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This open-data has enabled a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/03\/all-the-brexit-revoke-article-50-government-petition-resources\/\">whole raft of tools<\/a> to pop up analysing the petition data in various ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are other things I&#8217;ve made where I&#8217;ve kind-of re-used data where I&#8217;m not entirely sure I&#8217;m allowed to. My <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hey_schoolbot\">SchoolBot<\/a> (private access only for now), for example, uses term dates and other information from the council and school websites to make that data more easily accessible through an &#8220;intelligent&#8221; Facebook messenger &#8220;bot&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9580-169x300.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8439\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9580-169x300.png 169w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9580-577x1024.png 577w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9580.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px\" \/><figcaption>What ARE the school holiday dates?

But was I allowed to copy and use the locations of the &#8220;boxes&#8221;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">On Innovation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold that thought &#8211; let&#8217;s talk about innovation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 18 months ago I attended an &#8220;unconference&#8221; on the topic of digital tech in charities, where one of the sessions was about innovation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this discussion were two general opinions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Innovation is hard because it&#8217;s expensive and hard to get sign-off for and it&#8217;s risky and prone to failure and charities don&#8217;t want to waste donors money on it.<\/li><li>Innovation is easy with modern technology, you can try things out quickly at low cost, fail fast if things don&#8217;t work, pick things that work and develop them further and it&#8217;s a route to improving all sorts of things. It&#8217;s actually riskier to embark on a big, long, time-consuming project with an uncertain outcome.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I admit, the reality is that opinion 1 is probably the most realistic right now, and this was the opinion of most of the people who worked for\/in charities in the room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But technology people prototype ideas and run little side projects all the time and are so used to the way of working outlined in the second opinion. And we see the opportunities that this way of working presents. My <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/projects\/\">list of side projects<\/a> is testament to this approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And &#8211; I should add &#8211; I don&#8217;t believe innovation needs to be purely digital. Heck, even Dyson (still) make cardboard prototypes of things to try them out!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>one day I was at a local sawmill and noticed how the sawdust was being  removed from the air by large industrial cyclones. My engineering  instinct kicked in. Could that work on a smaller scale? So I created a  cardboard prototype and strapped it on to my machine. It didn\u2019t look  great, but it picked up more dust. Fifteen years and 5,000 prototypes  later, I had a bagless vacuum cleaner.<\/p><cite>James Dyson in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/culture\/2016\/may\/24\/interview-james-dyson-vacuum-cleaner\">The Guardian<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Opportunities of Innovation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So what if there are some good citizens out there who have interesting ideas about how to use information technology to improve public services, make life better and easier for fellow citizens, help charities and businesses be more effective?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what if those ideas aren&#8217;t being explored because the people who own the data don&#8217;t make it available in usable formats, and allow it to be copied and repurposed?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the data\/information\/content the council owned was more open, could tech-savvy people like me, who want to improve things for themselves and others, at low cost, be empowered to innovate with digital (and non-digital) technology, and allow the council to take the ideas that look like they are working and move them forward to make official tools?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A closing note on the actual risks and issues<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two more things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, I&#8217;m sure there are tech teams working on stuff like this for the council. I&#8217;m sure they are cash-strapped and have limited remits. But I&#8217;m also guessing that they work for huge corporations like Capita. I&#8217;m sure that both the local councils and the IT companies that they employ have lots of red-tape and budgetary constraints and so on. I have experienced some of this first hand through the council&#8217;s procurement processes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I suppose this is my challenge: innovation can&#8217;t work within these kinds of processes. A single freelance web developer like me can take what exists and make something better in a very short space of time at very low cost. Are these ideas at least worth exploring somehow? Is it worth having a framework for innovation that allows ideas like this to be evaluated?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I know this seems like a rosy, utopian view of how local government works or could work. The reality is that you don&#8217;t want people taking data and abusing it, masquerading as the authorities and confusing people, profiting unnecessarily from it, or putting unnecessary burden on the authorities. I understand all that. How real are these risks? I don&#8217;t know. How can they be managed? I&#8217;m not sure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I can&#8217;t help thinking that good citizens like me with useful skills and ideas are prevented from using those skills for the public good. The Petition Tracker and related tools show how open data can be great.  I&#8217;d love to see local governments working more like this.<\/p>\n",

But&#8230;if I did so there wouldn&#8217;t be room for any cute pictures that my kids drew, or of those stupid ClubCard vouchers that I keep forgetting to spend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9555-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Swindon's new recycling leaflet\" class=\"wp-image-8435\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9555-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9555-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9555-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Swindon&#8217;s new recycling information leaflet<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s HUGE! (I do not have Donald Trump-sized hands!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I saw this I immediately thought: wouldn&#8217;t it be great if there was a simple app or something where I could search for materials to quickly find out if they are recyclable and which bin\/box\/bag they should go in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apps are generally overkill, but I quickly realised you could do this with a simple piece of JavaScript website code. And that I&#8217;d already built <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/javascript30\/06%20-%20Type%20Ahead\/index.html\">a nice filterable list<\/a> as part of a <a href=\"https:\/\/javascript30.com\/\">free coding course<\/a> that a chap called Wes Bos put together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So within about an hour I&#8217;d re-cycled the code from the course, tweaked it, and added some of the recycling information to make a <a href=\"https:\/\/swindon-recycling.netlify.com\/\">quick prototype<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"281\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-09.53.18-281x300.png\" alt=\"Screen shot of prototype filterable recycling list\" class=\"wp-image-8436\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-09.53.18-281x300.png 281w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-09.53.18-768x819.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-09.53.18.png 930w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" \/><figcaption>Try it: <a href=\"https:\/\/swindon-recycling.netlify.com\/\">https:\/\/swindon-recycling.netlify.com\/<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside: Having done this, I thought &#8220;Oh, maybe the council already have a list like this on their website?&#8221;. They do have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/info\/20015\/bins_rubbish_and_recycling\/138\/recycling_guide\/6\">a full, indexed, A-Z list<\/a>, but it&#8217;s not as good as a filterable one, and adding a filter seems like a relatively simple but very welcome enhancement:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"166\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-10.10.15-166x300.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8437\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-10.10.15-166x300.png 166w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-10.10.15-566x1024.png 566w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-10.10.15.png 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 166px) 100vw, 166px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A good citizen?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I did a bit to promote this idea, and it got a little traction and love. My super local councilor, Jim Robbins, did his best to promote it to the powers that be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a few days later a local journalist asked if he could to a story about it to promote it. To which Jim Robbins replied: &#8220;Swindon Council should be encouraging great citizen engagement like this&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I&#8217;m a bit shy, and the local press (not necessarily this specific journalist) doesn&#8217;t have a great reputation for presenting things accurately. They can make a story out of nothing sometimes &#8211; welcome to <a href=\"https:\/\/apiln.blogspot.com\/\">local journalism<\/a>! So I wasn&#8217;t sure how this would go down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this comment about encouraging citizen engagement was interesting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other reason I&#8217;m hesitant to have a story about this prototype at this point is that&#8230;well&#8230;am I ALLOWED to make something like this? The leaflet has no copyright notice on it so it is copyright by default. The website is explicitly copyrighted by the council.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So can I take this data and re-purpose it? Would I be at risk of hindering the council in doing this, for example, if the list got out of date? Would I be at risk of impersonating the council and making something that looks official even though it definitely isn&#8217;t?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, in the words of my councillor, making a tool like this is &#8220;great citizen engagement&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data reuse and recycling<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve got involved in making tech that aids government and democracy. I made a <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/\">Petition Tracker<\/a> that tracks the signatories on government petitions over time. This blew up recently when the &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/241584\">Revoke Article 50 Petition<\/a>&#8221; took off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was able to make the Petition Tracker because the government petition data is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>available in a structured format called JSON that I can process easily with computer code<\/li><li>&#8220;open&#8221; &#8211; that is, I&#8217;m explicitly and freely allowed to use it under a license called the &#8220;Open Government License&#8221;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This open-data has enabled a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/03\/all-the-brexit-revoke-article-50-government-petition-resources\/\">whole raft of tools<\/a> to pop up analysing the petition data in various ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are other things I&#8217;ve made where I&#8217;ve kind-of re-used data where I&#8217;m not entirely sure I&#8217;m allowed to. My <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hey_schoolbot\">SchoolBot<\/a> (private access only for now), for example, uses term dates and other information from the council and school websites to make that data more easily accessible through an &#8220;intelligent&#8221; Facebook messenger &#8220;bot&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9580-169x300.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8439\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9580-169x300.png 169w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9580-577x1024.png 577w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9580.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px\" \/><figcaption>What ARE the school holiday dates? SchoolBot knows!<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>And after the huge success of &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/beatthestreet.me\/UserPortal\/Default\">Beat the Street<\/a>&#8221; in Swindon last year, I made an experimental &#8220;virtual&#8221; clone of the game, called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zapthemap.com\/\">Zap the Map<\/a>, that you can play with a smartphone. But was I allowed to copy and use the locations of the &#8220;boxes&#8221;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">On Innovation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold that thought &#8211; let&#8217;s talk about innovation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 18 months ago I attended an &#8220;unconference&#8221; on the topic of digital tech in charities, where one of the sessions was about innovation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this discussion were two general opinions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Innovation is hard because it&#8217;s expensive and hard to get sign-off for and it&#8217;s risky and prone to failure and charities don&#8217;t want to waste donors money on it.<\/li><li>Innovation is easy with modern technology, you can try things out quickly at low cost, fail fast if things don&#8217;t work, pick things that work and develop them further and it&#8217;s a route to improving all sorts of things. It&#8217;s actually riskier to embark on a big, long, time-consuming project with an uncertain outcome.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I admit, the reality is that opinion 1 is probably the most realistic right now, and this was the opinion of most of the people who worked for\/in charities in the room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But technology people prototype ideas and run little side projects all the time and are so used to the way of working outlined in the second opinion. And we see the opportunities that this way of working presents. My <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/projects\/\">list of side projects<\/a> is testament to this approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And &#8211; I should add &#8211; I don&#8217;t believe innovation needs to be purely digital. Heck, even Dyson (still) make cardboard prototypes of things to try them out!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>one day I was at a local sawmill and noticed how the sawdust was being  removed from the air by large industrial cyclones. My engineering  instinct kicked in. Could that work on a smaller scale? So I created a  cardboard prototype and strapped it on to my machine. It didn\u2019t look  great, but it picked up more dust. Fifteen years and 5,000 prototypes  later, I had a bagless vacuum cleaner.<\/p><cite>James Dyson in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/culture\/2016\/may\/24\/interview-james-dyson-vacuum-cleaner\">The Guardian<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Opportunities of Innovation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So what if there are some good citizens out there who have interesting ideas about how to use information technology to improve public services, make life better and easier for fellow citizens, help charities and businesses be more effective?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what if those ideas aren&#8217;t being explored because the people who own the data don&#8217;t make it available in usable formats, and allow it to be copied and repurposed?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the data\/information\/content the council owned was more open, could tech-savvy people like me, who want to improve things for themselves and others, at low cost, be empowered to innovate with digital (and non-digital) technology, and allow the council to take the ideas that look like they are working and move them forward to make official tools?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A closing note on the actual risks and issues<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two more things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, I&#8217;m sure there are tech teams working on stuff like this for the council. I&#8217;m sure they are cash-strapped and have limited remits. But I&#8217;m also guessing that they work for huge corporations like Capita. I&#8217;m sure that both the local councils and the IT companies that they employ have lots of red-tape and budgetary constraints and so on. I have experienced some of this first hand through the council&#8217;s procurement processes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I suppose this is my challenge: innovation can&#8217;t work within these kinds of processes. A single freelance web developer like me can take what exists and make something better in a very short space of time at very low cost. Are these ideas at least worth exploring somehow? Is it worth having a framework for innovation that allows ideas like this to be evaluated?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I know this seems like a rosy, utopian view of how local government works or could work. The reality is that you don&#8217;t want people taking data and abusing it, masquerading as the authorities and confusing people, profiting unnecessarily from it, or putting unnecessary burden on the authorities. I understand all that. How real are these risks? I don&#8217;t know. How can they be managed? I&#8217;m not sure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I can&#8217;t help thinking that good citizens like me with useful skills and ideas are prevented from using those skills for the public good. The Petition Tracker and related tools show how open data can be great.  I&#8217;d love to see local governments working more like this.<\/p>\n",
