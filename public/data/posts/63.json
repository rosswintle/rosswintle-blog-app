It&#8217;s VERY fast, does good elevation profiles and cue sheets (literally, &#8220;Turn left at Thomas Street&#8221;), and seems to have the easiest route editing functions.  The only problem being that it&#8217;s a bit clunky and lacks some simple things, like having a &#8220;home&#8221; &#8211; you have to zoom in about 8 times at the start of every route.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sticking with Bikely for now, but may convert to the Toaster if they can improve it just a TINY bit more!<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s VERY fast, does good elevation profiles and cue sheets (literally, &#8220;Turn left at Thomas Street&#8221;), and seems to have the easiest route editing functions.  The only problem being that it&#8217;s a bit clunky and lacks some simple things, like having a &#8220;home&#8221; &#8211; you have to zoom in about 8 times at the start of every route.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sticking with Bikely for now, but may convert to the Toaster if they can improve it just a TINY bit more!<\/p>\n",

They do this a couple of times a year and the idea is that we believe God wishes, in some cases, to heal us, and, in all cases, to bring us wholeness.<\/p>\n<p>And so I had Sally and one of the Elders pray for me in person.<\/p>\n<p>Talking about being prayed for is weird, mostly because spiritual things aren&#8217;t easy to describe in words.  In some cases you don&#8217;t feel anything when you&#8217;re being prayed for.  In other cases you will get a sense of peace, or happiness.  Sometimes there is a physical sensation of some sort.  And at other times more unusual things happen &#8211; for example, I&#8217;ve seen people fall over, semi-conscious, kinda like shutting down physically so that God can work on the spiritual stuff &#8211; forced meditation I guess!<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, in this case not much seemed to happen.  Does that mean that nothing has actually happened?  No! Not really.  I believe that whenever we speak to God something happens &#8211; he hears us, understands us, and though we may not see, hear, or feel the effects, we have made a request and had it heard.  A bit like sending a letter to Santa &#8211; nothing happens when you send the letter, but you will (eventually, if you&#8217;re a good boy\/girl) get some kind of response!<\/p>\n<p>And on that Sunday certain things started moving.  Later, at home, I prayed and had my own little conversation with God.  Again, it&#8217;s hard to explain how but I felt that God &#8220;spoke&#8221; to me &#8211; not in words as such, but a message arrived in my mind or my spirit or something &#8211; and he said that I could &#8220;start thinking again&#8221;.  Certain things, in my head, have kinda been on hold while all this illness and injury has been ongoing.  God was telling me that I could take those things off hold.<\/p>\n<p>That was a bit odd as I didn&#8217;t feel any dramatic improvement at that point.<\/p>\n<p>However &#8211; in the morning, on Monday, I felt like a different person!  Really, overnight the pain had gone from being a painful, broken, sort of pain, to being a tired, weary, will-be-better-soon sort of pain.  Psychologically I felt MUCH stronger too.  It really was a remarkable change &#8211; I suddenly felt like me again.  Oh, and I was really hungry!!  My appetite increased substantially!<\/p>\n<p>Following that I&#8217;ve had a steady week &#8211; the pain has come and gone a bit, but it&#8217;s not felt harsh and difficult, it&#8217;s continued to feel like recovery rather than injury.  I&#8217;ve been laughing, smiling, joking, and enjoying myself.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not about to enter into a discourse on the nature of prayer and answers to prayer here &#8211; maybe another time &#8211; I just want to record my experience and give thanks for it.  I&#8217;m happy for people to dismiss this as coincidence, or psychology, or a perfectly normal physical recovery.  But I know that something slightly more than that has happened.  As William Temple once said: &#8220;When I pray, coincidences happen, and when I don&#8217;t, they don&#8217;t.&#8221;<\/p>\n",

They do this a couple of times a year and the idea is that we believe God wishes, in some cases, to heal us, and, in all cases, to bring us wholeness.<\/p>\n<p>And so I had Sally and one of the Elders pray for me in person.<\/p>\n<p>Talking about being prayed for is weird, mostly because spiritual things aren&#8217;t easy to describe in words.  In some cases you don&#8217;t feel anything when you&#8217;re being prayed for.  In other cases you will get a sense of peace, or happiness.  Sometimes there is a physical sensation of some sort.  And at other times more unusual things happen &#8211; for example, I&#8217;ve seen people fall over, semi-conscious, kinda like shutting down physically so that God can work on the spiritual stuff &#8211; forced meditation I guess!<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, in this case not much seemed to happen.  Does that mean that nothing has actually happened?  No! Not really.  I believe that whenever we speak to God something happens &#8211; he hears us, understands us, and though we may not see, hear, or feel the effects, we have made a request and had it heard.  A bit like sending a letter to Santa &#8211; nothing happens when you send the letter, but you will (eventually, if you&#8217;re a good boy\/girl) get some kind of response!<\/p>\n<p>And on that Sunday certain things started moving.  Later, at home, I prayed and had my own little conversation with God.  Again, it&#8217;s hard to explain how but I felt that God &#8220;spoke&#8221; to me &#8211; not in words as such, but a message arrived in my mind or my spirit or something &#8211; and he said that I could &#8220;start thinking again&#8221;.  Certain things, in my head, have kinda been on hold while all this illness and injury has been ongoing.  God was telling me that I could take those things off hold.<\/p>\n<p>That was a bit odd as I didn&#8217;t feel any dramatic improvement at that point.<\/p>\n<p>However &#8211; in the morning, on Monday, I felt like a different person!  Really, overnight the pain had gone from being a painful, broken, sort of pain, to being a tired, weary, will-be-better-soon sort of pain.  Psychologically I felt MUCH stronger too.  It really was a remarkable change &#8211; I suddenly felt like me again.  Oh, and I was really hungry!!  My appetite increased substantially!<\/p>\n<p>Following that I&#8217;ve had a steady week &#8211; the pain has come and gone a bit, but it&#8217;s not felt harsh and difficult, it&#8217;s continued to feel like recovery rather than injury.  I&#8217;ve been laughing, smiling, joking, and enjoying myself.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not about to enter into a discourse on the nature of prayer and answers to prayer here &#8211; maybe another time &#8211; I just want to record my experience and give thanks for it.  I&#8217;m happy for people to dismiss this as coincidence, or psychology, or a perfectly normal physical recovery.  But I know that something slightly more than that has happened.  As William Temple once said: &#8220;When I pray, coincidences happen, and when I don&#8217;t, they don&#8217;t.&#8221;<\/p>\n",

I need to get all the right things to the right places. This means I:<\/p>\n<p>1) Wake up<br \/>2) Have breakfast and stuff and put cycling gear on.<br \/>3) Pack clean clothes (underwear and shirt) &#8211; my jumper and jeans\/trousers having previously been taken there and stored in a locker.<br \/>4) Remember to pack gadgets (phones, organiser, etc) in bag.<br \/>5) Remember to pack security pass in bag.<br \/>6) Remember to take keys.<br \/>7) Pack lunch\/snacks in bag.<br \/>8) Get keys, wallet and change from my &#8220;home&#8221; jeans.<br \/>9) Get bike from shed.<br \/>10) Put helmet, gloves, shoes, jacket, etc on.<br \/>11) Go to work.<\/p>\n<p>Then&#8230;at work:<br \/>1) Lock bike<br \/>2) Put lights in bag<br \/>3) Put computer in bag<br \/>4) Put saddle pack in bag<br \/>5) Take helmet and gloves off<br \/>6) Enter office.<br \/>7) Shower and change, taking trousers and jumper out of the locker and replacing them with bike stuff.<br \/>8) Remembering to take keys and computer into the office.<\/p>\n<p>And then reverse the whole process when I get home.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not simple and, inevitably, goes wrong occasionally.  Usually something simple like leaving my keys in my jeans or putting my lights in the wrong place when I get to the office.  It&#8217;s such a complicated routine that the slightest little thing throws me and risks the whole thing imploding a mess of clothing, gadgets and bike stuff.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I made a slightly more embarassing boo boo, which I blame fairly an squarely on not having done the routine for a week&#8230;I forgot to pack a shirt!!!  Which left me with the tricky dilemma of choosing between wearing a jumper with no shirt underneath &#8211; and hoping nobody notices.  Or wearing a long-sleeved, and not particularly attractive-looking, orange and black cycle jersey all day under the jumper &#8211; and hoping nobody notices.<\/p>\n<p>What would YOU do?<\/p>\n",

Usually something simple like leaving my keys in my jeans or putting my lights in the wrong place when I get to the office.  It&#8217;s such a complicated routine that the slightest little thing throws me and risks the whole thing imploding a mess of clothing, gadgets and bike stuff.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I made a slightly more embarassing boo boo, which I blame fairly an squarely on not having done the routine for a week&#8230;I forgot to pack a shirt!!!  Which left me with the tricky dilemma of choosing between wearing a jumper with no shirt underneath &#8211; and hoping nobody notices.  Or wearing a long-sleeved, and not particularly attractive-looking, orange and black cycle jersey all day under the jumper &#8211; and hoping nobody notices.<\/p>\n<p>What would YOU do?<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>OK, so I should make it clear at this point that, in my head at least, if not on paper, &#8220;52 songs&#8221; is a concept, not a target.  I never thought I&#8217;d learn 52 songs this year, but the idea was to learn SOME pop songs this year, the 52 Songs concept was to give me some discipline to do it, and that&#8217;s what I will continue to do!<\/p>\n<p>So, I considered choosing another song to learn but with the bad and busy week I&#8217;ve had I decided to drop it and learn the last two verses of &#8220;Nothing Ever Happens&#8221;.  I now know all the words and just need to learn the musical bridge before verse 4.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a cool song.  I don&#8217;t know for sure, but I guess it&#8217;s about how we all go about doing our business and work and shopping and stuff, we all have our routines.  But nothing really ever happens, and &#8220;we&#8217;ll all be lonely tonight, and lonely tomorrow.  We don&#8217;t achieve anything by just plodding through a working, consumerist, selfish life.<\/p>\n<p>It reminds me of a book in the Bible called &#8220;Ecclesiastes&#8221;, which starts off:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cUtterly meaningless!  <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Everything is meaningless.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>What does man gain from all his labour  <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>at which he toils under the sun?\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The point of life is not just to wake up and follow the same old routine every day.  That&#8217;s not life.  That&#8217;s missing the point!<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s something else I read about life recently.  This is Tom Wright, the Bishop of Durham, writing about the time when Jesus tells us to love our enemies, and gives examples of how to do this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Think of the best thing you can do for the worst person, and go ahead and do it.  Think of what you&#8217;d really like someone to do for you, and do it for them.  Think of the people to whom you are tempted to be nasty, and lavish generosity on them instead.  These instructions have a fresh, springlike quality.  They are all about new life bursting out energetically, like flowers growing through concrete and startling everyone with their colour and vigour&#8230;Imagine if even a few people around you took Jesus seriously and lived like that.  Life would be exuberant, different, astonishing.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Doesn&#8217;t that sound exciting?!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, this is a huge challenge for us, especially in our me-first culture.  It&#8217;s a huge challenge for me personally &#8211; it sounds massively exciting living that way, but I find it incredibly hard too.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fortunate to have some incredibly loving and generous people around me in the shape of my close friends and family.  They are all different and astonishing in the ways that they love others and live life to the full, and  I&#8217;m hugely thankful for them.<\/p>\n<p>In other places, I don&#8217;t see much of this kind of life at all.  I hardly know my neighbours for example.  I hope that as the weather improves and we start chatting over the fences and in the street, we will get to know them and have opportunities to be generous towards them.<\/p>\n<p>Del Amitri don&#8217;t give suggestions as to how to get out, meet people and find an exuberant life (I like the word exuberant &#8211; I must use it more!).  But they make us think &#8211; what are we doing here?  How can we make life worth living?<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n<p>P.S. I got a little carried away there &#8211; I suspect next week&#8217;s song won&#8217;t be anywhere near as interesting!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>OK, so I should make it clear at this point that, in my head at least, if not on paper, &#8220;52 songs&#8221; is a concept, not a target.  I never thought I&#8217;d learn 52 songs this year, but the idea was to learn SOME pop songs this year, the 52 Songs concept was to give me some discipline to do it, and that&#8217;s what I will continue to do!<\/p>\n<p>So, I considered choosing another song to learn but with the bad and busy week I&#8217;ve had I decided to drop it and learn the last two verses of &#8220;Nothing Ever Happens&#8221;.  I now know all the words and just need to learn the musical bridge before verse 4.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a cool song.  I don&#8217;t know for sure, but I guess it&#8217;s about how we all go about doing our business and work and shopping and stuff, we all have our routines.  But nothing really ever happens, and &#8220;we&#8217;ll all be lonely tonight, and lonely tomorrow.  We don&#8217;t achieve anything by just plodding through a working, consumerist, selfish life.<\/p>\n<p>It reminds me of a book in the Bible called &#8220;Ecclesiastes&#8221;, which starts off:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cUtterly meaningless!  <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Everything is meaningless.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>What does man gain from all his labour  <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>at which he toils under the sun?\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The point of life is not just to wake up and follow the same old routine every day.  That&#8217;s not life.  That&#8217;s missing the point!<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s something else I read about life recently.  This is Tom Wright, the Bishop of Durham, writing about the time when Jesus tells us to love our enemies, and gives examples of how to do this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Think of the best thing you can do for the worst person, and go ahead and do it.  Think of what you&#8217;d really like someone to do for you, and do it for them.  Think of the people to whom you are tempted to be nasty, and lavish generosity on them instead.  These instructions have a fresh, springlike quality.  They are all about new life bursting out energetically, like flowers growing through concrete and startling everyone with their colour and vigour&#8230;Imagine if even a few people around you took Jesus seriously and lived like that.  Life would be exuberant, different, astonishing.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Doesn&#8217;t that sound exciting?!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, this is a huge challenge for us, especially in our me-first culture.  It&#8217;s a huge challenge for me personally &#8211; it sounds massively exciting living that way, but I find it incredibly hard too.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fortunate to have some incredibly loving and generous people around me in the shape of my close friends and family.  They are all different and astonishing in the ways that they love others and live life to the full, and  I&#8217;m hugely thankful for them.<\/p>\n<p>In other places, I don&#8217;t see much of this kind of life at all.  I hardly know my neighbours for example.  I hope that as the weather improves and we start chatting over the fences and in the street, we will get to know them and have opportunities to be generous towards them.<\/p>\n<p>Del Amitri don&#8217;t give suggestions as to how to get out, meet people and find an exuberant life (I like the word exuberant &#8211; I must use it more!).  But they make us think &#8211; what are we doing here?  How can we make life worth living?<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n<p>P.S. I got a little carried away there &#8211; I suspect next week&#8217;s song won&#8217;t be anywhere near as interesting!<\/p>\n",

Too cluttered and didn&#8217;t really get what it was all about.  Then, a while back, Facebook became popular.  It was a real big thing in 2007 and I became a fully-addicted member in about <a href=\"http:\/\/wintle.blogspot.com\/2007\/05\/sunday-evening-brain-dump.html\">May time<\/a>.  I was a bit skeptical about it. but I&#8217;ve really enjoyed using it to keep up with what&#8217;s going on with my friends.  It DOES have some Friends-Reunited type functionality, but I&#8217;ve rarely spent much time reconnecting with old friends.  I mostly use it to watch the short status updates of my real-world friends, share photos, and to play Scrabulous (clever online version of Scrabble).<\/p>\n<p>More and more on Facebook, the advertising is creeping in, and the small amount of useful functionality is becoming obscured by alerts that I&#8217;d rather not see, and invitations to use pointless applications.<\/p>\n<p>It seems I&#8217;m not the only one with &#8220;Facebook Fatigue&#8221; either, as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theregister.co.uk\/2008\/01\/31\/myspace_fb_comscore_drop\/\">this article<\/a> from The Register suggests.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/p>\n<p>Blogs!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I also enjoy reading other people&#8217;s blogs in order to keep up with them.  This is also a kind of social networking for me.  And, of course, one of my reasons for writing this stuff is so that other people can keep up with me (not many do, but that&#8217;s OK &#8211; there are other reasons to write).<\/p>\n<p>But my blog entries take a lot of time to write and I&#8217;m often a week or so behind where I actually want to be with posts.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;Micro-Blogging&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><\/span>The status updates in Facebook are really a kind of &#8220;micro-blogging&#8221;.  Small statements about what&#8217;s going on with your life to allow others to keep up with you.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve not looked up a definition of &#8220;micro-blogging&#8221; but the concept seems to be a series of small notes that track those smaller updates and thoughts that occur between longer &#8220;macro blog&#8221; entries that people might be publishing about themselves.<\/p>\n<p>I would, in fact, much prefer it if the people I use Facebook to keep up with would do some form of Blogging or &#8220;micro-blogging&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Twitter<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Twitter is a tool that allows this sort of thing.  It&#8217;s stupidly simple.  You can write a status update of 140 characters from the web, your phone (by SMS or mobile web), or using a Google Chat.  These can be read by your &#8220;followers&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>You can also choose to &#8220;follow&#8221; others, and you can choose to get updates from others from the website, by SMS, or through your Google Chat.<\/p>\n<p>So, I have been doing a bit of Twittering to see if anyone follows.<\/p>\n<p>It feels a bit silly and self-indulgent.  But so did Facebook when it started.  I wonder if others would follow me in defecting if they knew what it was and why I was doing it?  I wonder if others are fed up of the constant hassling of Facebook applications and just want to know what&#8217;s going on with their friends and family?<\/p>\n<p>Maybe Twitter gives information overload if you have too many people that you&#8217;re following?  I&#8217;m not sure.  But my future feels like it&#8217;s more with micro-blogging, using whatever tool, than with Facebook.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

Too cluttered and didn&#8217;t really get what it was all about.  Then, a while back, Facebook became popular.  It was a real big thing in 2007 and I became a fully-addicted member in about <a href=\"http:\/\/wintle.blogspot.com\/2007\/05\/sunday-evening-brain-dump.html\">May time<\/a>.  I was a bit skeptical about it. but I&#8217;ve really enjoyed using it to keep up with what&#8217;s going on with my friends.  It DOES have some Friends-Reunited type functionality, but I&#8217;ve rarely spent much time reconnecting with old friends.  I mostly use it to watch the short status updates of my real-world friends, share photos, and to play Scrabulous (clever online version of Scrabble).<\/p>\n<p>More and more on Facebook, the advertising is creeping in, and the small amount of useful functionality is becoming obscured by alerts that I&#8217;d rather not see, and invitations to use pointless applications.<\/p>\n<p>It seems I&#8217;m not the only one with &#8220;Facebook Fatigue&#8221; either, as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theregister.co.uk\/2008\/01\/31\/myspace_fb_comscore_drop\/\">this article<\/a> from The Register suggests.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/p>\n<p>Blogs!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I also enjoy reading other people&#8217;s blogs in order to keep up with them.  This is also a kind of social networking for me.  And, of course, one of my reasons for writing this stuff is so that other people can keep up with me (not many do, but that&#8217;s OK &#8211; there are other reasons to write).<\/p>\n<p>But my blog entries take a lot of time to write and I&#8217;m often a week or so behind where I actually want to be with posts.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;Micro-Blogging&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><\/span>The status updates in Facebook are really a kind of &#8220;micro-blogging&#8221;.  Small statements about what&#8217;s going on with your life to allow others to keep up with you.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve not looked up a definition of &#8220;micro-blogging&#8221; but the concept seems to be a series of small notes that track those smaller updates and thoughts that occur between longer &#8220;macro blog&#8221; entries that people might be publishing about themselves.<\/p>\n<p>I would, in fact, much prefer it if the people I use Facebook to keep up with would do some form of Blogging or &#8220;micro-blogging&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Twitter<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Twitter is a tool that allows this sort of thing.  It&#8217;s stupidly simple.  You can write a status update of 140 characters from the web, your phone (by SMS or mobile web), or using a Google Chat.  These can be read by your &#8220;followers&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>You can also choose to &#8220;follow&#8221; others, and you can choose to get updates from others from the website, by SMS, or through your Google Chat.<\/p>\n<p>So, I have been doing a bit of Twittering to see if anyone follows.<\/p>\n<p>It feels a bit silly and self-indulgent.  But so did Facebook when it started.  I wonder if others would follow me in defecting if they knew what it was and why I was doing it?  I wonder if others are fed up of the constant hassling of Facebook applications and just want to know what&#8217;s going on with their friends and family?<\/p>\n<p>Maybe Twitter gives information overload if you have too many people that you&#8217;re following?  I&#8217;m not sure.  But my future feels like it&#8217;s more with micro-blogging, using whatever tool, than with Facebook.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

At least we think it&#8217;s dead rat.  It stinks a bit, but we&#8217;re kinda used to it now.  They ate all the pest-controller&#8217;s poison and he came back and re-baited the place, and they haven&#8217;t eaten any more since that second visit.  Which suggests that they haven&#8217;t eaten anything.  Which suggests that they&#8217;re dead!  We&#8217;ve not heard them for a while either so it&#8217;s all looking good rat-wise.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also been outside and plugged up the holes where we think they were getting in.  So hopefully that&#8217;ll be the last vermin we have to deal with for a while.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Backs<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I mentioned in passing the other week that I had a bad back again.  This all started a couple of days after my post-Christmas &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/wintle.blogspot.com\/2008\/01\/good-ride-today.html\">good ride<\/a>&#8220;.  It started in my middle back, faded after a couple of days, and then came back with a vengeance in my lower back.  Crazy country dancing at the wedding the other week didn&#8217;t help of course.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen the physio twice and all he seems to be able to do is move the pain around, rather than fix it.   Looks like everything from my  hamstrings to my hip flexors is screwed up and tight.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve tried doing a bit of cycling with it (as you will read about elsewhere) and that, oddly, seems to help.  But it&#8217;s not going away and it&#8217;s causing me more pain and frustration.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span>  I had a really low evening mid-week where it all got to me, but I&#8217;ve picked myself up again and have been feeling a bit more myself in the last couple of days.<\/p>\n<p>The real improvement seems to have come by doing nothing &#8211; no stretching, no cycling, just sitting or lying still for as long as possible each day.  I think all the muscles need to just relax themselves.  I&#8217;m learning AGAIN not to throw myself into things too much and that sometimes I just need to stop.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Not Cycling<\/span><\/p>\n<p>NOT cycling is an odd thing for me to be writing about.  But I am not-cycling at the moment because of my back.  Which means I&#8217;m driving to work.  Which is, itself, depressing and frustrating.<\/p>\n<p>Most people in Swindon can&#8217;t live more than a few miles from where they work, yet they insist on sitting in queues of traffic for hours on end looking miserable and angry.  It really bothers me.  Perhaps they&#8217;ve never considered that cycling or walking is an option?  I&#8217;d much rather be moving on two wheels than sat doing nothing in a big box on 4.  Plus, the globe is warming and petrol prices are going sky-high (104.9 at Sainsbury&#8217;s!).  Why drive?  Once I&#8217;m 100% well again I&#8217;m definitely doing as much not-driving as possible!<\/p>\n<p>I wonder what we can do to get people out of there cars more.  It strikes me that if we can&#8217;t do it in a small town with excellent cycle routes like Swindon then where CAN we do it?<\/p>\n",

We&#8217;ve not heard them for a while either so it&#8217;s all looking good rat-wise.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also been outside and plugged up the holes where we think they were getting in.  So hopefully that&#8217;ll be the last vermin we have to deal with for a while.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Backs<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I mentioned in passing the other week that I had a bad back again.  This all started a couple of days after my post-Christmas &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/wintle.blogspot.com\/2008\/01\/good-ride-today.html\">good ride<\/a>&#8220;.  It started in my middle back, faded after a couple of days, and then came back with a vengeance in my lower back.  Crazy country dancing at the wedding the other week didn&#8217;t help of course.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen the physio twice and all he seems to be able to do is move the pain around, rather than fix it.   Looks like everything from my  hamstrings to my hip flexors is screwed up and tight.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve tried doing a bit of cycling with it (as you will read about elsewhere) and that, oddly, seems to help.  But it&#8217;s not going away and it&#8217;s causing me more pain and frustration.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span>  I had a really low evening mid-week where it all got to me, but I&#8217;ve picked myself up again and have been feeling a bit more myself in the last couple of days.<\/p>\n<p>The real improvement seems to have come by doing nothing &#8211; no stretching, no cycling, just sitting or lying still for as long as possible each day.  I think all the muscles need to just relax themselves.  I&#8217;m learning AGAIN not to throw myself into things too much and that sometimes I just need to stop.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Not Cycling<\/span><\/p>\n<p>NOT cycling is an odd thing for me to be writing about.  But I am not-cycling at the moment because of my back.  Which means I&#8217;m driving to work.  Which is, itself, depressing and frustrating.<\/p>\n<p>Most people in Swindon can&#8217;t live more than a few miles from where they work, yet they insist on sitting in queues of traffic for hours on end looking miserable and angry.  It really bothers me.  Perhaps they&#8217;ve never considered that cycling or walking is an option?  I&#8217;d much rather be moving on two wheels than sat doing nothing in a big box on 4.  Plus, the globe is warming and petrol prices are going sky-high (104.9 at Sainsbury&#8217;s!).  Why drive?  Once I&#8217;m 100% well again I&#8217;m definitely doing as much not-driving as possible!<\/p>\n<p>I wonder what we can do to get people out of there cars more.  It strikes me that if we can&#8217;t do it in a small town with excellent cycle routes like Swindon then where CAN we do it?<\/p>\n",
