He put a call out for help and advice from others, and I was one of the responders.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The reply I gave was quite long and worthy of being a post of it\u2019s own, so here it is: my own, multi-tooled, mixed-media approach to organisation.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I don&#8217;t think I was much help to Tim because, as he currently does, I use a variety of approaches and am perfectly happy with that. But maybe one of my points here is that a mixed up approach is perfectly OK!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, I find it really useful to separate stuff I\u2019m organising into ephemeral and practical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideas are ephemeral. They accumulate over time and as they accumulate they gain traction in my brain. The drip, drip, drip of thoughts and ideas accumulate until they are ready to become practical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doodling and jotting down in notebooks is IDEAL for ephemeral stuff. I might not want to refer back to it later and it&#8217;s not structured enough to make sense in the long term and to make it worth making it permanent\/searchable\/structured.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually there comes a time when the ephemeral becomes more focused and starts to turn into more structured thoughts or practical actions. At this point stuff tends to become digital and I gather my ephemeral notes and record them digitally and organise them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sounds like I have some wonderful working process, but I really don&#8217;t!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A bit like Tim and other commenters on his post I have:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Physical Notebook(s) for jotting stuff down. I love the focus this gives me. Though, oddly, using an iPad works the same way. I often type blog posts on an iPad and it&#8217;s way less distracting that having my laptop open somehow.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\">Bear Notes<\/a>: For recording everything written I want to remember (except links\/bookmarks which go in Pinboard) plus writing draft blog posts and ideas for talks and videos and stuff. Sadly iOS\/MacOS only.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/trello.com\/\">Trello<\/a>. I use this in two ways: 1) as a high-level project status board (with separate boards for personal, work and household projects) 2) as kanban-style boards for in-flight projects.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ticktick.com\/\">TickTick<\/a> for the day to day &#8220;what the heck am I doing next&#8221; and odd things that don&#8217;t warrant a Trello card. I\u2019ve used a bunch of ToDo apps over the years and TickTick suits me really well. Good apps, cloud sync, reminders, tags. Everything I need in a simple package.<\/li><li>I also use other project management tools for clients that use them. I\u2019m happy to be flexible on a project-by-project basis and have used Asana, Basecamp, simple spreadsheets and plain emails to manage project work. It SUPER important that my clients are happy with the tools we are using to collaborate.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I also think it&#8217;s useful to do something like a physical written-down daily plan at the start of the day. What are the three things I want to do today? Ticking them off gives you satisfaction and some brain chemicals that make you feel good! But I&#8217;m not really sure how this fits with using TickTick for day-to-day todos. Hmm\u2026there ARE too many things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this paper-based, day-o-day stuff, I&#8217;ve used <a href=\"https:\/\/justthree.me\/\">Just Three<\/a> journals by Sam Hotchkiss) pretty successfully, but they no longer exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I use a <a href=\"https:\/\/dailygreatness.co.uk\/collections\/dailygreatness\/products\/dailygreatness-business-planner-blue?variant=13559365599307\">Daily Greatness Business Planner<\/a> on and off too, which I LOVE but it&#8217;s a whole year with week-to-a-page and loads of other stuff too and it&#8217;s just too big to carry around with you. I actually love the planner format, but I want a quarterly planner like this, not a whole year in one book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll see that I use a variety of methods, and that\u2019s because I have a variety of needs. Not just the ephemeral\/practical split  I mentioned earlier; there are other considerations too. But I\u2019m happy with mixed media and a multi-faceted approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, maybe there&#8217;s some helpful stuff there. Let us know what you do!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>My friend Tim wrote <a href=\"https:\/\/timnash.co.uk\/new-year-means-new-plans-and-new-tools\/\">a great blog post<\/a> the other day about his unhappiness with his mixed-up approach to organisational and productivity tools, and his dilemma of whether to use paper or digital tools and processes in future. He put a call out for help and advice from others, and I was one of the responders.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The reply I gave was quite long and worthy of being a post of it\u2019s own, so here it is: my own, multi-tooled, mixed-media approach to organisation.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I don&#8217;t think I was much help to Tim because, as he currently does, I use a variety of approaches and am perfectly happy with that. But maybe one of my points here is that a mixed up approach is perfectly OK!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, I find it really useful to separate stuff I\u2019m organising into ephemeral and practical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideas are ephemeral. They accumulate over time and as they accumulate they gain traction in my brain. The drip, drip, drip of thoughts and ideas accumulate until they are ready to become practical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doodling and jotting down in notebooks is IDEAL for ephemeral stuff. I might not want to refer back to it later and it&#8217;s not structured enough to make sense in the long term and to make it worth making it permanent\/searchable\/structured.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually there comes a time when the ephemeral becomes more focused and starts to turn into more structured thoughts or practical actions. At this point stuff tends to become digital and I gather my ephemeral notes and record them digitally and organise them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sounds like I have some wonderful working process, but I really don&#8217;t!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A bit like Tim and other commenters on his post I have:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Physical Notebook(s) for jotting stuff down. I love the focus this gives me. Though, oddly, using an iPad works the same way. I often type blog posts on an iPad and it&#8217;s way less distracting that having my laptop open somehow.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\">Bear Notes<\/a>: For recording everything written I want to remember (except links\/bookmarks which go in Pinboard) plus writing draft blog posts and ideas for talks and videos and stuff. Sadly iOS\/MacOS only.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/trello.com\/\">Trello<\/a>. I use this in two ways: 1) as a high-level project status board (with separate boards for personal, work and household projects) 2) as kanban-style boards for in-flight projects.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ticktick.com\/\">TickTick<\/a> for the day to day &#8220;what the heck am I doing next&#8221; and odd things that don&#8217;t warrant a Trello card. I\u2019ve used a bunch of ToDo apps over the years and TickTick suits me really well. Good apps, cloud sync, reminders, tags. Everything I need in a simple package.<\/li><li>I also use other project management tools for clients that use them. I\u2019m happy to be flexible on a project-by-project basis and have used Asana, Basecamp, simple spreadsheets and plain emails to manage project work. It SUPER important that my clients are happy with the tools we are using to collaborate.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I also think it&#8217;s useful to do something like a physical written-down daily plan at the start of the day. What are the three things I want to do today? Ticking them off gives you satisfaction and some brain chemicals that make you feel good! But I&#8217;m not really sure how this fits with using TickTick for day-to-day todos. Hmm\u2026there ARE too many things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this paper-based, day-o-day stuff, I&#8217;ve used <a href=\"https:\/\/justthree.me\/\">Just Three<\/a> journals by Sam Hotchkiss) pretty successfully, but they no longer exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I use a <a href=\"https:\/\/dailygreatness.co.uk\/collections\/dailygreatness\/products\/dailygreatness-business-planner-blue?variant=13559365599307\">Daily Greatness Business Planner<\/a> on and off too, which I LOVE but it&#8217;s a whole year with week-to-a-page and loads of other stuff too and it&#8217;s just too big to carry around with you. I actually love the planner format, but I want a quarterly planner like this, not a whole year in one book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll see that I use a variety of methods, and that\u2019s because I have a variety of needs. Not just the ephemeral\/practical split  I mentioned earlier; there are other considerations too. But I\u2019m happy with mixed media and a multi-faceted approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, maybe there&#8217;s some helpful stuff there. Let us know what you do!<\/p>\n",

I tried re-writing this in the past tense but it didn&#8217;t make sense. So just know that this is me writing at the very start of the year a week or so back.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think one of my tech goals for 2020 needs to be getting a proper understanding of building using web \u201ccomponents\u201d. I feel like I understand what components are and how to use them individually, but not how to compose them together onto bigger things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example: I get how a table could be a component. Or a row of a table could be a component. But I don\u2019t think I understand which of those things should be components, or if the rows should be child components of the table component.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried the table-component-with-child-row-components thing once and it was HORRIBLE. Either it\u2019s not \u201cthe way\u201d, or I was doing it totally wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the kind of thing I want to understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m happy to do it in React or Vue or whatever. It\u2019s the principles I want to learn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also think that once I\u2019ve done this, the Tailwind CSS framework (that everyone else raves about but that I don&#8217;t yet &#8220;get&#8221;) will make more sense. I THINK Tailwind and \u201ccomponents\u201d go hand in hand and it will make much more sense to me as creator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still fear that any Tailwind stuff I create will be incomprehensible to others though. ??\u200d\u2642\ufe0f<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all of this I note this piece of wisdom from Adam Wathan &#8211; the creator of Tailwind:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A framework that I&#39;ve found useful for filtering through the bullshit:<br><br>Be suspicious of people who talk about how *you* should do things, and pay close attention to people who talk about what works for *them*.<\/p>&mdash; Adam Wathan (@adamwathan) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adamwathan\/status\/1213870157480767489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 5, 2020<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n",

I tried re-writing this in the past tense but it didn&#8217;t make sense. So just know that this is me writing at the very start of the year a week or so back.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think one of my tech goals for 2020 needs to be getting a proper understanding of building using web \u201ccomponents\u201d. I feel like I understand what components are and how to use them individually, but not how to compose them together onto bigger things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example: I get how a table could be a component. Or a row of a table could be a component. But I don\u2019t think I understand which of those things should be components, or if the rows should be child components of the table component.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried the table-component-with-child-row-components thing once and it was HORRIBLE. Either it\u2019s not \u201cthe way\u201d, or I was doing it totally wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the kind of thing I want to understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m happy to do it in React or Vue or whatever. It\u2019s the principles I want to learn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also think that once I\u2019ve done this, the Tailwind CSS framework (that everyone else raves about but that I don&#8217;t yet &#8220;get&#8221;) will make more sense. I THINK Tailwind and \u201ccomponents\u201d go hand in hand and it will make much more sense to me as creator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still fear that any Tailwind stuff I create will be incomprehensible to others though. ??\u200d\u2642\ufe0f<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all of this I note this piece of wisdom from Adam Wathan &#8211; the creator of Tailwind:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A framework that I&#39;ve found useful for filtering through the bullshit:<br><br>Be suspicious of people who talk about how *you* should do things, and pay close attention to people who talk about what works for *them*.<\/p>&mdash; Adam Wathan (@adamwathan) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adamwathan\/status\/1213870157480767489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 5, 2020<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n",

But, for some reason, I just didn&#8217;t get it. Until I had this revelation about components that has caused me to go and take a serious look.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I want to understand this better!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I did <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/my-new-css-framework-sucss\/\">a bit of a (lengthy) write up last year<\/a> about my history with CSS and how I thought I should write CSS now. But the nagging sense that I was missing something with Tailwind has not gone away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as I explained in <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2020\/01\/understanding-web-components\/\">my last post<\/a>, I started this year with wanting to understand Tailwind and components better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, suddenly, and I can&#8217;t remember where from, I had this revelation about &#8220;components&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT THIS THING IS?!?!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s be clear: I totally get the idea of utility CSS, and I understand the syntax to a point where I could read it but not write it. But I&#8217;ve struggled to get past the initial barriers of understanding utility-FIRST CSS, which is what Tailwind is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get all the arguments people make. People I admire and respect rave about the how they can build more quickly; about how Tailwind code is super easy to change and maintain. I&#8217;m not wedded to semantic class-naming or ideas about how separation of concerns should work (you&#8217;re HTML and CSS are always going to be tied together <em>somehow<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I looked at screenshots of Tailwind code with bafflement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"686\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-1024x686.jpg\" alt=\"TailWind example screenshot\" class=\"wp-image-4497\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-1024x686.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-768x514.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-945x633.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-600x402.jpg 600w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender.jpg 1519w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I fiercely held to the idea that yes, I can work out what this looks like by reading the code, but I don&#8217;t know what that thing <em>IS<\/em>. And if I want more than one of those things (the profile &#8220;card&#8221; in the image above), surely I need to extract all that code into some CSS classes that I can apply and I&#8217;m back where I started?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People talked of &#8220;extracting components&#8221; and I figured this was what they meant: pulling a load of Tailwind properties into a single CSS class so that you can re-use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(For those who are ahead of me&#8230;yes&#8230;I know!! Wait!!)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Great Scott!!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the revelation. Like an Emmet Brown Flux Capacitor moment, only without the slipping in the bathroom and bumping your head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if the extracted components aren&#8217;t CSS? What if, instead you extract the HTML markup to a partial?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>THEN you could still have the MEANING in the project code, the &#8220;what is this?&#8221; can still be present, and you can still get the re-use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my head there&#8217;s a movie scene where I dash to my computer to confirm this revelation; fire up the <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/installation\">Tailwind docs<\/a>; and in some kind of strange, slow-motion dream effect, the truth becomes clear as I read the text:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>&#8220;<strong>Don&#8217;t rely on CSS classes to extract complex components &#8230; <\/strong>it&#8217;s often better to extract reusable pieces of your UI into <em>template partials<\/em> or <em>JavaScript components<\/em> instead of writing custom CSS classes.&#8221;<\/p><cite><a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/extracting-components#extracting-html-components\">Tailwind Docs<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A simple example<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s some more traditional-style markup for some buttons:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;a href=&quot;\/signup&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;\n  Sign up\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;\/login&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;\n  Log in\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll do some conversion to Tailwind. You don&#8217;t really have to know what it means for now:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;a href=&quot;\/signup&quot; class=&quot;inline-block bg-blue-300 px-4 py-3 rounded hover:bg-blue-500 hover:text-white&quot;&gt;\n  Sign up\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;\/login&quot; class=&quot;inline-block bg-blue-300 px-4 py-3 rounded hover:bg-blue-500 hover:text-white&quot;&gt;\n  Log in\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Woah! Look at all the classes and duplication. And&#8230; HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT THIS IS?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now in Tailwind you could extract the classes to your own CSS component. You can use the <code>@apply<\/code> rule to bring Tailwind&#8217;s utilities into a class:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: css; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n.button {\n  @apply inline-block bg-blue-300 px-4 py-3 rounded;\n}\n.button:hover {\n  @apply bg-blue-500 text-white;\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>But now we&#8217;re pretty much back where we started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alternative way &#8211; and the preferred way in utility-first CSS land &#8211; is to extract the HTML to a component.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to pass in parameters for the URL and label. So you would create a template partial like this (in <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/6.x\/blade\">Laravel Blade<\/a> syntax):<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;a href=&quot;{{ $url }}&quot; class=&quot;inline-block bg-blue-300 px-4 py-3 rounded hover:bg-blue-500 hover:text-white&quot;&gt;\n  {{ $label }}\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And then your template with the buttons becomes:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n@include('partials\/components\/button', &#x5B;'url' =&gt; '\/signup', 'label' =&gt; 'Sign up'])\n@include('partials\/components\/button', &#x5B;'url' =&gt; '\/login', 'label' =&gt; 'Log in'])\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>With this we get all the benefits of Tailwind&#8217;s CSS: consistent spacing, fonts, and colours with ease; quick-to-write and easy-to-maintain code, and so on. But with re-usable components, and meaningful &#8220;source&#8221; template code (although the HTML output is still kinda meaningless garbage)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Oooooh!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The big assumptions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I know at this point those of you experienced with components and Tailwind are wondering how on earth I didn&#8217;t understand this. But the truth is that it&#8217;s a key fact in piecing together this puzzle and not once has it been explained to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This understanding of components seems to be assumed. Yet to many coming from an approach like BEM CSS and WordPress world where templates tend not to be broken down into much smaller component-level partials, it&#8217;s something you have to be told or find out somehow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the explanations of Tailwind I&#8217;ve seen me show the code inside the component. Not the code that includes the component. And this is a critical piece of understanding how to work with Tailwind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But what about&#8230;?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I know, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re still getting to grips with this, and is quite a large paradigm shift to make in your head, you probably have loads of questions about how the details of this work in practice?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How do I create button style variants?<\/li><li>What if I want to add some CSS to just one button?<\/li><li>Sometimes buttons are <code>a<\/code> tags and sometimes they are <code>button<\/code> tags&#8230;how do I do that?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I&#8217;ve gone ahead and dabbled with Tailwind, I&#8217;ve found it&#8217;s not without a lot of questions of my own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;it is quite easy to learn. It is easy to set up. It is quick to work with (if you&#8217;re working within what it gives you). It&#8217;s very comprehensive and well thought out. Adam has done a GREAT job making this thing and has my HUGE respect. And I think I can see the attraction of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my next post (which may take a while to compile) I&#8217;m going to try to walk you through my explorations. I&#8217;ve recorded an hour of video that I want to cut into bite-sized chunks and then write up. Hopefully you&#8217;ll see the problems and questions I come across, and I hope you&#8217;ll come to a place where you can make your own mind up about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch this space!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>A huge number of people in my tech circles seemed to love Adam Wathan&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/\">Tailwind CSS<\/a> framework. But, for some reason, I just didn&#8217;t get it. Until I had this revelation about components that has caused me to go and take a serious look.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I want to understand this better!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I did <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/my-new-css-framework-sucss\/\">a bit of a (lengthy) write up last year<\/a> about my history with CSS and how I thought I should write CSS now. But the nagging sense that I was missing something with Tailwind has not gone away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as I explained in <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2020\/01\/understanding-web-components\/\">my last post<\/a>, I started this year with wanting to understand Tailwind and components better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, suddenly, and I can&#8217;t remember where from, I had this revelation about &#8220;components&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT THIS THING IS?!?!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s be clear: I totally get the idea of utility CSS, and I understand the syntax to a point where I could read it but not write it. But I&#8217;ve struggled to get past the initial barriers of understanding utility-FIRST CSS, which is what Tailwind is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get all the arguments people make. People I admire and respect rave about the how they can build more quickly; about how Tailwind code is super easy to change and maintain. I&#8217;m not wedded to semantic class-naming or ideas about how separation of concerns should work (you&#8217;re HTML and CSS are always going to be tied together <em>somehow<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I looked at screenshots of Tailwind code with bafflement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"686\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-1024x686.jpg\" alt=\"TailWind example screenshot\" class=\"wp-image-4497\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-1024x686.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-768x514.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-945x633.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-600x402.jpg 600w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender.jpg 1519w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I fiercely held to the idea that yes, I can work out what this looks like by reading the code, but I don&#8217;t know what that thing <em>IS<\/em>. And if I want more than one of those things (the profile &#8220;card&#8221; in the image above), surely I need to extract all that code into some CSS classes that I can apply and I&#8217;m back where I started?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People talked of &#8220;extracting components&#8221; and I figured this was what they meant: pulling a load of Tailwind properties into a single CSS class so that you can re-use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(For those who are ahead of me&#8230;yes&#8230;I know!! Wait!!)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Great Scott!!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the revelation. Like an Emmet Brown Flux Capacitor moment, only without the slipping in the bathroom and bumping your head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if the extracted components aren&#8217;t CSS? What if, instead you extract the HTML markup to a partial?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>THEN you could still have the MEANING in the project code, the &#8220;what is this?&#8221; can still be present, and you can still get the re-use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my head there&#8217;s a movie scene where I dash to my computer to confirm this revelation; fire up the <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/installation\">Tailwind docs<\/a>; and in some kind of strange, slow-motion dream effect, the truth becomes clear as I read the text:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>&#8220;<strong>Don&#8217;t rely on CSS classes to extract complex components &#8230; <\/strong>it&#8217;s often better to extract reusable pieces of your UI into <em>template partials<\/em> or <em>JavaScript components<\/em> instead of writing custom CSS classes.&#8221;<\/p><cite><a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/extracting-components#extracting-html-components\">Tailwind Docs<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A simple example<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s some more traditional-style markup for some buttons:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;a href=&quot;\/signup&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;\n  Sign up\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;\/login&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;\n  Log in\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll do some conversion to Tailwind. You don&#8217;t really have to know what it means for now:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;a href=&quot;\/signup&quot; class=&quot;inline-block bg-blue-300 px-4 py-3 rounded hover:bg-blue-500 hover:text-white&quot;&gt;\n  Sign up\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;\/login&quot; class=&quot;inline-block bg-blue-300 px-4 py-3 rounded hover:bg-blue-500 hover:text-white&quot;&gt;\n  Log in\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Woah! Look at all the classes and duplication. And&#8230; HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT THIS IS?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now in Tailwind you could extract the classes to your own CSS component. You can use the <code>@apply<\/code> rule to bring Tailwind&#8217;s utilities into a class:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: css; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n.button {\n  @apply inline-block bg-blue-300 px-4 py-3 rounded;\n}\n.button:hover {\n  @apply bg-blue-500 text-white;\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>But now we&#8217;re pretty much back where we started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alternative way &#8211; and the preferred way in utility-first CSS land &#8211; is to extract the HTML to a component.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to pass in parameters for the URL and label. So you would create a template partial like this (in <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/6.x\/blade\">Laravel Blade<\/a> syntax):<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;a href=&quot;{{ $url }}&quot; class=&quot;inline-block bg-blue-300 px-4 py-3 rounded hover:bg-blue-500 hover:text-white&quot;&gt;\n  {{ $label }}\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And then your template with the buttons becomes:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n@include('partials\/components\/button', &#x5B;'url' =&gt; '\/signup', 'label' =&gt; 'Sign up'])\n@include('partials\/components\/button', &#x5B;'url' =&gt; '\/login', 'label' =&gt; 'Log in'])\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>With this we get all the benefits of Tailwind&#8217;s CSS: consistent spacing, fonts, and colours with ease; quick-to-write and easy-to-maintain code, and so on. But with re-usable components, and meaningful &#8220;source&#8221; template code (although the HTML output is still kinda meaningless garbage)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Oooooh!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The big assumptions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I know at this point those of you experienced with components and Tailwind are wondering how on earth I didn&#8217;t understand this. But the truth is that it&#8217;s a key fact in piecing together this puzzle and not once has it been explained to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This understanding of components seems to be assumed. Yet to many coming from an approach like BEM CSS and WordPress world where templates tend not to be broken down into much smaller component-level partials, it&#8217;s something you have to be told or find out somehow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the explanations of Tailwind I&#8217;ve seen me show the code inside the component. Not the code that includes the component. And this is a critical piece of understanding how to work with Tailwind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But what about&#8230;?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I know, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re still getting to grips with this, and is quite a large paradigm shift to make in your head, you probably have loads of questions about how the details of this work in practice?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How do I create button style variants?<\/li><li>What if I want to add some CSS to just one button?<\/li><li>Sometimes buttons are <code>a<\/code> tags and sometimes they are <code>button<\/code> tags&#8230;how do I do that?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I&#8217;ve gone ahead and dabbled with Tailwind, I&#8217;ve found it&#8217;s not without a lot of questions of my own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;it is quite easy to learn. It is easy to set up. It is quick to work with (if you&#8217;re working within what it gives you). It&#8217;s very comprehensive and well thought out. Adam has done a GREAT job making this thing and has my HUGE respect. And I think I can see the attraction of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my next post (which may take a while to compile) I&#8217;m going to try to walk you through my explorations. I&#8217;ve recorded an hour of video that I want to cut into bite-sized chunks and then write up. Hopefully you&#8217;ll see the problems and questions I come across, and I hope you&#8217;ll come to a place where you can make your own mind up about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch this space!<\/p>\n",

And I wanted to try and cut through it a bit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Security &#8211; not just on computers, but in other places too &#8211; is a trade-off of convenience for safety. It would be great if we could leave all our doors unlocked and not have to carry keys, for example. But people would go into our houses and steal our stuff. So we add locks and have the inconvenience of carrying keys, and of sometimes forgetting them and getting locked out. This is the trade off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next level of home security might be to add an alarm. This gets you extra safety, but you need to arm and disarm the alarm, remember the code, put up with annoying false alarms, and so on. You get extra security, but pay the price of convenience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are different levels of internet security too. And just as some people have more valuable stuff in their homes and want more security, some people have more valuable internet stuff and need greater online protections. Not all levels are appropriate for everybody.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT being on the first step &#8211; the lowest level &#8211; probably isn&#8217;t a great idea for anyone. No one has a three-digit combination lock on their front door.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s a list of steps you can take with internet\/online security. Each step is an increase in security, but in most cases with more complexity, inconvenience and\/or cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disclaimer: You are entirely responsible for your own internet security. I can not be held liable for anything that happens as a result of your decisions to use or not use one of the tools or approaches outlined below. Thanks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Level 1: Stop using the same password for everything<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use one password for everything, then stop doing so. Why? Well, your personal details can be hacked or become public. The <a href=\"https:\/\/haveibeenpwned.com\/\">Have I been Pwned website<\/a> can tell you if your details are public because of a data breach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your email address and password are somehow &#8220;out there&#8221; then other nasty people can take them and try to log in with them. And once they have access to one thing of yours, they may be able to get access to others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the very least you should identify critical services and set different passwords for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, once your email account is hacked, people can do password resets for other things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your Facebook is hacked then people may have access to services where you use a Facebook login button.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if your Amazon account is hacked then people can send themselves cheap plastic or electronic tat at your expense as it stores your payment cards online!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you have email on your own domain like &#8220;<a href=\"mailto:me@mydomain.com\">me@mydomain.com<\/a>&#8221; rather than GMail or Outlook or Yahoo mail then consider your domain and hosting accounts special too. If they get hacked it may be possible to redirect your email elsewhere and then, again, other things can be gotten into using email-based password resets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Level 2: Use complex passwords<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A complex password is one that is hard to guess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Easy-to-guess passwords are those that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>contain commonly used words or patterns (see the most <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_the_most_common_passwords\">common password lists<\/a>!)<\/li><li>contain dictionary words or commonly used names like football teams<\/li><li>simple variations of these things created by adding numbers or changing letters to numbers, like swapping an &#8216;o&#8217; for a zero.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These common patterns and tricks are all know by the nasty people who want to hack you and they will try them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do NOT type your actual password into here (or anywhere that you don&#8217;t trust). Let me say that again: do NOT type your actual password in here. But you can use a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/howsecureismypassword.net\/\">How Secure Is My Password<\/a> to see how long it might take a hacker to guess different kinds of password.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a long, complex and randomly-generated password is better, even though it&#8217;s hard to remember. I&#8217;d argue that even if you write it down, that&#8217;s still better. Most hacks are not by people who steal your wallet or handbag. They are by armies of computer programs trying to get into your online profiles from afar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So having &#8220;8xgbek65sg$gstv:&#8221; as a password written on a piece of paper that you keep safely somewhere is probably better than having a password like &#8220;JackIsAwesome77&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it doesn&#8217;t have to be a random collection of letters, numbers and symbols. You can also combine random words together such as &#8220;proud-taken-dollar&#8221; and this is MORE secure and easier to remember. If you ignore the geeky maths and terminology this little cartoon explains that: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.xkcd.com\/936\/\">https:\/\/www.xkcd.com\/936\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 3: Combine levels 1 and 2 and use a password manager<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A password manager is a tool that stores all your passwords, and generates new ones for you. They keep everything secure and encrypted, and you just need to remember one strong, complex master password to get access to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a password manager you can use a different, and complex password on every website that you can create an account on!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example password manager tools are <a href=\"https:\/\/1password.com\/\">1Password<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lastpass.com\/\">LastPass<\/a>, which are not open-source, but are easy to get started with and well supported. Open source tools also exist such as <a href=\"https:\/\/keepass.info\/\">KeePass<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/bitwarden.com\/\">Bitwarden<\/a>, but they are harder to get started with, so not for the non-tech-savvy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always remember to use a service that is trusted and recommended before typing passwords into it. Some web browsers also have password remembering built in, but remember that this only works for that browser &#8211; if you use a different web browser one day your remembered passwords won&#8217;t be there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Password managers cost a little bit of money, but seriously, it&#8217;s the cost of like two cups of coffee a month. Is keeping safe online worth that? (This is a rhetorical question and the answer is YES IT IS!!!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in a strange twist to what I said earlier, passsword managers may actually be MORE convenient as well as more secure. Many have tools that automatically fill in log in forms for you and if you take time to learn the tools well and use keyboard shortcuts you&#8217;ll probably find them more convenient. Here&#8217;s a video I recorded demonstrating that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/336674830?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"387\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 4: Use &#8220;2 factor authentication&#8221; for critical services<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two-factor authentication (which may go under a different name in some places) is where you have to do something else after entering a password to prove that you are you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could be sending a code to your phone, making you tap something in an app on your phone, or using an app on your phone to generate a code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With two-factor authentication enabled, if someone gets hold of or manages to guess your password (which you can assume they will) they will need something else to log in. Plus, these codes also only work once, so even if someone got a code it probably wouldn&#8217;t work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So level 4 is to start using this two-factor login for some of the critical services like email, domain names, hosting and social media accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some intricacies to this. It&#8217;s suggested that codes to your phone may not be a good idea as your phone can be hijacked. Storing the codes in the same place as your passwords (as some password managers allow you to do) may be putting all of your eggs in one basket. And the Google Authenticator app forgets all your codes if you get a new phone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;you&#8217;re always better off with two-factor codes, regardless of how you store them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s worth noting that many places will refer to the Google Authenticator app, but most one-time code apps (such as <a href=\"https:\/\/authy.com\/\">Authy<\/a>, or the tools built in to password managers) do exactly the same thing and can be used as a replacement for Google Authenticator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 5: Use 2 factor codes for as many things as possible&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;and store the codes in you password manager for convenience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As stated in Level 4, this is an all-your-eggs-in-one-basket approach but password managers make this really convenient and two-factor is always a step up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you&#8217;re used to using it on your critical services, start to turn it on in other places too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 6: Use 2 factor codes for as many things as possible&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;but store them somewhere other than your password manager.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is harder to do and we&#8217;re kinda into the realm of high levels of inconvenience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously-mentioned apps like Google Authenticator and Authy help you to do it. But then you need to remember another PIN or password. And it may be, if both your passwords and the codes are on your phone, that your phone becomes the single thing that knows everything, and this isn&#8217;t do great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key here is to be thinking about keeping the &#8220;two factors&#8221; &#8211; the passwords and the codes &#8211; separate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to achieve this might be just to use different master passwords for your password manager and two-factor code app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, if you&#8217;re read this far you are probably taking security very seriously and can start to do your own research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 7: Physical security keys<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Physical security keys, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yubico.com\/\">Yubikeys<\/a>, are small devices that you plug into a USB port, lightning port on your phone, or use an &#8220;NFC&#8221; tap (like a contactless payment card) to identify you. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are expensive but give you a couple of additional levels of security:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It proves that it&#8217;s actually you (or whoever has the key) physically present at the login.<\/li><li>They ensure that you&#8217;re authenticating with a REAL site, not a fake\/phishing site designed to steal your details.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you re-sell hosting or deal with sensitive personal data under GDPR you should probably be looking at this kind of technology, and it&#8217;s actually super easy to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you lose or forget your key? Well, you would probably have your 2FA codes as a backup! And you can also buy two keys: one to carry with you, and a backup to keep in a safe or something. Both keys will need to be registered with each service you use them on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve found that these keys are actually incredibly convenient. And there are good guides to getting started:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/paulstamatiou.com\/getting-started-with-security-keys\/\">Getting Started with Security Keys<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/timnash.co.uk\/feitian-epass-u2f-2-factor-authentication\/\">Tim Nash&#8217;s expereinces getting started with a Feitian ePass key<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This probably all sounds a bit scary and there&#8217;s lots of information and technical stuff here. I add that this is not a comprehensive or definitive list of levels. It&#8217;s just how I see things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;you should take this seriously and not be scared by the higher levels if you&#8217;re not there yet or don&#8217;t need that level of security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d encourage everyone to evaluate which level they are on, and seriously consider if they could move to the next level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an area that I&#8217;m REALLY keen to help less technical people with. So if that&#8217;s you drop me a line and I&#8217;ll see what I can do to help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally&#8230;I&#8217;ve not actually said which level I&#8217;m on or what I do for security. You can assume I&#8217;m on one of the higher levels, but I would never publish my security strategy, and neither should you. ALWAYS keep your security details, logins, passwords and so on private and only ever share details with people you 100% trust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">BONUS: Sending passwords to people<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Occasionally&#8230;VERY occasionally&#8230;you may need to send a login to someone else. As a web developer who helps people with email and websites I get this a lot. So here are some things to consider about that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Do you need to send a login?:<\/strong> Many services where you need to give access to someone else allow you to add other people. Examples of this that I frequently come across are: WordPress, CloudFlare, MailChimp and Facebook pages or apps. Add a new user if you can. Then&#8230;when that person no longer needs access, remove it or delete them. Don&#8217;t send a login if you don&#8217;t need to!<\/li><li><strong>Email is probably not secure:<\/strong> If you really do need to send a login, there is no guarantee that email is encrypted or secure. Assume your message can be intercepted and read by someone other than the recipient. So do not send complete login details by email.<\/li><li><strong>Email may persist:<\/strong> There is no guarantee that an email will be deleted by the recipient. If you email someone login details they may sit in that person&#8217;s inbox for years to come. So, again, don&#8217;t send complete login details by email. If you do, or have ever done so, change the password for that account.<\/li><li><strong>Split the details up!<\/strong>: Splitting up the login details over two different communication methods is a good stragety. Like with passwords this makes the process a bit &#8220;two factor&#8221;. If the username is intercepted by email, the hacker still won&#8217;t have the password. So, for example, send the username by email, but send the password using a text message or messenger app.  For an extra bit of security don&#8217;t mention where to use the login details. Say &#8220;here&#8217;s the password you need&#8221; rather than &#8220;Here&#8217;s the password for my Facebook account&#8221;.<\/li><li><strong>Use a one-time messaging service<\/strong>: There are services that basically work like a &#8220;this message will self destruct&#8221; service. I often use <a href=\"https:\/\/onetimesecret.com\">https:\/\/onetimesecret.com<\/a>. You copy the information in, it gives you a link, you send the link to the other person, and once they have opened the link, the information is deleted. It can&#8217;t be seen again! As always, be careful who you trust. Assume the person running this is malicious and if you put a password into the system do NOT say what the password is for.<\/li><li><strong>Change\/remove\/delete<\/strong>: Change the password once access is no longer needed &#8211; remember that password managers make this easy. Remove users that no longer need access. Delete secret information when it no longer needs to be shared.<br><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I was chatting with some people today about passwords and internet security. There&#8217;s a lot of complicated terminology and sometimes conflicting advice. And I wanted to try and cut through it a bit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Security &#8211; not just on computers, but in other places too &#8211; is a trade-off of convenience for safety. It would be great if we could leave all our doors unlocked and not have to carry keys, for example. But people would go into our houses and steal our stuff. So we add locks and have the inconvenience of carrying keys, and of sometimes forgetting them and getting locked out. This is the trade off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next level of home security might be to add an alarm. This gets you extra safety, but you need to arm and disarm the alarm, remember the code, put up with annoying false alarms, and so on. You get extra security, but pay the price of convenience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are different levels of internet security too. And just as some people have more valuable stuff in their homes and want more security, some people have more valuable internet stuff and need greater online protections. Not all levels are appropriate for everybody.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT being on the first step &#8211; the lowest level &#8211; probably isn&#8217;t a great idea for anyone. No one has a three-digit combination lock on their front door.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s a list of steps you can take with internet\/online security. Each step is an increase in security, but in most cases with more complexity, inconvenience and\/or cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disclaimer: You are entirely responsible for your own internet security. I can not be held liable for anything that happens as a result of your decisions to use or not use one of the tools or approaches outlined below. Thanks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Level 1: Stop using the same password for everything<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use one password for everything, then stop doing so. Why? Well, your personal details can be hacked or become public. The <a href=\"https:\/\/haveibeenpwned.com\/\">Have I been Pwned website<\/a> can tell you if your details are public because of a data breach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your email address and password are somehow &#8220;out there&#8221; then other nasty people can take them and try to log in with them. And once they have access to one thing of yours, they may be able to get access to others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the very least you should identify critical services and set different passwords for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, once your email account is hacked, people can do password resets for other things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your Facebook is hacked then people may have access to services where you use a Facebook login button.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if your Amazon account is hacked then people can send themselves cheap plastic or electronic tat at your expense as it stores your payment cards online!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you have email on your own domain like &#8220;<a href=\"mailto:me@mydomain.com\">me@mydomain.com<\/a>&#8221; rather than GMail or Outlook or Yahoo mail then consider your domain and hosting accounts special too. If they get hacked it may be possible to redirect your email elsewhere and then, again, other things can be gotten into using email-based password resets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Level 2: Use complex passwords<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A complex password is one that is hard to guess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Easy-to-guess passwords are those that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>contain commonly used words or patterns (see the most <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_the_most_common_passwords\">common password lists<\/a>!)<\/li><li>contain dictionary words or commonly used names like football teams<\/li><li>simple variations of these things created by adding numbers or changing letters to numbers, like swapping an &#8216;o&#8217; for a zero.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These common patterns and tricks are all know by the nasty people who want to hack you and they will try them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do NOT type your actual password into here (or anywhere that you don&#8217;t trust). Let me say that again: do NOT type your actual password in here. But you can use a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/howsecureismypassword.net\/\">How Secure Is My Password<\/a> to see how long it might take a hacker to guess different kinds of password.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a long, complex and randomly-generated password is better, even though it&#8217;s hard to remember. I&#8217;d argue that even if you write it down, that&#8217;s still better. Most hacks are not by people who steal your wallet or handbag. They are by armies of computer programs trying to get into your online profiles from afar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So having &#8220;8xgbek65sg$gstv:&#8221; as a password written on a piece of paper that you keep safely somewhere is probably better than having a password like &#8220;JackIsAwesome77&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it doesn&#8217;t have to be a random collection of letters, numbers and symbols. You can also combine random words together such as &#8220;proud-taken-dollar&#8221; and this is MORE secure and easier to remember. If you ignore the geeky maths and terminology this little cartoon explains that: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.xkcd.com\/936\/\">https:\/\/www.xkcd.com\/936\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 3: Combine levels 1 and 2 and use a password manager<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A password manager is a tool that stores all your passwords, and generates new ones for you. They keep everything secure and encrypted, and you just need to remember one strong, complex master password to get access to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a password manager you can use a different, and complex password on every website that you can create an account on!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example password manager tools are <a href=\"https:\/\/1password.com\/\">1Password<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lastpass.com\/\">LastPass<\/a>, which are not open-source, but are easy to get started with and well supported. Open source tools also exist such as <a href=\"https:\/\/keepass.info\/\">KeePass<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/bitwarden.com\/\">Bitwarden<\/a>, but they are harder to get started with, so not for the non-tech-savvy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always remember to use a service that is trusted and recommended before typing passwords into it. Some web browsers also have password remembering built in, but remember that this only works for that browser &#8211; if you use a different web browser one day your remembered passwords won&#8217;t be there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Password managers cost a little bit of money, but seriously, it&#8217;s the cost of like two cups of coffee a month. Is keeping safe online worth that? (This is a rhetorical question and the answer is YES IT IS!!!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in a strange twist to what I said earlier, passsword managers may actually be MORE convenient as well as more secure. Many have tools that automatically fill in log in forms for you and if you take time to learn the tools well and use keyboard shortcuts you&#8217;ll probably find them more convenient. Here&#8217;s a video I recorded demonstrating that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/336674830?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"387\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 4: Use &#8220;2 factor authentication&#8221; for critical services<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two-factor authentication (which may go under a different name in some places) is where you have to do something else after entering a password to prove that you are you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could be sending a code to your phone, making you tap something in an app on your phone, or using an app on your phone to generate a code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With two-factor authentication enabled, if someone gets hold of or manages to guess your password (which you can assume they will) they will need something else to log in. Plus, these codes also only work once, so even if someone got a code it probably wouldn&#8217;t work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So level 4 is to start using this two-factor login for some of the critical services like email, domain names, hosting and social media accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some intricacies to this. It&#8217;s suggested that codes to your phone may not be a good idea as your phone can be hijacked. Storing the codes in the same place as your passwords (as some password managers allow you to do) may be putting all of your eggs in one basket. And the Google Authenticator app forgets all your codes if you get a new phone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;you&#8217;re always better off with two-factor codes, regardless of how you store them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s worth noting that many places will refer to the Google Authenticator app, but most one-time code apps (such as <a href=\"https:\/\/authy.com\/\">Authy<\/a>, or the tools built in to password managers) do exactly the same thing and can be used as a replacement for Google Authenticator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 5: Use 2 factor codes for as many things as possible&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;and store the codes in you password manager for convenience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As stated in Level 4, this is an all-your-eggs-in-one-basket approach but password managers make this really convenient and two-factor is always a step up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you&#8217;re used to using it on your critical services, start to turn it on in other places too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 6: Use 2 factor codes for as many things as possible&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;but store them somewhere other than your password manager.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is harder to do and we&#8217;re kinda into the realm of high levels of inconvenience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously-mentioned apps like Google Authenticator and Authy help you to do it. But then you need to remember another PIN or password. And it may be, if both your passwords and the codes are on your phone, that your phone becomes the single thing that knows everything, and this isn&#8217;t do great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key here is to be thinking about keeping the &#8220;two factors&#8221; &#8211; the passwords and the codes &#8211; separate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to achieve this might be just to use different master passwords for your password manager and two-factor code app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, if you&#8217;re read this far you are probably taking security very seriously and can start to do your own research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 7: Physical security keys<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Physical security keys, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yubico.com\/\">Yubikeys<\/a>, are small devices that you plug into a USB port, lightning port on your phone, or use an &#8220;NFC&#8221; tap (like a contactless payment card) to identify you. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are expensive but give you a couple of additional levels of security:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It proves that it&#8217;s actually you (or whoever has the key) physically present at the login.<\/li><li>They ensure that you&#8217;re authenticating with a REAL site, not a fake\/phishing site designed to steal your details.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you re-sell hosting or deal with sensitive personal data under GDPR you should probably be looking at this kind of technology, and it&#8217;s actually super easy to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you lose or forget your key? Well, you would probably have your 2FA codes as a backup! And you can also buy two keys: one to carry with you, and a backup to keep in a safe or something. Both keys will need to be registered with each service you use them on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve found that these keys are actually incredibly convenient. And there are good guides to getting started:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/paulstamatiou.com\/getting-started-with-security-keys\/\">Getting Started with Security Keys<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/timnash.co.uk\/feitian-epass-u2f-2-factor-authentication\/\">Tim Nash&#8217;s expereinces getting started with a Feitian ePass key<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This probably all sounds a bit scary and there&#8217;s lots of information and technical stuff here. I add that this is not a comprehensive or definitive list of levels. It&#8217;s just how I see things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;you should take this seriously and not be scared by the higher levels if you&#8217;re not there yet or don&#8217;t need that level of security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d encourage everyone to evaluate which level they are on, and seriously consider if they could move to the next level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an area that I&#8217;m REALLY keen to help less technical people with. So if that&#8217;s you drop me a line and I&#8217;ll see what I can do to help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally&#8230;I&#8217;ve not actually said which level I&#8217;m on or what I do for security. You can assume I&#8217;m on one of the higher levels, but I would never publish my security strategy, and neither should you. ALWAYS keep your security details, logins, passwords and so on private and only ever share details with people you 100% trust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">BONUS: Sending passwords to people<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Occasionally&#8230;VERY occasionally&#8230;you may need to send a login to someone else. As a web developer who helps people with email and websites I get this a lot. So here are some things to consider about that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Do you need to send a login?:<\/strong> Many services where you need to give access to someone else allow you to add other people. Examples of this that I frequently come across are: WordPress, CloudFlare, MailChimp and Facebook pages or apps. Add a new user if you can. Then&#8230;when that person no longer needs access, remove it or delete them. Don&#8217;t send a login if you don&#8217;t need to!<\/li><li><strong>Email is probably not secure:<\/strong> If you really do need to send a login, there is no guarantee that email is encrypted or secure. Assume your message can be intercepted and read by someone other than the recipient. So do not send complete login details by email.<\/li><li><strong>Email may persist:<\/strong> There is no guarantee that an email will be deleted by the recipient. If you email someone login details they may sit in that person&#8217;s inbox for years to come. So, again, don&#8217;t send complete login details by email. If you do, or have ever done so, change the password for that account.<\/li><li><strong>Split the details up!<\/strong>: Splitting up the login details over two different communication methods is a good stragety. Like with passwords this makes the process a bit &#8220;two factor&#8221;. If the username is intercepted by email, the hacker still won&#8217;t have the password. So, for example, send the username by email, but send the password using a text message or messenger app.  For an extra bit of security don&#8217;t mention where to use the login details. Say &#8220;here&#8217;s the password you need&#8221; rather than &#8220;Here&#8217;s the password for my Facebook account&#8221;.<\/li><li><strong>Use a one-time messaging service<\/strong>: There are services that basically work like a &#8220;this message will self destruct&#8221; service. I often use <a href=\"https:\/\/onetimesecret.com\">https:\/\/onetimesecret.com<\/a>. You copy the information in, it gives you a link, you send the link to the other person, and once they have opened the link, the information is deleted. It can&#8217;t be seen again! As always, be careful who you trust. Assume the person running this is malicious and if you put a password into the system do NOT say what the password is for.<\/li><li><strong>Change\/remove\/delete<\/strong>: Change the password once access is no longer needed &#8211; remember that password managers make this easy. Remove users that no longer need access. Delete secret information when it no longer needs to be shared.<br><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

Read up, watch my introductory video, and <a href=\"https:\/\/w4e.uk\/tinker\">buy the darned thing<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who crosses the boundary of WordPress and Laravel development, I like to exchange ideas and tools between those two communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One recent tool that&#8217;s appeared in the Laravel space is &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/w4e.uk\/tinker\">Tinkerwell<\/a>&#8221; by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/marcelpociot\/\">Marcel Pociot<\/a>. Tinker is a Laravel command-line REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) tool that lets you run code inside your Laravel app. If you don&#8217;t know what a REPL is then, well, watch the video below. If you&#8217;re familiar with WP-CLI in the WordPress space, then the <code>wp shell<\/code> command is a REPL for WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though it started as a tool for Laravel development, the latest version of Tinkerwell comes with built-in support for WordPress too (and the ability to extend it for other PHP frameworks).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as the messenger to the WordPress world of all the lovely Laravel things, I&#8217;d like to present my introduction to Tinkerwell for WordPress developers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I only cover the basics: I leave out how to use SSL to Tinker remotely for example, or how to change between projects. But the video is intended to show you the potential benefits of using Tinkerwell, not to be an exhaustive tutorial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you like Tinkerwell, it&#8217;s really cheap to buy: only $15 or \u00a312 plus local taxes. So go <a href=\"https:\/\/w4e.uk\/tinker\">grab a copy using my afilliate link<\/a> and both support Marcel&#8217;s great work and buy me a coffee while you&#8217;re at it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Tinkerwell for WordPress\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/386986589?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a second video I made showing off how to use the tables feature:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Tinkerwell for WordPress - Listing posts in tables\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/397315336?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n",

Read up, watch my introductory video, and <a href=\"https:\/\/w4e.uk\/tinker\">buy the darned thing<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who crosses the boundary of WordPress and Laravel development, I like to exchange ideas and tools between those two communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One recent tool that&#8217;s appeared in the Laravel space is &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/w4e.uk\/tinker\">Tinkerwell<\/a>&#8221; by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/marcelpociot\/\">Marcel Pociot<\/a>. Tinker is a Laravel command-line REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) tool that lets you run code inside your Laravel app. If you don&#8217;t know what a REPL is then, well, watch the video below. If you&#8217;re familiar with WP-CLI in the WordPress space, then the <code>wp shell<\/code> command is a REPL for WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though it started as a tool for Laravel development, the latest version of Tinkerwell comes with built-in support for WordPress too (and the ability to extend it for other PHP frameworks).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as the messenger to the WordPress world of all the lovely Laravel things, I&#8217;d like to present my introduction to Tinkerwell for WordPress developers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I only cover the basics: I leave out how to use SSL to Tinker remotely for example, or how to change between projects. But the video is intended to show you the potential benefits of using Tinkerwell, not to be an exhaustive tutorial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you like Tinkerwell, it&#8217;s really cheap to buy: only $15 or \u00a312 plus local taxes. So go <a href=\"https:\/\/w4e.uk\/tinker\">grab a copy using my afilliate link<\/a> and both support Marcel&#8217;s great work and buy me a coffee while you&#8217;re at it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Tinkerwell for WordPress\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/386986589?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a second video I made showing off how to use the tables feature:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Tinkerwell for WordPress - Listing posts in tables\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/397315336?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n",

Thanks!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">TL;DR<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I made a <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/laravel-asset-cache\/\">Laravel package<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/statamic-asset-cache\/\">Statamic v3 addon<\/a> that automatically download JS and CSS package files from CDN&#8217;s and cache and serve them locally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go straight to the README&#8217;s if you&#8217;re interested, or read on if you don&#8217;t quite understand what this is or why you might want it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m LOVING some of the trends in my tech world right now:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>No JS<\/li><li>Less JS<\/li><li>Simpler JS<\/li><li>Vanilla JS<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Not that I hate on JavaScript. It&#8217;s powerful, popular, easy (maybe deceptively so!) and has changed the internet for the better. But do we overuse it? Are we too dependent on it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s all good stuff. And (fanboy moment) a lot of the chatter on this in my world is powered by the brilliant Caleb Porzio and his <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel-livewire.com\/\">Laravel Livewire<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/alpinejs\/alpine\">AlpineJS<\/a> projects and all the amazing content he&#8217;s putting out around these topics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ditching the Build<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I, personally, am on a &#8220;Ditch the Build&#8221; trend. Trying to figure out how, if at all, we, as web developers, can wean ourselves off of starting every project with <code>npm install<\/code>; of acquiring the technical tooling debt that we inevitably acquire in using build tools; and of simplifying the back-end of the front-end development experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to say up-front that &#8220;Ditch the Build&#8221; is NOT for ALL projects: npm, webpack, parcel and so on are powerful tools that HELP us in many cases. But do we really need them for building simple websites and WordPress themes?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have things like CSS custom properties, ES6+ JavaScript, promises, async\/await, the fetch API, HTTP2 and a multitude of others all made NOT having a complex build process possible for smaller projects?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Losing your dependencies<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One issue that has not been resolved in my mind about how to Ditch the Build is including JavaScript dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all want our included code to be up to date and package managers help with this. But if I just want to include a JS library file from somewhere, I need to keep it up to date manually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Options are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Use npm\/yarn\/whatever and include the dependency manually; seems like overkill for including a JS file.<\/li><li>Use an npm wrapper like <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/6.x\/mix\">Laravel Mix<\/a>; more overkill because you&#8217;re including webpack and other stuff; but, it gives you an asset tag to include the dependency which may be a bonus.<\/li><li>Use <a href=\"https:\/\/bower.io\/\">Bower<\/a>, which, though still maintained, is technically deprecated and not recommended.<\/li><li>Use a CDN and include the script tag manually; fine, but there are several good reasons not to do that (see below).<\/li><li>Just download the script and include it manually.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly if you&#8217;re trying to ditch the build then only the last two options here are usable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the problem with CDN&#8217;s is that, while there may be slight performance gains, you become dependent on a third party for your site to work. CSS Wizard Harry Roberts gives <a href=\"https:\/\/csswizardry.com\/2019\/05\/self-host-your-static-assets\/\">a multitude of reasons not to use a CDN<\/a>. And you still have to manually update the script tag if you want to update it. (Yes, not even the major CDN&#8217;s support &#8220;latest version&#8221; &#8211; remember this, we&#8217;ll come back to it!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Idea: An automatic asset cacher<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So I had this idea: could we automate the process of downloading an asset (JS or CSS) from GitHub or from a CDN and then caching it and serving it locally?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could I just have some kind of helper function or Blade (or Antlers, for Statamic) tag that would output a link to this automatically locally-cached copy?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And could it maybe have a package-manager-link version constraint so it could automatically use minor updates? (Yes, in retrospect, this might be a bad idea).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could we just do, for example?:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;script src=&quot;{{ assetCache(&lt;package&gt;, &lt;version&gt;, &lt;file&gt;) }}&quot;&gt;&lt;\/script&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">It&#8217;s alive!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, yes, this isn&#8217;t big or clever. But here you go:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/laravel-asset-cache\/\">Laravel Asset Cacher<\/a> package<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/statamic-asset-cache\/\">Statamic Asset Cacher<\/a> addon (for v3, which is currently in beta, but it&#8217;s what I&#8217;m building with)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It has some limitations, and may not actually save you that much time. But I think it&#8217;s kinda neat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is this a big deal?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll see this in readme&#8217;s, but this is a big deal for me because:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>This is my first (and second) Laravel package<\/li><li>This is my first Statamic addon<\/li><li>I&#8217;ve had to learn quite a lot to accomplish this &#8211; nothing hard, but just lots of little things. (Huge thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/marcelpociot\">Marcel Pociot<\/a>&#8216;s excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/phppackagedevelopment.com\/\">PHP Package Development<\/a> course for guiding me through!)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure if these are useful to anyone; if this idea actually has any merit. But they were a good exercise in creating and publishing packages and addons. Constructive feedback is welcome!<\/p>\n",

Thanks!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">TL;DR<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I made a <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/laravel-asset-cache\/\">Laravel package<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/statamic-asset-cache\/\">Statamic v3 addon<\/a> that automatically download JS and CSS package files from CDN&#8217;s and cache and serve them locally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go straight to the README&#8217;s if you&#8217;re interested, or read on if you don&#8217;t quite understand what this is or why you might want it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m LOVING some of the trends in my tech world right now:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>No JS<\/li><li>Less JS<\/li><li>Simpler JS<\/li><li>Vanilla JS<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Not that I hate on JavaScript. It&#8217;s powerful, popular, easy (maybe deceptively so!) and has changed the internet for the better. But do we overuse it? Are we too dependent on it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s all good stuff. And (fanboy moment) a lot of the chatter on this in my world is powered by the brilliant Caleb Porzio and his <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel-livewire.com\/\">Laravel Livewire<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/alpinejs\/alpine\">AlpineJS<\/a> projects and all the amazing content he&#8217;s putting out around these topics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ditching the Build<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I, personally, am on a &#8220;Ditch the Build&#8221; trend. Trying to figure out how, if at all, we, as web developers, can wean ourselves off of starting every project with <code>npm install<\/code>; of acquiring the technical tooling debt that we inevitably acquire in using build tools; and of simplifying the back-end of the front-end development experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to say up-front that &#8220;Ditch the Build&#8221; is NOT for ALL projects: npm, webpack, parcel and so on are powerful tools that HELP us in many cases. But do we really need them for building simple websites and WordPress themes?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have things like CSS custom properties, ES6+ JavaScript, promises, async\/await, the fetch API, HTTP2 and a multitude of others all made NOT having a complex build process possible for smaller projects?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Losing your dependencies<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One issue that has not been resolved in my mind about how to Ditch the Build is including JavaScript dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all want our included code to be up to date and package managers help with this. But if I just want to include a JS library file from somewhere, I need to keep it up to date manually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Options are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Use npm\/yarn\/whatever and include the dependency manually; seems like overkill for including a JS file.<\/li><li>Use an npm wrapper like <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/6.x\/mix\">Laravel Mix<\/a>; more overkill because you&#8217;re including webpack and other stuff; but, it gives you an asset tag to include the dependency which may be a bonus.<\/li><li>Use <a href=\"https:\/\/bower.io\/\">Bower<\/a>, which, though still maintained, is technically deprecated and not recommended.<\/li><li>Use a CDN and include the script tag manually; fine, but there are several good reasons not to do that (see below).<\/li><li>Just download the script and include it manually.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly if you&#8217;re trying to ditch the build then only the last two options here are usable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the problem with CDN&#8217;s is that, while there may be slight performance gains, you become dependent on a third party for your site to work. CSS Wizard Harry Roberts gives <a href=\"https:\/\/csswizardry.com\/2019\/05\/self-host-your-static-assets\/\">a multitude of reasons not to use a CDN<\/a>. And you still have to manually update the script tag if you want to update it. (Yes, not even the major CDN&#8217;s support &#8220;latest version&#8221; &#8211; remember this, we&#8217;ll come back to it!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Idea: An automatic asset cacher<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So I had this idea: could we automate the process of downloading an asset (JS or CSS) from GitHub or from a CDN and then caching it and serving it locally?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could I just have some kind of helper function or Blade (or Antlers, for Statamic) tag that would output a link to this automatically locally-cached copy?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And could it maybe have a package-manager-link version constraint so it could automatically use minor updates? (Yes, in retrospect, this might be a bad idea).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could we just do, for example?:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;script src=&quot;{{ assetCache(&lt;package&gt;, &lt;version&gt;, &lt;file&gt;) }}&quot;&gt;&lt;\/script&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">It&#8217;s alive!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, yes, this isn&#8217;t big or clever. But here you go:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/laravel-asset-cache\/\">Laravel Asset Cacher<\/a> package<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/statamic-asset-cache\/\">Statamic Asset Cacher<\/a> addon (for v3, which is currently in beta, but it&#8217;s what I&#8217;m building with)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It has some limitations, and may not actually save you that much time. But I think it&#8217;s kinda neat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is this a big deal?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll see this in readme&#8217;s, but this is a big deal for me because:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>This is my first (and second) Laravel package<\/li><li>This is my first Statamic addon<\/li><li>I&#8217;ve had to learn quite a lot to accomplish this &#8211; nothing hard, but just lots of little things. (Huge thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/marcelpociot\">Marcel Pociot<\/a>&#8216;s excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/phppackagedevelopment.com\/\">PHP Package Development<\/a> course for guiding me through!)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure if these are useful to anyone; if this idea actually has any merit. But they were a good exercise in creating and publishing packages and addons. Constructive feedback is welcome!<\/p>\n",
