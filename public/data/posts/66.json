The lead singer of the band recently posted an message on his MySpace Blog about filesharing.  I spent some time writing a response and wanted to copy my thoughts here.  The full thread can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.myspace.com\/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=38074918&amp;blogID=338942328\">on MySpace here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, Kieran was starting a discussion about file sharing, whether or not it&#8217;s beneficial to the music industry, or should it be banned in some way.  He hadn&#8217;t asked a specific question, just wanted to see what people&#8217;s thoughts were.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n<p>Hi Kieran and other folks,<\/p>\n<p>I consider myself pretty old-school, I like cover artwork and inlays, I like to have a physical item in my music collection. Not everyone is like me.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t do piracy. At least, I always pay for music that&#8217;s in my collection because it has value. Not everyone is like me.<\/p>\n<p>Hmm&#8230;.piracy. It&#8217;s not new. It&#8217;s not just that we&#8217;re all selfish now&#8230;we&#8217;ve always been selfish! Hands up all those that copied CD or tapes (remember them) before computers and the Internet were fast enough to make MP3&#8217;s and file sharing a reality? All that&#8217;s changed is that it&#8217;s quicker and easier to copy and swap music and, with digital, you don&#8217;t lose quality with each copy.<\/p>\n<p>But the technology has improved in leaps and bounds &#8211; faster than the industry can cope with, it seems.<\/p>\n<p>The Internet truly is a double-edged sword.On the one hand:<br \/>&#8211; it has made it easy for new bands to promote themselves.<br \/>&#8211; it removes barriers and makes people equal; Iko probably have as much power as Radiohead on the Internet.<br \/>&#8211; it has the potential to create an environment where only truly good music thrives because you can try stuff for free and if it&#8217;s no good you&#8217;ll leave it and move on to something else quickly (as Dean does).<br \/>&#8211; it has potential to remove the middle men (distributors and record shops) and have more of the cost of music going direct to the artist&#8230;or to even reduce the cost of music in the same way (most people I know that copy stuff do so because they think\/know they&#8217;re being ripped off by the distributors and shops).<\/p>\n<p>So there&#8217;s a lot of good things about using the internet for music.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand it has turned music into &#8220;just information&#8221; that can very easily be passed between people at no cost. In some cases this may be to the benefit of the artist; especially to a decent new act just starting out who wants to get their sound &#8220;out there&#8221;. However, I suspect that in many cases it can be crippling as the monetary value is removed from the art.<\/p>\n<p>I work with technology a LOT. It is a tool. It is a means to an end. You don&#8217;t own a hammer for the sake of owning a hammer, you own it so you can hit things with it. And like any tool, it can be used, and it can be ab-used. I can use my hammer to hit people, for instance, which isn&#8217;t very nice (I don&#8217;t, by the way)<\/p>\n<p>File sharing is a tool. I&#8217;m sure it has many legal, useful purposes and that&#8217;s why it exists. Sadly it seems to be abused more and more. And, oddly, I find that people who are normally kind, sensible, good-moraled, law-abiding citizens, have no problem with using computers for piracy, and seem to think that it&#8217;s stupid that they have to pay for stuff that they can freely copy around.<\/p>\n<p>So what can we do?<\/p>\n<p>Just banning\/outlawing p2p file sharing is impractical and unlikely to help. People will just find other ways.<\/p>\n<p>We can fight technology with technology. DRM (digital rights management) is another method of protecting the artists rights. Giving the purchaser the ability to use the file on a limited number of devices, or for a limited length of time. Sadly this is more complex than it seems. What if I replace my computer and can no longer use that file? That&#8217;s unfair is it not? People will always crack the technology anyway, rendering it useless. And the technology industry will always want to make as much hard cash as possible, and so you end up with not one technology, but several, with each technology onwer hoping that theirs will become the big one! (e.g. VHS\/Betamax, or the recent HD DVD wars). There are many reasons why this isn&#8217;t a great solution.<\/p>\n<p>Education is not likely to work either. There will always be people who just don&#8217;t care.<\/p>\n<p>OK &#8211; I&#8217;m out of ideas. This whole new internet world needs some real creative thinking to work out how artists can best make use of it. Perhaps that&#8217;s why Kieran started this discussion? The world is not the one we used to know and we&#8217;re still mapping out the Internet and forming the unspoken rules and morals that surround it.<\/p>\n<p>Have I helped the discussion? Probably not, K didn&#8217;t ask a direct question, so I&#8217;ve not sought to answer one &#8211; in fact, I&#8217;ve raised a few of my own.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s encouraging is that there seem to be people who share the values that make the internet good. To all the commenters above &#8211; good on &#8216;ya. Perhaps one way we can all help is to help is to spread the word about how artists deserve and need the cash. Perhaps we can be role models in that, speak up for the artists, challenge those we know who copy and file share.<\/p>\n<p>After all, we&#8217;re right that it&#8217;s wrong.<\/p>\n<p>Aren&#8217;t we?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned Iko, the excellent band that a friend of ours is in, before.  The lead singer of the band recently posted an message on his MySpace Blog about filesharing.  I spent some time writing a response and wanted to copy my thoughts here.  The full thread can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.myspace.com\/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=38074918&amp;blogID=338942328\">on MySpace here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, Kieran was starting a discussion about file sharing, whether or not it&#8217;s beneficial to the music industry, or should it be banned in some way.  He hadn&#8217;t asked a specific question, just wanted to see what people&#8217;s thoughts were.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n<p>Hi Kieran and other folks,<\/p>\n<p>I consider myself pretty old-school, I like cover artwork and inlays, I like to have a physical item in my music collection. Not everyone is like me.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t do piracy. At least, I always pay for music that&#8217;s in my collection because it has value. Not everyone is like me.<\/p>\n<p>Hmm&#8230;.piracy. It&#8217;s not new. It&#8217;s not just that we&#8217;re all selfish now&#8230;we&#8217;ve always been selfish! Hands up all those that copied CD or tapes (remember them) before computers and the Internet were fast enough to make MP3&#8217;s and file sharing a reality? All that&#8217;s changed is that it&#8217;s quicker and easier to copy and swap music and, with digital, you don&#8217;t lose quality with each copy.<\/p>\n<p>But the technology has improved in leaps and bounds &#8211; faster than the industry can cope with, it seems.<\/p>\n<p>The Internet truly is a double-edged sword.On the one hand:<br \/>&#8211; it has made it easy for new bands to promote themselves.<br \/>&#8211; it removes barriers and makes people equal; Iko probably have as much power as Radiohead on the Internet.<br \/>&#8211; it has the potential to create an environment where only truly good music thrives because you can try stuff for free and if it&#8217;s no good you&#8217;ll leave it and move on to something else quickly (as Dean does).<br \/>&#8211; it has potential to remove the middle men (distributors and record shops) and have more of the cost of music going direct to the artist&#8230;or to even reduce the cost of music in the same way (most people I know that copy stuff do so because they think\/know they&#8217;re being ripped off by the distributors and shops).<\/p>\n<p>So there&#8217;s a lot of good things about using the internet for music.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand it has turned music into &#8220;just information&#8221; that can very easily be passed between people at no cost. In some cases this may be to the benefit of the artist; especially to a decent new act just starting out who wants to get their sound &#8220;out there&#8221;. However, I suspect that in many cases it can be crippling as the monetary value is removed from the art.<\/p>\n<p>I work with technology a LOT. It is a tool. It is a means to an end. You don&#8217;t own a hammer for the sake of owning a hammer, you own it so you can hit things with it. And like any tool, it can be used, and it can be ab-used. I can use my hammer to hit people, for instance, which isn&#8217;t very nice (I don&#8217;t, by the way)<\/p>\n<p>File sharing is a tool. I&#8217;m sure it has many legal, useful purposes and that&#8217;s why it exists. Sadly it seems to be abused more and more. And, oddly, I find that people who are normally kind, sensible, good-moraled, law-abiding citizens, have no problem with using computers for piracy, and seem to think that it&#8217;s stupid that they have to pay for stuff that they can freely copy around.<\/p>\n<p>So what can we do?<\/p>\n<p>Just banning\/outlawing p2p file sharing is impractical and unlikely to help. People will just find other ways.<\/p>\n<p>We can fight technology with technology. DRM (digital rights management) is another method of protecting the artists rights. Giving the purchaser the ability to use the file on a limited number of devices, or for a limited length of time. Sadly this is more complex than it seems. What if I replace my computer and can no longer use that file? That&#8217;s unfair is it not? People will always crack the technology anyway, rendering it useless. And the technology industry will always want to make as much hard cash as possible, and so you end up with not one technology, but several, with each technology onwer hoping that theirs will become the big one! (e.g. VHS\/Betamax, or the recent HD DVD wars). There are many reasons why this isn&#8217;t a great solution.<\/p>\n<p>Education is not likely to work either. There will always be people who just don&#8217;t care.<\/p>\n<p>OK &#8211; I&#8217;m out of ideas. This whole new internet world needs some real creative thinking to work out how artists can best make use of it. Perhaps that&#8217;s why Kieran started this discussion? The world is not the one we used to know and we&#8217;re still mapping out the Internet and forming the unspoken rules and morals that surround it.<\/p>\n<p>Have I helped the discussion? Probably not, K didn&#8217;t ask a direct question, so I&#8217;ve not sought to answer one &#8211; in fact, I&#8217;ve raised a few of my own.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s encouraging is that there seem to be people who share the values that make the internet good. To all the commenters above &#8211; good on &#8216;ya. Perhaps one way we can all help is to help is to spread the word about how artists deserve and need the cash. Perhaps we can be role models in that, speak up for the artists, challenge those we know who copy and file share.<\/p>\n<p>After all, we&#8217;re right that it&#8217;s wrong.<\/p>\n<p>Aren&#8217;t we?<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m not a very trusting person, while at the same time, I tend to believe what people tell me.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s all down to experience.<\/p>\n<p>If someone says, for example, that they&#8217;ve got tickets to go see the Spice Girls at Wembley stadium.  As long as it&#8217;s not said with a fairly strong tone of irony or sarcasm, I&#8217;ll believe that!It&#8217;s pretty believable.<\/p>\n<p>If, however, my wife told me that she&#8217;d had a piece of toast with peanut butter and really enjoyed it, I probably wouldn&#8217;t take her word for it, and would insist on checking the jar.  If something seems unlikely to me, I will check it out.  This sounds reasonable, but I often feel like I&#8217;m unnecessarily doubting people when such things happen.<\/p>\n<p>And so, with my sense of mistrust on red-alert, I was confronted with shelf hanging.  Our house has lots of bare walls, which with a few planks of wood, can easily be utilised as storage space.<\/p>\n<p>A quick trip to B&amp;Q to buy the aforementioned wall furniture, and a drill, and we were off!  Sally claimed I went a bit &#8220;drill crazy&#8221; at first &#8211; she probably had a point.  We have a lot of holes to make!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R6OEYS1YrLI\/AAAAAAAABk0\/IbmAg4akiYs\/s1600-h\/keyhole+shelf+fitting.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;cursor:pointer;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R6OEYS1YrLI\/AAAAAAAABk0\/IbmAg4akiYs\/s320\/keyhole+shelf+fitting.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>But, while confident with making holes, I had doubts about the fittings.  Most of the shelves we hung were held up by little &#8220;keyhole&#8221; fixings.  A small, thin plate of metal, with a keyhole-shaped hole in it, that hung over a single wall screw.<\/p>\n<p>And the instructions tell me that two of these little things will hold 25 kilograms?!  That&#8217;s 25 litres of water?  It&#8217;s more than a third of my body weight? Over 3 times the weight of an official men&#8217;s shotput shot?  And the average weight of an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.70south.com\/information\/antarctic-animals\/antarctic-marine-life\/antarcticfish\">antarctic cod<\/a>? (I&#8217;m open to other suggestions as to what this is the equivalent of)<\/p>\n<p>Yeah, right!<\/p>\n<p>And so, with the shelves up, I nervously started loading them up.  I have no experience of this kind of thing, but I know that recipe books are heavy.  I was very tentative.  I told Sally to keep the heavy ones on the worktop &#8211; no Nigel Slater or Nigella up there!!  I tried to carefully distribute the load between the two supports.  I went round inspecting them every day for about a week.  I cautiously pulled them occasionally to check that they&#8217;d take a little more weight.<\/p>\n<p>It was very much a test of faith!<\/p>\n<p>Lots of DIY seems to be like this.  Trying it out, sometimes failing, learning as you go, but having the confidence to have a go in the first place, and to try again if you fail.  I&#8217;m very much having to overcome some of my doubts and trust what people tell me in order to get things done.<\/p>\n<p>It turns out that shelves are pretty sturdy, and two little metal plates can take a fair bit of weight &#8211; I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ve risked 25kg yet and I don&#8217;t have any shot or antarctic cod to test it with, but we&#8217;ve got some heavy &#8211; and fragile &#8211; stuff, hanging on the walls of our kitchen now.<\/p>\n<p>Not only that, but I&#8217;m now a fully competent, drill-crazy, shelf hanger!<\/p>\n<p>A few USEFUL things that I learned along the way:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Those keyhole fittings should definitely be flush with the bracket &#8211; if you buy cheap shelves with badly pre-cut holes, make sure that you enlarge the holes rather than forcing the bracket in.<\/li>\n<li>If you have a large wall space that you want to put a LONG shelf in (we&#8217;ve done this in our utility room), don&#8217;t try to hang one super-long shelf with more than two supports.  Correctly aligning more than two supports such that a shelf rests flush on top of them is very hard.  Use two shorter shelves instead!<\/li>\n<li>Screwing the shelf to the supports is easiest done if you pre-drill the holes.  Put the shelf in place, mark up where the holes should be, hold it all still, drill the holes (with light pressure &#8211; shouldn&#8217;t have to push hard to get through the wood), and then take it off the wall to screw together. (There&#8217;s probably a &#8220;proper&#8221; way to do this, but I found this method much easier than screwing it together while the shelf was on the wall.  In fact, the pressure required to screw the shelf to the support whilst on the wall seemed to exceed the 25kg and bend the keyhole bracket!!)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n",

I&#8217;m not a very trusting person, while at the same time, I tend to believe what people tell me.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s all down to experience.<\/p>\n<p>If someone says, for example, that they&#8217;ve got tickets to go see the Spice Girls at Wembley stadium.  As long as it&#8217;s not said with a fairly strong tone of irony or sarcasm, I&#8217;ll believe that!It&#8217;s pretty believable.<\/p>\n<p>If, however, my wife told me that she&#8217;d had a piece of toast with peanut butter and really enjoyed it, I probably wouldn&#8217;t take her word for it, and would insist on checking the jar.  If something seems unlikely to me, I will check it out.  This sounds reasonable, but I often feel like I&#8217;m unnecessarily doubting people when such things happen.<\/p>\n<p>And so, with my sense of mistrust on red-alert, I was confronted with shelf hanging.  Our house has lots of bare walls, which with a few planks of wood, can easily be utilised as storage space.<\/p>\n<p>A quick trip to B&amp;Q to buy the aforementioned wall furniture, and a drill, and we were off!  Sally claimed I went a bit &#8220;drill crazy&#8221; at first &#8211; she probably had a point.  We have a lot of holes to make!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R6OEYS1YrLI\/AAAAAAAABk0\/IbmAg4akiYs\/s1600-h\/keyhole+shelf+fitting.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;cursor:pointer;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R6OEYS1YrLI\/AAAAAAAABk0\/IbmAg4akiYs\/s320\/keyhole+shelf+fitting.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>But, while confident with making holes, I had doubts about the fittings.  Most of the shelves we hung were held up by little &#8220;keyhole&#8221; fixings.  A small, thin plate of metal, with a keyhole-shaped hole in it, that hung over a single wall screw.<\/p>\n<p>And the instructions tell me that two of these little things will hold 25 kilograms?!  That&#8217;s 25 litres of water?  It&#8217;s more than a third of my body weight? Over 3 times the weight of an official men&#8217;s shotput shot?  And the average weight of an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.70south.com\/information\/antarctic-animals\/antarctic-marine-life\/antarcticfish\">antarctic cod<\/a>? (I&#8217;m open to other suggestions as to what this is the equivalent of)<\/p>\n<p>Yeah, right!<\/p>\n<p>And so, with the shelves up, I nervously started loading them up.  I have no experience of this kind of thing, but I know that recipe books are heavy.  I was very tentative.  I told Sally to keep the heavy ones on the worktop &#8211; no Nigel Slater or Nigella up there!!  I tried to carefully distribute the load between the two supports.  I went round inspecting them every day for about a week.  I cautiously pulled them occasionally to check that they&#8217;d take a little more weight.<\/p>\n<p>It was very much a test of faith!<\/p>\n<p>Lots of DIY seems to be like this.  Trying it out, sometimes failing, learning as you go, but having the confidence to have a go in the first place, and to try again if you fail.  I&#8217;m very much having to overcome some of my doubts and trust what people tell me in order to get things done.<\/p>\n<p>It turns out that shelves are pretty sturdy, and two little metal plates can take a fair bit of weight &#8211; I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ve risked 25kg yet and I don&#8217;t have any shot or antarctic cod to test it with, but we&#8217;ve got some heavy &#8211; and fragile &#8211; stuff, hanging on the walls of our kitchen now.<\/p>\n<p>Not only that, but I&#8217;m now a fully competent, drill-crazy, shelf hanger!<\/p>\n<p>A few USEFUL things that I learned along the way:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Those keyhole fittings should definitely be flush with the bracket &#8211; if you buy cheap shelves with badly pre-cut holes, make sure that you enlarge the holes rather than forcing the bracket in.<\/li>\n<li>If you have a large wall space that you want to put a LONG shelf in (we&#8217;ve done this in our utility room), don&#8217;t try to hang one super-long shelf with more than two supports.  Correctly aligning more than two supports such that a shelf rests flush on top of them is very hard.  Use two shorter shelves instead!<\/li>\n<li>Screwing the shelf to the supports is easiest done if you pre-drill the holes.  Put the shelf in place, mark up where the holes should be, hold it all still, drill the holes (with light pressure &#8211; shouldn&#8217;t have to push hard to get through the wood), and then take it off the wall to screw together. (There&#8217;s probably a &#8220;proper&#8221; way to do this, but I found this method much easier than screwing it together while the shelf was on the wall.  In fact, the pressure required to screw the shelf to the support whilst on the wall seemed to exceed the 25kg and bend the keyhole bracket!!)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n",

This is a government initiative designed to encourage people to cycle to work.  Which I do anyway, but it&#8217;s still a real treat.<\/p>\n<p>What happens is this.  I go out bike shopping to buy myself some new wheels to ride to work on, and any associated safety equipment I need.  My employer buys this stuff, and I rent it back from them for 12 months, making 12 monthly payments to cover the cost of the kit. BUT, because my employer buys the bike, they don&#8217;t pay VAT, so I get 17.5% off. AND, I pay before tax and National Insurance are deducted, so I get about another 30% off!  AND I get it all on a 12 month interest-free loan!<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the 12 months I get to buy the bike for a nominal fee &#8211; usually 5% of its cost.<\/p>\n<p>Doing the maths, this means I can buy a nice, say, \u00a3600 road bike and get about 49% off the cost!<\/p>\n<p>This is exactly what I&#8217;m doing.<\/p>\n<p>I looked at 3 bikes: the Giant SCR2 (I think it was SCR2) a something like \u00a3525, the KONA Zing (\u00a3999 reduced to \u00a3695) and the Felt Z90 (\u00a3600).<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span>The Giant didn&#8217;t really do much for me at all.  You pretty much got what you paid for, and the shop that had it would only sell at RRP, not doing any discounted bikes on the cycle scheme that we&#8217;re signed up to at work.<\/p>\n<p>The KONA was a VERY pretty bike, well equipped and great value with the \u00a3300 knocked off, but it was a racing bike really.  Low position and very hard ride.  The higher spec was tempting but in the end the Felt beat it on comfort and suitablility for the kind of riding that I&#8217;m doing.<\/p>\n<p>So I have a Felt Z90 on order.  Aluminium frame, carbon forks, 27 gears, mostly Shimano equipped.  It has a slightly more upright riding position and the extra chain ring (that&#8217;s a 3rd big ring by the pedals), bar-top brake levers and softer ride made it a good buy, and very suitable for the training\/touring kind of rides that I&#8217;m doing.<\/p>\n<p>It takes a while to process the paperwork for the cycle scheme but hopefully I&#8217;ll have it before Christmas!!!  Yipeee!!!!<\/p>\n",

This is a government initiative designed to encourage people to cycle to work.  Which I do anyway, but it&#8217;s still a real treat.<\/p>\n<p>What happens is this.  I go out bike shopping to buy myself some new wheels to ride to work on, and any associated safety equipment I need.  My employer buys this stuff, and I rent it back from them for 12 months, making 12 monthly payments to cover the cost of the kit. BUT, because my employer buys the bike, they don&#8217;t pay VAT, so I get 17.5% off. AND, I pay before tax and National Insurance are deducted, so I get about another 30% off!  AND I get it all on a 12 month interest-free loan!<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the 12 months I get to buy the bike for a nominal fee &#8211; usually 5% of its cost.<\/p>\n<p>Doing the maths, this means I can buy a nice, say, \u00a3600 road bike and get about 49% off the cost!<\/p>\n<p>This is exactly what I&#8217;m doing.<\/p>\n<p>I looked at 3 bikes: the Giant SCR2 (I think it was SCR2) a something like \u00a3525, the KONA Zing (\u00a3999 reduced to \u00a3695) and the Felt Z90 (\u00a3600).<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span>The Giant didn&#8217;t really do much for me at all.  You pretty much got what you paid for, and the shop that had it would only sell at RRP, not doing any discounted bikes on the cycle scheme that we&#8217;re signed up to at work.<\/p>\n<p>The KONA was a VERY pretty bike, well equipped and great value with the \u00a3300 knocked off, but it was a racing bike really.  Low position and very hard ride.  The higher spec was tempting but in the end the Felt beat it on comfort and suitablility for the kind of riding that I&#8217;m doing.<\/p>\n<p>So I have a Felt Z90 on order.  Aluminium frame, carbon forks, 27 gears, mostly Shimano equipped.  It has a slightly more upright riding position and the extra chain ring (that&#8217;s a 3rd big ring by the pedals), bar-top brake levers and softer ride made it a good buy, and very suitable for the training\/touring kind of rides that I&#8217;m doing.<\/p>\n<p>It takes a while to process the paperwork for the cycle scheme but hopefully I&#8217;ll have it before Christmas!!!  Yipeee!!!!<\/p>\n",

The component manufacturers don&#8217;t help by naming equipment in the same sort of way that car manufacturers give names to cars.  How am I supposed to know the difference between Sora, Tiagra, Ultegra, 105, Dura Ace and so on, easily, without having to research it all the time?  Surely there&#8217;s an easier way?<\/p>\n<p>And sometimes things are known by different names.  I still haven&#8217;t worked out if a crank is different from a crankset, or a chain different from a chainset.  There&#8217;s subtle differences between hubs and axles, and it&#8217;s not clear whether I can replace just one, or just the other, or if I always need to replace both.  There&#8217;s seat stays and seat posts, which are very different.  It&#8217;s all very confusing!<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s a useful article that has helped me a little.<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/gear\/article\/buyers-guide-to-road-chainsets-118<\/p>\n<p>My original intention for this post was to list some cycling terminology that I&#8217;ve learned the meaning of and try to keep that up to date, but that&#8217;s a bit of a waste of time as there are plenty of resources out there that have already done it.  If you&#8217;re reading this on the internet then look it up on Google, Wikipedia, or your information source of choice.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;m continuing my learning.<\/p>\n",

Surely there&#8217;s an easier way?<\/p>\n<p>And sometimes things are known by different names.  I still haven&#8217;t worked out if a crank is different from a crankset, or a chain different from a chainset.  There&#8217;s subtle differences between hubs and axles, and it&#8217;s not clear whether I can replace just one, or just the other, or if I always need to replace both.  There&#8217;s seat stays and seat posts, which are very different.  It&#8217;s all very confusing!<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s a useful article that has helped me a little.<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/gear\/article\/buyers-guide-to-road-chainsets-118<\/p>\n<p>My original intention for this post was to list some cycling terminology that I&#8217;ve learned the meaning of and try to keep that up to date, but that&#8217;s a bit of a waste of time as there are plenty of resources out there that have already done it.  If you&#8217;re reading this on the internet then look it up on Google, Wikipedia, or your information source of choice.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;m continuing my learning.<\/p>\n",

Cycling, like many other hobbies, has a language of its own, and experienced participants use it freely without really thinking about poor beginner like me who don&#8217;t know their cranksets from their cassettes and their bar ends [&hellip;]<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve tried out my day-glo waterproof in real rain and I first posted about that on October 3rd.  OK, I did have a week off driving to work (why was that??? can&#8217;t remember now), but it kinda helps prove the point.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, the waterproof proved to be very much so but I got very soggy bottoms and socks and shoes.  Riding home in wet gear isn&#8217;t fun.  Must remember waterproof over-trousers and over-shoes next time.<\/p>\n<p>I have a bit of a backlog of posts to write but not much time at the moment.  Hopefully I&#8217;ll get to catch up soon.  Sally&#8217;s not so well tonight so she&#8217;s gone to bed early and I get a little time that I wouldn&#8217;t normally have.  Bless her.<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve tried out my day-glo waterproof in real rain and I first posted about that on October 3rd.  OK, I did have a week off driving to work (why was that??? can&#8217;t remember now), but it kinda helps prove the point.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, the waterproof proved to be very much so but I got very soggy bottoms and socks and shoes.  Riding home in wet gear isn&#8217;t fun.  Must remember waterproof over-trousers and over-shoes next time.<\/p>\n<p>I have a bit of a backlog of posts to write but not much time at the moment.  Hopefully I&#8217;ll get to catch up soon.  Sally&#8217;s not so well tonight so she&#8217;s gone to bed early and I get a little time that I wouldn&#8217;t normally have.  Bless her.<\/p>\n",

One is that there&#8217;s this competition going on where four projects have the chance to win \u00a350 million of lottery money in a public vote.  One of the projects is being put forward by Sustrans (a sustainable transport organisation) to improve walking and cycling paths, including the National Cycle Network, across the country.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I have a vested interest in this, being a cyclist, but I also think that it&#8217;s the only nationwide project, the others are all specific to one place.  Yes, they&#8217;re all great projects, but the best use of public money is surely to improve access to cycle routes?<\/p>\n<p>Some cyclists are very much against this, assuming that, if there are designated cycle routes, then we&#8217;ll be forced to use them (and they&#8217;re not very good for serious mountain biking or road riding as they&#8217;re mostly paths used for leisure rides and shared with pedestrians), but the National Cycle Network is a great way for a beginner cyclist to discover longer rides, and was very much part of my catching of the cycling bug!<\/p>\n<p>So, if you don&#8217;t know about it, or don&#8217;t really care which project gets the money, I DO!  So please vote for Sustrans.  Details on the competition <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thepeoplesmillions.org.uk\/\">here<\/a> and details of the Sustrans Project &#8220;Connect2&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sustransconnect2.org.uk\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">My Wobbly Wheels<\/p>\n<p><\/span>In other, more personal cycle-related news, my rear wheel is wobbling again.  I thought I&#8217;d done a grand job of repairing the broken spokes, but it seems to still be uneven and, when I hit about 25 mph, it starts to shake me around a bit.<\/p>\n<p>But what to do?  I&#8217;ve had a good go at truing up but without expensive tools it&#8217;ll never be perfect.  Should I buy a new wheel?  Hmm&#8230;<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

One is that there&#8217;s this competition going on where four projects have the chance to win \u00a350 million of lottery money in a public vote.  One of the projects is being put forward by Sustrans (a sustainable transport organisation) to improve walking and cycling paths, including the National Cycle Network, across the country.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I have a vested interest in this, being a cyclist, but I also think that it&#8217;s the only nationwide project, the others are all specific to one place.  Yes, they&#8217;re all great projects, but the best use of public money is surely to improve access to cycle routes?<\/p>\n<p>Some cyclists are very much against this, assuming that, if there are designated cycle routes, then we&#8217;ll be forced to use them (and they&#8217;re not very good for serious mountain biking or road riding as they&#8217;re mostly paths used for leisure rides and shared with pedestrians), but the National Cycle Network is a great way for a beginner cyclist to discover longer rides, and was very much part of my catching of the cycling bug!<\/p>\n<p>So, if you don&#8217;t know about it, or don&#8217;t really care which project gets the money, I DO!  So please vote for Sustrans.  Details on the competition <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thepeoplesmillions.org.uk\/\">here<\/a> and details of the Sustrans Project &#8220;Connect2&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sustransconnect2.org.uk\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">My Wobbly Wheels<\/p>\n<p><\/span>In other, more personal cycle-related news, my rear wheel is wobbling again.  I thought I&#8217;d done a grand job of repairing the broken spokes, but it seems to still be uneven and, when I hit about 25 mph, it starts to shake me around a bit.<\/p>\n<p>But what to do?  I&#8217;ve had a good go at truing up but without expensive tools it&#8217;ll never be perfect.  Should I buy a new wheel?  Hmm&#8230;<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

I remember painting and stuff as a kid but DIY should be handed down to us somehow.  I&#8217;ve lived in rented houses since I was 18 and so all my DIY and decorating has been done for me.  I haven&#8217;t got a clue about filling, sanding, wallpapering, plumbing, electrics, lighting, interior design, building, plastering etc.  There&#8217;s so much to know!  And so much can go wrong.<\/p>\n<p>I hope my readers can learn something from my mistakes.<\/p>\n<p>And, for those of you who know, I&#8217;ve already learned my u-bend lesson!!!

I remember painting and stuff as a kid but DIY should be handed down to us somehow.  I&#8217;ve lived in rented houses since I was 18 and so all my DIY and decorating has been done for me.  I haven&#8217;t got a clue about filling, sanding, wallpapering, plumbing, electrics, lighting, interior design, building, plastering etc.  There&#8217;s so much to know!  And so much can go wrong.<\/p>\n<p>I hope my readers can learn something from my mistakes.<\/p>\n<p>And, for those of you who know, I&#8217;ve already learned my u-bend lesson!!!

Things finally seem to be fixed.  So I&#8217;m taking stock, looking around and thinking &#8220;Phew, OK, so that&#8217;s over&#8230;what now?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To help with that process I&#8217;m re-reading a book that&#8217;s quite well known in Christian circles called &#8220;The Purpose Driven Life&#8221;.  It&#8217;s written by famous American church leader who does lots of &#8220;purpose driven&#8221; stuff.  It&#8217;s a very American book &#8211; though I can&#8217;t really explain why.  But if you can see through the American Evangelical-isms it&#8217;s a good book.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s just what I need right now.  It&#8217;s taking a very beaten and battered soul inside of me, and taking it back to the basics of my faith.  Why am I here?  What on Earth am I doing?  How do I find God in all of this?

        "content": "<p>So, it&#8217;s been a long year.  It&#8217;s been a hard year.  I&#8217;ve been ill a lot.  I&#8217;ve not achieved very much of what I thought I would.  I enjoy physical activity and I&#8217;ve not managed to do much.<\/p>\n<p>On the up side we have bought a house and very much settled in Swindon, into our jobs, and into our church.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve now had a period of feeling well for a while.  Things finally seem to be fixed.  So I&#8217;m taking stock, looking around and thinking &#8220;Phew, OK, so that&#8217;s over&#8230;what now?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To help with that process I&#8217;m re-reading a book that&#8217;s quite well known in Christian circles called &#8220;The Purpose Driven Life&#8221;.  It&#8217;s written by famous American church leader who does lots of &#8220;purpose driven&#8221; stuff.  It&#8217;s a very American book &#8211; though I can&#8217;t really explain why.  But if you can see through the American Evangelical-isms it&#8217;s a good book.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s just what I need right now.  It&#8217;s taking a very beaten and battered soul inside of me, and taking it back to the basics of my faith.  Why am I here?  What on Earth am I doing?  How do I find God in all of this?  And what does he want me to be doing with my life.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully I&#8217;ll be reporting back sometime&#8230;watch this space.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>During our trip to the Lakes last year, to climb Helvellyn via Striding Edge with my sister and her man (oddly, I didn&#8217;t write anything about this, but we did!), we managed to drown both our digital camera and a mobile phone.  They were wrapped up safely in rucksacks but it was so wet that they filled with water anyway and they never came back to life.<\/p>\n<p>So, after phoning the insurance people and a bit of research, we&#8217;ve bought a new digital camera.  We&#8217;ve bought a Canon Ixus 70 because:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>We&#8217;ve had a Canon before, they&#8217;re well built (but not waterproof) and we know how to use them<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s pocket-sized but has a 3x optical zoom and all the features we need.<\/li>\n<li>We&#8217;d hoped for a fully-manual mode but there are hard to find on compact cameras.  You can manually adjust the ISO setting, but there&#8217;s no aperture or time priority.  But then no other camera we looked at had those either.<\/li>\n<li>The flash on our old Canon SureShot A80 was horrible, but this one, in testing, seems to have been improved.<\/li>\n<li>We chose the Ixus 70 over the Ixus 75 mostly because it has a smaller screen and therefore better battery life.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Overall we&#8217;re happy with the purchase.  It&#8217;s small, takes good snaps, the battery lasts long enough (though I don&#8217;t like having a rechargable &#8211; our old one just took standard AA batteries).  It&#8217;s all we expected really.  I guess, to the untrained eye, digital cameras are much of a muchness and though the Ixus 70 is nothing extraordinary, it is a well-built and easy to use camera.<\/p>\n<p>It has one feature that I particularly like though &#8211; it does time-lapse filming!  You can only set it to take a picture every 1 second or two seconds, and it kills the battery pretty quickly, but I&#8217;ve had some fun playing around with it and it gives interesting results.  It has prompted a bit of a fascination with life-at-high-speed.<\/p>\n<p>I first started playing around with this after a day&#8217;s working from home.  Here&#8217;s a bit of me at the laptop &#8211; it&#8217;s quite boring but I had no other subject to try it out on:<\/p>\n<p>For a laugh I tried moving really slowly to see what would happen when speeded back up again.  This has a strange stop-motion animation effect and makes me laugh every time:<\/p>\n<p>I wonder what sort of life-observation could be had with this.  Look out for speeded-up naturewatch movies next spring!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>During our trip to the Lakes last year, to climb Helvellyn via Striding Edge with my sister and her man (oddly, I didn&#8217;t write anything about this, but we did!), we managed to drown both our digital camera and a mobile phone.  They were wrapped up safely in rucksacks but it was so wet that they filled with water anyway and they never came back to life.<\/p>\n<p>So, after phoning the insurance people and a bit of research, we&#8217;ve bought a new digital camera.  We&#8217;ve bought a Canon Ixus 70 because:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>We&#8217;ve had a Canon before, they&#8217;re well built (but not waterproof) and we know how to use them<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s pocket-sized but has a 3x optical zoom and all the features we need.<\/li>\n<li>We&#8217;d hoped for a fully-manual mode but there are hard to find on compact cameras.  You can manually adjust the ISO setting, but there&#8217;s no aperture or time priority.  But then no other camera we looked at had those either.<\/li>\n<li>The flash on our old Canon SureShot A80 was horrible, but this one, in testing, seems to have been improved.<\/li>\n<li>We chose the Ixus 70 over the Ixus 75 mostly because it has a smaller screen and therefore better battery life.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Overall we&#8217;re happy with the purchase.  It&#8217;s small, takes good snaps, the battery lasts long enough (though I don&#8217;t like having a rechargable &#8211; our old one just took standard AA batteries).  It&#8217;s all we expected really.  I guess, to the untrained eye, digital cameras are much of a muchness and though the Ixus 70 is nothing extraordinary, it is a well-built and easy to use camera.<\/p>\n<p>It has one feature that I particularly like though &#8211; it does time-lapse filming!  You can only set it to take a picture every 1 second or two seconds, and it kills the battery pretty quickly, but I&#8217;ve had some fun playing around with it and it gives interesting results.  It has prompted a bit of a fascination with life-at-high-speed.<\/p>\n<p>I first started playing around with this after a day&#8217;s working from home.  Here&#8217;s a bit of me at the laptop &#8211; it&#8217;s quite boring but I had no other subject to try it out on:<\/p>\n<p>For a laugh I tried moving really slowly to see what would happen when speeded back up again.  This has a strange stop-motion animation effect and makes me laugh every time:<\/p>\n<p>I wonder what sort of life-observation could be had with this.  Look out for speeded-up naturewatch movies next spring!<\/p>\n",
