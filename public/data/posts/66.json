This is a government initiative designed to encourage people to cycle to work.  Which I do anyway, but it&#8217;s still a real treat.<\/p>\n<p>What happens is this.  I go out bike shopping to buy myself some new wheels to ride to work on, and any associated safety equipment I need.  My employer buys this stuff, and I rent it back from them for 12 months, making 12 monthly payments to cover the cost of the kit. BUT, because my employer buys the bike, they don&#8217;t pay VAT, so I get 17.5% off. AND, I pay before tax and National Insurance are deducted, so I get about another 30% off!  AND I get it all on a 12 month interest-free loan!<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the 12 months I get to buy the bike for a nominal fee &#8211; usually 5% of its cost.<\/p>\n<p>Doing the maths, this means I can buy a nice, say, \u00a3600 road bike and get about 49% off the cost!<\/p>\n<p>This is exactly what I&#8217;m doing.<\/p>\n<p>I looked at 3 bikes: the Giant SCR2 (I think it was SCR2) a something like \u00a3525, the KONA Zing (\u00a3999 reduced to \u00a3695) and the Felt Z90 (\u00a3600).<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span>The Giant didn&#8217;t really do much for me at all.  You pretty much got what you paid for, and the shop that had it would only sell at RRP, not doing any discounted bikes on the cycle scheme that we&#8217;re signed up to at work.<\/p>\n<p>The KONA was a VERY pretty bike, well equipped and great value with the \u00a3300 knocked off, but it was a racing bike really.  Low position and very hard ride.  The higher spec was tempting but in the end the Felt beat it on comfort and suitablility for the kind of riding that I&#8217;m doing.<\/p>\n<p>So I have a Felt Z90 on order.  Aluminium frame, carbon forks, 27 gears, mostly Shimano equipped.  It has a slightly more upright riding position and the extra chain ring (that&#8217;s a 3rd big ring by the pedals), bar-top brake levers and softer ride made it a good buy, and very suitable for the training\/touring kind of rides that I&#8217;m doing.<\/p>\n<p>It takes a while to process the paperwork for the cycle scheme but hopefully I&#8217;ll have it before Christmas!!!  Yipeee!!!!<\/p>\n",

This is a government initiative designed to encourage people to cycle to work.  Which I do anyway, but it&#8217;s still a real treat.<\/p>\n<p>What happens is this.  I go out bike shopping to buy myself some new wheels to ride to work on, and any associated safety equipment I need.  My employer buys this stuff, and I rent it back from them for 12 months, making 12 monthly payments to cover the cost of the kit. BUT, because my employer buys the bike, they don&#8217;t pay VAT, so I get 17.5% off. AND, I pay before tax and National Insurance are deducted, so I get about another 30% off!  AND I get it all on a 12 month interest-free loan!<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the 12 months I get to buy the bike for a nominal fee &#8211; usually 5% of its cost.<\/p>\n<p>Doing the maths, this means I can buy a nice, say, \u00a3600 road bike and get about 49% off the cost!<\/p>\n<p>This is exactly what I&#8217;m doing.<\/p>\n<p>I looked at 3 bikes: the Giant SCR2 (I think it was SCR2) a something like \u00a3525, the KONA Zing (\u00a3999 reduced to \u00a3695) and the Felt Z90 (\u00a3600).<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span>The Giant didn&#8217;t really do much for me at all.  You pretty much got what you paid for, and the shop that had it would only sell at RRP, not doing any discounted bikes on the cycle scheme that we&#8217;re signed up to at work.<\/p>\n<p>The KONA was a VERY pretty bike, well equipped and great value with the \u00a3300 knocked off, but it was a racing bike really.  Low position and very hard ride.  The higher spec was tempting but in the end the Felt beat it on comfort and suitablility for the kind of riding that I&#8217;m doing.<\/p>\n<p>So I have a Felt Z90 on order.  Aluminium frame, carbon forks, 27 gears, mostly Shimano equipped.  It has a slightly more upright riding position and the extra chain ring (that&#8217;s a 3rd big ring by the pedals), bar-top brake levers and softer ride made it a good buy, and very suitable for the training\/touring kind of rides that I&#8217;m doing.<\/p>\n<p>It takes a while to process the paperwork for the cycle scheme but hopefully I&#8217;ll have it before Christmas!!!  Yipeee!!!!<\/p>\n",

Cycling, like many other hobbies, has a language of its own, and experienced participants use it freely without really thinking about poor beginner like me who don&#8217;t know their cranksets from their cassettes and their bar ends from their bottom brackets.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been looking into new bikes and doing some maintenance so I&#8217;ve been struggling myself.  The component manufacturers don&#8217;t help by naming equipment in the same sort of way that car manufacturers give names to cars.  How am I supposed to know the difference between Sora, Tiagra, Ultegra, 105, Dura Ace and so on, easily, without having to research it all the time?  Surely there&#8217;s an easier way?<\/p>\n<p>And sometimes things are known by different names.  I still haven&#8217;t worked out if a crank is different from a crankset, or a chain different from a chainset.  There&#8217;s subtle differences between hubs and axles, and it&#8217;s not clear whether I can replace just one, or just the other, or if I always need to replace both.  There&#8217;s seat stays and seat posts, which are very different.  It&#8217;s all very confusing!<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s a useful article that has helped me a little.<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/gear\/article\/buyers-guide-to-road-chainsets-118<\/p>\n<p>My original intention for this post was to list some cycling terminology that I&#8217;ve learned the meaning of and try to keep that up to date, but that&#8217;s a bit of a waste of time as there are plenty of resources out there that have already done it.  If you&#8217;re reading this on the internet then look it up on Google, Wikipedia, or your information source of choice.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;m continuing my learning.<\/p>\n",

Cycling, like many other hobbies, has a language of its own, and experienced participants use it freely without really thinking about poor beginner like me who don&#8217;t know their cranksets from their cassettes and their bar ends from their bottom brackets.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been looking into new bikes and doing some maintenance so I&#8217;ve been struggling myself.  The component manufacturers don&#8217;t help by naming equipment in the same sort of way that car manufacturers give names to cars.  How am I supposed to know the difference between Sora, Tiagra, Ultegra, 105, Dura Ace and so on, easily, without having to research it all the time?  Surely there&#8217;s an easier way?<\/p>\n<p>And sometimes things are known by different names.  I still haven&#8217;t worked out if a crank is different from a crankset, or a chain different from a chainset.  There&#8217;s subtle differences between hubs and axles, and it&#8217;s not clear whether I can replace just one, or just the other, or if I always need to replace both.  There&#8217;s seat stays and seat posts, which are very different.  It&#8217;s all very confusing!<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s a useful article that has helped me a little.<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/gear\/article\/buyers-guide-to-road-chainsets-118<\/p>\n<p>My original intention for this post was to list some cycling terminology that I&#8217;ve learned the meaning of and try to keep that up to date, but that&#8217;s a bit of a waste of time as there are plenty of resources out there that have already done it.  If you&#8217;re reading this on the internet then look it up on Google, Wikipedia, or your information source of choice.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;m continuing my learning.<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve tried out my day-glo waterproof in real rain and I first posted about that on October 3rd.  OK, I did have a week off driving to work (why was that??? can&#8217;t remember now), but it kinda helps prove the point.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, the waterproof proved to be very much so but I got very soggy bottoms and socks and shoes.  Riding home in wet gear isn&#8217;t fun.  Must remember waterproof over-trousers and over-shoes next time.<\/p>\n<p>I have a bit of a backlog of posts to write but not much time at the moment.

It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve tried out my day-glo waterproof in real rain and I first posted about that on October 3rd.  OK, I did have a week off driving to work (why was that??? can&#8217;t remember now), but it kinda helps prove the point.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, the waterproof proved to be very much so but I got very soggy bottoms and socks and shoes.  Riding home in wet gear isn&#8217;t fun.  Must remember waterproof over-trousers and over-shoes next time.<\/p>\n<p>I have a bit of a backlog of posts to write but not much time at the moment.  Hopefully I&#8217;ll get to catch up soon.  Sally&#8217;s not so well tonight so she&#8217;s gone to bed early and I get a little time that I wouldn&#8217;t normally have.  Bless her.<\/p>\n",

One is that there&#8217;s this competition going on where four projects have the chance to win \u00a350 million of lottery money in a public vote.  One of the projects is being put forward by Sustrans (a sustainable transport organisation) to improve walking and cycling paths, including the National Cycle Network, across the country.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I have a vested interest in this, being a cyclist, but I also think that it&#8217;s the only nationwide project, the others are all specific to one place.  Yes, they&#8217;re all great projects, but the best use of public money is surely to improve access to cycle routes?<\/p>\n<p>Some cyclists are very much against this, assuming that, if there are designated cycle routes, then we&#8217;ll be forced to use them (and they&#8217;re not very good for serious mountain biking or road riding as they&#8217;re mostly paths used for leisure rides and shared with pedestrians), but the National Cycle Network is a great way for a beginner cyclist to discover longer rides, and was very much part of my catching of the cycling bug!<\/p>\n<p>So, if you don&#8217;t know about it, or don&#8217;t really care which project gets the money, I DO!  So please vote for Sustrans.  Details on the competition <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thepeoplesmillions.org.uk\/\">here<\/a> and details of the Sustrans Project &#8220;Connect2&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sustransconnect2.org.uk\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">My Wobbly Wheels<\/p>\n<p><\/span>In other, more personal cycle-related news, my rear wheel is wobbling again.  I thought I&#8217;d done a grand job of repairing the broken spokes, but it seems to still be uneven and, when I hit about 25 mph, it starts to shake me around a bit.<\/p>\n<p>But what to do?  I&#8217;ve had a good go at truing up but without expensive tools it&#8217;ll never be perfect.  Should I buy a new wheel?  Hmm&#8230;<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

One is that there&#8217;s this competition going on where four projects have the chance to win \u00a350 million of lottery money in a public vote.  One of the projects is being put forward by Sustrans (a sustainable transport organisation) to improve walking and cycling paths, including the National Cycle Network, across the country.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I have a vested interest in this, being a cyclist, but I also think that it&#8217;s the only nationwide project, the others are all specific to one place.  Yes, they&#8217;re all great projects, but the best use of public money is surely to improve access to cycle routes?<\/p>\n<p>Some cyclists are very much against this, assuming that, if there are designated cycle routes, then we&#8217;ll be forced to use them (and they&#8217;re not very good for serious mountain biking or road riding as they&#8217;re mostly paths used for leisure rides and shared with pedestrians), but the National Cycle Network is a great way for a beginner cyclist to discover longer rides, and was very much part of my catching of the cycling bug!<\/p>\n<p>So, if you don&#8217;t know about it, or don&#8217;t really care which project gets the money, I DO!  So please vote for Sustrans.  Details on the competition <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thepeoplesmillions.org.uk\/\">here<\/a> and details of the Sustrans Project &#8220;Connect2&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sustransconnect2.org.uk\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">My Wobbly Wheels<\/p>\n<p><\/span>In other, more personal cycle-related news, my rear wheel is wobbling again.  I thought I&#8217;d done a grand job of repairing the broken spokes, but it seems to still be uneven and, when I hit about 25 mph, it starts to shake me around a bit.<\/p>\n<p>But what to do?  I&#8217;ve had a good go at truing up but without expensive tools it&#8217;ll never be perfect.  Should I buy a new wheel?  Hmm&#8230;<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

I remember painting and stuff as a kid but DIY should be handed down to us somehow.  I&#8217;ve lived in rented houses since I was 18 and so all my DIY and decorating has been done for me.  I haven&#8217;t got a clue about filling, sanding, wallpapering, plumbing, electrics, lighting, interior design, building, plastering etc.  There&#8217;s so much to know!  And so much can go wrong.<\/p>\n<p>I hope my readers can learn something from my mistakes.<\/p>\n<p>And, for those of you who know, I&#8217;ve already learned my u-bend lesson!!!

This thread will be the ups and down, ins and outs, successes, failures, and lessons learned, of learning to do DIY.<\/p>\n<p>Which starts here with the question &#8220;Why does no one teach us this stuff?&#8221;.  I remember painting and stuff as a kid but DIY should be handed down to us somehow.  I&#8217;ve lived in rented houses since I was 18 and so all my DIY and decorating has been done for me.  I haven&#8217;t got a clue about filling, sanding, wallpapering, plumbing, electrics, lighting, interior design, building, plastering etc.  There&#8217;s so much to know!  And so much can go wrong.<\/p>\n<p>I hope my readers can learn something from my mistakes.<\/p>\n<p>And, for those of you who know, I&#8217;ve already learned my u-bend lesson!!!  Won&#8217;t be doing that again.<\/p>\n",

Things finally seem to be fixed.  So I&#8217;m taking stock, looking around and thinking &#8220;Phew, OK, so that&#8217;s over&#8230;what now?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To help with that process I&#8217;m re-reading a book that&#8217;s quite well known in Christian circles called &#8220;The Purpose Driven Life&#8221;.  It&#8217;s written by famous American church leader who does lots of &#8220;purpose driven&#8221; stuff.  It&#8217;s a very American book &#8211; though I can&#8217;t really explain why.  But if you can see through the American Evangelical-isms it&#8217;s a good book.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s just what I need right now.  It&#8217;s taking a very beaten and battered soul inside of me, and taking it back to the basics of my faith.  Why am I here?  What on Earth am I doing?  How do I find God in all of this?  And what does he want me to be doing with my life.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully I&#8217;ll be reporting back sometime&#8230;watch this space.<\/p>\n",

I enjoy physical activity and I&#8217;ve not managed to do much.<\/p>\n<p>On the up side we have bought a house and very much settled in Swindon, into our jobs, and into our church.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve now had a period of feeling well for a while.  Things finally seem to be fixed.  So I&#8217;m taking stock, looking around and thinking &#8220;Phew, OK, so that&#8217;s over&#8230;what now?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To help with that process I&#8217;m re-reading a book that&#8217;s quite well known in Christian circles called &#8220;The Purpose Driven Life&#8221;.  It&#8217;s written by famous American church leader who does lots of &#8220;purpose driven&#8221; stuff.  It&#8217;s a very American book &#8211; though I can&#8217;t really explain why.  But if you can see through the American Evangelical-isms it&#8217;s a good book.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s just what I need right now.  It&#8217;s taking a very beaten and battered soul inside of me, and taking it back to the basics of my faith.  Why am I here?  What on Earth am I doing?  How do I find God in all of this?  And what does he want me to be doing with my life.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully I&#8217;ll be reporting back sometime&#8230;watch this space.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>During our trip to the Lakes last year, to climb Helvellyn via Striding Edge with my sister and her man (oddly, I didn&#8217;t write anything about this, but we did!), we managed to drown both our digital camera and a mobile phone.  They were wrapped up safely in rucksacks but it was so wet that they filled with water anyway and they never came back to life.<\/p>\n<p>So, after phoning the insurance people and a bit of research, we&#8217;ve bought a new digital camera.  We&#8217;ve bought a Canon Ixus 70 because:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>We&#8217;ve had a Canon before, they&#8217;re well built (but not waterproof) and we know how to use them<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s pocket-sized but has a 3x optical zoom and all the features we need.<\/li>\n<li>We&#8217;d hoped for a fully-manual mode but there are hard to find on compact cameras.  You can manually adjust the ISO setting, but there&#8217;s no aperture or time priority.  But then no other camera we looked at had those either.<\/li>\n<li>The flash on our old Canon SureShot A80 was horrible, but this one, in testing, seems to have been improved.<\/li>\n<li>We chose the Ixus 70 over the Ixus 75 mostly because it has a smaller screen and therefore better battery life.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Overall we&#8217;re happy with the purchase.  It&#8217;s small, takes good snaps, the battery lasts long enough (though I don&#8217;t like having a rechargable &#8211; our old one just took standard AA batteries).  It&#8217;s all we expected really.  I guess, to the untrained eye, digital cameras are much of a muchness and though the Ixus 70 is nothing extraordinary, it is a well-built and easy to use camera.<\/p>\n<p>It has one feature that I particularly like though &#8211; it does time-lapse filming!  You can only set it to take a picture every 1 second or two seconds, and it kills the battery pretty quickly, but I&#8217;ve had some fun playing around with it and it gives interesting results.  It has prompted a bit of a fascination with life-at-high-speed.<\/p>\n<p>I first started playing around with this after a day&#8217;s working from home.  Here&#8217;s a bit of me at the laptop &#8211; it&#8217;s quite boring but I had no other subject to try it out on:<\/p>\n<p>For a laugh I tried moving really slowly to see what would happen when speeded back up again.  This has a strange stop-motion animation effect and makes me laugh every time:<\/p>\n<p>I wonder what sort of life-observation could be had with this.  Look out for speeded-up naturewatch movies next spring!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>During our trip to the Lakes last year, to climb Helvellyn via Striding Edge with my sister and her man (oddly, I didn&#8217;t write anything about this, but we did!), we managed to drown both our digital camera and a mobile phone.  They were wrapped up safely in rucksacks but it was so wet that they filled with water anyway and they never came back to life.<\/p>\n<p>So, after phoning the insurance people and a bit of research, we&#8217;ve bought a new digital camera.  We&#8217;ve bought a Canon Ixus 70 because:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>We&#8217;ve had a Canon before, they&#8217;re well built (but not waterproof) and we know how to use them<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s pocket-sized but has a 3x optical zoom and all the features we need.<\/li>\n<li>We&#8217;d hoped for a fully-manual mode but there are hard to find on compact cameras.  You can manually adjust the ISO setting, but there&#8217;s no aperture or time priority.  But then no other camera we looked at had those either.<\/li>\n<li>The flash on our old Canon SureShot A80 was horrible, but this one, in testing, seems to have been improved.<\/li>\n<li>We chose the Ixus 70 over the Ixus 75 mostly because it has a smaller screen and therefore better battery life.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Overall we&#8217;re happy with the purchase.  It&#8217;s small, takes good snaps, the battery lasts long enough (though I don&#8217;t like having a rechargable &#8211; our old one just took standard AA batteries).  It&#8217;s all we expected really.  I guess, to the untrained eye, digital cameras are much of a muchness and though the Ixus 70 is nothing extraordinary, it is a well-built and easy to use camera.<\/p>\n<p>It has one feature that I particularly like though &#8211; it does time-lapse filming!  You can only set it to take a picture every 1 second or two seconds, and it kills the battery pretty quickly, but I&#8217;ve had some fun playing around with it and it gives interesting results.  It has prompted a bit of a fascination with life-at-high-speed.<\/p>\n<p>I first started playing around with this after a day&#8217;s working from home.  Here&#8217;s a bit of me at the laptop &#8211; it&#8217;s quite boring but I had no other subject to try it out on:<\/p>\n<p>For a laugh I tried moving really slowly to see what would happen when speeded back up again.  This has a strange stop-motion animation effect and makes me laugh every time:<\/p>\n<p>I wonder what sort of life-observation could be had with this.  Look out for speeded-up naturewatch movies next spring!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>We&#8217;ve had the good fortune of seeing a couple of gigs lately.  We always enjoy live music, but finding bands\/artists we like at venues we like on dates that we&#8217;re free, and at prices we like is always difficult.<\/p>\n<p>However &#8211; despite our picky-ness we made it to the following recently (nicely matching with some recent CD purschases!)<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">KT Tunstall at Colston Hall, Bristol<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now&#8230;one of the games we played when we lived in Shepherd&#8217;s Bush was guessing who was playing at the Empire (a popular music venue just round the corner from where we lived) from the people who were queueing up\/milling around.  e.g. Jack Johnson gigs have lots of normally-dressed, but pretty stoned, surfer and indie types; The Beautiful South had lots of middle-aged, middle-of-the-road-looking people queueing outside.<\/p>\n<p>For some reason, I was very self-concious at this KT gig.  Though the crowd was a real mix, I felt slightly too young, slightly too normal, slightly too 90&#8217;s indie.  Yet, I think if I was playing the &#8220;who&#8217;s on at the Colston Hall&#8221; game, I&#8217;d have picked me out as a MOR soft-rocker type along with everyone else.  And I didn&#8217;t like that.  Part of me is embarrassed that I went.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;I don&#8217;t really care.  The gig was GREAT!  KT is a great entertainer, with lots of crowd-pleasing banter.  She&#8217;s confident and charming, but a bit kooky.  She&#8217;s incredibly cool, and very talented, but comes across as homely and clumsy.  Her mum and dad were in the audience and she even forgot the words to one song called &#8220;Hopeless&#8221;, which, ironically, is about being just that!<\/p>\n<p>The band were awesome and KT certainly doesn&#8217;t stand alone, with a bassist, guitarist, keyboards\/random sounds guy, a brilliant percussionist (I&#8217;m not calling him a drummer because he played far more than just drums), and two backing singers, playing, between them all, a HUGE number of different instruments.<\/p>\n<p>The songs were great, and we had fun, and enjoyed a class act.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Martyn Joseph at Marlborough Town Hall<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I was almost certainly too young and too cool to attend this aging, accoustic folk-rockers latest tour, but we love him to bits and we&#8217;ve caught the last 2 tours (and previous gigs too), so I&#8217;ve already lost any credibility I might have had. \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve seen MJ with accompaniment before &#8211; a single keyboard player at a gig at Bush Hall in London.  But this time he had a little band of sorts.  There was a very cool-looking and talented female bassist playing double bass and both fretted and fretless electric bass &#8211; not all at the same time of course.  And a very un-cool-looking but equally talented wind-instrument guy, playing tenor sax, clarinet and&#8230;yes really&#8230;the recorder!<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t say much about MJ.  He was on good form and the new songs, which have grown on me more since my album review, sound great live.  Though I prefer &#8220;Kindness&#8221; unaccompanied&#8230;it has a certain kind of emotion and tension when it&#8217;s just the accoustic guitar&#8230;it&#8217;s longing for more sound around it&#8230;&#8221;how I miss you\/my angel and my reason how I miss you&#8221;.  (Though I&#8217;m just listening to it again and there&#8217;s a hint of piano and electric guitar on the album version&#8230;so I&#8217;m wrong there.  I do prefer the album version though).<\/p>\n<p>What did amaze me at this gig was the teamwork, humility and restraint of the musicians.  The wind-instrument guy hardly played at all.  He only chipped in when it was needed.  He didn&#8217;t, pardon the pun, blow his own trumpet.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a great metaphor in here for how we should live our lives.  Quietly working in the background, not demanding attention, playing along to the tune of our creator, but remembering always that it&#8217;s His work.  He&#8217;s the lead, we follow, we play, and if we demand too much attention that will detract from His glory!<\/p>\n<p>Music is a great gift and I left both gigs thankful for the talented people who write and play these songs to bring us pleasure.<\/p>\n",

We always enjoy live music, but finding bands\/artists we like at venues we like on dates that we&#8217;re free, and at prices we like is always difficult.<\/p>\n<p>However &#8211; despite our picky-ness we made it to the following recently (nicely matching with some recent CD purschases!)<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">KT Tunstall at Colston Hall, Bristol<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now&#8230;one of the games we played when we lived in Shepherd&#8217;s Bush was guessing who was playing at the Empire (a popular music venue just round the corner from where we lived) from the people who were queueing up\/milling around.  e.g. Jack Johnson gigs have lots of normally-dressed, but pretty stoned, surfer and indie types; The Beautiful South had lots of middle-aged, middle-of-the-road-looking people queueing outside.<\/p>\n<p>For some reason, I was very self-concious at this KT gig.  Though the crowd was a real mix, I felt slightly too young, slightly too normal, slightly too 90&#8217;s indie.  Yet, I think if I was playing the &#8220;who&#8217;s on at the Colston Hall&#8221; game, I&#8217;d have picked me out as a MOR soft-rocker type along with everyone else.  And I didn&#8217;t like that.  Part of me is embarrassed that I went.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;I don&#8217;t really care.  The gig was GREAT!  KT is a great entertainer, with lots of crowd-pleasing banter.  She&#8217;s confident and charming, but a bit kooky.  She&#8217;s incredibly cool, and very talented, but comes across as homely and clumsy.  Her mum and dad were in the audience and she even forgot the words to one song called &#8220;Hopeless&#8221;, which, ironically, is about being just that!<\/p>\n<p>The band were awesome and KT certainly doesn&#8217;t stand alone, with a bassist, guitarist, keyboards\/random sounds guy, a brilliant percussionist (I&#8217;m not calling him a drummer because he played far more than just drums), and two backing singers, playing, between them all, a HUGE number of different instruments.<\/p>\n<p>The songs were great, and we had fun, and enjoyed a class act.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Martyn Joseph at Marlborough Town Hall<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I was almost certainly too young and too cool to attend this aging, accoustic folk-rockers latest tour, but we love him to bits and we&#8217;ve caught the last 2 tours (and previous gigs too), so I&#8217;ve already lost any credibility I might have had. \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve seen MJ with accompaniment before &#8211; a single keyboard player at a gig at Bush Hall in London.  But this time he had a little band of sorts.  There was a very cool-looking and talented female bassist playing double bass and both fretted and fretless electric bass &#8211; not all at the same time of course.  And a very un-cool-looking but equally talented wind-instrument guy, playing tenor sax, clarinet and&#8230;yes really&#8230;the recorder!<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t say much about MJ.  He was on good form and the new songs, which have grown on me more since my album review, sound great live.  Though I prefer &#8220;Kindness&#8221; unaccompanied&#8230;it has a certain kind of emotion and tension when it&#8217;s just the accoustic guitar&#8230;it&#8217;s longing for more sound around it&#8230;&#8221;how I miss you\/my angel and my reason how I miss you&#8221;.  (Though I&#8217;m just listening to it again and there&#8217;s a hint of piano and electric guitar on the album version&#8230;so I&#8217;m wrong there.  I do prefer the album version though).<\/p>\n<p>What did amaze me at this gig was the teamwork, humility and restraint of the musicians.  The wind-instrument guy hardly played at all.  He only chipped in when it was needed.  He didn&#8217;t, pardon the pun, blow his own trumpet.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a great metaphor in here for how we should live our lives.  Quietly working in the background, not demanding attention, playing along to the tune of our creator, but remembering always that it&#8217;s His work.  He&#8217;s the lead, we follow, we play, and if we demand too much attention that will detract from His glory!<\/p>\n<p>Music is a great gift and I left both gigs thankful for the talented people who write and play these songs to bring us pleasure.<\/p>\n",

Marketing &#8211; hahahaha&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Which pretty much sums up my understanding of the topic.<\/p>\n<p>The issue of &#8220;corporate re-blanding&#8221; has been bothering me for a while.  A certain company quite close to my heart has recently scrapped its well-known logo and put in its place the name of the company, written in a bold, sans serif font, in a variety of colours&#8230;which is exactly what a similar company had done a couple of years beforehand.<\/p>\n<p>But why?  Why scrap an image that&#8217;s recognised around the world and replace it with the same thing that everyone else is doing?<\/p>\n<p>Some examples.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Welcome Break<\/span> &#8211; you&#8217;ve all stopped on the motorway services and experienced the wonders of their toilets.  They used to have a nice old fashioned picture of a swan coming in to land above their name.<\/p>\n<p>I never quite got the swan thing.  Presumably swans like a gigantic fried breakfast halfway through their migration or something (do swans migrate?), but it was recognisable and kinda homely&#8230;welcoming.   So what&#8217;s with the new &#8220;logo&#8221;, which basically looks like this&#8230;<\/p>\n<table style=\"width:154px;height:25px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr><\/p>\n<td bgcolor=\"black\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:rgb(0,102,0);vertical-align:middle;font-family:arial;\">WELCOME<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:rgb(255,255,255);vertical-align:middle;font-family:arial;\">BREAK<\/span><\/td>\n<p><\/tr>\n<p><\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>This one particularly irritates me because <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">NOW<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">THEY<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">WRITE<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">EVERYTHING<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">IN<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">BOLD <\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">UPPERCASE<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">SANS-SERIF<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">AND<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">ITS<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">REALLY<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">HARD<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">TO<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">READ<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">AND<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">IT<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">SOUNDS<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">LIKE<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">THEY&#8217;RE <\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">SHOUTING<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">AT<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">YOU<\/span><\/span>.

Yes, they&#8217;re doing it on the high street too!  The old, angular logo was just a name and a magic little ampersand, presented on two lines in a nice shade of green.  But it was a well-recognised name.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/span>However, M&amp;S have actually changed a lot.  They used to be seen as a stuffy old supermarket that only sold its own brand food to old people, but for many that view has changed.  Their new logo is modern and reflects that change but I&#8217;m still left wondering if they could have come up with something more unique than their initials in a curvy black and greeny-yellow&#8230;this is not just any logo, it&#8217;s a smooth, sophisticated, trips-off-your tongue logo&#8230;my cheap imitation is simply something like:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-size:180%;\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana;\">M<span style=\"color:rgb(51,153,153);\">&amp;<\/span>S<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/span>The Co-op.  Possibly another story of a stuffy old shop modernising &#8211; the old logo&#8217;s loopy, lowercase, blue letters laid out in a square formation, firmly reminding me of shopping with my granny.  Like M&amp;S I like what the Co-operative are doing but surely they&#8217;re just jumping on a bandwagon with the new look&#8230;which isn&#8217;t far off something like&#8230;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,153);font-size:180%;\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana;\">The<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:arial;\">co-operative<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<p>Even charities are at it&#8230;internation Christian development agency, Tearfund, had their name in two fonts &#8211; with and without serifs, two colours &#8211; deep green and clean white, two weights &#8211; normal and bold, with a nice dandelion head in an orange box next to it.  But even charities modernise and we now have nothing more than&#8230;<\/p>\n<table style=\"width:81px;height:57px;\" bgcolor=\"#339999\">\n<tbody>\n<tr><\/p>\n<td>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:180%;\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana;color:white;\">tearfund<\/span><br \/><\/span><\/td>\n<p><\/tr>\n<p><\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>(I should point out that the &#8220;t&#8221; should be cross-shaped with no curly bottom.

Let&#8217;s just take a company name, optionally abbreviate it in some way, pick a modern typeface, and choose a couple of colours.  Anyone could do it?  Couldn&#8217;t they?<br \/>If I had the time I could write a computer program to randomly re-brand company names in this way.

Marketing &#8211; hahahaha&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Which pretty much sums up my understanding of the topic.<\/p>\n<p>The issue of &#8220;corporate re-blanding&#8221; has been bothering me for a while.  A certain company quite close to my heart has recently scrapped its well-known logo and put in its place the name of the company, written in a bold, sans serif font, in a variety of colours&#8230;which is exactly what a similar company had done a couple of years beforehand.<\/p>\n<p>But why?  Why scrap an image that&#8217;s recognised around the world and replace it with the same thing that everyone else is doing?<\/p>\n<p>Some examples.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Welcome Break<\/span> &#8211; you&#8217;ve all stopped on the motorway services and experienced the wonders of their toilets.  They used to have a nice old fashioned picture of a swan coming in to land above their name.<\/p>\n<p>I never quite got the swan thing.  Presumably swans like a gigantic fried breakfast halfway through their migration or something (do swans migrate?), but it was recognisable and kinda homely&#8230;welcoming.   So what&#8217;s with the new &#8220;logo&#8221;, which basically looks like this&#8230;<\/p>\n<table style=\"width:154px;height:25px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr><\/p>\n<td bgcolor=\"black\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:rgb(0,102,0);vertical-align:middle;font-family:arial;\">WELCOME<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:rgb(255,255,255);vertical-align:middle;font-family:arial;\">BREAK<\/span><\/td>\n<p><\/tr>\n<p><\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>This one particularly irritates me because <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">NOW<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">THEY<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">WRITE<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">EVERYTHING<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">IN<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">BOLD <\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">UPPERCASE<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">SANS-SERIF<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">AND<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">ITS<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">REALLY<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">HARD<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">TO<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">READ<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">AND<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">IT<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">SOUNDS<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">LIKE<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">THEY&#8217;RE <\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">SHOUTING<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">AT<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">YOU<\/span><\/span>.  Not actually very welcoming at all.<br \/><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;\"><br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Marks and Spencer<\/span>:  Wow &#8211; I realise that I&#8217;ve not seen the name in full for a while now. Yes, they&#8217;re doing it on the high street too!  The old, angular logo was just a name and a magic little ampersand, presented on two lines in a nice shade of green.  But it was a well-recognised name.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/span>However, M&amp;S have actually changed a lot.  They used to be seen as a stuffy old supermarket that only sold its own brand food to old people, but for many that view has changed.  Their new logo is modern and reflects that change but I&#8217;m still left wondering if they could have come up with something more unique than their initials in a curvy black and greeny-yellow&#8230;this is not just any logo, it&#8217;s a smooth, sophisticated, trips-off-your tongue logo&#8230;my cheap imitation is simply something like:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-size:180%;\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana;\">M<span style=\"color:rgb(51,153,153);\">&amp;<\/span>S<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/span>The Co-op.  Possibly another story of a stuffy old shop modernising &#8211; the old logo&#8217;s loopy, lowercase, blue letters laid out in a square formation, firmly reminding me of shopping with my granny.  Like M&amp;S I like what the Co-operative are doing but surely they&#8217;re just jumping on a bandwagon with the new look&#8230;which isn&#8217;t far off something like&#8230;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,153);font-size:180%;\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana;\">The<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:arial;\">co-operative<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<p>Even charities are at it&#8230;internation Christian development agency, Tearfund, had their name in two fonts &#8211; with and without serifs, two colours &#8211; deep green and clean white, two weights &#8211; normal and bold, with a nice dandelion head in an orange box next to it.  But even charities modernise and we now have nothing more than&#8230;<\/p>\n<table style=\"width:81px;height:57px;\" bgcolor=\"#339999\">\n<tbody>\n<tr><\/p>\n<td>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:180%;\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana;color:white;\">tearfund<\/span><br \/><\/span><\/td>\n<p><\/tr>\n<p><\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>(I should point out that the &#8220;t&#8221; should be cross-shaped with no curly bottom.  This is probably important, but I don&#8217;t have a standard font that looks like that!)<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a silly thing to have a rant about but what bugs me is that all the skill and creativity seems to have gone from marketing.  Let&#8217;s just take a company name, optionally abbreviate it in some way, pick a modern typeface, and choose a couple of colours.  Anyone could do it?  Couldn&#8217;t they?<br \/>If I had the time I could write a computer program to randomly re-brand company names in this way.  And people get paid a fortune to do it?<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;to any marketing people out there&#8230;what&#8217;s stopping me?<\/p>\n<p>Alien 1: Here, buy this<br \/>Alien 2: I already have this<br \/>Alien 1: &#8220;Marketing&#8221;<br \/>Alien 2: Okay then, I&#8217;ll buy it<br \/>Alien 1: I have laughed so hard I have accidentally passed what passes for alien wee-wee<br \/>Alien 2: Put it in a bottle, you could sell it to the humans<br \/>Both: hahahahaha<\/p>\n",
