                "rendered": "\n<p>It sounds simple, but the concept of &#8220;remembering&#8221; has becoming really important to me. Not facts, or information, but people and situations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can so easily \u201cforget\u201d &#8211; just get on with our own things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Remembering\u201d people &#8211; bringing them and their situations to mind &#8211; makes us mindful of their reality. And when we do that we gain empathy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sometimes try to do this when navigating a busy city. Noting that the people around me are\u2026 people! They have thoughts and feelings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they have a difficult situation they are working through and life is hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they are celebrating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they are on their way to a job interview. Or an important meeting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they couldn&#8217;t pay their electricity bill today or visited a food bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they have a Jewish friend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they know someone living in Gaza.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be overwhelming, realising that all those people passing by have complex inner lives and relationships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, it seems more critical than ever that we remember.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also overwhelming to think of people we don&#8217;t see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who, themselves, live &#8211; or are struggling to live &#8211; in Gaza&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who are on the front-line in Ukraine&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People working in hospitals in war zones&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People digging through rubble to find their child or sibling or parent&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is overwhelming. And it&#8217;s OK to not focus on it all day long. To distract yourself. To switch off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we must remember.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For if we don&#8217;t remember, we don&#8217;t have empathy; we are, as I once heard, &#8220;like a cow looking at cars. You know, a cow looks at a car. They watch it. But nothing&#8217;s going on. When you drive past a cow [in Ireland] it looks up, it watches, but there&#8217;s nothing going on inside. And then it goes back to eating. That&#8217;s how we treat people in daily life&#8230; you don&#8217;t really see them. They&#8217;re just objects. They are functions.&#8221;<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>It sounds simple, but the concept of &#8220;remembering&#8221; has becoming really important to me. Not facts, or information, but people and situations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can so easily \u201cforget\u201d &#8211; just get on with our own things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Remembering\u201d people &#8211; bringing them and their situations to mind &#8211; makes us mindful of their reality. And when we do that we gain empathy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sometimes try to do this when navigating a busy city. Noting that the people around me are\u2026 people! They have thoughts and feelings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they have a difficult situation they are working through and life is hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they are celebrating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they are on their way to a job interview. Or an important meeting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they couldn&#8217;t pay their electricity bill today or visited a food bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they have a Jewish friend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they know someone living in Gaza.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be overwhelming, realising that all those people passing by have complex inner lives and relationships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, it seems more critical than ever that we remember.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also overwhelming to think of people we don&#8217;t see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who, themselves, live &#8211; or are struggling to live &#8211; in Gaza&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who are on the front-line in Ukraine&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People working in hospitals in war zones&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People digging through rubble to find their child or sibling or parent&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is overwhelming. And it&#8217;s OK to not focus on it all day long. To distract yourself. To switch off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we must remember.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For if we don&#8217;t remember, we don&#8217;t have empathy; we are, as I once heard, &#8220;like a cow looking at cars. You know, a cow looks at a car. They watch it. But nothing&#8217;s going on. When you drive past a cow [in Ireland] it looks up, it watches, but there&#8217;s nothing going on inside. And then it goes back to eating. That&#8217;s how we treat people in daily life&#8230; you don&#8217;t really see them. They&#8217;re just objects. They are functions.&#8221;<\/p>\n",

And I couldn&#8217;t find easy answers to any of these problems. So here they are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;Target class [config] does not exist&#8221; error in Tinkerwell with Laravel Zero<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I had this error appearing in Tinkerwell. I searched. I scoured. I even ChatGPT&#8217;d to no avail!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually I realised that Laravel Zero needs its own Tinkerwell driver. And fortunately <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/owenvoke\/e3bf8c7394826c2541d450a5b12b2853\">Owen Voke has provided that<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;cURL error 60: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, I&#8217;m working locally. I&#8217;m trying to use the WordPress REST API served from a local site running on Laravel Valet. And even though I&#8217;ve gone through the Valet certificate trusting dance, <code>curl<\/code> needs a little extra help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My immediate thought was to reach for the <code>'verify' => false<\/code> option. But could I find out how to set this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel provides <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/10.x\/http-client#global-middleware\">Global Request Middleware<\/a>, but this doesn&#8217;t let you set options. These can only be changed when creating an instance of the <code>Http<\/code> client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Rick&#8217;s wonderful WordPress API wrapper doesn&#8217;t let you set options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SO&#8230; I hacked Http options into that and that works a treat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will PR this and hope that Rick accepts it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel Zero with Tinkerwell and the WordPress REST API package!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"509\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-22.02.48-1024x509.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Tinkerwell tinkering app showing the use of Rick West's WordPress REST API package, complete with an API response!

        "content": "\n<p>Today I decided to start work on a silly new thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will involve CLI commands, so I went for <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel-zero.com\/\">Laravel Zero<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I needed to use the WordPress REST API. I figured someone must have written a Laravel HTTP client wrapper for this and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rickwest\/laravel-wordpress-api\">Rick West delivered for me<\/a> there!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I wanted to get Tinkering. And I reach for <a href=\"https:\/\/tinkerwell.app\/ref\/Bzl4z9qvNO\">Tinkerwell<\/a> (&lt;- referral link) for that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s when the problems started. And I couldn&#8217;t find easy answers to any of these problems. So here they are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;Target class [config] does not exist&#8221; error in Tinkerwell with Laravel Zero<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I had this error appearing in Tinkerwell. I searched. I scoured. I even ChatGPT&#8217;d to no avail!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually I realised that Laravel Zero needs its own Tinkerwell driver. And fortunately <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/owenvoke\/e3bf8c7394826c2541d450a5b12b2853\">Owen Voke has provided that<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;cURL error 60: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, I&#8217;m working locally. I&#8217;m trying to use the WordPress REST API served from a local site running on Laravel Valet. And even though I&#8217;ve gone through the Valet certificate trusting dance, <code>curl<\/code> needs a little extra help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My immediate thought was to reach for the <code>'verify' => false<\/code> option. But could I find out how to set this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel provides <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/10.x\/http-client#global-middleware\">Global Request Middleware<\/a>, but this doesn&#8217;t let you set options. These can only be changed when creating an instance of the <code>Http<\/code> client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Rick&#8217;s wonderful WordPress API wrapper doesn&#8217;t let you set options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SO&#8230; I hacked Http options into that and that works a treat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will PR this and hope that Rick accepts it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel Zero with Tinkerwell and the WordPress REST API package!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"509\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/CleanShot-2023-12-06-at-22.02.48-1024x509.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Tinkerwell tinkering app showing the use of Rick West's WordPress REST API package, complete with an API response!

They are on the snack aisle, the baking aisle and in the produce department.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various packet sizes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The actual requirement is something like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Ground Almonds, 150g for baking cake\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lesson: Think about what the other person needs to know to fulfil your requirement without needing further exchange of information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, further communication is needed, which slows you down. OR, the person makes their own assumptions (&#8220;here&#8217;s a 50g packet of flaked almonds!\u201d) and the whole process becomes blocked and rework is needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes longer to do the initial work, but you get your cake baked on time for the birthday party!!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;I was coaching someone on how to be a better mentor recently.

They are on the snack aisle, the baking aisle and in the produce department.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various packet sizes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The actual requirement is something like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Ground Almonds, 150g for baking cake\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lesson: Think about what the other person needs to know to fulfil your requirement without needing further exchange of information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, further communication is needed, which slows you down. OR, the person makes their own assumptions (&#8220;here&#8217;s a 50g packet of flaked almonds!\u201d) and the whole process becomes blocked and rework is needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes longer to do the initial work, but you get your cake baked on time for the birthday party!!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;I was coaching someone on how to be a better mentor recently. One perspective I shared is that while you can teach people better work habits, you can\u2019t teach them to care. That is intrinsic, only the person can choose to care about a job or problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can teach how to code, how to run meetings or how to write status reports.

So&#8230; how?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be a very high-level, figuring out what I need to focus on. Yes, yes, there&#8217;s lots of theory and practice around habits and resolutions that I know but have left out of this. Steven Bartlett would say to focus on one habit, be task oriented and positive. James Clear would tell me to frame them in terms of what sort of person I want to become.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But work with me&#8230; I&#8217;m doing this initial set up in real time. Let&#8217;s see where it leads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a list of things on my mind that I want to do or be better at in the coming year:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Read books<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Write short blog posts\/produce content<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Floss<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exercise and\/or stretch<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Eat well\/lose weight<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Work on side projects<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clean\/tidy\/fix up our house properly<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Declutter\/simplify\/embrace minimalism<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stop going to bed so late!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Structure my day<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use personal todo lists effectively<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>See it:do it<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Take responsibility (there&#8217;s a whole post about this)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a LOT.

But will mean less time for some of the other things! So I added it as medium.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about by importance?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>High\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Eat well\/lose weight<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exercise and\/or stretch<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clean\/tidy\/fix up our house properly<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stop going to bed late<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Medium\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Floss<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Declutter<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Low\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Read books<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Write short blog posts\/produce content<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Work on side projects<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Meta\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>See it:do it<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Structure my day\/todos<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Take responsibility<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That was useful. Seems I value health highly!! And while I WANT the fun stuff to be higher, it&#8217;s really not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have some dimensions here. Size and importance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve read about this somewhere. It&#8217;s probably a James Clear thing. But I swear I&#8217;m totally making this up as I go. We need a diagram!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/2024-Goals_Priorities.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-254834\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/2024-Goals_Priorities.png 960w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/2024-Goals_Priorities-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/2024-Goals_Priorities-768x576.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: I am not a designer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those things in the green zone are the sweet spot. The quick, important things I can do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In theory, side projects are the worst thing to focus on. So that&#8217;s kinda sad. They WILL get attention. But it looks like the things I need to focus on first are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Eat well<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exercise<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Floss<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Declutter<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>See it:do it<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps, once I&#8217;ve got those better, the others will come along more easily.<\/p>\n",

So&#8230; how?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be a very high-level, figuring out what I need to focus on. Yes, yes, there&#8217;s lots of theory and practice around habits and resolutions that I know but have left out of this. Steven Bartlett would say to focus on one habit, be task oriented and positive. James Clear would tell me to frame them in terms of what sort of person I want to become.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But work with me&#8230; I&#8217;m doing this initial set up in real time. Let&#8217;s see where it leads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a list of things on my mind that I want to do or be better at in the coming year:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Read books<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Write short blog posts\/produce content<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Floss<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exercise and\/or stretch<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Eat well\/lose weight<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Work on side projects<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clean\/tidy\/fix up our house properly<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Declutter\/simplify\/embrace minimalism<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stop going to bed so late!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Structure my day<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use personal todo lists effectively<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>See it:do it<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Take responsibility (there&#8217;s a whole post about this)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a LOT.

But will mean less time for some of the other things! So I added it as medium.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about by importance?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>High\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Eat well\/lose weight<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exercise and\/or stretch<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clean\/tidy\/fix up our house properly<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stop going to bed late<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Medium\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Floss<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Declutter<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Low\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Read books<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Write short blog posts\/produce content<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Work on side projects<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Meta\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>See it:do it<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Structure my day\/todos<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Take responsibility<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That was useful. Seems I value health highly!! And while I WANT the fun stuff to be higher, it&#8217;s really not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have some dimensions here. Size and importance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve read about this somewhere. It&#8217;s probably a James Clear thing. But I swear I&#8217;m totally making this up as I go.

But&#8230; WHY???<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Some background<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I made a simple, app-like, completely static-file version of this site! It&#8217;s super-fast and pretty lightweight and it didn&#8217;t take very long. It&#8217;s here:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/m.rosswintle.uk\/\">https:\/\/m.rosswintle.uk\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s some of what I was trying to achieve and why&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Keeping it simple<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I find myself rebelling a lot against the complexity of modern web solutions. I&#8217;m a use-the-platform guy who firmly believes that the simple solutions are better, easier to make and maintain, faster, cheaper, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Proving things to myself<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m working with a lot of complexity at work: mostly building a headless site with React and Next.js and highly-scalable headless solutions involving many layers of caching and integration. This is right (maybe?) for the context of the work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve found myself wondering if a much simpler solution could achieve the same benefits &#8211; to <em>some<\/em> extent, at least.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to prove that there was a &#8220;headless&#8221; solution to websites that didn&#8217;t require node.js or a ton of heavy JavaScript framework code and a zillion dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Yes, I&#8217;m (probably) reinventing the wheel<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If I build a tool that scrapes all the content from the WordPress API and dumps it to some static format for serving as a static site, am I just making a poor-man&#8217;s Gatsby? Or Astro. Or&#8230; Next.js &#8211; the thing I&#8217;m proving that I don&#8217;t need? Or <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/simply-static\/\">Simply Static<\/a>? Is it not just what the JAMStack was doing all along for so many years?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, maybe. And one of the main reasons for using such a tool is that they handle all the complex edge cases that I&#8217;ve almost certainly not thought of yet and don&#8217;t have the constraints that I had. Probably the best reason I&#8217;ve been presented with for using Next.js for a web<em> site<\/em> (rather than a web <em>application<\/em>) is that if you start adding more and more code to handle features and use-cases, you end up with your own Next-like framework anyway, and it&#8217;s better to use a framework maintained by a framework expert! So I see the reasons you would do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I wanted to show what is possible with a very simple approach. It seems to me that you should be able to get a long way building a static site with a simple scraper script and a basic template.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with a bit of JavaScript, maybe using a small reactive framework, we can make it app-like too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Statically hosting all of this on a CDN means free hosting in the best case, and enormous scalability, and global edge serving in the other best case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I won&#8217;t do<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach had some hard constraints\/limitations:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It will be slow to generate a large site<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It will need developer experience and tooling to use<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It won&#8217;t be able to do anything that requires server-side processing without some third party service (e.g. forms, signups, etc &#8211; though I DID find a way to do search!)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Template editing won&#8217;t be WYSIWYG &#8211; the resulting output will be pretty bland and made in HTML and CSS.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all limitations I&#8217;m happy to accept for my simple personal blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I made&#8230; it&#8217;s not finished, but it&#8217;s 80% of the way there:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/m.rosswintle.uk\/\">https:\/\/m.rosswintle.uk\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately the back-end is my regular WordPress blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The static version is built using a PHP-based CLI tool, using <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel-zero.com\/\">Laravel Zero<\/a> to scrape the content, restructure it and save it. It&#8217;s pretty efficient &#8211; the slowness is in the API queries. It builds my 750-page\/post site in about 80 seconds.<br><br>There&#8217;s then a simple HTML template and some <a href=\"https:\/\/alpinejs.dev\/\">AlpineJS<\/a> scripting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was really glad to stumble upon <a href=\"https:\/\/pagefind.app\/\">PageFind<\/a> &#8211; a tool that builds a static content index and that allows search. This makes everything a bit more dynamic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things I want to add in the future:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>History\/back\/forward navigation\/URL updates<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Page listing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ability to re-use the scrape\/build scripts across sites. They&#8217;re not quite site-agnostic yet, and I want to write some docs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a shorter list than I thought it would be before I started writing it! So that&#8217;s good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusions and thoughts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For many years I was pretty unimpressed by the JAMStack approach. I think because it always seemed to be querying some dynamic back-end anyway, so it felt like you had the complexity of a dynamic CMS AND the complexity of a dynamic front-end app, but without very much benefit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps I misunderstood. But it seemed like you had:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Static site generators: all static files, built at run time<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;JAMStack&#8221; sites: static templating, but pulling in dynamic content over an API<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As I&#8217;ve been moving from a &#8220;Spin up a WordPress site for every little project&#8221; approach to a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2023\/08\/free-websites-for-side-projects\/\">Make some static HTML files and host them for free<\/a>&#8221; approach, I&#8217;ve been thinking about how this model can be used more. It&#8217;s cheap. It&#8217;s secure. It&#8217;s fast. I love developing with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not what Next does. Next needs a back-end server and a zillion (ish) dependencies. And it&#8217;s better suited to applications that need lots of dynamic content, not a simple blog site. I remain that if you&#8217;re building a marketing site, the cost\/benefit of Next is low if not negative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s probably what <a href=\"https:\/\/astro.build\/\">Astro<\/a> does, but Astro also has &#8230; checks notes &#8230;  450 ish dependencies!! (Astro looks really interesting, very nicely done, and has <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.astro.build\/en\/guides\/cms\/wordpress\/#building-a-blog-with-wordpress-and-astro\">a guide on working with a WordPress blog\/site<\/a>!). There are probably other frameworks and site generators that can help too. I&#8217;m no expert in this area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My site has 93 JavaScript package dependencies, which is still too many, but most of them are via TailwindCSS which is entirely optional, which I trust, and which rarely breaks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My project also has a bunch of Composer\/PHP dependencies. But most of those are to create the CLI tool that does the scraping. These are not problematic. This stuff just works. It&#8217;s stable. And when it&#8217;s broken you get helpful errors. It&#8217;s not a world of pain like I find npm to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I proved the concept. I achieved my goals. I like this. It&#8217;s not perfect. But I will take it a bit further and see where I get to.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>This time it&#8217;s a static-file-driven, mobile-app-like blog. And the tooling I made should be usable on any simple WordPress blog! But&#8230; WHY???<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Some background<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I made a simple, app-like, completely static-file version of this site! It&#8217;s super-fast and pretty lightweight and it didn&#8217;t take very long. It&#8217;s here:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/m.rosswintle.uk\/\">https:\/\/m.rosswintle.uk\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s some of what I was trying to achieve and why&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Keeping it simple<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I find myself rebelling a lot against the complexity of modern web solutions. I&#8217;m a use-the-platform guy who firmly believes that the simple solutions are better, easier to make and maintain, faster, cheaper, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Proving things to myself<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m working with a lot of complexity at work: mostly building a headless site with React and Next.js and highly-scalable headless solutions involving many layers of caching and integration. This is right (maybe?) for the context of the work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve found myself wondering if a much simpler solution could achieve the same benefits &#8211; to <em>some<\/em> extent, at least.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to prove that there was a &#8220;headless&#8221; solution to websites that didn&#8217;t require node.js or a ton of heavy JavaScript framework code and a zillion dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Yes, I&#8217;m (probably) reinventing the wheel<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If I build a tool that scrapes all the content from the WordPress API and dumps it to some static format for serving as a static site, am I just making a poor-man&#8217;s Gatsby? Or Astro. Or&#8230; Next.js &#8211; the thing I&#8217;m proving that I don&#8217;t need? Or <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/simply-static\/\">Simply Static<\/a>? Is it not just what the JAMStack was doing all along for so many years?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, maybe. And one of the main reasons for using such a tool is that they handle all the complex edge cases that I&#8217;ve almost certainly not thought of yet and don&#8217;t have the constraints that I had. Probably the best reason I&#8217;ve been presented with for using Next.js for a web<em> site<\/em> (rather than a web <em>application<\/em>) is that if you start adding more and more code to handle features and use-cases, you end up with your own Next-like framework anyway, and it&#8217;s better to use a framework maintained by a framework expert! So I see the reasons you would do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I wanted to show what is possible with a very simple approach. It seems to me that you should be able to get a long way building a static site with a simple scraper script and a basic template.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with a bit of JavaScript, maybe using a small reactive framework, we can make it app-like too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Statically hosting all of this on a CDN means free hosting in the best case, and enormous scalability, and global edge serving in the other best case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I won&#8217;t do<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach had some hard constraints\/limitations:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It will be slow to generate a large site<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It will need developer experience and tooling to use<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It won&#8217;t be able to do anything that requires server-side processing without some third party service (e.g. forms, signups, etc &#8211; though I DID find a way to do search!)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Template editing won&#8217;t be WYSIWYG &#8211; the resulting output will be pretty bland and made in HTML and CSS.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all limitations I&#8217;m happy to accept for my simple personal blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I made&#8230; it&#8217;s not finished, but it&#8217;s 80% of the way there:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/m.rosswintle.uk\/\">https:\/\/m.rosswintle.uk\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately the back-end is my regular WordPress blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The static version is built using a PHP-based CLI tool, using <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel-zero.com\/\">Laravel Zero<\/a> to scrape the content, restructure it and save it. It&#8217;s pretty efficient &#8211; the slowness is in the API queries. It builds my 750-page\/post site in about 80 seconds.<br><br>There&#8217;s then a simple HTML template and some <a href=\"https:\/\/alpinejs.dev\/\">AlpineJS<\/a> scripting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was really glad to stumble upon <a href=\"https:\/\/pagefind.app\/\">PageFind<\/a> &#8211; a tool that builds a static content index and that allows search. This makes everything a bit more dynamic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things I want to add in the future:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>History\/back\/forward navigation\/URL updates<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Page listing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ability to re-use the scrape\/build scripts across sites. They&#8217;re not quite site-agnostic yet, and I want to write some docs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a shorter list than I thought it would be before I started writing it! So that&#8217;s good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusions and thoughts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For many years I was pretty unimpressed by the JAMStack approach. I think because it always seemed to be querying some dynamic back-end anyway, so it felt like you had the complexity of a dynamic CMS AND the complexity of a dynamic front-end app, but without very much benefit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps I misunderstood. But it seemed like you had:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Static site generators: all static files, built at run time<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;JAMStack&#8221; sites: static templating, but pulling in dynamic content over an API<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As I&#8217;ve been moving from a &#8220;Spin up a WordPress site for every little project&#8221; approach to a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2023\/08\/free-websites-for-side-projects\/\">Make some static HTML files and host them for free<\/a>&#8221; approach, I&#8217;ve been thinking about how this model can be used more. It&#8217;s cheap. It&#8217;s secure. It&#8217;s fast. I love developing with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not what Next does. Next needs a back-end server and a zillion (ish) dependencies. And it&#8217;s better suited to applications that need lots of dynamic content, not a simple blog site. I remain that if you&#8217;re building a marketing site, the cost\/benefit of Next is low if not negative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s probably what <a href=\"https:\/\/astro.build\/\">Astro<\/a> does, but Astro also has &#8230; checks notes &#8230;  450 ish dependencies!! (Astro looks really interesting, very nicely done, and has <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.astro.build\/en\/guides\/cms\/wordpress\/#building-a-blog-with-wordpress-and-astro\">a guide on working with a WordPress blog\/site<\/a>!). There are probably other frameworks and site generators that can help too. I&#8217;m no expert in this area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My site has 93 JavaScript package dependencies, which is still too many, but most of them are via TailwindCSS which is entirely optional, which I trust, and which rarely breaks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My project also has a bunch of Composer\/PHP dependencies. But most of those are to create the CLI tool that does the scraping. These are not problematic. This stuff just works. It&#8217;s stable. And when it&#8217;s broken you get helpful errors. It&#8217;s not a world of pain like I find npm to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I proved the concept. I achieved my goals. I like this. It&#8217;s not perfect. But I will take it a bit further and see where I get to.<\/p>\n",

We generally do some of these over the breakfast table. It&#8217;s AMAZING that all this stuff exists and is so accessible. Here&#8217;s our favourites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Wordle<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/games\/wordle\/index.html\">https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/games\/wordle\/index.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The classic. We still love it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Connections<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/games\/connections\">https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/games\/connections<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my current favourite. 16 words that you have to group into four groups of four that have something in common. A real brain teaser. But quick and interesting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Waffle<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wafflegame.net\/daily\">https:\/\/wafflegame.net\/daily<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found out about this from a Slack group that has a &#8220;Wordle\/Waffle\/etc&#8221; channel. 6 Wordles in one in a crossword arrangement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keyword<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/games\/keyword\/\">https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/games\/keyword\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My daughter loves this for some reason. But I&#8217;m not so much of a fan. We usually get it without error.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Crosshare<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/crosshare.org\/\">https:\/\/crosshare.org\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love this daily, mini crossword. The app is good. It can be done quickly. Though it often has US-specific cultural references that make it tricky for a Brit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Puzzmo<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re REALLY into Puzzles, then Puzzmo is a good place to hang out. It&#8217;s like a subscription puzzle service (with a free tier) with a community and leaderboards. Co-created by Zach Gage who seems to be churning out puzzle games with a fun design aesthetic (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.playgoodsudoku.com\/\">Good Sudoku<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spelltower.com\/\">Spell Tower<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/playknotwords.com\/\">Knotwords<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Quordle\/Octordle<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/games\/quordle\/#\/\">https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/games\/quordle\/#\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/games\/octordle\/daily\">https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/games\/octordle\/daily<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple Wordles with limited guesses. These are an interesting challenge. We have a good strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Framed<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/framed.wtf\/\">https:\/\/framed.wtf\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For film buffs. You get to guess a movie from 6 images. It&#8217;s good, but requires very specific knowledge and can rarely be worked out. So more of a quiz than a puzzle. We did it for a while but rarely do now. Not kid friendly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Worldle<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/worldle.teuteuf.fr\/\">https:\/\/worldle.teuteuf.fr\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guess the country from its outline. A good little geography quiz. Occasionally veers off to weird Pacific islands that you&#8217;ve never heard of. There are extra bits too like guess the neighbouring countries that improve your geography knowledge. Limited by the number of countries in the world (we&#8217;ve been round at least once).<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s AMAZING that all this stuff exists and is so accessible. Here&#8217;s our favourites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Wordle<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/games\/wordle\/index.html\">https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/games\/wordle\/index.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The classic. We still love it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Connections<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/games\/connections\">https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/games\/connections<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my current favourite. 16 words that you have to group into four groups of four that have something in common. A real brain teaser. But quick and interesting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Waffle<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wafflegame.net\/daily\">https:\/\/wafflegame.net\/daily<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found out about this from a Slack group that has a &#8220;Wordle\/Waffle\/etc&#8221; channel. 6 Wordles in one in a crossword arrangement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keyword<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/games\/keyword\/\">https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/games\/keyword\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My daughter loves this for some reason. But I&#8217;m not so much of a fan. We usually get it without error.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Crosshare<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/crosshare.org\/\">https:\/\/crosshare.org\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love this daily, mini crossword. The app is good. It can be done quickly. Though it often has US-specific cultural references that make it tricky for a Brit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Puzzmo<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re REALLY into Puzzles, then Puzzmo is a good place to hang out. It&#8217;s like a subscription puzzle service (with a free tier) with a community and leaderboards. Co-created by Zach Gage who seems to be churning out puzzle games with a fun design aesthetic (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.playgoodsudoku.com\/\">Good Sudoku<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spelltower.com\/\">Spell Tower<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/playknotwords.com\/\">Knotwords<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Quordle\/Octordle<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/games\/quordle\/#\/\">https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/games\/quordle\/#\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/games\/octordle\/daily\">https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/games\/octordle\/daily<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple Wordles with limited guesses. These are an interesting challenge. We have a good strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Framed<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/framed.wtf\/\">https:\/\/framed.wtf\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For film buffs. You get to guess a movie from 6 images. It&#8217;s good, but requires very specific knowledge and can rarely be worked out. So more of a quiz than a puzzle. We did it for a while but rarely do now. Not kid friendly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Worldle<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/worldle.teuteuf.fr\/\">https:\/\/worldle.teuteuf.fr\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guess the country from its outline. A good little geography quiz. Occasionally veers off to weird Pacific islands that you&#8217;ve never heard of. There are extra bits too like guess the neighbouring countries that improve your geography knowledge. Limited by the number of countries in the world (we&#8217;ve been round at least once).<\/p>\n",

And different coloured jumpers. They were literally all grey and blue before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now I can mix it up a bit more.

Here&#8217;s what I mean.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The phrase is from James Clear, of Atomic Habits fame:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Life is harder when you expect a lot of the world and little of yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life is easier when you expect a lot of yourself and little of the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>High standards, low expectations.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems to me that you can play life two ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can expect everyone to do things your way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is tough, because not everyone even knows what &#8220;your way&#8221; is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This applies as much at the stacking of the dishwasher as it does at the Zoom call.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applying your own standards to others is hard (the &#8220;Life is harder&#8221; bit?).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you need to educate people. Because your way might be worse than someone else&#8217;s, so they need to educate YOU. Because you will be critical of others (silently, or vocally &#8211; both are bad!).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am guilty of these things. And there is balance to be found.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life CAN be easier when people you collaborate with have the same expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wisdom is therefore knowing when to expect a lot of yourself, and when to expect a lot of the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, I had lost that balance and swung to expecting too much of others in the hope that they might work in my ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve known this for a long time and have been figuring out:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Do I keep putting my expectations on them?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do I accept the status quo?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Or do I just get on with things myself?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Life is harder when you expect a lot of the world&#8221; because:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>There is conflict<\/strong>, because the world doesn&#8217;t know what your expectations are.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>You will be disappointed<\/strong> if you expect others to work the way you want them to, because they are not you &#8211; they have different values and goals.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>And your goals aren&#8217;t met<\/strong> because you&#8217;re not doing the work in the hope that others will.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I will soon write about &#8220;confidence&#8221;. These topics are related.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am becoming confident in how I do things. And so I will do them. And if others want to join in then they can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>YES, there are places where processes and standards are necessary for effective collaboration. But where that&#8217;s not the case, I&#8217;m doing things my way, and accepting that others will do things their way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been quite a mindset shift for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m much happier as a result.<\/p>\n",

Here&#8217;s what I mean.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The phrase is from James Clear, of Atomic Habits fame:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Life is harder when you expect a lot of the world and little of yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life is easier when you expect a lot of yourself and little of the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>High standards, low expectations.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems to me that you can play life two ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can expect everyone to do things your way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is tough, because not everyone even knows what &#8220;your way&#8221; is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This applies as much at the stacking of the dishwasher as it does at the Zoom call.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applying your own standards to others is hard (the &#8220;Life is harder&#8221; bit?).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you need to educate people. Because your way might be worse than someone else&#8217;s, so they need to educate YOU. Because you will be critical of others (silently, or vocally &#8211; both are bad!).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am guilty of these things. And there is balance to be found.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life CAN be easier when people you collaborate with have the same expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wisdom is therefore knowing when to expect a lot of yourself, and when to expect a lot of the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, I had lost that balance and swung to expecting too much of others in the hope that they might work in my ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve known this for a long time and have been figuring out:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Do I keep putting my expectations on them?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do I accept the status quo?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Or do I just get on with things myself?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Life is harder when you expect a lot of the world&#8221; because:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>There is conflict<\/strong>, because the world doesn&#8217;t know what your expectations are.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>You will be disappointed<\/strong> if you expect others to work the way you want them to, because they are not you &#8211; they have different values and goals.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>And your goals aren&#8217;t met<\/strong> because you&#8217;re not doing the work in the hope that others will.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I will soon write about &#8220;confidence&#8221;. These topics are related.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am becoming confident in how I do things. And so I will do them. And if others want to join in then they can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>YES, there are places where processes and standards are necessary for effective collaboration. But where that&#8217;s not the case, I&#8217;m doing things my way, and accepting that others will do things their way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been quite a mindset shift for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m much happier as a result.<\/p>\n",

The logical conclusion is, of course, that I should build my own!: <a href=\"https:\/\/notes.veryuseful.app\/\">https:\/\/notes.veryuseful.app\/<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of work, I love my <a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\">Bear Notes<\/a>. It&#8217;s the perfect quick note-taking app for me. Fast, simple, uses markdown, has simple tagging, syncs through iCloud. It&#8217;s great and amazing value for money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at work I&#8217;m hampered by corporate IT and security as to what I can use. So I went looking for alternatives that I CAN use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve looked at <a href=\"https:\/\/obsidian.md\/\">Obsidian<\/a>, and would be plenty happy with it. But that&#8217;s not allowed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also like the simplicity of <a href=\"https:\/\/simplenote.com\/\">Simplenote<\/a>, but again, it&#8217;s not approved!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple&#8217;s Notes app is allowed. But it&#8217;s has the wrong feature set for me and doesn&#8217;t do Markdown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google Keep is also allowed but\u2026 honestly?\u2026 it&#8217;s crap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d previously looked into <a href=\"https:\/\/mdsilo.com\/\">mdSilo<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/logseq.com\/\">logSeq<\/a> as these both had web versions that you could connect to local files. This seemed like it should be allowed. But they both seem to have lost their web-only features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I polled my team, and the majority liked Notion. But I&#8217;ve always found Notion slow and cumbersome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some use Evernote and were looking for alternatives as it&#8217;s gone downhill recently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So\u2026 what to do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scratch your own itch<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Data. Websites. Files. APIs. This is my thing, right? It can&#8217;t be too hard to make a simple notes app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just want a searchable list of notes with titles, tags, markdown. There are open-source markdown editors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My initial thought was to use WordPress as a back end and write a simple web app that saved notes using the WordPress REST API.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I got to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used my <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/small-site-template\">small site template<\/a> with a simple PHP build process, TailwindCSS and AlpineJS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I started building I realised that I could probably just store a good lump of notes in local storage in the browser. Looks like 5MB is the limit and the internet says that a MB is about 500 pages of text. So local storage gets me 2,500 notes. That&#8217;s fine for a good long while. I&#8217;ve only got about 1,100 notes in Bear after about four years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In about 90 minutes on Saturday night I had a working prototype. And as I went to sleep I was thinking that I could just use the browser&#8217;s built-in file access API to save the notes to a JSON file. I could do this every 10 seconds or so as an autosave. In theory I could then ditch the local storage. Hmm\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s Sunday. I&#8217;m writing this post in my own, simple, home-grown notes app that runs in a browser and saves data to a local file.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"994\" height=\"808\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-14-at-21.37.47.png\" alt=\"A screengrab of my new JavaScript-based notes app showing a list of notes on the left, and on the right I am editing this actual post that you are reading!\" class=\"wp-image-254894\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-14-at-21.37.47.png 994w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-14-at-21.37.47-300x244.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-14-at-21.37.47-768x624.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 994px) 100vw, 994px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not perfect. It&#8217;s badly designed. There aren&#8217;t tags yet. But it does what I need for now. And other than major dependencies (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Ionaru\/easy-markdown-editor\">EasyMDE<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/alpinejs.dev\/directives\/bind#binding-classes\">AlpineJS<\/a>) it&#8217;s all my own code. 200 lines of JS (6KB unminified).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please do NOT trust it with important information. Use entirely at your own risk. But do feel free to give it a whirl!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/notes.veryuseful.app\/\">https:\/\/notes.veryuseful.app\/<\/a><\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>I can&#8217;t use any of my favourite note-taking apps at work. But I can use a web browser and I can write JavaScript. The logical conclusion is, of course, that I should build my own!: <a href=\"https:\/\/notes.veryuseful.app\/\">https:\/\/notes.veryuseful.app\/<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of work, I love my <a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\">Bear Notes<\/a>. It&#8217;s the perfect quick note-taking app for me. Fast, simple, uses markdown, has simple tagging, syncs through iCloud. It&#8217;s great and amazing value for money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at work I&#8217;m hampered by corporate IT and security as to what I can use. So I went looking for alternatives that I CAN use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve looked at <a href=\"https:\/\/obsidian.md\/\">Obsidian<\/a>, and would be plenty happy with it. But that&#8217;s not allowed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also like the simplicity of <a href=\"https:\/\/simplenote.com\/\">Simplenote<\/a>, but again, it&#8217;s not approved!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple&#8217;s Notes app is allowed. But it&#8217;s has the wrong feature set for me and doesn&#8217;t do Markdown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google Keep is also allowed but\u2026 honestly?\u2026 it&#8217;s crap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d previously looked into <a href=\"https:\/\/mdsilo.com\/\">mdSilo<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/logseq.com\/\">logSeq<\/a> as these both had web versions that you could connect to local files. This seemed like it should be allowed. But they both seem to have lost their web-only features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I polled my team, and the majority liked Notion. But I&#8217;ve always found Notion slow and cumbersome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some use Evernote and were looking for alternatives as it&#8217;s gone downhill recently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So\u2026 what to do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scratch your own itch<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Data. Websites. Files. APIs. This is my thing, right? It can&#8217;t be too hard to make a simple notes app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just want a searchable list of notes with titles, tags, markdown. There are open-source markdown editors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My initial thought was to use WordPress as a back end and write a simple web app that saved notes using the WordPress REST API.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I got to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used my <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/small-site-template\">small site template<\/a> with a simple PHP build process, TailwindCSS and AlpineJS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I started building I realised that I could probably just store a good lump of notes in local storage in the browser. Looks like 5MB is the limit and the internet says that a MB is about 500 pages of text. So local storage gets me 2,500 notes. That&#8217;s fine for a good long while. I&#8217;ve only got about 1,100 notes in Bear after about four years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In about 90 minutes on Saturday night I had a working prototype. And as I went to sleep I was thinking that I could just use the browser&#8217;s built-in file access API to save the notes to a JSON file. I could do this every 10 seconds or so as an autosave. In theory I could then ditch the local storage. Hmm\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s Sunday. I&#8217;m writing this post in my own, simple, home-grown notes app that runs in a browser and saves data to a local file.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"994\" height=\"808\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-14-at-21.37.47.png\" alt=\"A screengrab of my new JavaScript-based notes app showing a list of notes on the left, and on the right I am editing this actual post that you are reading!\" class=\"wp-image-254894\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-14-at-21.37.47.png 994w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-14-at-21.37.47-300x244.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-14-at-21.37.47-768x624.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 994px) 100vw, 994px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not perfect. It&#8217;s badly designed. There aren&#8217;t tags yet. But it does what I need for now. And other than major dependencies (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Ionaru\/easy-markdown-editor\">EasyMDE<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/alpinejs.dev\/directives\/bind#binding-classes\">AlpineJS<\/a>) it&#8217;s all my own code. 200 lines of JS (6KB unminified).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please do NOT trust it with important information. Use entirely at your own risk. But do feel free to give it a whirl!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/notes.veryuseful.app\/\">https:\/\/notes.veryuseful.app\/<\/a><\/p>\n",
