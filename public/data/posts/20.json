A proper Italian <span class=\"blsp-spelling-corrected\">cappuccino<\/span>, pastries and cakes galore, fresh fruit and a selection of cereals. My perfect morning meal. Yummy!<\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTLqYxlInI\/AAAAAAAAD7o\/O5G0cixq7I4\/s288\/IMG_1135.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:216px;cursor:pointer;height:288px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTLqYxlInI\/AAAAAAAAD7o\/O5G0cixq7I4\/s288\/IMG_1135.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>After filling up we started exploring, starting with a drive to the nearby town of <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Noto<\/span>. Again, the <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">SatNav<\/span> helped us out but didn&#8217;t really get us to the centre of the city and we struggled to find somewhere to park. We eventually parked up in a place that turned out to be on the outskirts of the small city, and we walked down the hill towards the centre.<\/div>\n<div>Part-way down the hill we came across a very provincial town square in front of a big church. This was a classic Italian sight: old Italian men gathering in the square in rough suits and flat caps, smoking their cigarettes in whatever shade they could find, whilst talking loudly and gesticulating wildly. Perfect!<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Noto<\/span>, despite being very small, has some fantastic buildings and there&#8217;s plenty to see. The Baroque architecture is everywhere and captivates the imagination. Well worth a visit if you&#8217;re in the area.<\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTL4pueSpI\/AAAAAAAAD8w\/nGAZK8B6QHg\/s400\/IMG_1142.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;width:300px;cursor:pointer;height:400px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTL4pueSpI\/AAAAAAAAD8w\/nGAZK8B6QHg\/s400\/IMG_1142.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>We spent some time wondering and taking photos before ambling back to the car and heading off to the bigger city of Syracuse (aka Siracusa).<\/div>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Struggling with Sandwiches in Syracuse<\/span><\/p>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>The journey to Syracuse not only confused the Sat <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Nav<\/span> (some bits of road were closed or being rebuilt), but gave us our first taste of proper Sicilian driving. Turns out they are a bit crazy after all. We saw some mad overtaking <span class=\"blsp-spelling-corrected\">manoeuvres<\/span> &#8211; even from big trucks! &#8211; and they drive right up close behind you. This all not helped by the fact that visibility in the Micra was awful.<\/div>\n<div>After arriving at Syracuse and fighting our way through the equally-crazy city-centre mele of cars and scooters (are there any rules of the road?), we again had problems parking &#8211; not least because we didn&#8217;t have any Euro coins to put in the parking ticket machines &#8211; we only had notes!<\/div>\n<div>Eventually we found a free space in a fairly dodgy looking part of town, and walked back towards the historic centre of Ortigia.<\/div>\n<div>By now it was definitely lunchtime, and we wanted to grab a sandwich. This was the start of several lunchtime stresses for us. It turns out that buying cakes, cigarettes and coffee is pretty easy at any time of day, but buying a sandwich is a bit hit and miss.<\/div>\n<div>We eventually found a cafe selling the sort of thing we were after. It had seats outside for an al fresco dining experience. But what did we do? The food was on display in counters inside, so did we go in, see what we wanted, then sit outside and wait for someone to take an order? Or did we buy the food inside and then take it out to eat?<\/div>\n<div>Most people sitting outside seemed quite happy that there were no menus, but we were a bit baffled.<\/div>\n<div>We proceeded to the counter and asked for some panini (sandwiches), and as we were being served some other people came in and started paying. We decided that the system must be to pay first, then get the food. But we still weren&#8217;t sure about sitting outside.<\/div>\n<div>AAAARRRGGHH!!!! This is why I hate being abroad. Doing the simplest things becomes incredibly difficult when you don&#8217;t know how things work and don&#8217;t have a good enough grasp of the language to be able to ask.<\/div>\n<div>Eventually, I think the cafe staff worked out what we were trying to do. Gave us our sandwiches, ushered us outside and took our money once we were finished.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Wandering the Back Streets of Ortigia<\/span><\/div>\n<div>Full of good wholesome Italian lunch, we then picked up our Rough Guide and went for a walk around Ortigia. Wandering backstreets is something that Sally and I always seem to end up doing. We try to follow signs and directions but almost always end on off the beaten track in foreign cities. Why doesn&#8217;t everyone else end up doing this? We always seem to be alone.<\/div>\n<div>It&#8217;s slightly fun, but becomes a drag after a while, especially when you&#8217;re trying to see the sights and you can&#8217;t find them.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Cathedral &#8211; Reverence, but at what cost?<\/span><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMKKuuTuI\/AAAAAAAAD9k\/cLgnUAu_CXs\/s288\/IMG_1151.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMKKuuTuI\/AAAAAAAAD9k\/cLgnUAu_CXs\/s288\/IMG_1151.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>We eventually found the Duomo (Cathedral). An AMAZING building. It&#8217;s a place that has been built and re-built over the centuries, but unlike most places, you can see how it&#8217;s been built over. There columns of the old greek temple on which it was built are still there to see, and you can see how the new bits of building have been overlaid, and set within these. The fairly modern facade was added after an earthquake brought down an older entrance to the building. Inside, the building was dark and quiet, huge and expansive, allowing your mind to awe and wonder.<\/div>\n<div>As a Christian I have conflicting views on the nature of big churches. A place like Ortigia&#8217;s Duomo brings me to a place of great reverence. These places make God big. They cost lots and took lots of effort to build. These were probably the finest buildings of their times, and they were built for the purpose of worshipping God. I find it amazing, and it makes me wish that WE could do such amazing things for God.<\/div>\n<div>But I also question what God would have us do? Giving our lives, out work, our money, as offerings to God is exactly what our faith requires. But is using that wealth and effort to build a place of worship, where Christians can lock themselves away and revere the Lord the right thing? The Bible makes it clear that our God would rather have us help the poor and needy, share all we have with those in need, and bring righteousness and justice to all, than hoard our wealth within the church.<\/div>\n<div>I love the huge reverence that these people had for the LORD. But wouldn&#8217;t their sacrifices have been better used for God&#8217;s purposes?<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Spooky Catacombs<\/span><\/div>\n<div>A quick ice cream (I LOVE Italian ice cream!) and we headed back to the car and out of town. It had started raining again, and large puddles has started accumulating on the roads which, oddly, don&#8217;t seem to have drains. This puzzled us because when it rains in Sicily, it really buckets down!<\/div>\n<div>Our next destination was the catacombs. We found this easily using the Sat NAv, and we found some parking too. We even had Euro coins to put in the machine. But&#8230;where do we pay? There were no machines!<\/div>\n<div>After some deliberation, we spotted a free space by the road and parked there.<\/div>\n<div>Catacombs are fascinating places. When we went to Rome we made a long trip outside the city to visit some. They are underground networks of tunnels that form a burial site for Christians. Thousands of people were buried in tombs underground in these places and they are spooky, but intriguing places that again show the great lengths that people went to in reverence of God.<\/div>\n<div>One thing tha I found in both Rome and Syracuse was that the guides that took you round the catacombs were incredibly knowledgable, multi-lingual, and very helpful. Catacombs are always well worth a visit if you&#8217;re near them.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dinner in Noto &#8211; Don&#8217;t Trust your Rough Guide!<\/span><\/div>\n<div>We headed back to <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Noto for dinner<\/span> via the town of <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Avola<\/span>, which looked like a cool and thriving place. Back in Noto we still couldn&#8217;t find a place to park. We drove in circles for a bit with the SAt Nav bleating out &#8220;Recalculating&#8230;.recalculating&#8230;&#8221; (seems they&#8217;re not so good at finding parking) then eventually we found a free space.<\/div>\n<div>Wondering round Noto earlier we&#8217;d seen plenty of places to eat, but on our return they all seemed to have disappeared. Where had all the restaurants gone?<\/div>\n<div>The Rough Guide we had recommended a couple of places. The first was a restaurant just off the main square. It has a load of seats outside but no one was eating there, there were no menus on show and, frankly, the place smelled of wee. So we avoided that one. Next up was a restaurant described by the Rough Guide as &#8220;the best restaurant in Noto&#8221;. This was not to be the case. They weren&#8217;t serving Pizza, and the food we did get was cheap and pretty poor quality.<\/div>\n<div>Perhaps Noto&#8217;s not such a good place to eat after all? And we&#8217;d certainly recommend using your head rather then the guide to find a good place to eat. It&#8217;s not hard to work out the good places, but it is made difficult when there&#8217;s no menus or prices on display &#8211; which was often the case in Sicily.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Language Complications<\/span><\/div>\n<div>Over dinner we were trying to learn a bit more Italian to get us through the week. We had some phrases in the Rough Guide and an Italian-English dictionary. I somehow got distracted looking at English pronunciation. How complicated is that? How is anyone supposed to learn a language where the following groups of letters sound the same:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>t, tt, ed and bt (tea, butter, walked, doubt)<\/li>\n<li>k, c, cc, ck, ch, que (key, cool, soccer, lock, school, cheque)<\/li>\n<li>ch, tch, tu, ti (cheer, match, nature, question)<\/li>\n<li>j, ge, dge, di, du (jump, age, edge, soldier, gradual)<\/li>\n<li>f, ff, gh, ph, lf (fat, coffee, cough, physics, half)<\/li>\n<li>s, c, ps, ss, sc, st (soon, city, psychology, mess, scene, listen)<\/li>\n<li>f, s, ti, si (fishing, sure, station, tension)<\/li>\n<li>m, mm, lm, mb (sum, hammer, calm, bomb)<\/li>\n<li>r, rr, wr, rh (red, marry, wriggle, rhubard)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>And that&#8217;s just the consonants! Note that some letter combinations have more than one sound (e.g. ti = question, station &#8211; subtly different!)<\/div>\n<div>Vowels are even worse &#8211; check out these groups:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>augh, a, oa, aw, ou, oo (caught, ball, board, draw, four, floor)<\/li>\n<li>oo, o, oe, ou, ew, ue, u (boot, move, shoe, group, flew, blue, rude)<\/li>\n<li>i, ur, er, or, ear, our (bird, burn, fern, worm, earn, journal)<\/li>\n<li>oar, e, our, or, io, er (cupboard, the, colour, actor, nation, danger)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>Even the letters y, i and u can all sound the same just on their own (yet, onion, use).<\/div>\n<div>Our language is BONKERS, and I have a renewed respect for anyone that tries to learn it!<\/div>\n<div>Less hungry, but not hugely satisfied, we headed back to hotel for some well earned rest. We certainly had a busy first day.<\/div>\n<div>Link: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/08\/a-week-in-sicily-part-5-bored-yet-i-am\/\">Part five<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

A proper Italian <span class=\"blsp-spelling-corrected\">cappuccino<\/span>, pastries and cakes galore, fresh fruit and a selection of cereals. My perfect morning meal. Yummy!<\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTLqYxlInI\/AAAAAAAAD7o\/O5G0cixq7I4\/s288\/IMG_1135.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:216px;cursor:pointer;height:288px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTLqYxlInI\/AAAAAAAAD7o\/O5G0cixq7I4\/s288\/IMG_1135.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>After filling up we started exploring, starting with a drive to the nearby town of <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Noto<\/span>. Again, the <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">SatNav<\/span> helped us out but didn&#8217;t really get us to the centre of the city and we struggled to find somewhere to park. We eventually parked up in a place that turned out to be on the outskirts of the small city, and we walked down the hill towards the centre.<\/div>\n<div>Part-way down the hill we came across a very provincial town square in front of a big church. This was a classic Italian sight: old Italian men gathering in the square in rough suits and flat caps, smoking their cigarettes in whatever shade they could find, whilst talking loudly and gesticulating wildly. Perfect!<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Noto<\/span>, despite being very small, has some fantastic buildings and there&#8217;s plenty to see. The Baroque architecture is everywhere and captivates the imagination. Well worth a visit if you&#8217;re in the area.<\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTL4pueSpI\/AAAAAAAAD8w\/nGAZK8B6QHg\/s400\/IMG_1142.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;width:300px;cursor:pointer;height:400px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTL4pueSpI\/AAAAAAAAD8w\/nGAZK8B6QHg\/s400\/IMG_1142.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>We spent some time wondering and taking photos before ambling back to the car and heading off to the bigger city of Syracuse (aka Siracusa).<\/div>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Struggling with Sandwiches in Syracuse<\/span><\/p>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>The journey to Syracuse not only confused the Sat <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Nav<\/span> (some bits of road were closed or being rebuilt), but gave us our first taste of proper Sicilian driving. Turns out they are a bit crazy after all. We saw some mad overtaking <span class=\"blsp-spelling-corrected\">manoeuvres<\/span> &#8211; even from big trucks! &#8211; and they drive right up close behind you. This all not helped by the fact that visibility in the Micra was awful.<\/div>\n<div>After arriving at Syracuse and fighting our way through the equally-crazy city-centre mele of cars and scooters (are there any rules of the road?), we again had problems parking &#8211; not least because we didn&#8217;t have any Euro coins to put in the parking ticket machines &#8211; we only had notes!<\/div>\n<div>Eventually we found a free space in a fairly dodgy looking part of town, and walked back towards the historic centre of Ortigia.<\/div>\n<div>By now it was definitely lunchtime, and we wanted to grab a sandwich. This was the start of several lunchtime stresses for us. It turns out that buying cakes, cigarettes and coffee is pretty easy at any time of day, but buying a sandwich is a bit hit and miss.<\/div>\n<div>We eventually found a cafe selling the sort of thing we were after. It had seats outside for an al fresco dining experience. But what did we do? The food was on display in counters inside, so did we go in, see what we wanted, then sit outside and wait for someone to take an order? Or did we buy the food inside and then take it out to eat?<\/div>\n<div>Most people sitting outside seemed quite happy that there were no menus, but we were a bit baffled.<\/div>\n<div>We proceeded to the counter and asked for some panini (sandwiches), and as we were being served some other people came in and started paying. We decided that the system must be to pay first, then get the food. But we still weren&#8217;t sure about sitting outside.<\/div>\n<div>AAAARRRGGHH!!!! This is why I hate being abroad. Doing the simplest things becomes incredibly difficult when you don&#8217;t know how things work and don&#8217;t have a good enough grasp of the language to be able to ask.<\/div>\n<div>Eventually, I think the cafe staff worked out what we were trying to do. Gave us our sandwiches, ushered us outside and took our money once we were finished.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Wandering the Back Streets of Ortigia<\/span><\/div>\n<div>Full of good wholesome Italian lunch, we then picked up our Rough Guide and went for a walk around Ortigia. Wandering backstreets is something that Sally and I always seem to end up doing. We try to follow signs and directions but almost always end on off the beaten track in foreign cities. Why doesn&#8217;t everyone else end up doing this? We always seem to be alone.<\/div>\n<div>It&#8217;s slightly fun, but becomes a drag after a while, especially when you&#8217;re trying to see the sights and you can&#8217;t find them.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Cathedral &#8211; Reverence, but at what cost?<\/span><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMKKuuTuI\/AAAAAAAAD9k\/cLgnUAu_CXs\/s288\/IMG_1151.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMKKuuTuI\/AAAAAAAAD9k\/cLgnUAu_CXs\/s288\/IMG_1151.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>We eventually found the Duomo (Cathedral). An AMAZING building. It&#8217;s a place that has been built and re-built over the centuries, but unlike most places, you can see how it&#8217;s been built over. There columns of the old greek temple on which it was built are still there to see, and you can see how the new bits of building have been overlaid, and set within these. The fairly modern facade was added after an earthquake brought down an older entrance to the building. Inside, the building was dark and quiet, huge and expansive, allowing your mind to awe and wonder.<\/div>\n<div>As a Christian I have conflicting views on the nature of big churches. A place like Ortigia&#8217;s Duomo brings me to a place of great reverence. These places make God big. They cost lots and took lots of effort to build. These were probably the finest buildings of their times, and they were built for the purpose of worshipping God. I find it amazing, and it makes me wish that WE could do such amazing things for God.<\/div>\n<div>But I also question what God would have us do? Giving our lives, out work, our money, as offerings to God is exactly what our faith requires. But is using that wealth and effort to build a place of worship, where Christians can lock themselves away and revere the Lord the right thing? The Bible makes it clear that our God would rather have us help the poor and needy, share all we have with those in need, and bring righteousness and justice to all, than hoard our wealth within the church.<\/div>\n<div>I love the huge reverence that these people had for the LORD. But wouldn&#8217;t their sacrifices have been better used for God&#8217;s purposes?<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Spooky Catacombs<\/span><\/div>\n<div>A quick ice cream (I LOVE Italian ice cream!) and we headed back to the car and out of town. It had started raining again, and large puddles has started accumulating on the roads which, oddly, don&#8217;t seem to have drains. This puzzled us because when it rains in Sicily, it really buckets down!<\/div>\n<div>Our next destination was the catacombs. We found this easily using the Sat NAv, and we found some parking too. We even had Euro coins to put in the machine. But&#8230;where do we pay? There were no machines!<\/div>\n<div>After some deliberation, we spotted a free space by the road and parked there.<\/div>\n<div>Catacombs are fascinating places. When we went to Rome we made a long trip outside the city to visit some. They are underground networks of tunnels that form a burial site for Christians. Thousands of people were buried in tombs underground in these places and they are spooky, but intriguing places that again show the great lengths that people went to in reverence of God.<\/div>\n<div>One thing tha I found in both Rome and Syracuse was that the guides that took you round the catacombs were incredibly knowledgable, multi-lingual, and very helpful. Catacombs are always well worth a visit if you&#8217;re near them.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dinner in Noto &#8211; Don&#8217;t Trust your Rough Guide!<\/span><\/div>\n<div>We headed back to <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Noto for dinner<\/span> via the town of <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Avola<\/span>, which looked like a cool and thriving place. Back in Noto we still couldn&#8217;t find a place to park. We drove in circles for a bit with the SAt Nav bleating out &#8220;Recalculating&#8230;.recalculating&#8230;&#8221; (seems they&#8217;re not so good at finding parking) then eventually we found a free space.<\/div>\n<div>Wondering round Noto earlier we&#8217;d seen plenty of places to eat, but on our return they all seemed to have disappeared. Where had all the restaurants gone?<\/div>\n<div>The Rough Guide we had recommended a couple of places. The first was a restaurant just off the main square. It has a load of seats outside but no one was eating there, there were no menus on show and, frankly, the place smelled of wee. So we avoided that one. Next up was a restaurant described by the Rough Guide as &#8220;the best restaurant in Noto&#8221;. This was not to be the case. They weren&#8217;t serving Pizza, and the food we did get was cheap and pretty poor quality.<\/div>\n<div>Perhaps Noto&#8217;s not such a good place to eat after all? And we&#8217;d certainly recommend using your head rather then the guide to find a good place to eat. It&#8217;s not hard to work out the good places, but it is made difficult when there&#8217;s no menus or prices on display &#8211; which was often the case in Sicily.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Language Complications<\/span><\/div>\n<div>Over dinner we were trying to learn a bit more Italian to get us through the week. We had some phrases in the Rough Guide and an Italian-English dictionary. I somehow got distracted looking at English pronunciation. How complicated is that? How is anyone supposed to learn a language where the following groups of letters sound the same:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>t, tt, ed and bt (tea, butter, walked, doubt)<\/li>\n<li>k, c, cc, ck, ch, que (key, cool, soccer, lock, school, cheque)<\/li>\n<li>ch, tch, tu, ti (cheer, match, nature, question)<\/li>\n<li>j, ge, dge, di, du (jump, age, edge, soldier, gradual)<\/li>\n<li>f, ff, gh, ph, lf (fat, coffee, cough, physics, half)<\/li>\n<li>s, c, ps, ss, sc, st (soon, city, psychology, mess, scene, listen)<\/li>\n<li>f, s, ti, si (fishing, sure, station, tension)<\/li>\n<li>m, mm, lm, mb (sum, hammer, calm, bomb)<\/li>\n<li>r, rr, wr, rh (red, marry, wriggle, rhubard)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>And that&#8217;s just the consonants! Note that some letter combinations have more than one sound (e.g. ti = question, station &#8211; subtly different!)<\/div>\n<div>Vowels are even worse &#8211; check out these groups:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>augh, a, oa, aw, ou, oo (caught, ball, board, draw, four, floor)<\/li>\n<li>oo, o, oe, ou, ew, ue, u (boot, move, shoe, group, flew, blue, rude)<\/li>\n<li>i, ur, er, or, ear, our (bird, burn, fern, worm, earn, journal)<\/li>\n<li>oar, e, our, or, io, er (cupboard, the, colour, actor, nation, danger)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>Even the letters y, i and u can all sound the same just on their own (yet, onion, use).<\/div>\n<div>Our language is BONKERS, and I have a renewed respect for anyone that tries to learn it!<\/div>\n<div>Less hungry, but not hugely satisfied, we headed back to hotel for some well earned rest. We certainly had a busy first day.<\/div>\n<div>Link: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/08\/a-week-in-sicily-part-5-bored-yet-i-am\/\">Part five<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

My crisis began when we headed to Avola (the lively town we passed through the day before) for lunch. Turns out that not only does everything in Sicily close from about 12 noon until about 4pm, but most of Avola is being rebuilt. We found somewhere to park, and had we wanted the usual combination of an espresso, cigarette, and some cake, we&#8217;d have been fine, but no sandwiches for sale in this thriving town at lunchtime!<\/div>\n<p>We gave up and headed back to a signposted Trattoria near a beautiful gorge called Cava Grande. The gorge was closed due to bad weather making it unsafe, and we weren&#8217;t sure if the trattoria was serving food and we didn&#8217;t know how to ask.<\/p>\n<div>So it was back to Noto where we picked up Pizza and ice cream and satisfied our appetites.<\/div>\n<p>In the meantime we&#8217;ve scraped the hire car&#8217;s hubcaps &amp; scratched bumper.<\/p>\n<div>Back at the hotel I&#8217;m fuming, angry and frustrated.

This was no exception.<\/p>\n<div>The day started well with sunshine, the usual fantastic breakfast, and chilling out by the pool. My crisis began when we headed to Avola (the lively town we passed through the day before) for lunch. Turns out that not only does everything in Sicily close from about 12 noon until about 4pm, but most of Avola is being rebuilt. We found somewhere to park, and had we wanted the usual combination of an espresso, cigarette, and some cake, we&#8217;d have been fine, but no sandwiches for sale in this thriving town at lunchtime!<\/div>\n<p>We gave up and headed back to a signposted Trattoria near a beautiful gorge called Cava Grande. The gorge was closed due to bad weather making it unsafe, and we weren&#8217;t sure if the trattoria was serving food and we didn&#8217;t know how to ask.<\/p>\n<div>So it was back to Noto where we picked up Pizza and ice cream and satisfied our appetites.<\/div>\n<p>In the meantime we&#8217;ve scraped the hire car&#8217;s hubcaps &amp; scratched bumper.<\/p>\n<div>Back at the hotel I&#8217;m fuming, angry and frustrated. All my reasons for not liking to holiday abroad have materialised.<\/div>\n<div>Sally is hugely patient &#8211; bless her. It takes me a long time to chill out but after a light dinner at the hotel I&#8217;m mostly OK.<\/div>\n<div>What did we learn? That Sicily shuts down between 12 and 4 and that Avola is a rubbish place for tourists.<\/div>\n<div>We pray before we sleep that tomorrow &#8211; a planned trip up Mt Etna &#8211; will be easier.<\/div>\n<div>Link: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/09\/a-week-in-sicily-not-a-trip-to-etna-no-honking-and-definitely-no-kangaroos\/\">Part six<\/a><\/div>\n",

We found a little grocers shop in Noto &#8211; amazingly OPEN &#8211; and bought sandwich-making stuff an a good old English newspaper.<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTQF-MsjnI\/AAAAAAAAD_o\/7xfK6Z44G8A\/s288\/IMG_1177.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTQF-MsjnI\/AAAAAAAAD_o\/7xfK6Z44G8A\/s288\/IMG_1177.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>With rations to hand we then made our way to the Vendicari Nature Reserve and the beach.<\/p>\n<p>We made this journey via Eloro &#8211; an archaeological site. But this was sadly closed. In fact, it looked very closed, completely deserted and quite scruffy and litter-strewn. A shame really as their may otherwise have been some good history on show.<\/p>\n<div>Vendicari was excellent. 3 Euros of parking got us a good quiet beach, and safe swimming.<\/div>\n<div>Now, we sensed that Italians weren&#8217;t very good with following rules, so the important rules for the nature reserve were made quite explicit on a number of large signs. One rule in particular caught our eye; we were warned that &#8220;E&#8217; vietato introdurre specie animali o vegetali estranee alla fauna e alla flora tipiche della zona.&#8221; (Something along the lines of &#8220;It&#8217;s forbidden to introduce foreign animal or plant species to the flora and fauna of the reserve&#8221;)&#8230;complete with an amusing graphic showing us what might constitute breach of this rule:<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTQNH8EeTI\/AAAAAAAAEAA\/-OQz_g0zPZk\/s288\/IMG_1180.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTQNH8EeTI\/AAAAAAAAEAA\/-OQz_g0zPZk\/s288\/IMG_1180.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>We had a nice few hours on the beach, complete with home-made sandwiches. A bit of cloud and wind came and went and we left in the early afternoon. We headed to the nearby town of Lido di Noto (an uninteresting little place on the seafront) for a drink. We parked up, grabbed a couple of bottles of Coke (no cafe&#8217;s sadly) and then&#8230;it absolutely chucked it down with rain.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSIVT9dOI\/AAAAAAAAEAc\/YSCC-3ml-l8\/s288\/IMG_1183.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSIVT9dOI\/AAAAAAAAEAc\/YSCC-3ml-l8\/s288\/IMG_1183.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSK-rXshI\/AAAAAAAAEAs\/qj7xbk3WTlI\/s288\/IMG_1186.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSK-rXshI\/AAAAAAAAEAs\/qj7xbk3WTlI\/s288\/IMG_1186.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>Coke&#8230;in the car&#8230;on sea front.

We found a little grocers shop in Noto &#8211; amazingly OPEN &#8211; and bought sandwich-making stuff an a good old English newspaper.<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTQF-MsjnI\/AAAAAAAAD_o\/7xfK6Z44G8A\/s288\/IMG_1177.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTQF-MsjnI\/AAAAAAAAD_o\/7xfK6Z44G8A\/s288\/IMG_1177.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>With rations to hand we then made our way to the Vendicari Nature Reserve and the beach.<\/p>\n<p>We made this journey via Eloro &#8211; an archaeological site. But this was sadly closed. In fact, it looked very closed, completely deserted and quite scruffy and litter-strewn. A shame really as their may otherwise have been some good history on show.<\/p>\n<div>Vendicari was excellent. 3 Euros of parking got us a good quiet beach, and safe swimming.<\/div>\n<div>Now, we sensed that Italians weren&#8217;t very good with following rules, so the important rules for the nature reserve were made quite explicit on a number of large signs. One rule in particular caught our eye; we were warned that &#8220;E&#8217; vietato introdurre specie animali o vegetali estranee alla fauna e alla flora tipiche della zona.&#8221; (Something along the lines of &#8220;It&#8217;s forbidden to introduce foreign animal or plant species to the flora and fauna of the reserve&#8221;)&#8230;complete with an amusing graphic showing us what might constitute breach of this rule:<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTQNH8EeTI\/AAAAAAAAEAA\/-OQz_g0zPZk\/s288\/IMG_1180.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTQNH8EeTI\/AAAAAAAAEAA\/-OQz_g0zPZk\/s288\/IMG_1180.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>We had a nice few hours on the beach, complete with home-made sandwiches. A bit of cloud and wind came and went and we left in the early afternoon. We headed to the nearby town of Lido di Noto (an uninteresting little place on the seafront) for a drink. We parked up, grabbed a couple of bottles of Coke (no cafe&#8217;s sadly) and then&#8230;it absolutely chucked it down with rain.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSIVT9dOI\/AAAAAAAAEAc\/YSCC-3ml-l8\/s288\/IMG_1183.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSIVT9dOI\/AAAAAAAAEAc\/YSCC-3ml-l8\/s288\/IMG_1183.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSK-rXshI\/AAAAAAAAEAs\/qj7xbk3WTlI\/s288\/IMG_1186.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSK-rXshI\/AAAAAAAAEAs\/qj7xbk3WTlI\/s288\/IMG_1186.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>Coke&#8230;in the car&#8230;on sea front.

But the road, though steep and windy, was great and had fantastic views back over the Sicilian scenery. And Refugia Sapienza was a thriving toursit spot with lots of little gift shops, huge car parks, and several large hotels and restaurants. Oh, and quite importantly, a cable car station and lots of large 4&#215;4 buses to take you higher up.<\/p>\n<p>We parked up, and wrapped up. The temperature had dropped further to about 12 degrees and a chill wind was blowing.

The cable car was expensive, but worth it. As the tracks and paths opened up beneath us we realised that it was actually a LONG way to the top, and not a hike that we had time for.<\/div>\n<p>The whole place is set up for excursions and getting you to pay to have an easy ride. There are no maps, or directions or guides for walkers. The guide books are mostly photographic.<\/p>\n<p>Having said that, we appreciated the facilites at the top of the cable car, with a good cafe and toilets.<\/p>\n<p>We headed out into the now-very-cold air with the aim of following whoever else was walking. We got a little way and the wind picked up and blew some snow in! Yes, Sicily in September and it&#8217;s snowing.

The Rough Guide had made this out to be a small town but it seemed pretty big. We&#8217;d punched the address of the Tourist Office into the SatNav but it lead us to a random back street with no shops or offices in sight.<\/p>\n<p>Nicolosi is at 700m and already the temperature had dropped to about 14 degrees &#8211; but it was a fine day with great views up to the top of Etna.<\/p>\n<p>Encouraged by the size of Nicolosi and the big road signs to &#8220;Etna Sud&#8221; we decided to skip the information office and head up the mountain.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSXZ_yzBI\/AAAAAAAAEBs\/oI7UKrQJ_TM\/s288\/IMG_1206.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSXZ_yzBI\/AAAAAAAAEBs\/oI7UKrQJ_TM\/s288\/IMG_1206.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>The impression in my head, gleaded from both the Rough Guide and the Lonely Planet we&#8217;d borrowed, was of a narrow dirt track leading from Nicolosi to a tiny out post, &#8220;Refugia Sapienza&#8221;. But the road, though steep and windy, was great and had fantastic views back over the Sicilian scenery. And Refugia Sapienza was a thriving toursit spot with lots of little gift shops, huge car parks, and several large hotels and restaurants. Oh, and quite importantly, a cable car station and lots of large 4&#215;4 buses to take you higher up.<\/p>\n<p>We parked up, and wrapped up. The temperature had dropped further to about 12 degrees and a chill wind was blowing. We were beginning to appreciate having brought fleeces with us.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSgYoWUvI\/AAAAAAAAECM\/MZWf7KxhMRU\/s288\/IMG_1217.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:left;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 10px 10px 0;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSgYoWUvI\/AAAAAAAAECM\/MZWf7KxhMRU\/s288\/IMG_1217.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>We considered our options &#8211; a 4-hour-each-way hike, an &#8220;Excursion&#8221; with a load of old people on a bus, or the swift cable-car ascent. The cable car was expensive, but worth it. As the tracks and paths opened up beneath us we realised that it was actually a LONG way to the top, and not a hike that we had time for.<\/div>\n<p>The whole place is set up for excursions and getting you to pay to have an easy ride. There are no maps, or directions or guides for walkers. The guide books are mostly photographic.<\/p>\n<p>Having said that, we appreciated the facilites at the top of the cable car, with a good cafe and toilets.<\/p>\n<p>We headed out into the now-very-cold air with the aim of following whoever else was walking. We got a little way and the wind picked up and blew some snow in! Yes, Sicily in September and it&#8217;s snowing. Well, we were at quite an altitude at this point and very much in the clouds.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSszQ0JKI\/AAAAAAAAEDI\/Q6nCiA4HUdI\/s400\/IMG_1231.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;width:400px;cursor:pointer;height:300px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSszQ0JKI\/AAAAAAAAEDI\/Q6nCiA4HUdI\/s400\/IMG_1231.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<div>We retreat to the cafe to discuss our options over a cappucino. I was accosted at the bar by some hilarious Russian guys who&#8217;d obviously had a vodka too many and were buying more alcohol to warm them up. After escaping them, the weather had cleared slightly, so we decided to head back out and brave the elements with the aim of reaching a crater higher up.<\/div>\n<div>We nervously started following the bus tracks. It would be easy to get lost in such a stark and barren landscape, but the bus tracks and the posts that marked their route up made it easy really.<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTS5oPbrJI\/AAAAAAAAED4\/QqG_xgpTObg\/s400\/IMG_1241.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;width:400px;cursor:pointer;height:300px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTS5oPbrJI\/AAAAAAAAED4\/QqG_xgpTObg\/s400\/IMG_1241.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nIt&#8217;s a weird place.

It could have been several kilometres to the crater. It could have been 100yards, but we couldn&#8217;t see, and we were cold and bored. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; it was a great experience, but we were worn out and had a cable car to get back before closing time.<\/p>\n<div>We headed back down and reached the cable-car station.

I&#8217;d recommend going. I&#8217;d recommend starting earlier than we did and heading up the mountain in the morning to give you plenty of time.

We stopped off next to a shallow pool on the way, for some lunch. \u00a0This really could have been a film set or something, it was almost unreal in its purity and beauty.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\">On returning to the car we set out to find some other, less spectacular Necropoli nearby, which were also quite spectacular. \u00a0Tombs, dwellings and even churches carved out of the rock amongst breathtaking scenery.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\">This place is mentioned in the Rough Guide, and is even one of the listed top 30 things to see\/do while there, but you could so easily pass it by. \u00a0&#8220;Who want&#8217;s to go and see a load of tombs?&#8221;, but this place is a true gem!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTVY1Nc6zI\/AAAAAAAAEM0\/geK80LITvPQ\/s400\/IMG_1384.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTVY1Nc6zI\/AAAAAAAAEM0\/geK80LITvPQ\/s400\/IMG_1384.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:300px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Palazzolo Acreide<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Leaving the Pantalica area we checked the Rough Guide to see what else was nearby, and decided to call in at a place called Palazzolo Acreide. \u00a0This small town has a great Archaelogical park. \u00a0It&#8217;s at the top of a fairly big hill, so we recommend taking the car up to the top if you can.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>This place is mostly well-preserved Greek tombs, dwellings and temples. \u00a0But it brings things slightly more to life because it&#8217;s all layed out as a small village. \u00a0You are almost transported back in time and you can imagine ancient people wandering around, meeting together and heading to worship. \u00a0It feels like a place with community, rather than just a random collection of ancient buildings and artifacts.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTVkJYt8TI\/AAAAAAAAENU\/Or5dSypWi20\/s400\/IMG_1390.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTVkJYt8TI\/AAAAAAAAENU\/Or5dSypWi20\/s400\/IMG_1390.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:300px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div>And the highlight of this place was the greek theatre. \u00a0Marvellously intact, with an entrace hallway, tunnels to walk through to your seats, and bits of the staging and set still on show.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Dinner back in Noto rounded off our day. \u00a0We found a reasonably good restaurant but the service was a bit brusque. \u00a0Never mind.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Sunday and Home<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Sunday was a real day of rest as we packed and prepared to head home. \u00a0Mostly spent around the hotel it was a good chance to chill out. \u00a0We blew a load of money on a last meal in the hotel which was GREAT! \u00a0I mean, it was one of the best meals I&#8217;ve EVER had. \u00a0If you&#8217;re in the area and not staying at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.masseriadegliulivi.com\/\">Masseria degli Ulivi<\/a>, then at least go and eat there!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Monday was heading home day. \u00a0The SatNav took us on a VERY weird route to the airport and failed completely to find us a petrol station. \u00a0The small scratches to the car went unnoticed. \u00a0And we were amused by the presence of a large number of older English people on our plane, who&#8217;d obviously all booked with the same tour operator. \u00a0Hearing one of them ordering &#8220;Four cappucino americanos&#8221; made me feel that I&#8217;d done quite well with my Italian, and my order of &#8220;Due cappucini e una panina&#8221; felt quite authentic in comparison.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The English baggage collection was surprisingly swift and collecting the car from the car park was a doddle. \u00a0Re-learning driving on the left was interesting and my brain was well confused for a while, especially at junctions and when we hit the motorway. \u00a0But I quickly got back into it.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>A great holiday, with a little stressful day surrounded by some amazing places and food. \u00a0Summing up the holiday was mostly done in my first post. \u00a0Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/week-in-sicily-introduction.html\">the highlights<\/a> there.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I leave you with one thing that confused and amused us. \u00a0Now, my Italian isn&#8217;t great, by any means, but I can mostly get by with at least reading signs and notices. \u00a0This bottle baffled though,<br \/>\n as the best translation I could do of &#8220;Con il suo gusto morbido e delicato&#8230;&#8221; was &#8220;With the delicate taste of death&#8230;&#8221;<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWCzxrYfI\/AAAAAAAAEPA\/77ITc8XwifM\/s400\/IMG_1418.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWCzxrYfI\/AAAAAAAAEPA\/77ITc8XwifM\/s400\/IMG_1418.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:300px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Perhaps someone else knows better?<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Note: Google claims that &#8220;morbido&#8221; means &#8220;delicate&#8221;. \u00a0Hey &#8211; easy mistake to make!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWPlkYSiI\/AAAAAAAAEP4\/RYn57H9BtYE\/s400\/IMG_1436.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWPlkYSiI\/AAAAAAAAEP4\/RYn57H9BtYE\/s400\/IMG_1436.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:300px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

But there&#8217;s one that I&#8217;ve never got on with&#8230;running!  It knackers my kness and every time I try to take it up I have to give up quite quickly because I&#8217;m in pain.<\/p>\n<p>So instead, I tend to run by proxy.  I know so many people who are really into running, and I engage with other runners by talking about&#8230;err&#8230;other runners.  I&#8217;m a middle man in the running circles of Swindon.<\/p>\n<p>So, with today being the Swindon Half Marathon, my duty was not as a runner, but as a supporter.<\/p>\n<p>It was a beautiful day for it &#8211; if anything too hot &#8211; and Sally and I pedalled out on our bikes to a fine spot on the course where we would see people running out (at about 3 miles) and back in (at about 9 miles) from the same place.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m not really sure what to do as a running-race supporter, or how to cheer people on.  We clapped a lot.  In fact, we clapped almost non-stop for about 3 hours!  And we called people&#8217;s names and shouted things like &#8220;Well done&#8221; and &#8220;Keep Going&#8221;, but it all feels a bit lame.<\/p>\n<p>The hard core runners seem to view this as a distraction, and they keep focussed on the road ahead, barely acknowledging your presence.  The ones at the back seem to appreciate it more, and occasionally engage in some banter.  When I told one friend &#8220;Keep going!  You&#8217;re doing well!&#8221; he shouted back &#8220;No I&#8217;m not!&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So, I hope we helped some people along.<\/p>\n<p>It was quite inspiring too.  This was a small race of only around 1500 people, but it seemed to be a LOT from where we were standing.  My sister and her boyfriend are pretty quick but there were a surprisingly large number of people running at a similar pace.  It all made me think that surely running 13 miles is something that I could do.<\/p>\n<p>One friend of mine called back &#8220;Your turn next year Wintle!&#8221; as he ran past.  Perhaps he&#8217;s right.  Perhaps I should try again, take it easy, build up slowly and have a go at running with the aim of running next year&#8217;s Swindon Half.<\/p>\n<p>Hmmm&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>To finish, I pay my respect to those I know who ran.  I&#8217;m hugley impressed by their commitment and effort.  Sarah, Guy, Dave, Carol, James, Mike, Stevo, Ray&#8230;well done!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;m a cyclist &#8211; you can probably tell that &#8211; and I love all sports of different kinds.  But there&#8217;s one that I&#8217;ve never got on with&#8230;running!  It knackers my kness and every time I try to take it up I have to give up quite quickly because I&#8217;m in pain.<\/p>\n<p>So instead, I tend to run by proxy.  I know so many people who are really into running, and I engage with other runners by talking about&#8230;err&#8230;other runners.  I&#8217;m a middle man in the running circles of Swindon.<\/p>\n<p>So, with today being the Swindon Half Marathon, my duty was not as a runner, but as a supporter.<\/p>\n<p>It was a beautiful day for it &#8211; if anything too hot &#8211; and Sally and I pedalled out on our bikes to a fine spot on the course where we would see people running out (at about 3 miles) and back in (at about 9 miles) from the same place.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m not really sure what to do as a running-race supporter, or how to cheer people on.  We clapped a lot.  In fact, we clapped almost non-stop for about 3 hours!  And we called people&#8217;s names and shouted things like &#8220;Well done&#8221; and &#8220;Keep Going&#8221;, but it all feels a bit lame.<\/p>\n<p>The hard core runners seem to view this as a distraction, and they keep focussed on the road ahead, barely acknowledging your presence.  The ones at the back seem to appreciate it more, and occasionally engage in some banter.  When I told one friend &#8220;Keep going!  You&#8217;re doing well!&#8221; he shouted back &#8220;No I&#8217;m not!&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So, I hope we helped some people along.<\/p>\n<p>It was quite inspiring too.  This was a small race of only around 1500 people, but it seemed to be a LOT from where we were standing.  My sister and her boyfriend are pretty quick but there were a surprisingly large number of people running at a similar pace.  It all made me think that surely running 13 miles is something that I could do.<\/p>\n<p>One friend of mine called back &#8220;Your turn next year Wintle!&#8221; as he ran past.  Perhaps he&#8217;s right.  Perhaps I should try again, take it easy, build up slowly and have a go at running with the aim of running next year&#8217;s Swindon Half.<\/p>\n<p>Hmmm&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>To finish, I pay my respect to those I know who ran.  I&#8217;m hugley impressed by their commitment and effort.  Sarah, Guy, Dave, Carol, James, Mike, Stevo, Ray&#8230;well done!<\/p>\n",

Most of this will probably mean nothing to any of you and for that I make absolutely no apology whatsoever.<\/p>\n<p>This whole post is a bit of a brag, but it&#8217;s writing up what&#8217;s been an intriguing afternoon\/evening for me too.<\/p>\n<p>I have a pretty strong background in Software Engineering, but I&#8217;m a bit behind with the times.  I don&#8217;t really know much about how people go about developing applications these days.  It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been meaning to get to grips with for a while.  Today I&#8217;ve been playing a bit with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.symfony-project.org\/\">Symfony<\/a> &#8211; a PHP-based web development framework, with the aim of re-writing the database using a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Symfony.  If you really care I&#8217;m using an installation of MoWes on a USB stick to keep this all portable so I can develop from work or home.  Thanks must go to those on Twitter who have thrown some of these technologies my way.<\/p>\n<p>Web-based applications seem to be the way of things at the moment (unless you&#8217;re doing hard-core coding for things like OS&#8217;s or embedded systems, which I&#8217;m not).  And all the little projects I can either get my hands on, or dream up, are all web-apps that would benefit from a rapid-application development (RAD) type approach.<\/p>\n<p>This has sort-of been happening a bit at work as I look after a database with a web-based front-end.  This is currently written in PHP, outputting static HTML (i.e. no JavaScript) but when I wrote it I tried to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>abstract the database operations;<\/li>\n<li>separate the data model and the presentation so that the code didn&#8217;t need to be updated when new fields got added, deleted, etc.;<\/li>\n<li>create some generic code for those things that remained the same for all pages (cookies\/authentication, standard menus, banners, etc).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit clunky but it works well and the time spent coding the abstractions has saved me a lot of time with subsequent modifications.<\/p>\n<p>So it was a surprise to find that most of what I&#8217;ve done, or tried to do, fits with the principles on which application frameworks are based (see the Fundamental Concepts section of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.symfony-project.org\/book\/1_1\/01-Introducing-Symfony\">Symfony book<\/a> I&#8217;m reading).  The terminology is all a bit much to take in in one go, but essentially I was doing things right.<\/p>\n<p>Or is it a surprise?  My computing teachers were always keen to teach us good principles like abstraction, and I&#8217;ve always held that my fundamentals are good.  So maybe it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that learning to use Symfony is quick and easy.  I&#8217;m working my way through the tutorial, but without a lot of time it could easily leak from my head.<\/p>\n<p>Possibly more techie posts like this to come as I learn more.  Or maybe I&#8217;ll have rewritten the database before I get a chance to write again.  That&#8217;ll depend on how good all this new technolgoy really is!<\/p>\n",

Most of this will probably mean nothing to any of you and for that I make absolutely no apology whatsoever.<\/p>\n<p>This whole post is a bit of a brag, but it&#8217;s writing up what&#8217;s been an intriguing afternoon\/evening for me too.<\/p>\n<p>I have a pretty strong background in Software Engineering, but I&#8217;m a bit behind with the times.  I don&#8217;t really know much about how people go about developing applications these days.  It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been meaning to get to grips with for a while.  Today I&#8217;ve been playing a bit with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.symfony-project.org\/\">Symfony<\/a> &#8211; a PHP-based web development framework, with the aim of re-writing the database using a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Symfony.  If you really care I&#8217;m using an installation of MoWes on a USB stick to keep this all portable so I can develop from work or home.  Thanks must go to those on Twitter who have thrown some of these technologies my way.<\/p>\n<p>Web-based applications seem to be the way of things at the moment (unless you&#8217;re doing hard-core coding for things like OS&#8217;s or embedded systems, which I&#8217;m not).  And all the little projects I can either get my hands on, or dream up, are all web-apps that would benefit from a rapid-application development (RAD) type approach.<\/p>\n<p>This has sort-of been happening a bit at work as I look after a database with a web-based front-end.  This is currently written in PHP, outputting static HTML (i.e. no JavaScript) but when I wrote it I tried to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>abstract the database operations;<\/li>\n<li>separate the data model and the presentation so that the code didn&#8217;t need to be updated when new fields got added, deleted, etc.;<\/li>\n<li>create some generic code for those things that remained the same for all pages (cookies\/authentication, standard menus, banners, etc).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit clunky but it works well and the time spent coding the abstractions has saved me a lot of time with subsequent modifications.<\/p>\n<p>So it was a surprise to find that most of what I&#8217;ve done, or tried to do, fits with the principles on which application frameworks are based (see the Fundamental Concepts section of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.symfony-project.org\/book\/1_1\/01-Introducing-Symfony\">Symfony book<\/a> I&#8217;m reading).  The terminology is all a bit much to take in in one go, but essentially I was doing things right.<\/p>\n<p>Or is it a surprise?  My computing teachers were always keen to teach us good principles like abstraction, and I&#8217;ve always held that my fundamentals are good.  So maybe it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that learning to use Symfony is quick and easy.  I&#8217;m working my way through the tutorial, but without a lot of time it could easily leak from my head.<\/p>\n<p>Possibly more techie posts like this to come as I learn more.  Or maybe I&#8217;ll have rewritten the database before I get a chance to write again.  That&#8217;ll depend on how good all this new technolgoy really is!<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ve taken up darts!!!<\/p>\n<p>We have a cultural change program going on at work and we have a glorified sports and social club in our office.  One of the things this little committee (that I&#8217;m a part of) have done is install a darts board.<\/p>\n<p>And I must confess, I&#8217;ve really rather taken to the game, but it&#8217;s also caused me some problems.  I should add the the squeamish <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">can<\/span> read on, there are no descriptions of gory holes in the head or feet coming up.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Darts Players and Culture<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m slightly baffed by darts players and culture. Given the list of attributes above, you&#8217;d maybe expect the stereotypical darts player to be a geeky, thin, glasses-wearing mathematician type.<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s slightly confusing that it&#8217;s mostly played by hairy, overweight man who&#8217;ve spent too long in the pub.<\/p>\n<p>And what&#8217;s with all the women that are forced to follow it.  IF you ever watch it on the telly there&#8217;s always bikini-clad models walking around.  At work, we ordered the board, surround, scoring machine and a few sets of darts from a company called Red Dragon Darts.  When it arrived it came with a catalogue which was more soft-porn than precision sport.  I don&#8217;t link to their website for similar reasons &#8211; I almost couldn&#8217;t condone them as supplier!<\/p>\n<p>Bizarre.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Game<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The game is quite addictive you know.  Having invested \u00a312 (not much really) in my own darts (it&#8217;s much better if you get used to a set that you always use) I not only play the odd game, but I&#8217;m practicing by playing solitaire &#8220;round-the-clock&#8221; &#8211; hit all the numbers from 1 to 20 in order.<\/p>\n<p>You have to get worse before you get better too.  When you start you could hit pretty much anything, but, aiming for twenty, as you do, you usually end up hitting anything from 12 through to 18.  12 and 18 give you pretty good scores.  As you improve that range narrows, and you start hitting more 1&#8217;s and 5&#8217;s.  These are NOT good scores.  This is the stage I&#8217;m at.<\/p>\n<p>As for hitting doubles&#8230;that&#8217;s a different matter altogether.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dangers!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I said it was dangerous.  Shortly after I started playing my shoulder started to ache.  I thought this was a general wearing-out type pain, but then Sally said &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s the darts?&#8221;, and I think she&#8217;s right.  It puts a lot of tension on very specific parts of the arm, and the repetitive action can certainly take it&#8217;s toll.<\/p>\n<p>Also&#8230;you may remember my stomach pain from my long bike ride a couple of months back (see the bottom half of <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/pre-holiday-cycling-news.html\">this post<\/a>), well, I reckon this has actually turned out to be darts-related too.  When I throw my arrows I tend to lean forward and put all my weight on my front (right) leg.  I think my hip flexor was getting quite a lot of strain put on it by this with the result that cycling made it flare up and become painful.<\/p>\n<p>Not kidding&#8230;you can really do yourself an injury playing darts.  And not necessarily one that involves being hit with a pointy stick.<\/p>\n<p>You have been warned!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I need to write about this incredibly important subject to warn you of the dangers of a sport that I&#8217;ve recently taken up.<\/p>\n<p>This sport requires:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>excellent balance;<\/li>\n<li>pin point precision;<\/li>\n<li>dedication and repeated practice of repetitive actions;<\/li>\n<li>a good head for numbers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Yes, I&#8217;m not kidding. I&#8217;ve taken up darts!!!<\/p>\n<p>We have a cultural change program going on at work and we have a glorified sports and social club in our office.  One of the things this little committee (that I&#8217;m a part of) have done is install a darts board.<\/p>\n<p>And I must confess, I&#8217;ve really rather taken to the game, but it&#8217;s also caused me some problems.  I should add the the squeamish <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">can<\/span> read on, there are no descriptions of gory holes in the head or feet coming up.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Darts Players and Culture<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m slightly baffed by darts players and culture. Given the list of attributes above, you&#8217;d maybe expect the stereotypical darts player to be a geeky, thin, glasses-wearing mathematician type.<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s slightly confusing that it&#8217;s mostly played by hairy, overweight man who&#8217;ve spent too long in the pub.<\/p>\n<p>And what&#8217;s with all the women that are forced to follow it.  IF you ever watch it on the telly there&#8217;s always bikini-clad models walking around.  At work, we ordered the board, surround, scoring machine and a few sets of darts from a company called Red Dragon Darts.  When it arrived it came with a catalogue which was more soft-porn than precision sport.  I don&#8217;t link to their website for similar reasons &#8211; I almost couldn&#8217;t condone them as supplier!<\/p>\n<p>Bizarre.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Game<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The game is quite addictive you know.  Having invested \u00a312 (not much really) in my own darts (it&#8217;s much better if you get used to a set that you always use) I not only play the odd game, but I&#8217;m practicing by playing solitaire &#8220;round-the-clock&#8221; &#8211; hit all the numbers from 1 to 20 in order.<\/p>\n<p>You have to get worse before you get better too.  When you start you could hit pretty much anything, but, aiming for twenty, as you do, you usually end up hitting anything from 12 through to 18.  12 and 18 give you pretty good scores.  As you improve that range narrows, and you start hitting more 1&#8217;s and 5&#8217;s.  These are NOT good scores.  This is the stage I&#8217;m at.<\/p>\n<p>As for hitting doubles&#8230;that&#8217;s a different matter altogether.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dangers!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I said it was dangerous.  Shortly after I started playing my shoulder started to ache.  I thought this was a general wearing-out type pain, but then Sally said &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s the darts?&#8221;, and I think she&#8217;s right.  It puts a lot of tension on very specific parts of the arm, and the repetitive action can certainly take it&#8217;s toll.<\/p>\n<p>Also&#8230;you may remember my stomach pain from my long bike ride a couple of months back (see the bottom half of <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/pre-holiday-cycling-news.html\">this post<\/a>), well, I reckon this has actually turned out to be darts-related too.  When I throw my arrows I tend to lean forward and put all my weight on my front (right) leg.  I think my hip flexor was getting quite a lot of strain put on it by this with the result that cycling made it flare up and become painful.<\/p>\n<p>Not kidding&#8230;you can really do yourself an injury playing darts.  And not necessarily one that involves being hit with a pointy stick.<\/p>\n<p>You have been warned!<\/p>\n",

They won&#8217;t mean much to some so I&#8217;ll try and explain.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>&#8220;Discipleship&#8221; is lots of things.  For me it&#8217;s the process of being a disciple of Jesus Christ, learning his ways, following in his footsteps, trying to lead a godly life.  What&#8217;s a godly life you might ask?  Well, part of the process is finding that out.  There are general rules but it&#8217;s worked out in different ways for each person, and each time.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We&#8217;ve just had a new youth minister start at our church and he&#8217;s really interested in helping people on this journey and is exploring ways of doing this.  Discipleship Academy and SoulSpace are two of these things.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Discipleship Academy<\/span> is mostly for the young people of our church, but I&#8217;m tagging along as a &#8220;fellow journeyer&#8221;.  I&#8217;m hesitant to call myself a &#8220;leader&#8221; in this activity because I&#8217;m actually going through the process myself.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>This is intended to be 12, monthly sessions looking at, and equipping us to do discipleship.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I missed the first session, but went along today and it was really inspiring.  The youth minister has produced a set of what I would call &#8220;tools&#8221; (things like study, reading, finding space, journalling and attending church) which we&#8217;re all discussing the use of and encouraging each other to actually do.  It was really good and I&#8217;m sure that these tools and sessions will be useful for us all as we try to do &#8220;discipleship&#8221; together.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">SoulSpace<\/span> is the new minister giving our Sunday evening church service a bit of an overhaul.  We won&#8217;t be doing this every week, but it will happen 2 weekends every month.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The idea of this is that rather than do a typical church service (a &#8220;hymn sandwich&#8221; as he called it today), we&#8217;ll be trying to do church things in different ways.  Sometimes we&#8217;ll sing, sometimes we wont.  Sometimes there will be a talk from the front.  Sometimes we&#8217;ll have group discussions.  Sometimes we&#8217;ll have other creative forms of worship or prayer.  We&#8217;ll just try, as a community, to learn from God and respond to him in different ways.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>And community is key in both of these activities.  This is something we&#8217;ll do together.  But also something that is not confined to Sunday evenings &#8211; the things we learn, the things we&#8217;re encouraged to do, will, hopefully, spill over into the rest of our lives.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>So tonight we&#8217;ve looked at:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>using the Bible as a tool.  How can we use it?  How do we break it down into bite-sized chunks, read it, understand it, and apply it to our lives; and<\/li>\n<li>authenticity &#8211; being real.  How do we carry all this church stuff with us in our daily lives.  Are we honest with people about who we are, and what we believe in?  Or do we hide for fear of being &#8220;found out&#8221; and embarassed about that key part of our lives: our faith?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>These are both difficult things to grapple with &#8211; Jesus didn&#8217;t promise us following him would be easy.  But I&#8217;ve been really inspired tonight in both these things, and the fact that a little pocket of people around me are also grappling with them helps a LOT.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We also had a really good church service this morning.  The speaker did lots of storytelling, which I always find a powerful way of communicating.  The story was of Joseph and the key thing I got from it was that he wasn&#8217;t called by God.  He didn&#8217;t have God speaking from a burning bush like Moses, or a revelation from angels or anything like that.  He just did what he thought he should be doing and God lead him and worked through him.  Some people have things that God clearly wants them to do, but the rest of us shouldn&#8217;t feel left out &#8211; God can do great things through all of us who follow him, wherever we are!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>It&#8217;s weird writing publicly about my faith, but in the interests of taking a step in discipleship and being real, I feel I must be writing more about what God is doing and saying.  My faith is more important than my cycling, gardening, housework, DIY, music and technology interests, but that probably doesn&#8217;t come across here.  I hope it will in future!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;ve had an inspiring evening with these two little events.  They won&#8217;t mean much to some so I&#8217;ll try and explain.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>&#8220;Discipleship&#8221; is lots of things.  For me it&#8217;s the process of being a disciple of Jesus Christ, learning his ways, following in his footsteps, trying to lead a godly life.  What&#8217;s a godly life you might ask?  Well, part of the process is finding that out.  There are general rules but it&#8217;s worked out in different ways for each person, and each time.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We&#8217;ve just had a new youth minister start at our church and he&#8217;s really interested in helping people on this journey and is exploring ways of doing this.  Discipleship Academy and SoulSpace are two of these things.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Discipleship Academy<\/span> is mostly for the young people of our church, but I&#8217;m tagging along as a &#8220;fellow journeyer&#8221;.  I&#8217;m hesitant to call myself a &#8220;leader&#8221; in this activity because I&#8217;m actually going through the process myself.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>This is intended to be 12, monthly sessions looking at, and equipping us to do discipleship.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I missed the first session, but went along today and it was really inspiring.  The youth minister has produced a set of what I would call &#8220;tools&#8221; (things like study, reading, finding space, journalling and attending church) which we&#8217;re all discussing the use of and encouraging each other to actually do.  It was really good and I&#8217;m sure that these tools and sessions will be useful for us all as we try to do &#8220;discipleship&#8221; together.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">SoulSpace<\/span> is the new minister giving our Sunday evening church service a bit of an overhaul.  We won&#8217;t be doing this every week, but it will happen 2 weekends every month.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The idea of this is that rather than do a typical church service (a &#8220;hymn sandwich&#8221; as he called it today), we&#8217;ll be trying to do church things in different ways.  Sometimes we&#8217;ll sing, sometimes we wont.  Sometimes there will be a talk from the front.  Sometimes we&#8217;ll have group discussions.  Sometimes we&#8217;ll have other creative forms of worship or prayer.  We&#8217;ll just try, as a community, to learn from God and respond to him in different ways.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>And community is key in both of these activities.  This is something we&#8217;ll do together.  But also something that is not confined to Sunday evenings &#8211; the things we learn, the things we&#8217;re encouraged to do, will, hopefully, spill over into the rest of our lives.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>So tonight we&#8217;ve looked at:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>using the Bible as a tool.  How can we use it?  How do we break it down into bite-sized chunks, read it, understand it, and apply it to our lives; and<\/li>\n<li>authenticity &#8211; being real.  How do we carry all this church stuff with us in our daily lives.  Are we honest with people about who we are, and what we believe in?  Or do we hide for fear of being &#8220;found out&#8221; and embarassed about that key part of our lives: our faith?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>These are both difficult things to grapple with &#8211; Jesus didn&#8217;t promise us following him would be easy.  But I&#8217;ve been really inspired tonight in both these things, and the fact that a little pocket of people around me are also grappling with them helps a LOT.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We also had a really good church service this morning.  The speaker did lots of storytelling, which I always find a powerful way of communicating.  The story was of Joseph and the key thing I got from it was that he wasn&#8217;t called by God.  He didn&#8217;t have God speaking from a burning bush like Moses, or a revelation from angels or anything like that.  He just did what he thought he should be doing and God lead him and worked through him.  Some people have things that God clearly wants them to do, but the rest of us shouldn&#8217;t feel left out &#8211; God can do great things through all of us who follow him, wherever we are!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>It&#8217;s weird writing publicly about my faith, but in the interests of taking a step in discipleship and being real, I feel I must be writing more about what God is doing and saying.  My faith is more important than my cycling, gardening, housework, DIY, music and technology interests, but that probably doesn&#8217;t come across here.  I hope it will in future!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",
