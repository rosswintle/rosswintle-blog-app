                "rendered": "<p>Had a very good Christian Aid Week service at church this morning.  Lots of good use of CA&#8217;s resources and an interesting sermon based on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Luke%207:36-50;&amp;version=31;\">Luke 7:36-50<\/a> &#8211; the story of a woman, probably a prostitute, worshipping Jesus by pouring expensive perfume over his feet.<\/p>\n<p>The key thing I took away was the need for forgiveness.  It&#8217;s a word that&#8217;s passed around lightly in Christian circles but the concept of forgiveness is hugely important.<\/p>\n<p>In the context of the story from Luke&#8217;s gospel, Jesus accepted the woman and forgave her wrongdoing (though I suspect it wasn&#8217;t entirely her fault she was in the situation she was in).<\/p>\n<p>In the context of Christian Aid, it was noted that we all exploit the third\/developing world and maybe we need them to forgive us of that.<\/p>\n<p>It may not always be out of choice; it&#8217;s hard to find clothes\/coffee\/chocolate\/electrical goods\/etc that have not involved some form of exploitation of cheap or forced labour, child labour, sweatshops and unfair pricing, and when you can find them buying them can be prohibitively expensive.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, in any case, I suspect that if you invited a child labourer from the developing world into your house you&#8217;d feel quite guilty and they&#8217;d be aghast at the wealth and luxury of even the poorest Briton.<\/p>\n<p>How does that make us feel about what we buy and where it&#8217;s come from?  It makes me want to be even more scrupulous about my consuming of stuff.  I&#8217;m the first to admit that Fairtrade isn&#8217;t a silver bullet that will cure all the world&#8217;s trade ills, but it&#8217;s a start and it&#8217;s my vote to say that people should be treated and paid fairly and justly and that I&#8217;m willing to stump up a bit extra of my relatively-vast amount of cash to achieve that.<\/p>\n<p>But, as I said, we have limited choice.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that, with trade, we&#8217;re such tiny parts of a huge machine.   We CAN &#8211; we MUST &#8211; do our bit but so much of our choice comes from the big corporations that sell us stuff, and that, fuelled by our consumer culture.  Without a major shift in how our western society as a whole plays the trade game, we won&#8217;t be turning around and asking for forgiveness any time soon.<\/p>\n",

Lots of good use of CA&#8217;s resources and an interesting sermon based on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Luke%207:36-50;&amp;version=31;\">Luke 7:36-50<\/a> &#8211; the story of a woman, probably a prostitute, worshipping Jesus by pouring expensive perfume over his feet.<\/p>\n<p>The key thing I took away was the need for forgiveness.  It&#8217;s a word that&#8217;s passed around lightly in Christian circles but the concept of forgiveness is hugely important.<\/p>\n<p>In the context of the story from Luke&#8217;s gospel, Jesus accepted the woman and forgave her wrongdoing (though I suspect it wasn&#8217;t entirely her fault she was in the situation she was in).<\/p>\n<p>In the context of Christian Aid, it was noted that we all exploit the third\/developing world and maybe we need them to forgive us of that.<\/p>\n<p>It may not always be out of choice; it&#8217;s hard to find clothes\/coffee\/chocolate\/electrical goods\/etc that have not involved some form of exploitation of cheap or forced labour, child labour, sweatshops and unfair pricing, and when you can find them buying them can be prohibitively expensive.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, in any case, I suspect that if you invited a child labourer from the developing world into your house you&#8217;d feel quite guilty and they&#8217;d be aghast at the wealth and luxury of even the poorest Briton.<\/p>\n<p>How does that make us feel about what we buy and where it&#8217;s come from?  It makes me want to be even more scrupulous about my consuming of stuff.  I&#8217;m the first to admit that Fairtrade isn&#8217;t a silver bullet that will cure all the world&#8217;s trade ills, but it&#8217;s a start and it&#8217;s my vote to say that people should be treated and paid fairly and justly and that I&#8217;m willing to stump up a bit extra of my relatively-vast amount of cash to achieve that.<\/p>\n<p>But, as I said, we have limited choice.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that, with trade, we&#8217;re such tiny parts of a huge machine.   We CAN &#8211; we MUST &#8211; do our bit but so much of our choice comes from the big corporations that sell us stuff, and that, fuelled by our consumer culture.  Without a major shift in how our western society as a whole plays the trade game, we won&#8217;t be turning around and asking for forgiveness any time soon.<\/p>\n",

I don&#8217;t want to have to pay anything to do this, so the projects have been set aside waiting for free tools to become available.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway &#8211; I happened across <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eyespot.com\/\">Eyespot<\/a> an online video mixing tool.  It:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>accepts the 3gp format for uploads;<\/li>\n<li>has a simple user interface (though tags seem to go missing occasionally);<\/li>\n<li>has a limitation of 100 elements in a storyboard;<\/li>\n<li>has some other limited functionality (it&#8217;s still in Beta though so should improve).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Oh, and the terms and conditions, which, as far as I can make out, state that you keep the copyright but your material and be redistributed and mixed by anyone, seemingly without limitation.<\/p>\n<p>I produced a simple mix online and then downloaded everything in .avi format to do it properly.  So, if nothing else, you can upload and just convert.  You also seem to be able to do file conversion at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zamzar.com\/\">Zamzar<\/a> but I&#8217;ve not tried this.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m an amateur in the video editing world so if anyone knows better ways to mash together .3gp&#8217;s, .mov&#8217;s and .avi&#8217;s (from my various devices) for free then please post a comment!<\/p>\n<p>I find video editing fun &#8211; one of the few creative things that I might possibly be any good at &#8211; and theraputic.

It:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>accepts the 3gp format for uploads;<\/li>\n<li>has a simple user interface (though tags seem to go missing occasionally);<\/li>\n<li>has a limitation of 100 elements in a storyboard;<\/li>\n<li>has some other limited functionality (it&#8217;s still in Beta though so should improve).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Oh, and the terms and conditions, which, as far as I can make out, state that you keep the copyright but your material and be redistributed and mixed by anyone, seemingly without limitation.<\/p>\n<p>I produced a simple mix online and then downloaded everything in .avi format to do it properly.  So, if nothing else, you can upload and just convert.

Then I noticed that if I ate lunch early, BEFORE I played, I was OK.  So I took to doing that.  I also discovered flapjack then&#8230;if I didn&#8217;t have time to eat lunch before a I went out to play a big slab of oats always did the trick.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Upping the workload<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Then I moved to Swindon and started cycling to work.  Only 4 miles each way but boy, I was hungry as a horse all day!  I started munching cereal bars, which I guess are glorified flapjacks with lots of additives.  They really fill a whole though and don&#8217;t seem to be that unhealthy or&#8230;like some &#8220;energy foods&#8221;&#8230;all that disgusting.  I also have a big bowl of oaty cereal before I go out.  Porridge, frankly, sucks!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Long rides and recovery<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I also notice that after a long ride I really need something to recover.  My body craves various things at that point but basically I just cram as much sugar and water in as I can.  Apple Lucozade is particularly yummy and not too sweet.  Apparently you need to get a mix of carbs, fat and protein.  But hey, I&#8217;m still learning.<\/p>\n<p>Key facts seem to be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>eat little and often<\/li>\n<li>keep carbs up<\/li>\n<li>take good food (oats, bananas, etc) when you&#8217;re out exercising<\/li>\n<li>have regular intake of water<\/li>\n<li>make sure you eat well to recover too<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In this case, you really are what you eat and if you start feeling really hungry because you&#8217;re exercising more do take some advice on it.  Just cramming more won&#8217;t necessarily help.<\/p>\n",

Then I noticed that if I ate lunch early, BEFORE I played, I was OK.  So I took to doing that.  I also discovered flapjack then&#8230;if I didn&#8217;t have time to eat lunch before a I went out to play a big slab of oats always did the trick.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Upping the workload<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Then I moved to Swindon and started cycling to work.  Only 4 miles each way but boy, I was hungry as a horse all day!  I started munching cereal bars, which I guess are glorified flapjacks with lots of additives.  They really fill a whole though and don&#8217;t seem to be that unhealthy or&#8230;like some &#8220;energy foods&#8221;&#8230;all that disgusting.  I also have a big bowl of oaty cereal before I go out.  Porridge, frankly, sucks!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Long rides and recovery<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I also notice that after a long ride I really need something to recover.  My body craves various things at that point but basically I just cram as much sugar and water in as I can.  Apple Lucozade is particularly yummy and not too sweet.  Apparently you need to get a mix of carbs, fat and protein.  But hey, I&#8217;m still learning.<\/p>\n<p>Key facts seem to be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>eat little and often<\/li>\n<li>keep carbs up<\/li>\n<li>take good food (oats, bananas, etc) when you&#8217;re out exercising<\/li>\n<li>have regular intake of water<\/li>\n<li>make sure you eat well to recover too<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In this case, you really are what you eat and if you start feeling really hungry because you&#8217;re exercising more do take some advice on it.  Just cramming more won&#8217;t necessarily help.<\/p>\n",

A good ride but my knees hurt a bit &#8211; probably beacause I&#8217;ve not been doing my stretches while I&#8217;ve not been cycling to work &#8211; must keep that up even when I&#8217;m not doing a daily ride.<\/p>\n<p>The stretches are mostly for my &#8220;Glutes&#8221; (mostly my gluteus medius) but also for a thing called the IT band (nothing to do with computers) that runs from the bum down the side of the leg.   Forgive my amateur physiology. The glutes pull the band to stop your legs collapsing underneath you.  If the glutes or the band are tight it seems to rub against the knee causing a dull pain.<\/p>\n<p>It also makes me flat footed (called over-pronation).  Just another of my ongoing health things that I keep at bay by doing certain things.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that there are all sorts of other mechanics going on, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the saddle high enough = are my legs bending too much?<\/li>\n<li>Have I got the right balance of cadence (rate of pedalling) and pressure?<\/li>\n<li>Are my feet in the right place on the pedals?  If the feet are twisted that can put additional strain on the knees.<\/li>\n<li>Am I pushing with the right part of the foot?  I think you need to try to spread load across the foot.  As I&#8217;m flat footed I tend to push with the ball of my foot so I need to make a conscious effort to put some pressure on the outside of my foot.  This also balances the quadriceps in the legs &#8211; you use the inner quads to push with the ball of your foot and the outer quads to push with the outside.<\/li>\n<li>Am I pushing with both legs?  The pain is usually in my right leg.  Of course, I&#8217;m right footed so I lead and do more pedalling with my right leg.  I need to balance that too.<\/li>\n<li>Are my knees in the right place? I&#8217;ve read that, ideally, the knee should sit directly above the foot and press straight downwards, rather than having your knees sticking out or squeezing in towards the bike.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As I say, all stuff I&#8217;ve read but it all makes sense and seems to work &#8211; if I do the stretches and try to balance everything and pedal right I can ride strong for ages.<\/p>\n<p>And you thought cycling was simple!?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Went out for a ride by myself this afternoon. Managed 21.24 miles in 1:24:31, averaging 15.0 mph overall.  A good ride but my knees hurt a bit &#8211; probably beacause I&#8217;ve not been doing my stretches while I&#8217;ve not been cycling to work &#8211; must keep that up even when I&#8217;m not doing a daily ride.<\/p>\n<p>The stretches are mostly for my &#8220;Glutes&#8221; (mostly my gluteus medius) but also for a thing called the IT band (nothing to do with computers) that runs from the bum down the side of the leg.   Forgive my amateur physiology. The glutes pull the band to stop your legs collapsing underneath you.  If the glutes or the band are tight it seems to rub against the knee causing a dull pain.<\/p>\n<p>It also makes me flat footed (called over-pronation).  Just another of my ongoing health things that I keep at bay by doing certain things.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that there are all sorts of other mechanics going on, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the saddle high enough = are my legs bending too much?<\/li>\n<li>Have I got the right balance of cadence (rate of pedalling) and pressure?<\/li>\n<li>Are my feet in the right place on the pedals?  If the feet are twisted that can put additional strain on the knees.<\/li>\n<li>Am I pushing with the right part of the foot?  I think you need to try to spread load across the foot.  As I&#8217;m flat footed I tend to push with the ball of my foot so I need to make a conscious effort to put some pressure on the outside of my foot.  This also balances the quadriceps in the legs &#8211; you use the inner quads to push with the ball of your foot and the outer quads to push with the outside.<\/li>\n<li>Am I pushing with both legs?  The pain is usually in my right leg.  Of course, I&#8217;m right footed so I lead and do more pedalling with my right leg.  I need to balance that too.<\/li>\n<li>Are my knees in the right place? I&#8217;ve read that, ideally, the knee should sit directly above the foot and press straight downwards, rather than having your knees sticking out or squeezing in towards the bike.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As I say, all stuff I&#8217;ve read but it all makes sense and seems to work &#8211; if I do the stretches and try to balance everything and pedal right I can ride strong for ages.<\/p>\n<p>And you thought cycling was simple!?<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m VERY grateful to my boss for the time off and the rest.  But I feel like a bit of a fraud now.  It was all very real on Saturday but now I wonder if there was some overreaction.  Certainly at the time it was very scary being so out of control of my emotions, and I was just physically and mentally and emotionally exhausted in a way I&#8217;ve not been before.  I guess we can only wait and see.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned some things in the meantime, which I&#8217;ll try to write up at some point but for now, I&#8217;m doing OK.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m VERY grateful to my boss for the time off and the rest.  But I feel like a bit of a fraud now.  It was all very real on Saturday but now I wonder if there was some overreaction.

I guess we can only wait and see.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned some things in the meantime, which I&#8217;ll try to write up at some point but for now, I&#8217;m doing OK.<\/p>\n",
