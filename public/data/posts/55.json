\u00a0I mean, it was one of the best meals I&#8217;ve EVER had. \u00a0If you&#8217;re in the area and not staying at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.masseriadegliulivi.com\/\">Masseria degli Ulivi<\/a>, then at least go and eat there!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Monday was heading home day. \u00a0The SatNav took us on a VERY weird route to the airport and failed completely to find us a petrol station. \u00a0The small scratches to the car went unnoticed. \u00a0And we were amused by the presence of a large number of older English people on our plane, who&#8217;d obviously all booked with the same tour operator. \u00a0Hearing one of them ordering &#8220;Four cappucino americanos&#8221; made me feel that I&#8217;d done quite well with my Italian, and my order of &#8220;Due cappucini e una panina&#8221; felt quite authentic in comparison.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The English baggage collection was surprisingly swift and collecting the car from the car park was a doddle. \u00a0Re-learning driving on the left was interesting and my brain was well confused for a while, especially at junctions and when we hit the motorway. \u00a0But I quickly got back into it.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>A great holiday, with a little stressful day surrounded by some amazing places and food. \u00a0Summing up the holiday was mostly done in my first post. \u00a0Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/week-in-sicily-introduction.html\">the highlights<\/a> there.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I leave you with one thing that confused and amused us. \u00a0Now, my Italian isn&#8217;t great, by any means, but I can mostly get by with at least reading signs and notices. \u00a0This bottle baffled though,<br \/>\n as the best translation I could do of &#8220;Con il suo gusto morbido e delicato&#8230;&#8221; was &#8220;With the delicate taste of death&#8230;&#8221;<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWCzxrYfI\/AAAAAAAAEPA\/77ITc8XwifM\/s400\/IMG_1418.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWCzxrYfI\/AAAAAAAAEPA\/77ITc8XwifM\/s400\/IMG_1418.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:300px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Perhaps someone else knows better?<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Note: Google claims that &#8220;morbido&#8221; means &#8220;delicate&#8221;. \u00a0Hey &#8211; easy mistake to make!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWPlkYSiI\/AAAAAAAAEP4\/RYn57H9BtYE\/s400\/IMG_1436.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWPlkYSiI\/AAAAAAAAEP4\/RYn57H9BtYE\/s400\/IMG_1436.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:300px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

But the road, though steep and windy, was great and had fantastic views back over the Sicilian scenery. And Refugia Sapienza was a thriving toursit spot with lots of little gift shops, huge car parks, and several large hotels and restaurants. Oh, and quite importantly, a cable car station and lots of large 4&#215;4 buses to take you higher up.<\/p>\n<p>We parked up, and wrapped up.

As the tracks and paths opened up beneath us we realised that it was actually a LONG way to the top, and not a hike that we had time for.<\/div>\n<p>The whole place is set up for excursions and getting you to pay to have an easy ride. There are no maps, or directions or guides for walkers. The guide books are mostly photographic.<\/p>\n<p>Having said that, we appreciated the facilites at the top of the cable car, with a good cafe and toilets.<\/p>\n<p>We headed out into the now-very-cold air with the aim of following whoever else was walking.

The Rough Guide had made this out to be a small town but it seemed pretty big. We&#8217;d punched the address of the Tourist Office into the SatNav but it lead us to a random back street with no shops or offices in sight.<\/p>\n<p>Nicolosi is at 700m and already the temperature had dropped to about 14 degrees &#8211; but it was a fine day with great views up to the top of Etna.<\/p>\n<p>Encouraged by the size of Nicolosi and the big road signs to &#8220;Etna Sud&#8221; we decided to skip the information office and head up the mountain.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSXZ_yzBI\/AAAAAAAAEBs\/oI7UKrQJ_TM\/s288\/IMG_1206.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSXZ_yzBI\/AAAAAAAAEBs\/oI7UKrQJ_TM\/s288\/IMG_1206.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>The impression in my head, gleaded from both the Rough Guide and the Lonely Planet we&#8217;d borrowed, was of a narrow dirt track leading from Nicolosi to a tiny out post, &#8220;Refugia Sapienza&#8221;. But the road, though steep and windy, was great and had fantastic views back over the Sicilian scenery. And Refugia Sapienza was a thriving toursit spot with lots of little gift shops, huge car parks, and several large hotels and restaurants. Oh, and quite importantly, a cable car station and lots of large 4&#215;4 buses to take you higher up.<\/p>\n<p>We parked up, and wrapped up. The temperature had dropped further to about 12 degrees and a chill wind was blowing. We were beginning to appreciate having brought fleeces with us.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSgYoWUvI\/AAAAAAAAECM\/MZWf7KxhMRU\/s288\/IMG_1217.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:left;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 10px 10px 0;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSgYoWUvI\/AAAAAAAAECM\/MZWf7KxhMRU\/s288\/IMG_1217.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>We considered our options &#8211; a 4-hour-each-way hike, an &#8220;Excursion&#8221; with a load of old people on a bus, or the swift cable-car ascent. The cable car was expensive, but worth it. As the tracks and paths opened up beneath us we realised that it was actually a LONG way to the top, and not a hike that we had time for.<\/div>\n<p>The whole place is set up for excursions and getting you to pay to have an easy ride. There are no maps, or directions or guides for walkers. The guide books are mostly photographic.<\/p>\n<p>Having said that, we appreciated the facilites at the top of the cable car, with a good cafe and toilets.<\/p>\n<p>We headed out into the now-very-cold air with the aim of following whoever else was walking. We got a little way and the wind picked up and blew some snow in! Yes, Sicily in September and it&#8217;s snowing. Well, we were at quite an altitude at this point and very much in the clouds.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSszQ0JKI\/AAAAAAAAEDI\/Q6nCiA4HUdI\/s400\/IMG_1231.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;width:400px;cursor:pointer;height:300px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSszQ0JKI\/AAAAAAAAEDI\/Q6nCiA4HUdI\/s400\/IMG_1231.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<div>We retreat to the cafe to discuss our options over a cappucino.

We found a little grocers shop in Noto &#8211; amazingly OPEN &#8211; and bought sandwich-making stuff an a good old English newspaper.<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTQF-MsjnI\/AAAAAAAAD_o\/7xfK6Z44G8A\/s288\/IMG_1177.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTQF-MsjnI\/AAAAAAAAD_o\/7xfK6Z44G8A\/s288\/IMG_1177.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>With rations to hand we then made our way to the Vendicari Nature Reserve and the beach.<\/p>\n<p>We made this journey via Eloro &#8211; an archaeological site.

A shame really as their may otherwise have been some good history on show.<\/p>\n<div>Vendicari was excellent. 3 Euros of parking got us a good quiet beach, and safe swimming.<\/div>\n<div>Now, we sensed that Italians weren&#8217;t very good with following rules, so the important rules for the nature reserve were made quite explicit on a number of large signs. One rule in particular caught our eye; we were warned that &#8220;E&#8217; vietato introdurre specie animali o vegetali estranee alla fauna e alla flora tipiche della zona.&#8221; (Something along the lines of &#8220;It&#8217;s forbidden to introduce foreign animal or plant species to the flora and fauna of the reserve&#8221;)&#8230;complete with an amusing graphic showing us what might constitute breach of this rule:<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTQNH8EeTI\/AAAAAAAAEAA\/-OQz_g0zPZk\/s288\/IMG_1180.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTQNH8EeTI\/AAAAAAAAEAA\/-OQz_g0zPZk\/s288\/IMG_1180.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>We had a nice few hours on the beach, complete with home-made sandwiches.

We found a little grocers shop in Noto &#8211; amazingly OPEN &#8211; and bought sandwich-making stuff an a good old English newspaper.<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTQF-MsjnI\/AAAAAAAAD_o\/7xfK6Z44G8A\/s288\/IMG_1177.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTQF-MsjnI\/AAAAAAAAD_o\/7xfK6Z44G8A\/s288\/IMG_1177.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>With rations to hand we then made our way to the Vendicari Nature Reserve and the beach.<\/p>\n<p>We made this journey via Eloro &#8211; an archaeological site. But this was sadly closed. In fact, it looked very closed, completely deserted and quite scruffy and litter-strewn. A shame really as their may otherwise have been some good history on show.<\/p>\n<div>Vendicari was excellent. 3 Euros of parking got us a good quiet beach, and safe swimming.<\/div>\n<div>Now, we sensed that Italians weren&#8217;t very good with following rules, so the important rules for the nature reserve were made quite explicit on a number of large signs. One rule in particular caught our eye; we were warned that &#8220;E&#8217; vietato introdurre specie animali o vegetali estranee alla fauna e alla flora tipiche della zona.&#8221; (Something along the lines of &#8220;It&#8217;s forbidden to introduce foreign animal or plant species to the flora and fauna of the reserve&#8221;)&#8230;complete with an amusing graphic showing us what might constitute breach of this rule:<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTQNH8EeTI\/AAAAAAAAEAA\/-OQz_g0zPZk\/s288\/IMG_1180.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTQNH8EeTI\/AAAAAAAAEAA\/-OQz_g0zPZk\/s288\/IMG_1180.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>We had a nice few hours on the beach, complete with home-made sandwiches. A bit of cloud and wind came and went and we left in the early afternoon. We headed to the nearby town of Lido di Noto (an uninteresting little place on the seafront) for a drink. We parked up, grabbed a couple of bottles of Coke (no cafe&#8217;s sadly) and then&#8230;it absolutely chucked it down with rain.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSIVT9dOI\/AAAAAAAAEAc\/YSCC-3ml-l8\/s288\/IMG_1183.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSIVT9dOI\/AAAAAAAAEAc\/YSCC-3ml-l8\/s288\/IMG_1183.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSK-rXshI\/AAAAAAAAEAs\/qj7xbk3WTlI\/s288\/IMG_1186.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTSK-rXshI\/AAAAAAAAEAs\/qj7xbk3WTlI\/s288\/IMG_1186.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>Coke&#8230;in the car&#8230;on sea front. It could have been Bognor, or Scarborough, but it was Lido di Noto in Sicily. Just our luck! There was plenty more evidence of the previously-mentioned lack of road drainage, and we drove our poor little Micra through the floods back to the hotel.<\/p>\n<div>Boy were we glad not to be up Etna!<\/div>\n<div>We chilled at hotel a little before heading to a supermarket we&#8217;d spotted for a bit more shopping and then dinner in Noto.<\/div>\n<div>A much better day!<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">More signs<\/span><\/p>\n<div>As a slight side note on driving.

This was no exception.<\/p>\n<div>The day started well with sunshine, the usual fantastic breakfast, and chilling out by the pool. My crisis began when we headed to Avola (the lively town we passed through the day before) for lunch. Turns out that not only does everything in Sicily close from about 12 noon until about 4pm, but most of Avola is being rebuilt. We found somewhere to park, and had we wanted the usual combination of an espresso, cigarette, and some cake, we&#8217;d have been fine, but no sandwiches for sale in this thriving town at lunchtime!<\/div>\n<p>We gave up and headed back to a signposted Trattoria near a beautiful gorge called Cava Grande. The gorge was closed due to bad weather making it unsafe, and we weren&#8217;t sure if the trattoria was serving food and we didn&#8217;t know how to ask.<\/p>\n<div>So it was back to Noto where we picked up Pizza and ice cream and satisfied our appetites.<\/div>\n<p>In the meantime we&#8217;ve scraped the hire car&#8217;s hubcaps &amp; scratched bumper.<\/p>\n<div>Back at the hotel I&#8217;m fuming, angry and frustrated. All my reasons for not liking to holiday abroad have materialised.<\/div>\n<div>Sally is hugely patient &#8211; bless her. It takes me a long time to chill out but after a light dinner at the hotel I&#8217;m mostly OK.<\/div>\n<div>What did we learn? That Sicily shuts down between 12 and 4 and that Avola is a rubbish place for tourists.<\/div>\n<div>We pray before we sleep that tomorrow &#8211; a planned trip up Mt Etna &#8211; will be easier.<\/div>\n<div>Link: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/09\/a-week-in-sicily-not-a-trip-to-etna-no-honking-and-definitely-no-kangaroos\/\">Part six<\/a><\/div>\n",

This was no exception.<\/p>\n<div>The day started well with sunshine, the usual fantastic breakfast, and chilling out by the pool. My crisis began when we headed to Avola (the lively town we passed through the day before) for lunch. Turns out that not only does everything in Sicily close from about 12 noon until about 4pm, but most of Avola is being rebuilt. We found somewhere to park, and had we wanted the usual combination of an espresso, cigarette, and some cake, we&#8217;d have been fine, but no sandwiches for sale in this thriving town at lunchtime!<\/div>\n<p>We gave up and headed back to a signposted Trattoria near a beautiful gorge called Cava Grande. The gorge was closed due to bad weather making it unsafe, and we weren&#8217;t sure if the trattoria was serving food and we didn&#8217;t know how to ask.<\/p>\n<div>So it was back to Noto where we picked up Pizza and ice cream and satisfied our appetites.<\/div>\n<p>In the meantime we&#8217;ve scraped the hire car&#8217;s hubcaps &amp; scratched bumper.<\/p>\n<div>Back at the hotel I&#8217;m fuming, angry and frustrated.

It takes me a long time to chill out but after a light dinner at the hotel I&#8217;m mostly OK.<\/div>\n<div>What did we learn? That Sicily shuts down between 12 and 4 and that Avola is a rubbish place for tourists.<\/div>\n<div>We pray before we sleep that tomorrow &#8211; a planned trip up Mt Etna &#8211; will be easier.<\/div>\n<div>Link: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/09\/a-week-in-sicily-not-a-trip-to-etna-no-honking-and-definitely-no-kangaroos\/\">Part six<\/a><\/div>\n",

Again, the <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">SatNav<\/span> helped us out but didn&#8217;t really get us to the centre of the city and we struggled to find somewhere to park. We eventually parked up in a place that turned out to be on the outskirts of the small city, and we walked down the hill towards the centre.<\/div>\n<div>Part-way down the hill we came across a very provincial town square in front of a big church. This was a classic Italian sight: old Italian men gathering in the square in rough suits and flat caps, smoking their cigarettes in whatever shade they could find, whilst talking loudly and gesticulating wildly. Perfect!<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Noto<\/span>, despite being very small, has some fantastic buildings and there&#8217;s plenty to see. The Baroque architecture is everywhere and captivates the imagination. Well worth a visit if you&#8217;re in the area.<\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTL4pueSpI\/AAAAAAAAD8w\/nGAZK8B6QHg\/s400\/IMG_1142.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;width:300px;cursor:pointer;height:400px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTL4pueSpI\/AAAAAAAAD8w\/nGAZK8B6QHg\/s400\/IMG_1142.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>We spent some time wondering and taking photos before ambling back to the car and heading off to the bigger city of Syracuse (aka Siracusa).<\/div>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Struggling with Sandwiches in Syracuse<\/span><\/p>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>The journey to Syracuse not only confused the Sat <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Nav<\/span> (some bits of road were closed or being rebuilt), but gave us our first taste of proper Sicilian driving. Turns out they are a bit crazy after all. We saw some mad overtaking <span class=\"blsp-spelling-corrected\">manoeuvres<\/span> &#8211; even from big trucks! &#8211; and they drive right up close behind you. This all not helped by the fact that visibility in the Micra was awful.<\/div>\n<div>After arriving at Syracuse and fighting our way through the equally-crazy city-centre mele of cars and scooters (are there any rules of the road?), we again had problems parking &#8211; not least because we didn&#8217;t have any Euro coins to put in the parking ticket machines &#8211; we only had notes!<\/div>\n<div>Eventually we found a free space in a fairly dodgy looking part of town, and walked back towards the historic centre of Ortigia.<\/div>\n<div>By now it was definitely lunchtime, and we wanted to grab a sandwich. This was the start of several lunchtime stresses for us. It turns out that buying cakes, cigarettes and coffee is pretty easy at any time of day, but buying a sandwich is a bit hit and miss.<\/div>\n<div>We eventually found a cafe selling the sort of thing we were after. It had seats outside for an al fresco dining experience. But what did we do? The food was on display in counters inside, so did we go in, see what we wanted, then sit outside and wait for someone to take an order? Or did we buy the food inside and then take it out to eat?<\/div>\n<div>Most people sitting outside seemed quite happy that there were no menus, but we were a bit baffled.<\/div>\n<div>We proceeded to the counter and asked for some panini (sandwiches), and as we were being served some other people came in and started paying. We decided that the system must be to pay first, then get the food. But we still weren&#8217;t sure about sitting outside.<\/div>\n<div>AAAARRRGGHH!!!! This is why I hate being abroad. Doing the simplest things becomes incredibly difficult when you don&#8217;t know how things work and don&#8217;t have a good enough grasp of the language to be able to ask.<\/div>\n<div>Eventually, I think the cafe staff worked out what we were trying to do. Gave us our sandwiches, ushered us outside and took our money once we were finished.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Wandering the Back Streets of Ortigia<\/span><\/div>\n<div>Full of good wholesome Italian lunch, we then picked up our Rough Guide and went for a walk around Ortigia. Wandering backstreets is something that Sally and I always seem to end up doing. We try to follow signs and directions but almost always end on off the beaten track in foreign cities. Why doesn&#8217;t everyone else end up doing this? We always seem to be alone.<\/div>\n<div>It&#8217;s slightly fun, but becomes a drag after a while, especially when you&#8217;re trying to see the sights and you can&#8217;t find them.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Cathedral &#8211; Reverence, but at what cost?<\/span><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMKKuuTuI\/AAAAAAAAD9k\/cLgnUAu_CXs\/s288\/IMG_1151.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMKKuuTuI\/AAAAAAAAD9k\/cLgnUAu_CXs\/s288\/IMG_1151.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>We eventually found the Duomo (Cathedral). An AMAZING building. It&#8217;s a place that has been built and re-built over the centuries, but unlike most places, you can see how it&#8217;s been built over. There columns of the old greek temple on which it was built are still there to see, and you can see how the new bits of building have been overlaid, and set within these. The fairly modern facade was added after an earthquake brought down an older entrance to the building. Inside, the building was dark and quiet, huge and expansive, allowing your mind to awe and wonder.<\/div>\n<div>As a Christian I have conflicting views on the nature of big churches. A place like Ortigia&#8217;s Duomo brings me to a place of great reverence. These places make God big. They cost lots and took lots of effort to build. These were probably the finest buildings of their times, and they were built for the purpose of worshipping God. I find it amazing, and it makes me wish that WE could do such amazing things for God.<\/div>\n<div>But I also question what God would have us do? Giving our lives, out work, our money, as offerings to God is exactly what our faith requires. But is using that wealth and effort to build a place of worship, where Christians can lock themselves away and revere the Lord the right thing? The Bible makes it clear that our God would rather have us help the poor and needy, share all we have with those in need, and bring righteousness and justice to all, than hoard our wealth within the church.<\/div>\n<div>I love the huge reverence that these people had for the LORD. But wouldn&#8217;t their sacrifices have been better used for God&#8217;s purposes?<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Spooky Catacombs<\/span><\/div>\n<div>A quick ice cream (I LOVE Italian ice cream!) and we headed back to the car and out of town. It had started raining again, and large puddles has started accumulating on the roads which, oddly, don&#8217;t seem to have drains. This puzzled us because when it rains in Sicily, it really buckets down!<\/div>\n<div>Our next destination was the catacombs. We found this easily using the Sat NAv, and we found some parking too. We even had Euro coins to put in the machine. But&#8230;where do we pay? There were no machines!<\/div>\n<div>After some deliberation, we spotted a free space by the road and parked there.<\/div>\n<div>Catacombs are fascinating places. When we went to Rome we made a long trip outside the city to visit some. They are underground networks of tunnels that form a burial site for Christians. Thousands of people were buried in tombs underground in these places and they are spooky, but intriguing places that again show the great lengths that people went to in reverence of God.<\/div>\n<div>One thing tha I found in both Rome and Syracuse was that the guides that took you round the catacombs were incredibly knowledgable, multi-lingual, and very helpful. Catacombs are always well worth a visit if you&#8217;re near them.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dinner in Noto &#8211; Don&#8217;t Trust your Rough Guide!<\/span><\/div>\n<div>We headed back to <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Noto for dinner<\/span> via the town of <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Avola<\/span>, which looked like a cool and thriving place. Back in Noto we still couldn&#8217;t find a place to park. We drove in circles for a bit with the SAt Nav bleating out &#8220;Recalculating&#8230;.recalculating&#8230;&#8221; (seems they&#8217;re not so good at finding parking) then eventually we found a free space.<\/div>\n<div>Wondering round Noto earlier we&#8217;d seen plenty of places to eat, but on our return they all seemed to have disappeared. Where had all the restaurants gone?<\/div>\n<div>The Rough Guide we had recommended a couple of places. The first was a restaurant just off the main square. It has a load of seats outside but no one was eating there, there were no menus on show and, frankly, the place smelled of wee. So we avoided that one. Next up was a restaurant described by the Rough Guide as &#8220;the best restaurant in Noto&#8221;. This was not to be the case. They weren&#8217;t serving Pizza, and the food we did get was cheap and pretty poor quality.<\/div>\n<div>Perhaps Noto&#8217;s not such a good place to eat after all? And we&#8217;d certainly recommend using your head rather then the guide to find a good place to eat. It&#8217;s not hard to work out the good places, but it is made difficult when there&#8217;s no menus or prices on display &#8211; which was often the case in Sicily.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Language Complications<\/span><\/div>\n<div>Over dinner we were trying to learn a bit more Italian to get us through the week. We had some phrases in the Rough Guide and an Italian-English dictionary. I somehow got distracted looking at English pronunciation. How complicated is that? How is anyone supposed to learn a language where the following groups of letters sound the same:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>t, tt, ed and bt (tea, butter, walked, doubt)<\/li>\n<li>k, c, cc, ck, ch, que (key, cool, soccer, lock, school, cheque)<\/li>\n<li>ch, tch, tu, ti (cheer, match, nature, question)<\/li>\n<li>j, ge, dge, di, du (jump, age, edge, soldier, gradual)<\/li>\n<li>f, ff, gh, ph, lf (fat, coffee, cough, physics, half)<\/li>\n<li>s, c, ps, ss, sc, st (soon, city, psychology, mess, scene, listen)<\/li>\n<li>f, s, ti, si (fishing, sure, station, tension)<\/li>\n<li>m, mm, lm, mb (sum, hammer, calm, bomb)<\/li>\n<li>r, rr, wr, rh (red, marry, wriggle, rhubard)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>And that&#8217;s just the consonants! Note that some letter combinations have more than one sound (e.g. ti = question, station &#8211; subtly different!)<\/div>\n<div>Vowels are even worse &#8211; check out these groups:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>augh, a, oa, aw, ou, oo (caught, ball, board, draw, four, floor)<\/li>\n<li>oo, o, oe, ou, ew, ue, u (boot, move, shoe, group, flew, blue, rude)<\/li>\n<li>i, ur, er, or, ear, our (bird, burn, fern, worm, earn, journal)<\/li>\n<li>oar, e, our, or, io, er (cupboard, the, colour, actor, nation, danger)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>Even the letters y, i and u can all sound the same just on their own (yet, onion, use).<\/div>\n<div>Our language is BONKERS, and I have a renewed respect for anyone that tries to learn it!<\/div>\n<div>Less hungry, but not hugely satisfied, we headed back to hotel for some well earned rest. We certainly had a busy first day.<\/div>\n<div>Link: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/08\/a-week-in-sicily-part-5-bored-yet-i-am\/\">Part five<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

Again, the <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">SatNav<\/span> helped us out but didn&#8217;t really get us to the centre of the city and we struggled to find somewhere to park. We eventually parked up in a place that turned out to be on the outskirts of the small city, and we walked down the hill towards the centre.<\/div>\n<div>Part-way down the hill we came across a very provincial town square in front of a big church. This was a classic Italian sight: old Italian men gathering in the square in rough suits and flat caps, smoking their cigarettes in whatever shade they could find, whilst talking loudly and gesticulating wildly. Perfect!<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Noto<\/span>, despite being very small, has some fantastic buildings and there&#8217;s plenty to see. The Baroque architecture is everywhere and captivates the imagination. Well worth a visit if you&#8217;re in the area.<\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTL4pueSpI\/AAAAAAAAD8w\/nGAZK8B6QHg\/s400\/IMG_1142.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;width:300px;cursor:pointer;height:400px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTL4pueSpI\/AAAAAAAAD8w\/nGAZK8B6QHg\/s400\/IMG_1142.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>We spent some time wondering and taking photos before ambling back to the car and heading off to the bigger city of Syracuse (aka Siracusa).<\/div>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Struggling with Sandwiches in Syracuse<\/span><\/p>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>The journey to Syracuse not only confused the Sat <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Nav<\/span> (some bits of road were closed or being rebuilt), but gave us our first taste of proper Sicilian driving. Turns out they are a bit crazy after all. We saw some mad overtaking <span class=\"blsp-spelling-corrected\">manoeuvres<\/span> &#8211; even from big trucks! &#8211; and they drive right up close behind you. This all not helped by the fact that visibility in the Micra was awful.<\/div>\n<div>After arriving at Syracuse and fighting our way through the equally-crazy city-centre mele of cars and scooters (are there any rules of the road?), we again had problems parking &#8211; not least because we didn&#8217;t have any Euro coins to put in the parking ticket machines &#8211; we only had notes!<\/div>\n<div>Eventually we found a free space in a fairly dodgy looking part of town, and walked back towards the historic centre of Ortigia.<\/div>\n<div>By now it was definitely lunchtime, and we wanted to grab a sandwich. This was the start of several lunchtime stresses for us. It turns out that buying cakes, cigarettes and coffee is pretty easy at any time of day, but buying a sandwich is a bit hit and miss.<\/div>\n<div>We eventually found a cafe selling the sort of thing we were after. It had seats outside for an al fresco dining experience. But what did we do? The food was on display in counters inside, so did we go in, see what we wanted, then sit outside and wait for someone to take an order? Or did we buy the food inside and then take it out to eat?<\/div>\n<div>Most people sitting outside seemed quite happy that there were no menus, but we were a bit baffled.<\/div>\n<div>We proceeded to the counter and asked for some panini (sandwiches), and as we were being served some other people came in and started paying. We decided that the system must be to pay first, then get the food. But we still weren&#8217;t sure about sitting outside.<\/div>\n<div>AAAARRRGGHH!!!! This is why I hate being abroad. Doing the simplest things becomes incredibly difficult when you don&#8217;t know how things work and don&#8217;t have a good enough grasp of the language to be able to ask.<\/div>\n<div>Eventually, I think the cafe staff worked out what we were trying to do. Gave us our sandwiches, ushered us outside and took our money once we were finished.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Wandering the Back Streets of Ortigia<\/span><\/div>\n<div>Full of good wholesome Italian lunch, we then picked up our Rough Guide and went for a walk around Ortigia. Wandering backstreets is something that Sally and I always seem to end up doing. We try to follow signs and directions but almost always end on off the beaten track in foreign cities. Why doesn&#8217;t everyone else end up doing this? We always seem to be alone.<\/div>\n<div>It&#8217;s slightly fun, but becomes a drag after a while, especially when you&#8217;re trying to see the sights and you can&#8217;t find them.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Cathedral &#8211; Reverence, but at what cost?<\/span><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMKKuuTuI\/AAAAAAAAD9k\/cLgnUAu_CXs\/s288\/IMG_1151.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMKKuuTuI\/AAAAAAAAD9k\/cLgnUAu_CXs\/s288\/IMG_1151.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>We eventually found the Duomo (Cathedral). An AMAZING building. It&#8217;s a place that has been built and re-built over the centuries, but unlike most places, you can see how it&#8217;s been built over. There columns of the old greek temple on which it was built are still there to see, and you can see how the new bits of building have been overlaid, and set within these. The fairly modern facade was added after an earthquake brought down an older entrance to the building. Inside, the building was dark and quiet, huge and expansive, allowing your mind to awe and wonder.<\/div>\n<div>As a Christian I have conflicting views on the nature of big churches. A place like Ortigia&#8217;s Duomo brings me to a place of great reverence. These places make God big. They cost lots and took lots of effort to build. These were probably the finest buildings of their times, and they were built for the purpose of worshipping God. I find it amazing, and it makes me wish that WE could do such amazing things for God.<\/div>\n<div>But I also question what God would have us do? Giving our lives, out work, our money, as offerings to God is exactly what our faith requires. But is using that wealth and effort to build a place of worship, where Christians can lock themselves away and revere the Lord the right thing? The Bible makes it clear that our God would rather have us help the poor and needy, share all we have with those in need, and bring righteousness and justice to all, than hoard our wealth within the church.<\/div>\n<div>I love the huge reverence that these people had for the LORD. But wouldn&#8217;t their sacrifices have been better used for God&#8217;s purposes?<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Spooky Catacombs<\/span><\/div>\n<div>A quick ice cream (I LOVE Italian ice cream!) and we headed back to the car and out of town. It had started raining again, and large puddles has started accumulating on the roads which, oddly, don&#8217;t seem to have drains. This puzzled us because when it rains in Sicily, it really buckets down!<\/div>\n<div>Our next destination was the catacombs. We found this easily using the Sat NAv, and we found some parking too. We even had Euro coins to put in the machine. But&#8230;where do we pay? There were no machines!<\/div>\n<div>After some deliberation, we spotted a free space by the road and parked there.<\/div>\n<div>Catacombs are fascinating places. When we went to Rome we made a long trip outside the city to visit some. They are underground networks of tunnels that form a burial site for Christians. Thousands of people were buried in tombs underground in these places and they are spooky, but intriguing places that again show the great lengths that people went to in reverence of God.<\/div>\n<div>One thing tha I found in both Rome and Syracuse was that the guides that took you round the catacombs were incredibly knowledgable, multi-lingual, and very helpful. Catacombs are always well worth a visit if you&#8217;re near them.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dinner in Noto &#8211; Don&#8217;t Trust your Rough Guide!<\/span><\/div>\n<div>We headed back to <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Noto for dinner<\/span> via the town of <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Avola<\/span>, which looked like a cool and thriving place. Back in Noto we still couldn&#8217;t find a place to park. We drove in circles for a bit with the SAt Nav bleating out &#8220;Recalculating&#8230;.recalculating&#8230;&#8221; (seems they&#8217;re not so good at finding parking) then eventually we found a free space.<\/div>\n<div>Wondering round Noto earlier we&#8217;d seen plenty of places to eat, but on our return they all seemed to have disappeared. Where had all the restaurants gone?<\/div>\n<div>The Rough Guide we had recommended a couple of places. The first was a restaurant just off the main square. It has a load of seats outside but no one was eating there, there were no menus on show and, frankly, the place smelled of wee. So we avoided that one. Next up was a restaurant described by the Rough Guide as &#8220;the best restaurant in Noto&#8221;. This was not to be the case. They weren&#8217;t serving Pizza, and the food we did get was cheap and pretty poor quality.<\/div>\n<div>Perhaps Noto&#8217;s not such a good place to eat after all? And we&#8217;d certainly recommend using your head rather then the guide to find a good place to eat. It&#8217;s not hard to work out the good places, but it is made difficult when there&#8217;s no menus or prices on display &#8211; which was often the case in Sicily.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Language Complications<\/span><\/div>\n<div>Over dinner we were trying to learn a bit more Italian to get us through the week. We had some phrases in the Rough Guide and an Italian-English dictionary. I somehow got distracted looking at English pronunciation. How complicated is that? How is anyone supposed to learn a language where the following groups of letters sound the same:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>t, tt, ed and bt (tea, butter, walked, doubt)<\/li>\n<li>k, c, cc, ck, ch, que (key, cool, soccer, lock, school, cheque)<\/li>\n<li>ch, tch, tu, ti (cheer, match, nature, question)<\/li>\n<li>j, ge, dge, di, du (jump, age, edge, soldier, gradual)<\/li>\n<li>f, ff, gh, ph, lf (fat, coffee, cough, physics, half)<\/li>\n<li>s, c, ps, ss, sc, st (soon, city, psychology, mess, scene, listen)<\/li>\n<li>f, s, ti, si (fishing, sure, station, tension)<\/li>\n<li>m, mm, lm, mb (sum, hammer, calm, bomb)<\/li>\n<li>r, rr, wr, rh (red, marry, wriggle, rhubard)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>And that&#8217;s just the consonants! Note that some letter combinations have more than one sound (e.g. ti = question, station &#8211; subtly different!)<\/div>\n<div>Vowels are even worse &#8211; check out these groups:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>augh, a, oa, aw, ou, oo (caught, ball, board, draw, four, floor)<\/li>\n<li>oo, o, oe, ou, ew, ue, u (boot, move, shoe, group, flew, blue, rude)<\/li>\n<li>i, ur, er, or, ear, our (bird, burn, fern, worm, earn, journal)<\/li>\n<li>oar, e, our, or, io, er (cupboard, the, colour, actor, nation, danger)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div>Even the letters y, i and u can all sound the same just on their own (yet, onion, use).<\/div>\n<div>Our language is BONKERS, and I have a renewed respect for anyone that tries to learn it!<\/div>\n<div>Less hungry, but not hugely satisfied, we headed back to hotel for some well earned rest. We certainly had a busy first day.<\/div>\n<div>Link: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/08\/a-week-in-sicily-part-5-bored-yet-i-am\/\">Part five<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

I do waffle!!!<\/div>\n<div>\n<div>An alarm at 5am, a quick rise and off to <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">AirParks<\/span> <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Gatwick<\/span> (booked as part of the package with <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Expedia<\/span>). I&#8217;m not a <span class=\"blsp-spelling-corrected\">connoisseur<\/span> of airport parking but this seemed fine, other than their new computer system not working at first. But we dropped the car off, checked in, and got the bus to the terminal. Easy peasey.<\/div>\n<div>Having checked in online the day before, we did a quick and easy bag drop. We heard others checking in and not getting seats together so it seems lots of people check in online, and it&#8217;s worth doing to get the good seats.<\/div>\n<div>We headed through security with it&#8217;s baffling no-liquids rules and dedicated shoe X-ray system (this always seems ridiculous but who are we to argue with the security experts). Breakfast was at &#8220;eat&#8221;. A quick sausage sandwich&#8230;pittifully small, far too expensive, and lacking ketchup, but just what we needed&#8230;and then off to the gate.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A very British flight<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">The flight was quite entertaining. British Airways crew are typically British. With a vague aloofness, slight lack of dedication to the job, dry humour and no apparent foreign language capability. It was fine.<\/span><\/div>\n<div>The pilot was the funniest. Before we took off he informed us that &#8220;The engineers have now fixed the intercom but, in the airline industry we have a saying that the flight can&#8217;t take off until the weight of the paperwork matches the weight of the plane&#8221;. And upon landing we were welcomed to Catania Airport and blessed with the catchphrase &#8220;If you&#8217;re here on business, may it be a pleasure, and if you&#8217;re here for pleasure, may it be the business&#8221;.<\/div>\n<div>The flight was good, and the little &#8220;Deli&#8221; snack pack that we got with a salmon roll and some other goodies, was surprisingly good quality.<\/div>\n<div>We arrived at Catania in sunny and warmth and sat on the plane watching our baggage being grossly mishandled by Italian airport staff before heading to arrivals.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">First Impressions<\/span><\/div>\n<div>Don&#8217;t you find that first impressions of a foreign country are always of the loos! After a two or three hour flight you kinda need to go, and it&#8217;s the first thing that you notice is different. The brand names are different, the flushes work differently, the signs are in different languages. If I was designing an airport I&#8217;d make the toilets in arrivals the most amazing place, shiny, gleaming, spotless, automated. Just to make a good first impression. Catania&#8217;s loos were reasonable, but it alerted me to the fact that I really was no longer in the UK and I&#8217;d have to get used to things being a bit different.<\/div>\n<div>Baggage collection was a bit slow. The Italians might throw your luggage around but they take they don&#8217;t do it because they&#8217;re in a hurry.<\/div>\n<div>We grabbed some pizza (cheap, yummy, and needs little Italian to order) and then headed to collect our car. And guess what? IT&#8217;S BLOODY RAINING!! We&#8217;ve travelled 2000 miles to escape the crappy English &#8220;summer&#8221; weather. We&#8217;re about as far south as you can go without leaving Europe. And it&#8217;s dull, cloudy, and wet. How depressing.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Driving&#8230;.getting it right!<\/span><\/div>\n<div>We picked up our hire car, a little Nissan Micra with aircon, central locking, radio and all the mod cons, without needing to speak much Italian&#8230;thankfully.<\/div>\n<div>We reported some un-documented scratches to a very stern Italian lady who didn&#8217;t seem to care all that much. And then the fun began.<\/div>\n<div>I&#8217;ve never driven on the continent. I&#8217;d been told lots of things about it:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>it&#8217;s fine<\/li>\n<li>you&#8217;ll pick it up quickly<\/li>\n<li>just follow everyone else<\/li>\n<li>watch out for roundabouts<\/li>\n<li>the biggest problem is grabbing the door handle instead of the gear stick<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div>And most of them proved true.<\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTWWiV7flI\/AAAAAAAAEQg\/q8FELD5e-ns\/s288\/IMG_1452.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:216px;cursor:pointer;height:288px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTWWiV7flI\/AAAAAAAAEQg\/q8FELD5e-ns\/s288\/IMG_1452.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>Driving on the right wasn&#8217;t a problem at all. Judging the width of car was hard &#8211; I&#8217;m so used to having the middle and edge of the road being the other way around, and Sally let out a few muffled &#8220;eeeks&#8221; as I drifted too far right, but <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">generally it was OK. My biggest problem was non-roundabout junctions; turning left off main roads (must remember to stay on the right) and working out which direction traffic was coming from.<\/span><\/div>\n<div>So, psyched up and ready to get it right, we headed off. Now, I&#8217;m a pretty organised person. I had a little green plastic folder with our passports, all the printed-out doucumentation for the holiday, pre-paid vouchers, maps of the airport parking and hotel, and so on. So when Sally ask &#8220;Where&#8217;s the directions to the hotel?&#8221; I naturally had the answer.<\/div>\n<div>&#8220;Errr&#8230;I don&#8217;t have them&#8221;<\/div>\n<div>So &#8211; praise the LORD (literally!) for our borrowed SatNav. A few screen-touches and we had directions to Masseria degli Ulivi. Phew! What an idiot I am.<\/div>\n<div>The drive was quick and easy. The Sicilian driving didn&#8217;t seem as crazy as I expected (though this was to change later in the week), and we arrived safely at our hotel. To find&#8230;.oh.<\/div>\n<div>It looks like it&#8217;s still being built.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Masseria Degli Ulivi<\/span><\/div>\n<div>You hear all these nightmare stories about people turning up to their holiday destination to find that their hotel is still a pile of bricks and a bunch of uninterested builders. So when we turned through some blank, concrete pillars, into a gravel courtyard with several diggers and some big piles of aggregates, we had to do a quick double take. &#8220;It&#8217;s fine&#8230;everything&#8217;s fine&#8221; we said to ourselves.<\/div>\n<div>The hotel turned out to be amazing and we think they were just building some new rooms.<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMW8GDUqI\/AAAAAAAAD-E\/VHg9aV8aThc\/s288\/IMG_1158.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMW8GDUqI\/AAAAAAAAD-E\/VHg9aV8aThc\/s288\/IMG_1158.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>Set about 15 km outside the town of Noto, Masseria degli Ulivi is a converted olive farm. Simple, but charming. Not grandiose, and fairly limited in facilities, but with only 18 rooms, an excellent (if a little expensive) restaurant on site, acres of land, a tennis court and swimming pool, and no one or nothing around for miles, it&#8217;s a perfect place for a quiet retreat, and to use as a base for exploring the historic south-east of Sicily. If you want a 5-star luxury experience, look elsewhere, but if you want to get away from it all and chill out, we&#8217;d highly recommend it.<\/p>\n<div>But it was still cloudy and cold. Boooo.<\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMeNSAUBI\/AAAAAAAAD-U\/3hNTFwpPO7U\/s288\/IMG_1160.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:left;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 10px 10px 0;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMeNSAUBI\/AAAAAAAAD-U\/3hNTFwpPO7U\/s288\/IMG_1160.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>We ignored the dullness and the lack of sunshine and took a very B<span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">ritish<\/span> dip in the cold swimming pool before wandering around the hotel grounds.

Bits of path were missing, and it felt like they&#8217;d not quite completed some of the work they&#8217;d planned. But this is the <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">mediterranean<\/span> way and it in no way detracted from our enjoyment &#8211; I offer it as a simple observation.<\/div>\n<div>We grabbed an amazing proper Italian Cappucino and set and planned our week- there&#8217;s lots to do!<\/div>\n<div>The hotel dog arrived to welcome us and took a liking to my clothing. He was VERY naughty and appeared to be pretty untrained and untrainable. But he was fun to have around. Perhaps Italian phrase books should have a &#8220;dog instructions&#8221; section. I sense he didn&#8217;t understand &#8220;SIT!&#8221; and &#8220;DOWN!&#8221; but I didn&#8217;t know the Italian equivalents and my attempts at Italian-style arm waving and gesturing seemed to go unnoticed too.<\/div>\n<div>We ate in the hotel&#8217;s excellent restaurant. It was expensive for a full meal with wine but really good food. Very earthy Sicilian dishes &#8211; I had <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Gnocci and <\/span>rabbit &#8211; and truly heavenly, but strong, local wine. Worth the money, but we probably couldn&#8217;t afford to eat here all week.<\/div>\n<div>We enjoyed many hours deep sleep that night!<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTWRvdeu5I\/AAAAAAAAEQI\/qIuRXH-vzUM\/s400\/IMG_1440.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;width:400px;cursor:pointer;height:300px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTWRvdeu5I\/AAAAAAAAEQI\/qIuRXH-vzUM\/s400\/IMG_1440.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/07\/a-week-in-sicily-part-4-yummy-historic-crazy-stressful-amazing-wet-complicated-and-incorrect\/\">Part four<\/a><\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Flying Out<\/span><\/p>\n<div>Part 3 and we haven&#8217;t even left yet. I do waffle!!!<\/div>\n<div>\n<div>An alarm at 5am, a quick rise and off to <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">AirParks<\/span> <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Gatwick<\/span> (booked as part of the package with <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Expedia<\/span>). I&#8217;m not a <span class=\"blsp-spelling-corrected\">connoisseur<\/span> of airport parking but this seemed fine, other than their new computer system not working at first. But we dropped the car off, checked in, and got the bus to the terminal. Easy peasey.<\/div>\n<div>Having checked in online the day before, we did a quick and easy bag drop. We heard others checking in and not getting seats together so it seems lots of people check in online, and it&#8217;s worth doing to get the good seats.<\/div>\n<div>We headed through security with it&#8217;s baffling no-liquids rules and dedicated shoe X-ray system (this always seems ridiculous but who are we to argue with the security experts). Breakfast was at &#8220;eat&#8221;. A quick sausage sandwich&#8230;pittifully small, far too expensive, and lacking ketchup, but just what we needed&#8230;and then off to the gate.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A very British flight<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">The flight was quite entertaining. British Airways crew are typically British. With a vague aloofness, slight lack of dedication to the job, dry humour and no apparent foreign language capability. It was fine.<\/span><\/div>\n<div>The pilot was the funniest. Before we took off he informed us that &#8220;The engineers have now fixed the intercom but, in the airline industry we have a saying that the flight can&#8217;t take off until the weight of the paperwork matches the weight of the plane&#8221;. And upon landing we were welcomed to Catania Airport and blessed with the catchphrase &#8220;If you&#8217;re here on business, may it be a pleasure, and if you&#8217;re here for pleasure, may it be the business&#8221;.<\/div>\n<div>The flight was good, and the little &#8220;Deli&#8221; snack pack that we got with a salmon roll and some other goodies, was surprisingly good quality.<\/div>\n<div>We arrived at Catania in sunny and warmth and sat on the plane watching our baggage being grossly mishandled by Italian airport staff before heading to arrivals.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">First Impressions<\/span><\/div>\n<div>Don&#8217;t you find that first impressions of a foreign country are always of the loos! After a two or three hour flight you kinda need to go, and it&#8217;s the first thing that you notice is different. The brand names are different, the flushes work differently, the signs are in different languages. If I was designing an airport I&#8217;d make the toilets in arrivals the most amazing place, shiny, gleaming, spotless, automated. Just to make a good first impression. Catania&#8217;s loos were reasonable, but it alerted me to the fact that I really was no longer in the UK and I&#8217;d have to get used to things being a bit different.<\/div>\n<div>Baggage collection was a bit slow. The Italians might throw your luggage around but they take they don&#8217;t do it because they&#8217;re in a hurry.<\/div>\n<div>We grabbed some pizza (cheap, yummy, and needs little Italian to order) and then headed to collect our car. And guess what? IT&#8217;S BLOODY RAINING!! We&#8217;ve travelled 2000 miles to escape the crappy English &#8220;summer&#8221; weather. We&#8217;re about as far south as you can go without leaving Europe. And it&#8217;s dull, cloudy, and wet. How depressing.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Driving&#8230;.getting it right!<\/span><\/div>\n<div>We picked up our hire car, a little Nissan Micra with aircon, central locking, radio and all the mod cons, without needing to speak much Italian&#8230;thankfully.<\/div>\n<div>We reported some un-documented scratches to a very stern Italian lady who didn&#8217;t seem to care all that much. And then the fun began.<\/div>\n<div>I&#8217;ve never driven on the continent. I&#8217;d been told lots of things about it:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>it&#8217;s fine<\/li>\n<li>you&#8217;ll pick it up quickly<\/li>\n<li>just follow everyone else<\/li>\n<li>watch out for roundabouts<\/li>\n<li>the biggest problem is grabbing the door handle instead of the gear stick<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div>And most of them proved true.<\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTWWiV7flI\/AAAAAAAAEQg\/q8FELD5e-ns\/s288\/IMG_1452.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:216px;cursor:pointer;height:288px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTWWiV7flI\/AAAAAAAAEQg\/q8FELD5e-ns\/s288\/IMG_1452.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>Driving on the right wasn&#8217;t a problem at all. Judging the width of car was hard &#8211; I&#8217;m so used to having the middle and edge of the road being the other way around, and Sally let out a few muffled &#8220;eeeks&#8221; as I drifted too far right, but <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">generally it was OK. My biggest problem was non-roundabout junctions; turning left off main roads (must remember to stay on the right) and working out which direction traffic was coming from.<\/span><\/div>\n<div>So, psyched up and ready to get it right, we headed off. Now, I&#8217;m a pretty organised person. I had a little green plastic folder with our passports, all the printed-out doucumentation for the holiday, pre-paid vouchers, maps of the airport parking and hotel, and so on. So when Sally ask &#8220;Where&#8217;s the directions to the hotel?&#8221; I naturally had the answer.<\/div>\n<div>&#8220;Errr&#8230;I don&#8217;t have them&#8221;<\/div>\n<div>So &#8211; praise the LORD (literally!) for our borrowed SatNav. A few screen-touches and we had directions to Masseria degli Ulivi. Phew! What an idiot I am.<\/div>\n<div>The drive was quick and easy. The Sicilian driving didn&#8217;t seem as crazy as I expected (though this was to change later in the week), and we arrived safely at our hotel. To find&#8230;.oh.<\/div>\n<div>It looks like it&#8217;s still being built.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Masseria Degli Ulivi<\/span><\/div>\n<div>You hear all these nightmare stories about people turning up to their holiday destination to find that their hotel is still a pile of bricks and a bunch of uninterested builders. So when we turned through some blank, concrete pillars, into a gravel courtyard with several diggers and some big piles of aggregates, we had to do a quick double take. &#8220;It&#8217;s fine&#8230;everything&#8217;s fine&#8221; we said to ourselves.<\/div>\n<div>The hotel turned out to be amazing and we think they were just building some new rooms.<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMW8GDUqI\/AAAAAAAAD-E\/VHg9aV8aThc\/s288\/IMG_1158.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMW8GDUqI\/AAAAAAAAD-E\/VHg9aV8aThc\/s288\/IMG_1158.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>Set about 15 km outside the town of Noto, Masseria degli Ulivi is a converted olive farm. Simple, but charming. Not grandiose, and fairly limited in facilities, but with only 18 rooms, an excellent (if a little expensive) restaurant on site, acres of land, a tennis court and swimming pool, and no one or nothing around for miles, it&#8217;s a perfect place for a quiet retreat, and to use as a base for exploring the historic south-east of Sicily. If you want a 5-star luxury experience, look elsewhere, but if you want to get away from it all and chill out, we&#8217;d highly recommend it.<\/p>\n<div>But it was still cloudy and cold. Boooo.<\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMeNSAUBI\/AAAAAAAAD-U\/3hNTFwpPO7U\/s288\/IMG_1160.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:left;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 10px 10px 0;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMeNSAUBI\/AAAAAAAAD-U\/3hNTFwpPO7U\/s288\/IMG_1160.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>We ignored the dullness and the lack of sunshine and took a very B<span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">ritish<\/span> dip in the cold swimming pool before wandering around the hotel grounds. Foreign places often feel like they&#8217;re not quite finished and this is no exception. Bits of path were missing, and it felt like they&#8217;d not quite completed some of the work they&#8217;d planned. But this is the <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">mediterranean<\/span> way and it in no way detracted from our enjoyment &#8211; I offer it as a simple observation.<\/div>\n<div>We grabbed an amazing proper Italian Cappucino and set and planned our week- there&#8217;s lots to do!<\/div>\n<div>The hotel dog arrived to welcome us and took a liking to my clothing. He was VERY naughty and appeared to be pretty untrained and untrainable. But he was fun to have around. Perhaps Italian phrase books should have a &#8220;dog instructions&#8221; section. I sense he didn&#8217;t understand &#8220;SIT!&#8221; and &#8220;DOWN!&#8221; but I didn&#8217;t know the Italian equivalents and my attempts at Italian-style arm waving and gesturing seemed to go unnoticed too.<\/div>\n<div>We ate in the hotel&#8217;s excellent restaurant. It was expensive for a full meal with wine but really good food. Very earthy Sicilian dishes &#8211; I had <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Gnocci and <\/span>rabbit &#8211; and truly heavenly, but strong, local wine. Worth the money, but we probably couldn&#8217;t afford to eat here all week.<\/div>\n<div>We enjoyed many hours deep sleep that night!<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTWRvdeu5I\/AAAAAAAAEQI\/qIuRXH-vzUM\/s400\/IMG_1440.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;width:400px;cursor:pointer;height:300px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTWRvdeu5I\/AAAAAAAAEQI\/qIuRXH-vzUM\/s400\/IMG_1440.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/07\/a-week-in-sicily-part-4-yummy-historic-crazy-stressful-amazing-wet-complicated-and-incorrect\/\">Part four<\/a><\/p>\n",

\u00a0And who&#8217;s flying the planes at that time of morning? \u00a0Weird.<\/li>\n<li>We did lots of looking online too, but trying hard to get an all-in-one package.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div>In the end we booked a Flight\/Car\/Hotel online with Expedia. \u00a0It was a bit above our budget but we really wanted to go to Sicily and had exhausted pretty much all other options.<\/div>\n<div>The package would have been cheaper had we booked with Alitalia, but we found out about their looming bankruptcy and paid over-the-odds to fly British Airways. \u00a0This had other advantages, such as being a direct flight, and departing at the more sensible hour of 8am. \u00a0Thanks to my dad for pointing out Alitalia&#8217;s troubles as we were about to head home and click the &#8220;Buy this holiday&#8221; button!!<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What we got<\/span><\/div>\n<div>A little more detail&#8230;<\/div>\n<div>We flew BA direct to Catania\/Fontarossa Airport on the East Coast of Sicily, then hired a small car, and headed south towards the ancient town of Syracuse.<\/div>\n<div>Our hotel &#8211; the simple, charming, out-in-the-country retreat of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.masseriadegliulivi.com\/\">Masseria Degli Ulivi<\/a> &#8211; was located just outside the nearby town of Noto &#8211; itself a beautiful and historic place worth exploring (and one of the highlights of the holiday, if I might say so).<\/div>\n<div>We were there for a week, driving round, exploring the Eastern side of the island, sampling the food and wine, and relaxing poolside and on the beach.<\/div>\n<div>It was a great, relaxing break.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Highlights<\/span><\/div>\n<div>There will be more about the holiday posted later, but if you don&#8217;t want the detail, here&#8217;s the stuff that you really should know if you want to know what we got up to, or if you fancy a trip to Sicily yourself.<\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.masseriadegliulivi.com\/\">The Hotel<\/a>, mentioned above, is a great place to chill out and explore the island &#8211; just watch out for the naughty puppy on site!<\/li>\n<li>Sicily is a very rural and traditional place &#8211; at least, the Eastern Coast is. \u00a0This means that everything shuts from about noon until about 4pm. \u00a0So MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A LUNCH PLAN. \u00a0I had a very stressful day driving around trying to find lunch with only a minimal grasp of the language. \u00a0It was not fun.<\/li>\n<li>In fact, the hotel didn&#8217;t offer lunch, so we were out and about most days. \u00a0The best way is to find a grocery or supermarket and get some supplies and make your own lunch. \u00a0Milano Salami is fantastic! \u00a0Don&#8217;t go for the sliced bread&#8230;yuk!<\/li>\n<li>We borrowed a Sat Nav system with European mapping from a friend. \u00a0This was hugely helpful and saved us hours of time, lots of faff, and probably lots of arguments too. \u00a0But, as always, use wisely! \u00a0They do get funny ideas about where to go sometimes. \u00a0If you think you need to stick to the main road, then sitck to it!<\/li>\n<li>Sicilians are lunatic drivers with little regard for the road. \u00a0Pay attention, drive with confidence, and give them a wide berth and you&#8217;ll a)\u00a0be fine b) witness some crazy overtaking and turning first hand!<\/li>\n<li>Driving on the continent for the first time wasn&#8217;t so hard, though turning at junctions was often confusing. \u00a0Having the car layout the other way around was probably more taxing for my head than the driving.<\/li>\n<li>Things that must be done: \u00a01) Climb Mt Etna (more detail on this later) 2) Visit Pantalica 3) Explore Syracuse on foot<\/li>\n<li>Food is generally good to excellent and you get what you pay for. \u00a0Coffee is awesome! \u00a0Local wine is also pretty incredible, but watch out &#8211; it&#8217;s strong too!<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t take any kangaroos with you. \u00a0 You&#8217;ll have to read on to find out why! \ud83d\ude09<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/05\/a-week-in-sicily-part-2-travel\/\">Read part two<\/a><\/div>\n",

\u00a0And who&#8217;s flying the planes at that time of morning? \u00a0Weird.<\/li>\n<li>We did lots of looking online too, but trying hard to get an all-in-one package.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div>In the end we booked a Flight\/Car\/Hotel online with Expedia. \u00a0It was a bit above our budget but we really wanted to go to Sicily and had exhausted pretty much all other options.<\/div>\n<div>The package would have been cheaper had we booked with Alitalia, but we found out about their looming bankruptcy and paid over-the-odds to fly British Airways. \u00a0This had other advantages, such as being a direct flight, and departing at the more sensible hour of 8am. \u00a0Thanks to my dad for pointing out Alitalia&#8217;s troubles as we were about to head home and click the &#8220;Buy this holiday&#8221; button!!<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What we got<\/span><\/div>\n<div>A little more detail&#8230;<\/div>\n<div>We flew BA direct to Catania\/Fontarossa Airport on the East Coast of Sicily, then hired a small car, and headed south towards the ancient town of Syracuse.<\/div>\n<div>Our hotel &#8211; the simple, charming, out-in-the-country retreat of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.masseriadegliulivi.com\/\">Masseria Degli Ulivi<\/a> &#8211; was located just outside the nearby town of Noto &#8211; itself a beautiful and historic place worth exploring (and one of the highlights of the holiday, if I might say so).<\/div>\n<div>We were there for a week, driving round, exploring the Eastern side of the island, sampling the food and wine, and relaxing poolside and on the beach.<\/div>\n<div>It was a great, relaxing break.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Highlights<\/span><\/div>\n<div>There will be more about the holiday posted later, but if you don&#8217;t want the detail, here&#8217;s the stuff that you really should know if you want to know what we got up to, or if you fancy a trip to Sicily yourself.<\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.masseriadegliulivi.com\/\">The Hotel<\/a>, mentioned above, is a great place to chill out and explore the island &#8211; just watch out for the naughty puppy on site!<\/li>\n<li>Sicily is a very rural and traditional place &#8211; at least, the Eastern Coast is. \u00a0This means that everything shuts from about noon until about 4pm. \u00a0So MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A LUNCH PLAN. \u00a0I had a very stressful day driving around trying to find lunch with only a minimal grasp of the language. \u00a0It was not fun.<\/li>\n<li>In fact, the hotel didn&#8217;t offer lunch, so we were out and about most days. \u00a0The best way is to find a grocery or supermarket and get some supplies and make your own lunch. \u00a0Milano Salami is fantastic! \u00a0Don&#8217;t go for the sliced bread&#8230;yuk!<\/li>\n<li>We borrowed a Sat Nav system with European mapping from a friend. \u00a0This was hugely helpful and saved us hours of time, lots of faff, and probably lots of arguments too. \u00a0But, as always, use wisely! \u00a0They do get funny ideas about where to go sometimes. \u00a0If you think you need to stick to the main road, then sitck to it!<\/li>\n<li>Sicilians are lunatic drivers with little regard for the road. \u00a0Pay attention, drive with confidence, and give them a wide berth and you&#8217;ll a)\u00a0be fine b) witness some crazy overtaking and turning first hand!<\/li>\n<li>Driving on the continent for the first time wasn&#8217;t so hard, though turning at junctions was often confusing. \u00a0Having the car layout the other way around was probably more taxing for my head than the driving.<\/li>\n<li>Things that must be done: \u00a01) Climb Mt Etna (more detail on this later) 2) Visit Pantalica 3) Explore Syracuse on foot<\/li>\n<li>Food is generally good to excellent and you get what you pay for. \u00a0Coffee is awesome! \u00a0Local wine is also pretty incredible, but watch out &#8211; it&#8217;s strong too!<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t take any kangaroos with you. \u00a0 You&#8217;ll have to read on to find out why! \ud83d\ude09<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/05\/a-week-in-sicily-part-2-travel\/\">Read part two<\/a><\/div>\n",

No. \u00a0So let&#8217;s do some work on balancing that out.<\/li>\n<li>Is my saddle straight? \u00a0Yes, and it&#8217;s at a good height too. \u00a0But I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m sat on it straight. \u00a0Maybe I sag to one side a little? \u00a0Have to think about my position there too.<\/li>\n<li>What about my feet? \u00a0Well, my cleats (the clips on the bottom of cycling shoes that clip into &#8220;clipless&#8221; pedals), weren&#8217;t in the same position on both feet &#8211; so I&#8217;ve adjusted them, and replaced the cleats at the same time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Will all this make a difference? \u00a0It&#8217;s hard to say right now as I&#8217;ve not done a longer ride for a while. \u00a0It will be interesting to see how things are now.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Of course, in the background the stretching and strength work that I don&#8217;t do enough of will have to continue too, and as the nights draw in perhaps I&#8217;ll get more opportunity to do that. \u00a0Then, come next spring, I&#8217;ll be REALLY fit and ready to go!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Maybe.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

No. \u00a0So let&#8217;s do some work on balancing that out.<\/li>\n<li>Is my saddle straight? \u00a0Yes, and it&#8217;s at a good height too. \u00a0But I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m sat on it straight. \u00a0Maybe I sag to one side a little? \u00a0Have to think about my position there too.<\/li>\n<li>What about my feet? \u00a0Well, my cleats (the clips on the bottom of cycling shoes that clip into &#8220;clipless&#8221; pedals), weren&#8217;t in the same position on both feet &#8211; so I&#8217;ve adjusted them, and replaced the cleats at the same time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Will all this make a difference? \u00a0It&#8217;s hard to say right now as I&#8217;ve not done a longer ride for a while. \u00a0It will be interesting to see how things are now.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Of course, in the background the stretching and strength work that I don&#8217;t do enough of will have to continue too, and as the nights draw in perhaps I&#8217;ll get more opportunity to do that. \u00a0Then, come next spring, I&#8217;ll be REALLY fit and ready to go!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Maybe.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",
