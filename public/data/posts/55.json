I&#8217;ve understood HOW it works and WHAT is does for a while, but it&#8217;s taken a simple, real-world example to pull it all together and make it all &#8220;stick&#8221;.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I may still have all this wrong, in which case correct me in the comments. I also note that while Laravel is opinionated, sometimes there&#8217;s many ways to do a particular job, so this may not be the only way to solve my problem.<\/p>\n<p>Also, while I&#8217;m pre-ambling, I find myself talking to quite a lot of WordPress developers about the benefits of Laravel so I&#8217;m thinking of doing a couple of screencasts introducing the differences and benefits. If this is of interest leave a note in the comments. If there&#8217;s demand I&#8217;ll record some &#8220;Laravel for WordPressers&#8221; tutorials and let you know when they&#8217;re up.<\/p>\n<h3>Example: Application stats<\/h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s my simple example that I think fits really well. I have a really simple side-project application that has users and actions, and a relationship between the two: every action has a user, and every user has zero or more actions.<\/p>\n<p>I want to display in this application some statistics about how many actions have been taken by all users over different time periods.<\/p>\n<p>This is really simple data to get in Laravel:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$dayCount = App\\Action::whereDate( Carbon\\Carbon::now()-&gt;toDateString() )-&gt;count();\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>But I wanted to wrap this up into a class so that I could write:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$dayCount = App\\Stats-&gt;dayCount;\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>and so that I could implement any caching that might be necessary to improve performance.<\/p>\n<p>But where should I put this code within Laravel? And how do I load it and make it available when I need it?<\/p>\n<p>The service container is the answer.<\/p>\n<h3>Where do I put the stats code?<\/h3>\n<p>The answer is, it doesn&#8217;t really matter all that much. I chose to just create a class in <code>\/app<\/code>\u00a0and in the <code>\\App<\/code>\u00a0namespace, so I have, in the file <code>app\/stats.php<\/code>:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n&lt;?php\r\n\r\nnamespace App;\r\n\r\nuse App\\Action;\r\nuse Carbon\\Carbon;\r\n\r\nclass Stats\r\n{\r\n\r\n  \/* Code *\/\r\n\r\n}\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>And then a bunch of simple methods and properties that do all the calculations and store the results. I use the constructor of this class to run all the queries and populate the class properties with the counts. Simple.<\/p>\n<h3>How do I load the code?<\/h3>\n<p>This is the weird bit, particularly for a developer who&#8217;s so deep in WordPress and so used to just <code>require<\/code>ing everything I need. \u00a0Laravel doesn&#8217;t have a <code>require<\/code>\u00a0in sight. It&#8217;s using the composer autoloader to load PHP files and the service providers\/container to create instances of classes when needed.<\/p>\n<p>So this is where the service container comes in. The service container is Laravel&#8217;s way of loading stuff like this into the application and making it available.<\/p>\n<p>You can think of the application as just a bunch of services. When you need a service you grab it from the container. \u00a0Most Laravel code is using services all the time without you knowing it. It hides the details of what&#8217;s going on behind facades and helper functions. Auth, cookies, sessions, mail, caching and views are all provided by Laravel services. For example, when setting a session you might use the <code>session()<\/code>\u00a0helper function, like this:<\/p>\n<p><code>session()-&gt;get( 'savedData' );<\/code><\/p>\n<p>This is just getting you a (or the) session object from the service container and running the get method of it.<\/p>\n<p>But how do services get into the container?<\/p>\n<p>Well, you create a service provider, or add it to an existing service provider.<\/p>\n<p>A service provider is a simple class that has two methods.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>register()<\/code>, which places the service into the container by registering it and;<\/li>\n<li><code>boot()<\/code>, which is called after all services are registered and allows you do do some initialisation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>My stats class needs the application to be set up before it runs the calculation so I&#8217;m registering it in the <code>boot()<\/code> method, like this:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\npublic function boot()\r\n    {\r\n        $this-&gt;app-&gt;singleton( Stats::class, function () {\r\n            return new Stats();\r\n        });\r\n\r\n    }\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>And I&#8217;m registering it as a singleton so that there&#8217;s only ever one instance as the class will instantiate once and then just be referred to. (Question: Is this any better than making things static?)<\/p>\n<p>I then need to register the service provider in <code>config\/app.php<\/code>, which is easy; just add this to the list of providers:<\/p>\n<p><code>App\\Providers\\StatsServiceProvider::class,<\/code><\/p>\n<p>So we now have the class, we&#8217;ve created the service provider to shove it into the service container for later use, and we&#8217;ve registered the service provider with Laravel. Laravel starts up, knows about the service provider, runs <code>register()<\/code>, which does nothing, and later runs <code>boot()<\/code>\u00a0which instantiates the class instance and puts it into the service container for when it&#8217;s needed.<\/p>\n<p>Nice.<\/p>\n<p>I can then access the class whenever I need, either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>explicitly from the container (which is the <code>App<\/code> class) by using <code>App::make( 'App\\Stats' )<\/code><\/li>\n<li>explicitly using the <code>app()<\/code>\u00a0helper: <code>app( 'App\\Stats' )<\/code><\/li>\n<li>using dependency injection through type hinting (or so I believe, I&#8217;ve not tried this out!)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In my case, I actually want the stats to appear in pretty much every view that I load, and there&#8217;s a shortcut for that, which is to &#8220;share&#8221; the data with the views by adding this to the <code>boot()<\/code>\u00a0method of the service provider:<\/p>\n<p><code>View::share('stats', app('App\\Stats'));<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Every view (or a component of every view) can then have access to the stats without me having to explicitly make the stats available in every controller method. \u00a0So my blade templates can just do:<\/p>\n<p><code>&lt;strong&gt;Today:&lt;\/strong&gt; {{ $stats-&gt;dayCount }}<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Neat! (But use wisely)<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>Hopefully I did all this right and explained it well.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, this is a very simple example and perhaps the service container is overkill for loading this class. But I think it&#8217;s a simple and real enough example that it helps us see how to add this kind of generic, re-usable functionality into our app.<\/p>\n<p>I certainly understand the service container better having done this. Hopefully you will too.<\/p>\n<p>For greater completness, most of the code files involved are shown in <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/428ae8a3e0c215a7b3ecbfd186b5520c\">this Gist<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>I finally feel like I&#8217;m getting to grips with Laravel&#8217;s service container. I&#8217;ve understood HOW it works and WHAT is does for a while, but it&#8217;s taken a simple, real-world example to pull it all together and make it all &#8220;stick&#8221;.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I may still have all this wrong, in which case correct me in the comments. I also note that while Laravel is opinionated, sometimes there&#8217;s many ways to do a particular job, so this may not be the only way to solve my problem.<\/p>\n<p>Also, while I&#8217;m pre-ambling, I find myself talking to quite a lot of WordPress developers about the benefits of Laravel so I&#8217;m thinking of doing a couple of screencasts introducing the differences and benefits. If this is of interest leave a note in the comments. If there&#8217;s demand I&#8217;ll record some &#8220;Laravel for WordPressers&#8221; tutorials and let you know when they&#8217;re up.<\/p>\n<h3>Example: Application stats<\/h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s my simple example that I think fits really well. I have a really simple side-project application that has users and actions, and a relationship between the two: every action has a user, and every user has zero or more actions.<\/p>\n<p>I want to display in this application some statistics about how many actions have been taken by all users over different time periods.<\/p>\n<p>This is really simple data to get in Laravel:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$dayCount = App\\Action::whereDate( Carbon\\Carbon::now()-&gt;toDateString() )-&gt;count();\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>But I wanted to wrap this up into a class so that I could write:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$dayCount = App\\Stats-&gt;dayCount;\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>and so that I could implement any caching that might be necessary to improve performance.<\/p>\n<p>But where should I put this code within Laravel? And how do I load it and make it available when I need it?<\/p>\n<p>The service container is the answer.<\/p>\n<h3>Where do I put the stats code?<\/h3>\n<p>The answer is, it doesn&#8217;t really matter all that much. I chose to just create a class in <code>\/app<\/code>\u00a0and in the <code>\\App<\/code>\u00a0namespace, so I have, in the file <code>app\/stats.php<\/code>:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n&lt;?php\r\n\r\nnamespace App;\r\n\r\nuse App\\Action;\r\nuse Carbon\\Carbon;\r\n\r\nclass Stats\r\n{\r\n\r\n  \/* Code *\/\r\n\r\n}\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>And then a bunch of simple methods and properties that do all the calculations and store the results. I use the constructor of this class to run all the queries and populate the class properties with the counts. Simple.<\/p>\n<h3>How do I load the code?<\/h3>\n<p>This is the weird bit, particularly for a developer who&#8217;s so deep in WordPress and so used to just <code>require<\/code>ing everything I need. \u00a0Laravel doesn&#8217;t have a <code>require<\/code>\u00a0in sight. It&#8217;s using the composer autoloader to load PHP files and the service providers\/container to create instances of classes when needed.<\/p>\n<p>So this is where the service container comes in. The service container is Laravel&#8217;s way of loading stuff like this into the application and making it available.<\/p>\n<p>You can think of the application as just a bunch of services. When you need a service you grab it from the container. \u00a0Most Laravel code is using services all the time without you knowing it. It hides the details of what&#8217;s going on behind facades and helper functions. Auth, cookies, sessions, mail, caching and views are all provided by Laravel services. For example, when setting a session you might use the <code>session()<\/code>\u00a0helper function, like this:<\/p>\n<p><code>session()-&gt;get( 'savedData' );<\/code><\/p>\n<p>This is just getting you a (or the) session object from the service container and running the get method of it.<\/p>\n<p>But how do services get into the container?<\/p>\n<p>Well, you create a service provider, or add it to an existing service provider.<\/p>\n<p>A service provider is a simple class that has two methods.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>register()<\/code>, which places the service into the container by registering it and;<\/li>\n<li><code>boot()<\/code>, which is called after all services are registered and allows you do do some initialisation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>My stats class needs the application to be set up before it runs the calculation so I&#8217;m registering it in the <code>boot()<\/code> method, like this:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\npublic function boot()\r\n    {\r\n        $this-&gt;app-&gt;singleton( Stats::class, function () {\r\n            return new Stats();\r\n        });\r\n\r\n    }\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>And I&#8217;m registering it as a singleton so that there&#8217;s only ever one instance as the class will instantiate once and then just be referred to. (Question: Is this any better than making things static?)<\/p>\n<p>I then need to register the service provider in <code>config\/app.php<\/code>, which is easy; just add this to the list of providers:<\/p>\n<p><code>App\\Providers\\StatsServiceProvider::class,<\/code><\/p>\n<p>So we now have the class, we&#8217;ve created the service provider to shove it into the service container for later use, and we&#8217;ve registered the service provider with Laravel. Laravel starts up, knows about the service provider, runs <code>register()<\/code>, which does nothing, and later runs <code>boot()<\/code>\u00a0which instantiates the class instance and puts it into the service container for when it&#8217;s needed.<\/p>\n<p>Nice.<\/p>\n<p>I can then access the class whenever I need, either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>explicitly from the container (which is the <code>App<\/code> class) by using <code>App::make( 'App\\Stats' )<\/code><\/li>\n<li>explicitly using the <code>app()<\/code>\u00a0helper: <code>app( 'App\\Stats' )<\/code><\/li>\n<li>using dependency injection through type hinting (or so I believe, I&#8217;ve not tried this out!)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In my case, I actually want the stats to appear in pretty much every view that I load, and there&#8217;s a shortcut for that, which is to &#8220;share&#8221; the data with the views by adding this to the <code>boot()<\/code>\u00a0method of the service provider:<\/p>\n<p><code>View::share('stats', app('App\\Stats'));<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Every view (or a component of every view) can then have access to the stats without me having to explicitly make the stats available in every controller method. \u00a0So my blade templates can just do:<\/p>\n<p><code>&lt;strong&gt;Today:&lt;\/strong&gt; {{ $stats-&gt;dayCount }}<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Neat! (But use wisely)<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>Hopefully I did all this right and explained it well.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, this is a very simple example and perhaps the service container is overkill for loading this class. But I think it&#8217;s a simple and real enough example that it helps us see how to add this kind of generic, re-usable functionality into our app.<\/p>\n<p>I certainly understand the service container better having done this. Hopefully you will too.<\/p>\n<p>For greater completness, most of the code files involved are shown in <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/428ae8a3e0c215a7b3ecbfd186b5520c\">this Gist<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

I saw you from afar and had resolved to cheer you on. At first I wasn&#8217;t sure if you were a man, because of your curly hair, but you were. A dad on a pink scooter, chasing down a young girl, also on her scooter, in a way that feigned that you were trying hard, but you were clearly letting her win.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been thinking, in the previous few days, about how you don&#8217;t see parents, and especially dads, playing in public with their children much.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been wondering why it was that when groups of parents and children gather, children somehow gravitate to me and talk to me.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;d been realising that it&#8217;s because I play. I kneel. I ask. With children. In public.<\/p>\n<p>And this, to my great sadness, is unusual.<\/p>\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m a bit of a show off. And in later years I&#8217;ll be hugely embarrassing. <\/p>\n<p>But I want to talk to my children when we&#8217;re out and about. And I want to make everyday activities fun. And I want to explore and laugh.<\/p>\n<p>I feel weird because most children seem to be left to play by themselves in public. Or strapped in a buggy and ignored.<\/p>\n<p>So when I saw you: a grown man, on a three-wheeled, pink, Barbie scooter; in public; clearly having fun with your daughter (?); unashamed; and clearly enjoying yourself too, yes, I cheered you on.<\/p>\n<p>I admired and respected your attitude. And I wanted to encourage it. It was a beautiful thing to see and it made me smile.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sorry if you thought I was weird.<\/p>\n<p>Race sometime?<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2666\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/2013-06-16-18.01.31.jpg\" alt=\"2013-06-16 18.01.31\" width=\"3264\" height=\"3264\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/2013-06-16-18.01.31.jpg 3264w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/2013-06-16-18.01.31-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/2013-06-16-18.01.31-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/2013-06-16-18.01.31-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/2013-06-16-18.01.31-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/2013-06-16-18.01.31-945x945.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/2013-06-16-18.01.31-600x600.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px\" \/><\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>You probably thought I was a bit funny. I mean, you were the adult man on the pink, three-wheeled Barbie scooter, but *you* probably wondered what *I* was doing.<\/p>\n<p>I was in my car. I saw you from afar and had resolved to cheer you on. At first I wasn&#8217;t sure if you were a man, because of your curly hair, but you were. A dad on a pink scooter, chasing down a young girl, also on her scooter, in a way that feigned that you were trying hard, but you were clearly letting her win.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been thinking, in the previous few days, about how you don&#8217;t see parents, and especially dads, playing in public with their children much.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been wondering why it was that when groups of parents and children gather, children somehow gravitate to me and talk to me.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;d been realising that it&#8217;s because I play. I kneel. I ask. With children. In public.<\/p>\n<p>And this, to my great sadness, is unusual.<\/p>\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m a bit of a show off. And in later years I&#8217;ll be hugely embarrassing. <\/p>\n<p>But I want to talk to my children when we&#8217;re out and about. And I want to make everyday activities fun. And I want to explore and laugh.<\/p>\n<p>I feel weird because most children seem to be left to play by themselves in public. Or strapped in a buggy and ignored.<\/p>\n<p>So when I saw you: a grown man, on a three-wheeled, pink, Barbie scooter; in public; clearly having fun with your daughter (?); unashamed; and clearly enjoying yourself too, yes, I cheered you on.<\/p>\n<p>I admired and respected your attitude. And I wanted to encourage it. It was a beautiful thing to see and it made me smile.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sorry if you thought I was weird.<\/p>\n<p>Race sometime?<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2666\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/2013-06-16-18.01.31.jpg\" alt=\"2013-06-16 18.01.31\" width=\"3264\" height=\"3264\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/2013-06-16-18.01.31.jpg 3264w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/2013-06-16-18.01.31-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/2013-06-16-18.01.31-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/2013-06-16-18.01.31-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/2013-06-16-18.01.31-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/2013-06-16-18.01.31-945x945.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/2013-06-16-18.01.31-600x600.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px\" \/><\/p>\n",

But the system also hopes to inspire by offering you different sorts of creative action to take. \u00a0If you&#8217;re a maker why not try writing? Or perhaps you&#8217;re good at giving, but find it hard to practically help others? There&#8217;s always a nudge to do something different.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2699\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2699\" style=\"width: 676px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2699 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/today-i-action-types-1024x475.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"314\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/today-i-action-types-1024x475.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/today-i-action-types-300x139.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/today-i-action-types-768x357.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/today-i-action-types-945x439.png 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/today-i-action-types-600x279.png 600w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/today-i-action-types.png 1680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2699\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The &#8220;Today I&#8221; action form<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I hate online marketing speak, but I&#8217;m hoping you&#8217;ll join me: <a href=\"https:\/\/today-i.com\/register\">Sign up and get started now<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Perhaps you have some questions about why this thing exists or is what it is. Well, here&#8217;s some background.<\/p>\n<h3>The story behind &#8220;Today I&#8230;&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p>A good long while ago, a friend of mine convinced me that I was creative when previously I had flat out denied it. This has been a profound change in my life. \u00a0I&#8217;ve come to see that creativity is part of being human, and that though the word &#8220;creative&#8221; is often applied to visual media, it&#8217;s far, far broader.<\/p>\n<p>Last year I gave a 10 minute &#8220;Lightning talk&#8221; at a conference in Brighton about this which, if you have time, you can watch below.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/videopress.com\/embed\/x6vaH1Tn?hd=0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><script src='https:\/\/v0.wordpress.com\/js\/next\/videopress-iframe.js?m=1435166243'><\/script><\/p>\n<p>Another person I know used to have a small community of people who posted to social media every day with something they were thankful for using the hashtag &#8220;#thankyoutoday&#8221;. \u00a0I loved this idea and still go through phases of trying to continue this as a tradition.<\/p>\n<p>After the &#8220;You are creative&#8221; talk, I combined these two ideas &#8211; discovering a broader creativity, and a daily habit of remembering &#8211; and I started Tweeting under the hashtag &#8220;#TodayIMade&#8221; in an attempt to recognise my own daily creativity.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Today I&#8230;&#8221; is an extension of that idea.<\/p>\n<h3>But, it&#8217;s hardly a complicated thing?<\/h3>\n<p>Well, yeah. At the moment &#8220;Today I&#8230;&#8221; doesn&#8217;t do much. It&#8217;s very simple. Technically a daily log like this is quite easy to make. Go make your own if you want to!<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s also, I hope, well thought out. I&#8217;ve tried to make it as easy to use as possible, and there are plans to make it even easier and better. But it&#8217;s reached &#8220;good enough&#8221;, and I&#8217;m hoping some people will try it out.<\/p>\n<p>I also hope I can make it fun, by adding quotes, inspiration, and an encouraging tone of voice into the reminder emails. \u00a0They may even suggest different sorts of actions based on your history. And I may add some clever post-to-social-media functions too.<\/p>\n<h3>It&#8217;s broken\/annoying\/doesn&#8217;t work&#8230;help!<\/h3>\n<p>It needs some kind of help contact for sure. I&#8217;ll add that when I&#8217;ve worked out the best way to do it that doesn&#8217;t involve my inbox being flooded with spam. \u00a0But you can always contact me here in the comments or using my contact form. Or you can Tweet &#8211; if that&#8217;s your thing &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/today_i_team\">@today_i_team<\/a>\u00a0where I&#8217;ll also make product announcements.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also happy to take suggestions for improvement and ideas for new types of creative action if you think a blue button is missing!<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for reading and taking part&#8230;if you do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Now let&#8217;s go make stuff!<\/strong><\/p>\n",

What will you do today?<\/h2>\n<p>In a world that seems to have gone mad recently, creativity has become more important than ever. Not just &#8220;arts&#8221;, but making, doing, sharing, writing, hacking, teaching, growing, mending and so many other things are creative endeavours.<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s sometimes hard to recognise your creativity. It&#8217;s easy to get stuck in a creative rut. We need inspiration and encouragement.<\/p>\n<h3>Welcome to Today I&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>So today, I&#8217;m opening to you my latest side-project: &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/today-i.com\">Today I&#8230;<\/a>&#8220;. \u00a0It&#8217;s really simple: you register, and every day you are encouraged &#8211; by a daily reminder email &#8211; to record your creativity for the day. \u00a0The log is private to you (well, I as the site owner can access it, but I promise to only do this if I really need to), and the whole thing has been made as simple as possible.<\/p>\n<p>The email is a nudge to be creative and to record your creativity. But the system also hopes to inspire by offering you different sorts of creative action to take. \u00a0If you&#8217;re a maker why not try writing? Or perhaps you&#8217;re good at giving, but find it hard to practically help others? There&#8217;s always a nudge to do something different.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2699\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2699\" style=\"width: 676px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2699 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/today-i-action-types-1024x475.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"314\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/today-i-action-types-1024x475.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/today-i-action-types-300x139.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/today-i-action-types-768x357.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/today-i-action-types-945x439.png 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/today-i-action-types-600x279.png 600w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/today-i-action-types.png 1680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2699\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The &#8220;Today I&#8221; action form<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I hate online marketing speak, but I&#8217;m hoping you&#8217;ll join me: <a href=\"https:\/\/today-i.com\/register\">Sign up and get started now<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Perhaps you have some questions about why this thing exists or is what it is. Well, here&#8217;s some background.<\/p>\n<h3>The story behind &#8220;Today I&#8230;&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p>A good long while ago, a friend of mine convinced me that I was creative when previously I had flat out denied it. This has been a profound change in my life. \u00a0I&#8217;ve come to see that creativity is part of being human, and that though the word &#8220;creative&#8221; is often applied to visual media, it&#8217;s far, far broader.<\/p>\n<p>Last year I gave a 10 minute &#8220;Lightning talk&#8221; at a conference in Brighton about this which, if you have time, you can watch below.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/videopress.com\/embed\/x6vaH1Tn?hd=0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen><\/iframe><script src='https:\/\/v0.wordpress.com\/js\/next\/videopress-iframe.js?m=1435166243'><\/script><\/p>\n<p>Another person I know used to have a small community of people who posted to social media every day with something they were thankful for using the hashtag &#8220;#thankyoutoday&#8221;. \u00a0I loved this idea and still go through phases of trying to continue this as a tradition.<\/p>\n<p>After the &#8220;You are creative&#8221; talk, I combined these two ideas &#8211; discovering a broader creativity, and a daily habit of remembering &#8211; and I started Tweeting under the hashtag &#8220;#TodayIMade&#8221; in an attempt to recognise my own daily creativity.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Today I&#8230;&#8221; is an extension of that idea.<\/p>\n<h3>But, it&#8217;s hardly a complicated thing?<\/h3>\n<p>Well, yeah. At the moment &#8220;Today I&#8230;&#8221; doesn&#8217;t do much. It&#8217;s very simple. Technically a daily log like this is quite easy to make. Go make your own if you want to!<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s also, I hope, well thought out. I&#8217;ve tried to make it as easy to use as possible, and there are plans to make it even easier and better. But it&#8217;s reached &#8220;good enough&#8221;, and I&#8217;m hoping some people will try it out.<\/p>\n<p>I also hope I can make it fun, by adding quotes, inspiration, and an encouraging tone of voice into the reminder emails. \u00a0They may even suggest different sorts of actions based on your history. And I may add some clever post-to-social-media functions too.<\/p>\n<h3>It&#8217;s broken\/annoying\/doesn&#8217;t work&#8230;help!<\/h3>\n<p>It needs some kind of help contact for sure. I&#8217;ll add that when I&#8217;ve worked out the best way to do it that doesn&#8217;t involve my inbox being flooded with spam. \u00a0But you can always contact me here in the comments or using my contact form. Or you can Tweet &#8211; if that&#8217;s your thing &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/today_i_team\">@today_i_team<\/a>\u00a0where I&#8217;ll also make product announcements.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also happy to take suggestions for improvement and ideas for new types of creative action if you think a blue button is missing!<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for reading and taking part&#8230;if you do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Now let&#8217;s go make stuff!<\/strong><\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s fascinating.<\/p>\n<p>The other day I was in a meeting, and one person in the meeting is known to have difficulty hearing. \u00a0So one of the people leading the meeting suggested that it would be helpful for this person if only person spoke at a time.<\/p>\n<p>And I couldn&#8217;t help but think: wouldn&#8217;t it be helpful for <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">everyone<\/span> if only one person spoke at a time?<\/p>\n<p>Accessibility: it&#8217;s good for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>(With apologies to the meeting leader &#8211; who shall remain anonymous&#8230;I hope you don&#8217;t mind me sharing a simple, practical example of an important lesson that I&#8217;ve been learning)<\/p>\n",
