But it's an option if you want it.\n\n\/\/ A quicker way is to search the settings.

And I really like the short-form format of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have two kids though, and no dedicated space at home to make recordings like that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can&#8217;t do it as part of my day job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I figured I&#8217;d try a silent video format!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Why not a blog post, Ross?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I hear that too. And the answer is that I want to SHOW you things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure this format isn&#8217;t perfect. It may not be any good at all. But I might try it for a bit and see what happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m aiming for relatively light touch. Little editing &#8211; you will see my mistakes!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I encourage questions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>What&#8217;s your editor?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What&#8217;s that icon in your menu bar?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Why Light Mode?i<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps we can answer some of these questions as we go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow &#8211; or whenever I get time &#8211; I&#8217;ll get back to PHP and objects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t quite finished.<\/p>\n",

You may not notice much, but when you open the palette now you have even more super powers than before!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A faster basic command palette; better content search; WooCommerce searching; access to plugins and users; Gravity Forms integration; and a more polished experience overall. It&#8217;s more useful than ever and I hope you love it!!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/try.html\">Try the extension for free<\/a> and buy it (it&#8217;s a one-time, $35 purchase!) at <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Let&#8217;s talk history<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s be honest &#8211; I made Turbo Admin for me. But I love sharing it with others too and I love that I have a dedicated, happy squad of users who have helped me spread the word and get it to others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally it was a command palette plugin. Then I realised it could be a browser extension too. Then I realised I could do other things with it &#8211; hide notices, clean up the admin bar, close annoying pop-ups automatically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I got distracted from the main mission of Turbo Admin: making the WordPress Dashboard fast and keyboard-driven so that you can navigate quicker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turbo Admin did get content search, but it was limited. And it was kind-of modular under the hood in the code, but not modular enough. It risked becoming difficult to manage and add things to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, with it was with renewed focus on navigation, search, performance and stability that I started a major upgrade. And now it&#8217;s hear for you to experience &#8211; in the browser extension at least. The plugin will be getting an update sometime next year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s changed?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Basic search<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you first open the Turbo Admin command palette you won&#8217;t see much different. It looks&#8230; identical? Perhaps a tiny spacing change or two.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Searching your WordPress dashboard&#8217;s menu items should be much faster. I&#8217;ve put a lot of time into polishing the experience, but also, it&#8217;s not searching for content every time you type!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, this is a change from how it worked before. If you use the content search you&#8217;re going to need to re-train your brain a bit. But, trust me, it&#8217;s for the better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve improved error handling and reporting too so you should now get help in those tricky edge-case scenarios where Turbo Admin used to just stop working properly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basic search should now be super fast and reliable. And it still give you access to your admin menu items on the front-end of your site as well as the back-end in the Dashboard!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Content search \/ search modes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to search content now you need to enter a &#8220;search mode&#8221;. To do this you type a &#8220;keyword&#8221; and press tab (or you can use a colon). Search modes will reveal themselves with a little notice too to help you.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-19.46.58@2x-1024x282.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11506\" width=\"580\" height=\"160\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-19.46.58@2x-1024x282.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-19.46.58@2x-300x83.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-19.46.58@2x-768x212.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-19.46.58@2x.png 1292w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Turbo Admin&#8217;s search mode hints: Look!

So you can search within an individual post type.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use the keywords <code>find<\/code> and <code>search<\/code> to search all post types.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you somehow already know the numeric ID of the post you want to navigate to then you can use the keyword <code>id<\/code> to go straight to it super-quick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">User search<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you need to edit a user and you shouldn&#8217;t have to leave your keyboard to do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can use the <code>user<\/code> keyword to search your users from anywhere in your dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re already thinking about how this is useful in WooCommerce stores you are jumping ahead. Be patient!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Plugin search<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is actually an embryonic feature that will improve with time. Currently you can just search for plugins installed on a site using the <code>plugin<\/code> keyword. Selecting a plugin will show that plugin on the plugins page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in future I hope to add sub-menu items in the command palette to update, activate, deactivate and delete plugins. Maybe even a repository search and the ability to install plugins from Turbo Admin too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Multisite site search<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not new but is now improved and accessed using the <code>site<\/code> keyword. And selecting a site gives you a sub-menu with different places you can go to:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.06.22@2x-1024x549.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11510\" width=\"512\" height=\"275\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.06.22@2x-1024x549.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.06.22@2x-300x161.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.06.22@2x-768x412.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.06.22@2x.png 1306w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A multisite site&#8217;s sub menu<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WooCommerce customer and order search<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OK. This, I think, is the big one! The <code>customer<\/code> and <code>order<\/code> keywords should do exactly what you expect, using the WooCommerce search to find orders and customers. And you can do it from anywhere on your site. Even the front-end!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/782134331?h=877db1e000&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"339\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As a bonus, using <code>order &lt;id><\/code> will find just that order ID and is generally quicker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you have a WooCommerce store this is a super feature for customer support teams to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gravity Forms<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For one final integration&#8230; FOR NOW! &#8230; I&#8217;ve added a <code>form<\/code> keyword that searches for Gravity Forms and lets you go direct to editing, entries, and settings for that form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, you can do this from anywhere.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.42.35@2x-1024x609.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11511\" width=\"512\" height=\"305\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.42.35@2x-1024x609.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.42.35@2x-300x178.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.42.35@2x-768x457.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.42.35@2x.png 1302w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Gravity Form sub menu options<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The future of search modes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Search modes are where I really wanted to get to with Turbo Admin.

From then on I&#8217;ll probably see what there is demand for. What would you like to get access to that might have an API that I an tap into.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/instructions.html\">documentation<\/a> has been greatly improved, and it&#8217;s especially detailed around the <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/searching.html\">search modes<\/a> and on <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/instructions.html#troubleshooting\">troubleshooting<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is always work to do here and I hope you&#8217;ll let me know if it&#8217;s not up to scratch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s with the version number<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is version 1.12.0, not version 2.0, despite the big update. Why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well I promised customers that updates to the <em>current major version<\/em> would be free. So I&#8217;m honouring that. This is a minor version bump and so you ALL get it for free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is, technically, a &#8220;breaking&#8221; change with how content search works. So for those who care about such things, this is, arguably, a v2.0.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m sure that won&#8217;t bother ANYONE!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s Next?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, hopefully you like what you hear and, you will head to <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/try.html\">try it for free<\/a> or buy a license (it&#8217;s a one-time, $35 purchase!). If you already have a license, you can support my work by buying another for a friend, or just <a href=\"https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/magicroundabout\">buy me a coffee<\/a> to say thanks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been building these new features since late July &#8211; nearly 5 months. If that sounds like a long time then know that this is NOT a full time gig by any means. I get brief snatches of time here and there to work on it. So progress is slow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m also feeling some of that burnout from having worked on the same things for a while.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to get you these changes as soon as I could. I find them valuable, and I really hope you do to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plan is to have a Christmas break, do a little marketing push in January, and then get back to adding new features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the re-writing of the &#8220;core&#8221; done, I&#8217;m hopeful that adding new things is now easier and quicker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other plans and ideas too. But for now, enjoy this release! Be sure to let me know what you think on <a href=\"https:\/\/fosstodon.org\/@ross\">Mastodon<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/\">Twitter<\/a> (I&#8217;m bearing with it for now) or by <a href=\"mailto:help@turbo-admin.com\">email<\/a>. I LOVE all the feedback I get, and PLEASE report bugs and issues: I can&#8217;t fix them if I don&#8217;t know about them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Special thanks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some people who have been particularly supportive of Turbo Admin. They are my champions and helpers. They test and give feedback. They promote and share like crazy. This is a small project that needs help to get the word out, and I appreciate their support deeply and I want to thank them publicly ?:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/erikteichmann\">Erik Teichmann<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/greg_burnison\">Greg Burnison<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/UaMV\">Joshua (Ua) Vandercar<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/James_Cobbett\">James Cobbett<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/barrd\">Dave Barr<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/courtneyr_dev\/\">Courtney Robertson<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wpbuilds\/\">Nathan Wrigley<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>Turbo Admin &#8211; my browser extension that brings a command palette to all your WordPress dashboards &#8211; has just had a major update. You may not notice much, but when you open the palette now you have even more super powers than before!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A faster basic command palette; better content search; WooCommerce searching; access to plugins and users; Gravity Forms integration; and a more polished experience overall. It&#8217;s more useful than ever and I hope you love it!!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/try.html\">Try the extension for free<\/a> and buy it (it&#8217;s a one-time, $35 purchase!) at <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Let&#8217;s talk history<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s be honest &#8211; I made Turbo Admin for me. But I love sharing it with others too and I love that I have a dedicated, happy squad of users who have helped me spread the word and get it to others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally it was a command palette plugin. Then I realised it could be a browser extension too. Then I realised I could do other things with it &#8211; hide notices, clean up the admin bar, close annoying pop-ups automatically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I got distracted from the main mission of Turbo Admin: making the WordPress Dashboard fast and keyboard-driven so that you can navigate quicker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turbo Admin did get content search, but it was limited. And it was kind-of modular under the hood in the code, but not modular enough. It risked becoming difficult to manage and add things to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, with it was with renewed focus on navigation, search, performance and stability that I started a major upgrade. And now it&#8217;s hear for you to experience &#8211; in the browser extension at least. The plugin will be getting an update sometime next year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s changed?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Basic search<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you first open the Turbo Admin command palette you won&#8217;t see much different. It looks&#8230; identical? Perhaps a tiny spacing change or two.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Searching your WordPress dashboard&#8217;s menu items should be much faster. I&#8217;ve put a lot of time into polishing the experience, but also, it&#8217;s not searching for content every time you type!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, this is a change from how it worked before. If you use the content search you&#8217;re going to need to re-train your brain a bit. But, trust me, it&#8217;s for the better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve improved error handling and reporting too so you should now get help in those tricky edge-case scenarios where Turbo Admin used to just stop working properly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basic search should now be super fast and reliable. And it still give you access to your admin menu items on the front-end of your site as well as the back-end in the Dashboard!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Content search \/ search modes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to search content now you need to enter a &#8220;search mode&#8221;. To do this you type a &#8220;keyword&#8221; and press tab (or you can use a colon). Search modes will reveal themselves with a little notice too to help you.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-19.46.58@2x-1024x282.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11506\" width=\"580\" height=\"160\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-19.46.58@2x-1024x282.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-19.46.58@2x-300x83.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-19.46.58@2x-768x212.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-19.46.58@2x.png 1292w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Turbo Admin&#8217;s search mode hints: Look!

Because it&#8217;s ONLY searching posts it&#8217;s quicker and easier to find what you want.

So you can search within an individual post type.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use the keywords <code>find<\/code> and <code>search<\/code> to search all post types.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you somehow already know the numeric ID of the post you want to navigate to then you can use the keyword <code>id<\/code> to go straight to it super-quick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">User search<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you need to edit a user and you shouldn&#8217;t have to leave your keyboard to do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can use the <code>user<\/code> keyword to search your users from anywhere in your dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re already thinking about how this is useful in WooCommerce stores you are jumping ahead. Be patient!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Plugin search<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is actually an embryonic feature that will improve with time. Currently you can just search for plugins installed on a site using the <code>plugin<\/code> keyword. Selecting a plugin will show that plugin on the plugins page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in future I hope to add sub-menu items in the command palette to update, activate, deactivate and delete plugins. Maybe even a repository search and the ability to install plugins from Turbo Admin too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Multisite site search<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not new but is now improved and accessed using the <code>site<\/code> keyword. And selecting a site gives you a sub-menu with different places you can go to:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.06.22@2x-1024x549.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11510\" width=\"512\" height=\"275\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.06.22@2x-1024x549.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.06.22@2x-300x161.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.06.22@2x-768x412.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.06.22@2x.png 1306w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A multisite site&#8217;s sub menu<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WooCommerce customer and order search<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OK. This, I think, is the big one! The <code>customer<\/code> and <code>order<\/code> keywords should do exactly what you expect, using the WooCommerce search to find orders and customers. And you can do it from anywhere on your site. Even the front-end!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/782134331?h=877db1e000&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"339\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As a bonus, using <code>order &lt;id><\/code> will find just that order ID and is generally quicker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you have a WooCommerce store this is a super feature for customer support teams to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gravity Forms<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For one final integration&#8230; FOR NOW! &#8230; I&#8217;ve added a <code>form<\/code> keyword that searches for Gravity Forms and lets you go direct to editing, entries, and settings for that form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, you can do this from anywhere.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.42.35@2x-1024x609.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11511\" width=\"512\" height=\"305\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.42.35@2x-1024x609.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.42.35@2x-300x178.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.42.35@2x-768x457.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/CleanShot-2022-12-17-at-20.42.35@2x.png 1302w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Gravity Form sub menu options<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The future of search modes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Search modes are where I really wanted to get to with Turbo Admin. This is the dream. And I now have a truly modular architecture that lets me easily add new search modes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that Advanced Customer Fields (ACF) is next on the list, if I can find a way to do it. From then on I&#8217;ll probably see what there is demand for. What would you like to get access to that might have an API that I an tap into.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/instructions.html\">documentation<\/a> has been greatly improved, and it&#8217;s especially detailed around the <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/searching.html\">search modes<\/a> and on <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/instructions.html#troubleshooting\">troubleshooting<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is always work to do here and I hope you&#8217;ll let me know if it&#8217;s not up to scratch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s with the version number<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is version 1.12.0, not version 2.0, despite the big update. Why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well I promised customers that updates to the <em>current major version<\/em> would be free. So I&#8217;m honouring that. This is a minor version bump and so you ALL get it for free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is, technically, a &#8220;breaking&#8221; change with how content search works. So for those who care about such things, this is, arguably, a v2.0.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m sure that won&#8217;t bother ANYONE!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s Next?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, hopefully you like what you hear and, you will head to <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/try.html\">try it for free<\/a> or buy a license (it&#8217;s a one-time, $35 purchase!). If you already have a license, you can support my work by buying another for a friend, or just <a href=\"https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/magicroundabout\">buy me a coffee<\/a> to say thanks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been building these new features since late July &#8211; nearly 5 months. If that sounds like a long time then know that this is NOT a full time gig by any means. I get brief snatches of time here and there to work on it. So progress is slow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m also feeling some of that burnout from having worked on the same things for a while.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to get you these changes as soon as I could. I find them valuable, and I really hope you do to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plan is to have a Christmas break, do a little marketing push in January, and then get back to adding new features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the re-writing of the &#8220;core&#8221; done, I&#8217;m hopeful that adding new things is now easier and quicker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other plans and ideas too. But for now, enjoy this release!

They are my champions and helpers. They test and give feedback. They promote and share like crazy.

And I&#8217;d actually CELEBRATE being able to pay more tax if I knew it was going to front-line workers and not into the grimy hands of already-rich people who milk off the state with their corrupt business schemes.&#8221; ?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a whole thing about how we talk about tax. That tax is bad because it takes from us. We need to turn that around. Being able to pay a lot of tax is a privilege. I get to GIVE from what I earn to pay for OUR nurses, OUR teachers, OUR bin collectors. Let&#8217;s make that GOOD!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1603321062367764481\/analytics\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1603321062367764481\/analytics\"><\/a><\/p>\n",

The lack of investment sucks. The rich getting richer sucks. People need good jobs that pay well. Get what you deserve!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for ministers saying &#8220;we can&#8217;t raise taxes when people are struggling&#8221;: you absolutely can &#8211; tax the people who AREN&#8217;T struggling. Tax the millionaires and billionaires. Tax the corporations making massive profits. There are options here. Do it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might say: &#8220;But Ross, aren&#8217;t you doing OK? You have a good IT job and stuff. What if they come and tax you?&#8221; And I reply: &#8220;Yes! I&#8217;m VERY fortunate and privileged. And I&#8217;d actually CELEBRATE being able to pay more tax if I knew it was going to front-line workers and not into the grimy hands of already-rich people who milk off the state with their corrupt business schemes.&#8221; ?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a whole thing about how we talk about tax. That tax is bad because it takes from us. We need to turn that around. Being able to pay a lot of tax is a privilege. I get to GIVE from what I earn to pay for OUR nurses, OUR teachers, OUR bin collectors. Let&#8217;s make that GOOD!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1603321062367764481\/analytics\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1603321062367764481\/analytics\"><\/a><\/p>\n",

And early on I suggested that &#8220;WordlePress&#8221; should be a thing. So I made something that may fit the name. Here&#8217;s how it works:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress core has over 900 global PHP functions with four underscore-separated &#8220;parts&#8221;, such as `wp_get_attachment_image`. This is a &#8220;function&#8221;, and each of the parts is a &#8220;word&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Aim of the game<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each day (changing at midnight UTC) WordlePress selects a new 4-part function for you to guess. You need to guess all 4 &#8220;words&#8221; correctly to win.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also the option to guess a randomly picked function name from the list to practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you win, or give up, the answer is shown and the documentation for the function is linked. So this is an educational tool too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The function list is from (I think) WordPress 5.9, released in January 2022. If it helps this is just after the first beta of the full-site editing feature was added to core.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to play<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter your word guesses in the four input boxes and click &#8220;Guess&#8221;. The result boxes will tell you how many of them are correct:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A green box means you got the right word in the right position<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>An orange box means you got a word that is in the function, but it&#8217;s in the wrong position<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim is to get all four result boxes to green!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Words and suggestions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\">The game<\/a> helps you by only allowing words from the list of functions to be entered. There are 695 valid words and the game shows you how many you have not guessed with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To further help you, there is a &#8220;Suggest&#8221; button. This will choose random words from the unused words list for you and put them in the input boxes. If you have correctly guessed a word this is kept in the correct place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will notice that the input boxes sometimes have coloured highlights:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Red: You tried this word before and it&#8217;s not in the function<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Orange: You tried this word before and it&#8217;s in the function, but you didn&#8217;t get the right place<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Green: You&#8217;ve found this word in the correct place<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The game saves your progress across reloads but does not keep any player stats yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Limitations\/roadmap<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, no, I&#8217;m not a designer. The game works but the UI needs improvement. I&#8217;m well aware of that. But it&#8217;s still perfectly playable for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve hacked this together fairly quickly (it&#8217;s not my finest code!) and some of the interaction is quite complex so I&#8217;m making not claims about the accessibility of this game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve had a request to add a color-blind-friendly mode, and that will probably come soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d love to add some player stats and an option to share your result to social media.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Technology<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This game is built on a single HTML page (with some JS files loaded too) using vanilla CSS and a combination of vanilla JavaScript and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alpinejs.dev\/\">AlpineJS<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s hosted on Netlify.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been hacked together quickly so is not my finest code and needs some refactoring!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested I previously <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/03\/wordlepress-and-nerding-out-about-wordpress-function-names\/\">wrote some stuff about how I made this<\/a> with some &#8220;interesting&#8221; stats on WordPress function names.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contact\/suggestions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have feedback or suggestions then please drop me a line &#8211; probably on social media. You can find all my details at <a href=\"https:\/\/rw.omg.lol\/\">https:\/\/rw.omg.lol\/<\/a>. Just bear in mind this is a fun side-project, don&#8217;t expect first-class support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for playing! I hope you have fun and learn something.<\/p>\n",

And early on I suggested that &#8220;WordlePress&#8221; should be a thing. So I made something that may fit the name. Here&#8217;s how it works:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress core has over 900 global PHP functions with four underscore-separated &#8220;parts&#8221;, such as `wp_get_attachment_image`. This is a &#8220;function&#8221;, and each of the parts is a &#8220;word&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Aim of the game<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each day (changing at midnight UTC) WordlePress selects a new 4-part function for you to guess. You need to guess all 4 &#8220;words&#8221; correctly to win.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also the option to guess a randomly picked function name from the list to practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you win, or give up, the answer is shown and the documentation for the function is linked. So this is an educational tool too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The function list is from (I think) WordPress 5.9, released in January 2022. If it helps this is just after the first beta of the full-site editing feature was added to core.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to play<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter your word guesses in the four input boxes and click &#8220;Guess&#8221;. The result boxes will tell you how many of them are correct:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A green box means you got the right word in the right position<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>An orange box means you got a word that is in the function, but it&#8217;s in the wrong position<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim is to get all four result boxes to green!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Words and suggestions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\">The game<\/a> helps you by only allowing words from the list of functions to be entered. There are 695 valid words and the game shows you how many you have not guessed with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To further help you, there is a &#8220;Suggest&#8221; button. This will choose random words from the unused words list for you and put them in the input boxes. If you have correctly guessed a word this is kept in the correct place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will notice that the input boxes sometimes have coloured highlights:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Red: You tried this word before and it&#8217;s not in the function<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Orange: You tried this word before and it&#8217;s in the function, but you didn&#8217;t get the right place<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Green: You&#8217;ve found this word in the correct place<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The game saves your progress across reloads but does not keep any player stats yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Limitations\/roadmap<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, no, I&#8217;m not a designer. The game works but the UI needs improvement. I&#8217;m well aware of that. But it&#8217;s still perfectly playable for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve hacked this together fairly quickly (it&#8217;s not my finest code!) and some of the interaction is quite complex so I&#8217;m making not claims about the accessibility of this game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve had a request to add a color-blind-friendly mode, and that will probably come soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d love to add some player stats and an option to share your result to social media.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Technology<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This game is built on a single HTML page (with some JS files loaded too) using vanilla CSS and a combination of vanilla JavaScript and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alpinejs.dev\/\">AlpineJS<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s hosted on Netlify.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been hacked together quickly so is not my finest code and needs some refactoring!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested I previously <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/03\/wordlepress-and-nerding-out-about-wordpress-function-names\/\">wrote some stuff about how I made this<\/a> with some &#8220;interesting&#8221; stats on WordPress function names.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contact\/suggestions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have feedback or suggestions then please drop me a line &#8211; probably on social media. You can find all my details at <a href=\"https:\/\/rw.omg.lol\/\">https:\/\/rw.omg.lol\/<\/a>. Just bear in mind this is a fun side-project, don&#8217;t expect first-class support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for playing! I hope you have fun and learn something.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been on Mastodon for a little longer that most, and I&#8217;ve taken some time to look into how it works. So I&#8217;m a little ahead of the curve. And lots of people are asking questions about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a ton of posts about it. But perhaps you trust me more than other random strangers? Here&#8217;s my take.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My thing is: You don&#8217;t have to move to it. You can stay on Twitter (though there are MANY good reasons not to right now). You can also move to other places like Tumblr. Or stay on Instagram or Facebook. You really don&#8217;t have to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you probably want to make an informed choice. So here&#8217;s my general info.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, Mastodon is quite a lot like Twitter, but it also has a lot of differences<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mastodon has different &#8220;servers&#8221; (sometimes called &#8220;instances&#8221;). Each server is like a little self-contained mini-Twitter. BUT, servers can talk to each other. You will hear this called &#8220;federation&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some people say it&#8217;s &#8220;like email&#8221; because if you have GMail you can send and receive messages to someone with Outlook. And it IS like that, but there are other things about the server that you are on that are important.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>So if you sign up for an account on, say, <a href=\"https:\/\/mastodon.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mastodon.social<\/a> (which I wouldn&#8217;t recommend because it&#8217;s overloaded), you can see posts by me on the server that I&#8217;m on: <a href=\"https:\/\/fosstodon.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fosstodon.org<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Each server has its own rules (these are on the &#8220;about&#8221; page for the server). So check these out before you join. My server, for example, forbids a thing called &#8220;s**tposting&#8221; and &#8220;spam&#8221;. Generally these rules are A Good Thing(TM).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You also get to see a &#8220;local feed&#8221; from your own server. So if you&#8217;re into, say, bollards, and you joins the <a href=\"https:\/\/bollards.lol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bollards.lol<\/a> server then your local feed will be full of people talking about bollards. This may or may not be of interest to you. (Other servers are available.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can move servers. But not, like, every day. And there are limitations to it. Like, your posts don&#8217;t move with you, but your followers do.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mastodon has the appearance of being &#8220;free as in beer&#8221;. But it is costing someone &#8211; the person running the server &#8211; money to run it and time to moderate it. So please, please, PLEASE consider sending your server admins a few \u00a3s to support them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>There&#8217;s no ads or algorithms. &#8220;Likes&#8221; don&#8217;t influence who sees something. There&#8217;s no &#8220;Look! Here&#8217;s a post from someone that someone you follow follows liked.&#8221; Or &#8220;Here&#8217;s a random video of a bollard that you&#8217;re seeing just, because, well, Bollards are cool right now.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I will take further questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But not about bollards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry if you love bollards.<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Mastodon &#8211; what I know that you may need to",
        "content": "\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been on Mastodon for a little longer that most, and I&#8217;ve taken some time to look into how it works. So I&#8217;m a little ahead of the curve. And lots of people are asking questions about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a ton of posts about it. But perhaps you trust me more than other random strangers? Here&#8217;s my take.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My thing is: You don&#8217;t have to move to it. You can stay on Twitter (though there are MANY good reasons not to right now). You can also move to other places like Tumblr. Or stay on Instagram or Facebook. You really don&#8217;t have to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you probably want to make an informed choice. So here&#8217;s my general info.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, Mastodon is quite a lot like Twitter, but it also has a lot of differences<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mastodon has different &#8220;servers&#8221; (sometimes called &#8220;instances&#8221;). Each server is like a little self-contained mini-Twitter. BUT, servers can talk to each other. You will hear this called &#8220;federation&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some people say it&#8217;s &#8220;like email&#8221; because if you have GMail you can send and receive messages to someone with Outlook. And it IS like that, but there are other things about the server that you are on that are important.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>So if you sign up for an account on, say, <a href=\"https:\/\/mastodon.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mastodon.social<\/a> (which I wouldn&#8217;t recommend because it&#8217;s overloaded), you can see posts by me on the server that I&#8217;m on: <a href=\"https:\/\/fosstodon.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fosstodon.org<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Each server has its own rules (these are on the &#8220;about&#8221; page for the server). So check these out before you join. My server, for example, forbids a thing called &#8220;s**tposting&#8221; and &#8220;spam&#8221;. Generally these rules are A Good Thing(TM).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You also get to see a &#8220;local feed&#8221; from your own server. So if you&#8217;re into, say, bollards, and you joins the <a href=\"https:\/\/bollards.lol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bollards.lol<\/a> server then your local feed will be full of people talking about bollards. This may or may not be of interest to you. (Other servers are available.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can move servers. But not, like, every day. And there are limitations to it. Like, your posts don&#8217;t move with you, but your followers do.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mastodon has the appearance of being &#8220;free as in beer&#8221;. But it is costing someone &#8211; the person running the server &#8211; money to run it and time to moderate it. So please, please, PLEASE consider sending your server admins a few \u00a3s to support them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>There&#8217;s no ads or algorithms. &#8220;Likes&#8221; don&#8217;t influence who sees something. There&#8217;s no &#8220;Look! Here&#8217;s a post from someone that someone you follow follows liked.&#8221; Or &#8220;Here&#8217;s a random video of a bollard that you&#8217;re seeing just, because, well, Bollards are cool right now.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I will take further questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But not about bollards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry if you love bollards.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>So Elon bought Twitter. And lots of people are attempting to take their social presence elsewhere. Which is a good idea. But to me seems futile, in the short term at least.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I would genuinely love to see a move towards a more open technology based on common protocols and where people own their own information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love <a href=\"https:\/\/micro.blog\/\">Micro.blog<\/a> (which is often the answer when people propose &#8220;can&#8217;t we just aggregate RSS feeds somehow?&#8221;). I&#8217;m sometimes <a href=\"https:\/\/micro.blog\/ross\">over there<\/a> for starters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve tried Mastodon several times as <a href=\"https:\/\/fosstodon.org\/ross\">@ross@fosstodon.org<\/a> (previously <a href=\"https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@magicroundabout\">@magicroundabout@mastodon.social<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I recently found the fun-looking collection of tools over at <a href=\"https:\/\/omg.lol\/\">omg.lol<\/a> where I signed up as <a href=\"https:\/\/rw.omg.lol\/\">rw.omg.lol<\/a> with a &#8220;status log&#8221; at <a href=\"https:\/\/omg.lol\/@rw\">omg.lol\/@rw<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we\u2019ve seen this attempted exodus to the promised land many times before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without a proper mass migration of people and organisations to another service, it doesn\u2019t stick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You end up with people cross posting to multiple services to reach all the people that they want to reach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then as a reader I\u2019m checking multiple services and seeing the same things. The signal\/noise ratio goes down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And most people get fed up and end up back where they were before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes huge discipline and sacrifice by a large number of people simultaneously to have the right effect.&nbsp;This is hard to achieve. I&nbsp;don\u2019t&nbsp;understand how a mass migration to not-Twitter happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(I&#8217;m aware that the use of &#8220;sacrifice&#8221; here may seem odd, but for all their flaws, the big social networks have real, genuine value for people, so you do often give something up when you move somewhere quieter. You could, however, replace &#8220;discipline and sacrifice&#8221; with &#8220;not-giving-a-crappery&#8221; if you want to.&nbsp;That\u2019s&nbsp;definitely also an option for how to leave. To simply not care.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people are flocking to Mastodon. My personal issue with Mastodon specifically is that I feel like&nbsp;I\u2019m&nbsp;either putting my social presence in the hands of a total stranger with an unknown business model and no clue as to the service\u2019s sustainability.&nbsp;Or I have the pain and cost of running\/managing my own server.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I don&#8217;t mind paying a little for a social presence that has value, but Mastodon simply hasn&#8217;t had that for me yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I prefer the <a href=\"https:\/\/micro.blog\/\">micro.blog<\/a> model. It\u2019s been around for a while and <a href=\"https:\/\/micro.blog\/manton\">Manton<\/a> seems to have built a sustainable indie platform. You can bring your own \u201cCMS\u201d and he does the following\/feed\/comment bits. Or you can use the very simple posting\/blogging system that he&#8217;s built for a small fee.&nbsp;It\u2019s&nbsp;all based on open&nbsp;standards and <a href=\"https:\/\/indieweb.org\/\">indieweb<\/a>&nbsp;protocols, but it has the simplicity of setup that an everyday internet user needs to get started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not saying I wouldn\u2019t love a mass migration to happen.&nbsp;I\u2019ve just seen so many attempts now and none seem to have been particularly successful, and I don&#8217;t see why this one would either.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a big change to happen, I think either the platform has to spontaneously combust itself or it falls out of fashion by a long period of attrition and fades from the public consciousness over time. Facebook may even be at the start of this. Time will tell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps, one day, we will look back and remember that thing we all used called Twitter the same way we remember Geocities and MySpace. But I struggle to see how that will be next week or next month. It will be in many years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These occasional reconnaissance missions are good. I&#8217;m respectful of them. And grateful for them. They will eventually lead the charge away. So do look around. See if you feel at home elsewhere. And look me up elsewhere in the coming weeks too. The more of you that are elsewhere, the less I will think that I still need the big networks.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>So Elon bought Twitter. And lots of people are attempting to take their social presence elsewhere. Which is a good idea. But to me seems futile, in the short term at least.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I would genuinely love to see a move towards a more open technology based on common protocols and where people own their own information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love <a href=\"https:\/\/micro.blog\/\">Micro.blog<\/a> (which is often the answer when people propose &#8220;can&#8217;t we just aggregate RSS feeds somehow?&#8221;). I&#8217;m sometimes <a href=\"https:\/\/micro.blog\/ross\">over there<\/a> for starters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve tried Mastodon several times as <a href=\"https:\/\/fosstodon.org\/ross\">@ross@fosstodon.org<\/a> (previously <a href=\"https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@magicroundabout\">@magicroundabout@mastodon.social<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I recently found the fun-looking collection of tools over at <a href=\"https:\/\/omg.lol\/\">omg.lol<\/a> where I signed up as <a href=\"https:\/\/rw.omg.lol\/\">rw.omg.lol<\/a> with a &#8220;status log&#8221; at <a href=\"https:\/\/omg.lol\/@rw\">omg.lol\/@rw<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we\u2019ve seen this attempted exodus to the promised land many times before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without a proper mass migration of people and organisations to another service, it doesn\u2019t stick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You end up with people cross posting to multiple services to reach all the people that they want to reach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then as a reader I\u2019m checking multiple services and seeing the same things. The signal\/noise ratio goes down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And most people get fed up and end up back where they were before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes huge discipline and sacrifice by a large number of people simultaneously to have the right effect.&nbsp;This is hard to achieve. I&nbsp;don\u2019t&nbsp;understand how a mass migration to not-Twitter happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(I&#8217;m aware that the use of &#8220;sacrifice&#8221; here may seem odd, but for all their flaws, the big social networks have real, genuine value for people, so you do often give something up when you move somewhere quieter. You could, however, replace &#8220;discipline and sacrifice&#8221; with &#8220;not-giving-a-crappery&#8221; if you want to.&nbsp;That\u2019s&nbsp;definitely also an option for how to leave. To simply not care.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people are flocking to Mastodon. My personal issue with Mastodon specifically is that I feel like&nbsp;I\u2019m&nbsp;either putting my social presence in the hands of a total stranger with an unknown business model and no clue as to the service\u2019s sustainability.&nbsp;Or I have the pain and cost of running\/managing my own server.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I don&#8217;t mind paying a little for a social presence that has value, but Mastodon simply hasn&#8217;t had that for me yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I prefer the <a href=\"https:\/\/micro.blog\/\">micro.blog<\/a> model. It\u2019s been around for a while and <a href=\"https:\/\/micro.blog\/manton\">Manton<\/a> seems to have built a sustainable indie platform. You can bring your own \u201cCMS\u201d and he does the following\/feed\/comment bits. Or you can use the very simple posting\/blogging system that he&#8217;s built for a small fee.&nbsp;It\u2019s&nbsp;all based on open&nbsp;standards and <a href=\"https:\/\/indieweb.org\/\">indieweb<\/a>&nbsp;protocols, but it has the simplicity of setup that an everyday internet user needs to get started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not saying I wouldn\u2019t love a mass migration to happen.&nbsp;I\u2019ve just seen so many attempts now and none seem to have been particularly successful, and I don&#8217;t see why this one would either.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a big change to happen, I think either the platform has to spontaneously combust itself or it falls out of fashion by a long period of attrition and fades from the public consciousness over time. Facebook may even be at the start of this. Time will tell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps, one day, we will look back and remember that thing we all used called Twitter the same way we remember Geocities and MySpace. But I struggle to see how that will be next week or next month. It will be in many years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These occasional reconnaissance missions are good. I&#8217;m respectful of them. And grateful for them. They will eventually lead the charge away. So do look around. See if you feel at home elsewhere. And look me up elsewhere in the coming weeks too. The more of you that are elsewhere, the less I will think that I still need the big networks.<\/p>\n",

Here&#8217;s my thoughts on the idea of selling it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Too many independent software projects are being bought up. I&#8217;m determined for it to stay indie &#8211; for now at least!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I enjoy making it and I learn from making it. Perhaps a buyer would pay me to keep working on it? Or I could just find another project. But it&#8217;s my little hobby thing for now.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It&#8217;s definitely a thing that I make, in part at least, for myself to use! I <em>literally<\/em> use it <em>all<\/em> the time. I used it to log in to this site and start writing this post. I don&#8217;t want someone else to own the roadmap. I know what <em>I<\/em> want it to be. I don&#8217;t want it to be a lead generator or a nice add-on business to something much bigger. I want it to be a useful tool for WordPress users.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>There&#8217;s a really nice group of dedicated customers (THANK YOU!) who love the product. I like being able to serve them personally.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It&#8217;s not (yet) in a state where I think it&#8217;s worth someone buying from me! It has lots of potential, but I want to realise more of that by myself before I would consider it something that is sellable. So I won&#8217;t rule it out in the future. But the buyer would have to promise to keep it what it is.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be benefits to it having a bigger owner. Development might be faster. Support too (but support requests are SO rare).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m honestly flattered by the offers. Maybe one day it will make sense to sell it? But for now it&#8217;s staying with me. I hope that&#8217;s OK.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If people want to keep making me offers, I&#8217;m totally happy to receive them. It&#8217;s a very lovely and encouraging thing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if customers think I <em>should<\/em> sell it, let me know. I&#8217;d be keen to hear what you think.<\/p>\n",

Here&#8217;s my thoughts on the idea of selling it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Too many independent software projects are being bought up. I&#8217;m determined for it to stay indie &#8211; for now at least!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I enjoy making it and I learn from making it. Perhaps a buyer would pay me to keep working on it? Or I could just find another project. But it&#8217;s my little hobby thing for now.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It&#8217;s definitely a thing that I make, in part at least, for myself to use! I <em>literally<\/em> use it <em>all<\/em> the time. I used it to log in to this site and start writing this post. I don&#8217;t want someone else to own the roadmap. I know what <em>I<\/em> want it to be. I don&#8217;t want it to be a lead generator or a nice add-on business to something much bigger. I want it to be a useful tool for WordPress users.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>There&#8217;s a really nice group of dedicated customers (THANK YOU!) who love the product. I like being able to serve them personally.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It&#8217;s not (yet) in a state where I think it&#8217;s worth someone buying from me! It has lots of potential, but I want to realise more of that by myself before I would consider it something that is sellable. So I won&#8217;t rule it out in the future. But the buyer would have to promise to keep it what it is.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be benefits to it having a bigger owner. Development might be faster. Support too (but support requests are SO rare).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m honestly flattered by the offers. Maybe one day it will make sense to sell it? But for now it&#8217;s staying with me. I hope that&#8217;s OK.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If people want to keep making me offers, I&#8217;m totally happy to receive them. It&#8217;s a very lovely and encouraging thing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if customers think I <em>should<\/em> sell it, let me know. I&#8217;d be keen to hear what you think.<\/p>\n",
