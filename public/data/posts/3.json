It:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>accepts the 3gp format for uploads;<\/li>\n<li>has a simple user interface (though tags seem to go missing occasionally);<\/li>\n<li>has a limitation of 100 elements in a storyboard;<\/li>\n<li>has some other limited functionality (it&#8217;s still in Beta though so should improve).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Oh, and the terms and conditions, which, as far as I can make out, state that you keep the copyright but your material and be redistributed and mixed by anyone, seemingly without limitation.<\/p>\n<p>I produced a simple mix online and then downloaded everything in .avi format to do it properly.  So, if nothing else, you can upload and just convert.  You also seem to be able to do file conversion at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zamzar.com\/\">Zamzar<\/a> but I&#8217;ve not tried this.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m an amateur in the video editing world so if anyone knows better ways to mash together .3gp&#8217;s, .mov&#8217;s and .avi&#8217;s (from my various devices) for free then please post a comment!<\/p>\n<p>I find video editing fun &#8211; one of the few creative things that I might possibly be any good at &#8211; and theraputic.

It:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>accepts the 3gp format for uploads;<\/li>\n<li>has a simple user interface (though tags seem to go missing occasionally);<\/li>\n<li>has a limitation of 100 elements in a storyboard;<\/li>\n<li>has some other limited functionality (it&#8217;s still in Beta though so should improve).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Oh, and the terms and conditions, which, as far as I can make out, state that you keep the copyright but your material and be redistributed and mixed by anyone, seemingly without limitation.<\/p>\n<p>I produced a simple mix online and then downloaded everything in .avi format to do it properly.  So, if nothing else, you can upload and just convert.  You also seem to be able to do file conversion at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zamzar.com\/\">Zamzar<\/a> but I&#8217;ve not tried this.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m an amateur in the video editing world so if anyone knows better ways to mash together .3gp&#8217;s, .mov&#8217;s and .avi&#8217;s (from my various devices) for free then please post a comment!<\/p>\n<p>I find video editing fun &#8211; one of the few creative things that I might possibly be any good at &#8211; and theraputic.

Lots of good use of CA&#8217;s resources and an interesting sermon based on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Luke%207:36-50;&amp;version=31;\">Luke 7:36-50<\/a> &#8211; the story of a woman, probably a prostitute, worshipping Jesus by pouring expensive perfume over his feet.<\/p>\n<p>The key thing I took away was the need for forgiveness.  It&#8217;s a word that&#8217;s passed around lightly in Christian circles but the concept of forgiveness is hugely important.<\/p>\n<p>In the context of the story from Luke&#8217;s gospel, Jesus accepted the woman and forgave her wrongdoing (though I suspect it wasn&#8217;t entirely her fault she was in the situation she was in).<\/p>\n<p>In the context of Christian Aid, it was noted that we all exploit the third\/developing world and maybe we need them to forgive us of that.<\/p>\n<p>It may not always be out of choice; it&#8217;s hard to find clothes\/coffee\/chocolate\/electrical goods\/etc that have not involved some form of exploitation of cheap or forced labour, child labour, sweatshops and unfair pricing, and when you can find them buying them can be prohibitively expensive.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, in any case, I suspect that if you invited a child labourer from the developing world into your house you&#8217;d feel quite guilty and they&#8217;d be aghast at the wealth and luxury of even the poorest Briton.<\/p>\n<p>How does that make us feel about what we buy and where it&#8217;s come from?  It makes me want to be even more scrupulous about my consuming of stuff.  I&#8217;m the first to admit that Fairtrade isn&#8217;t a silver bullet that will cure all the world&#8217;s trade ills, but it&#8217;s a start and it&#8217;s my vote to say that people should be treated and paid fairly and justly and that I&#8217;m willing to stump up a bit extra of my relatively-vast amount of cash to achieve that.<\/p>\n<p>But, as I said, we have limited choice.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that, with trade, we&#8217;re such tiny parts of a huge machine.   We CAN &#8211; we MUST &#8211; do our bit but so much of our choice comes from the big corporations that sell us stuff, and that, fuelled by our consumer culture.  Without a major shift in how our western society as a whole plays the trade game, we won&#8217;t be turning around and asking for forgiveness any time soon.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Had a very good Christian Aid Week service at church this morning.  Lots of good use of CA&#8217;s resources and an interesting sermon based on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Luke%207:36-50;&amp;version=31;\">Luke 7:36-50<\/a> &#8211; the story of a woman, probably a prostitute, worshipping Jesus by pouring expensive perfume over his feet.<\/p>\n<p>The key thing I took away was the need for forgiveness.  It&#8217;s a word that&#8217;s passed around lightly in Christian circles but the concept of forgiveness is hugely important.<\/p>\n<p>In the context of the story from Luke&#8217;s gospel, Jesus accepted the woman and forgave her wrongdoing (though I suspect it wasn&#8217;t entirely her fault she was in the situation she was in).<\/p>\n<p>In the context of Christian Aid, it was noted that we all exploit the third\/developing world and maybe we need them to forgive us of that.<\/p>\n<p>It may not always be out of choice; it&#8217;s hard to find clothes\/coffee\/chocolate\/electrical goods\/etc that have not involved some form of exploitation of cheap or forced labour, child labour, sweatshops and unfair pricing, and when you can find them buying them can be prohibitively expensive.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, in any case, I suspect that if you invited a child labourer from the developing world into your house you&#8217;d feel quite guilty and they&#8217;d be aghast at the wealth and luxury of even the poorest Briton.<\/p>\n<p>How does that make us feel about what we buy and where it&#8217;s come from?  It makes me want to be even more scrupulous about my consuming of stuff.  I&#8217;m the first to admit that Fairtrade isn&#8217;t a silver bullet that will cure all the world&#8217;s trade ills, but it&#8217;s a start and it&#8217;s my vote to say that people should be treated and paid fairly and justly and that I&#8217;m willing to stump up a bit extra of my relatively-vast amount of cash to achieve that.<\/p>\n<p>But, as I said, we have limited choice.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that, with trade, we&#8217;re such tiny parts of a huge machine.   We CAN &#8211; we MUST &#8211; do our bit but so much of our choice comes from the big corporations that sell us stuff, and that, fuelled by our consumer culture.  Without a major shift in how our western society as a whole plays the trade game, we won&#8217;t be turning around and asking for forgiveness any time soon.<\/p>\n",

Yet I feel compelled to write as if I&#8217;m talking to someone that really doesn&#8217;t understand what my faith is all about.<\/p>\n<p>Why?  A few reasons:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It will be a good exercise for me to get me using non-Christian language to talk about my Christian experiences &#8211; we have far too much jargon that we use within Church and it must be completely baffling to those outside.  Hopefully I&#8217;ll explain things as I go along.<\/li>\n<li>It may help anyone that MIGHT be reading to understand what I&#8217;m talking about.<\/li>\n<li>It will probably help me write clearly and say what I want to say rather than using words that I only half know the meaning of.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>With that in mind&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Church service was good tonight but raised some questions!  The music was excellent with lots of songs about being thankful &#8211; really got me in the mood.<\/p>\n<p>The talk was based around a video by an American guy called Rob Bell.  The video is called &#8220;Kickball&#8221; and is about wanting things and needing things.   It explains how if we see God as &#8220;our father&#8221; (as the Lord&#8217;s Prayer starts), he should know what we need better than we do.  If, as children, we got everything that we asked for, then that would actually be really bad.  So, if we see ourselves as God&#8217;s children &#8211; a picture often portrayed in the bible &#8211; then we shouldn&#8217;t expect to get everything that we ask God for in prayer because He knows better than we do.<\/p>\n<p>The video also said some stuff about how God is &#8220;good&#8221; &#8211; by which we mean ultimately good; a concept that we as humans probably can&#8217;t quite grasp &#8211; and as such, if we don&#8217;t get what we ask for then it&#8217;s because God has something better in mind.<\/p>\n<p>Which is all GREAT.  Only it&#8217;s set against the week that just went by when I discovered that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a couple I know are breaking up after being married for 2 years &#8211; seemingly without much hope of reconcilliation<\/li>\n<li>an wedding I was going to has been cancelled<\/li>\n<li>a friend of mine is really struggling with her faith because she has an illness which, despite lots and LOTS of faithful prayer has not gone away &#8211; she&#8217;s not been healed despite our asking a God who we believe can miraculously heal &#8211; and also because of some other sad events that have happened to people close to her.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All of these things happened to people who&#8217;ve followed Jesus INCREDIBLY faithfully for many years.  Amazing, amazing people who&#8217;ve trusted our &#8220;good&#8221; God through thick and thin.<\/p>\n<p>Now, people do have choice, and relationships are difficult, so I can see how the break-up and the wedding problems can come about because of the actions of people.  God&#8217;s will is (probably) for those relationships to work out, yet things don&#8217;t work out because we&#8217;re not God&#8217;s puppets, subject to his every whim.  We have choice and we can choose to do the wrong thing.  Though I add that I don&#8217;t know where those relationships have gone wrong and at what point wrong choices were made and by whom.<\/p>\n<p>But a seemingly-pointless death and an illness that won&#8217;t go away?  People don&#8217;t choose them!  How could God have something better in mind?<\/p>\n<p>This is, of course, the age old question of suffering for which there are many standard answers, most of which are pretty useless unless you already have faith in God.  Faith is defined in the bible as &#8220;being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see&#8221; &#8211; choosing to believe despite the fact that sometimes evidence is to the contrary.<\/p>\n<p>My response tonight?  Well, I&#8217;m going to struggle on.  I&#8217;m going to pursue my faith.  And I&#8217;m going to change the way I pray.  If God knows better than I then my prayers should be asking him what he wants for me, my family, my friends, etc, rather than me coming to ask him for what I think I want or need.<\/p>\n<p>Please don&#8217;t thing that if you read that you can tear my faith apart.  My God has done some amazing things and I could tell far more stories of God being GOOD and not giving me things because he has something better in store.  That IS my general experience.<\/p>\n<p>I DO believe that he&#8217;ll pull through in the situations I&#8217;ve talked about, and I look forward to sharing that journey here.  Probably with myself but, hey.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Social Networking<\/p>\n<p><\/span>So, we discovered Facebook today, as stated. What an odd thing.<\/p>\n<p>MySpace has been my only real experience of online Social Networking so far.  It has been around for a while and I really don&#8217;t like it for anything other than reading up on the plans of some of my favourite bands&#8230;especially the up-and-coming <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/ikomusic\">Iko<\/a>.  MySpace is too cluttered, has too much advertising and is too much about self-promotion.  It all seems a bit random and chaotic.<\/p>\n<p>But I was invited to Facebook by a fairly sensible person that I trust the opinion of.  It was also mentioned by some other very reasonable, humble and grown-up people over the weekend I just spent with friends in Swindon and London.  So I signed up to see what it was all about.<\/p>\n<p>I was oddly compelled by it for a few hours.  Interesting seeing who I knew was on there and what was on their profiles.  There was a strange sense of fun in searching for crazily titled &#8220;groups&#8221; to be a part of, such as &#8220;Wintles&#8221; and &#8220;The Magic Roundabout, Swindon, Society&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;what&#8217;s the point?  What need does this social networking serve?  I know who my friends are and I can chat to them or email them if I need to get in touch.  Friends Reunited gave us the opportunity to reconnect with lost classmates and colleagues but, well, we probably lost touch because the friendship wasn&#8217;t that strong and, heck, I can hardly keep up with those people I&#8217;ve NOT lost touch with.<\/p>\n<p>It was fun for a while but I quickly got bored.  It&#8217;ll be interesting to see if it serves any purpose over a longer period of time.<\/p>\n<p>The only real thing that redeemed it today was the finding of another Ross Wintle.  Seems I&#8217;m not so unique after all!<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Thoughts on Work<\/p>\n<p><\/span>Going back to work last week made me realise that I&#8217;m not very happy there at the moment.  My boss is being great and doing all he can to make thing better though.  I&#8217;m praying that God will show me what I should be doing to make my work life better.  I may have a sabbatical later in the year or something.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Storytelling<\/span>&#8230;will have to wait for another time.

        "content": "<p>Another Sunday evening Brain dump then.<\/p>\n<p>Things to write about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sunday evening&#8217;s talk at church<\/li>\n<li>More on social networking<\/li>\n<li>Thoughts on Work<\/li>\n<li>Storytelling!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Sunday Evening&#8217;s Talk at Church<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Before I write this, a vague note about how I intend writing about my faith here.<\/p>\n<p>I do have an assumption that no one else is reading this, that it&#8217;s all for my own benefit.  Yet I feel compelled to write as if I&#8217;m talking to someone that really doesn&#8217;t understand what my faith is all about.<\/p>\n<p>Why?  A few reasons:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It will be a good exercise for me to get me using non-Christian language to talk about my Christian experiences &#8211; we have far too much jargon that we use within Church and it must be completely baffling to those outside.  Hopefully I&#8217;ll explain things as I go along.<\/li>\n<li>It may help anyone that MIGHT be reading to understand what I&#8217;m talking about.<\/li>\n<li>It will probably help me write clearly and say what I want to say rather than using words that I only half know the meaning of.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>With that in mind&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Church service was good tonight but raised some questions!  The music was excellent with lots of songs about being thankful &#8211; really got me in the mood.<\/p>\n<p>The talk was based around a video by an American guy called Rob Bell.  The video is called &#8220;Kickball&#8221; and is about wanting things and needing things.   It explains how if we see God as &#8220;our father&#8221; (as the Lord&#8217;s Prayer starts), he should know what we need better than we do.  If, as children, we got everything that we asked for, then that would actually be really bad.  So, if we see ourselves as God&#8217;s children &#8211; a picture often portrayed in the bible &#8211; then we shouldn&#8217;t expect to get everything that we ask God for in prayer because He knows better than we do.<\/p>\n<p>The video also said some stuff about how God is &#8220;good&#8221; &#8211; by which we mean ultimately good; a concept that we as humans probably can&#8217;t quite grasp &#8211; and as such, if we don&#8217;t get what we ask for then it&#8217;s because God has something better in mind.<\/p>\n<p>Which is all GREAT.  Only it&#8217;s set against the week that just went by when I discovered that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a couple I know are breaking up after being married for 2 years &#8211; seemingly without much hope of reconcilliation<\/li>\n<li>an wedding I was going to has been cancelled<\/li>\n<li>a friend of mine is really struggling with her faith because she has an illness which, despite lots and LOTS of faithful prayer has not gone away &#8211; she&#8217;s not been healed despite our asking a God who we believe can miraculously heal &#8211; and also because of some other sad events that have happened to people close to her.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All of these things happened to people who&#8217;ve followed Jesus INCREDIBLY faithfully for many years.  Amazing, amazing people who&#8217;ve trusted our &#8220;good&#8221; God through thick and thin.<\/p>\n<p>Now, people do have choice, and relationships are difficult, so I can see how the break-up and the wedding problems can come about because of the actions of people.  God&#8217;s will is (probably) for those relationships to work out, yet things don&#8217;t work out because we&#8217;re not God&#8217;s puppets, subject to his every whim.  We have choice and we can choose to do the wrong thing.  Though I add that I don&#8217;t know where those relationships have gone wrong and at what point wrong choices were made and by whom.<\/p>\n<p>But a seemingly-pointless death and an illness that won&#8217;t go away?  People don&#8217;t choose them!  How could God have something better in mind?<\/p>\n<p>This is, of course, the age old question of suffering for which there are many standard answers, most of which are pretty useless unless you already have faith in God.  Faith is defined in the bible as &#8220;being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see&#8221; &#8211; choosing to believe despite the fact that sometimes evidence is to the contrary.<\/p>\n<p>My response tonight?  Well, I&#8217;m going to struggle on.  I&#8217;m going to pursue my faith.  And I&#8217;m going to change the way I pray.  If God knows better than I then my prayers should be asking him what he wants for me, my family, my friends, etc, rather than me coming to ask him for what I think I want or need.<\/p>\n<p>Please don&#8217;t thing that if you read that you can tear my faith apart.  My God has done some amazing things and I could tell far more stories of God being GOOD and not giving me things because he has something better in store.  That IS my general experience.<\/p>\n<p>I DO believe that he&#8217;ll pull through in the situations I&#8217;ve talked about, and I look forward to sharing that journey here.  Probably with myself but, hey.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Social Networking<\/p>\n<p><\/span>So, we discovered Facebook today, as stated. What an odd thing.<\/p>\n<p>MySpace has been my only real experience of online Social Networking so far.  It has been around for a while and I really don&#8217;t like it for anything other than reading up on the plans of some of my favourite bands&#8230;especially the up-and-coming <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/ikomusic\">Iko<\/a>.  MySpace is too cluttered, has too much advertising and is too much about self-promotion.  It all seems a bit random and chaotic.<\/p>\n<p>But I was invited to Facebook by a fairly sensible person that I trust the opinion of.  It was also mentioned by some other very reasonable, humble and grown-up people over the weekend I just spent with friends in Swindon and London.  So I signed up to see what it was all about.<\/p>\n<p>I was oddly compelled by it for a few hours.  Interesting seeing who I knew was on there and what was on their profiles.  There was a strange sense of fun in searching for crazily titled &#8220;groups&#8221; to be a part of, such as &#8220;Wintles&#8221; and &#8220;The Magic Roundabout, Swindon, Society&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;what&#8217;s the point?  What need does this social networking serve?  I know who my friends are and I can chat to them or email them if I need to get in touch.  Friends Reunited gave us the opportunity to reconnect with lost classmates and colleagues but, well, we probably lost touch because the friendship wasn&#8217;t that strong and, heck, I can hardly keep up with those people I&#8217;ve NOT lost touch with.<\/p>\n<p>It was fun for a while but I quickly got bored.  It&#8217;ll be interesting to see if it serves any purpose over a longer period of time.<\/p>\n<p>The only real thing that redeemed it today was the finding of another Ross Wintle.  Seems I&#8217;m not so unique after all!<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Thoughts on Work<\/p>\n<p><\/span>Going back to work last week made me realise that I&#8217;m not very happy there at the moment.  My boss is being great and doing all he can to make thing better though.  I&#8217;m praying that God will show me what I should be doing to make my work life better.  I may have a sabbatical later in the year or something.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Storytelling<\/span>&#8230;will have to wait for another time. I leave you (or possibly just me) with <a href=\"http:\/\/observer.guardian.co.uk\/magazine\/story\/0,,2081835,00.html\">an inspiring article <\/a>from a Christian youthworker who&#8217;s getting alongside kids in very much the same way that Jesus drew alongside the rejected people of his day.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

Keeping my hands in my pockets, I shiver and shuffle around in my coat and draw it closer.  I&#8217;m lost, in a place I don&#8217;t know very well.  I don&#8217;t recognise anything.  Signposts tell me the way to streets and landmarks I&#8217;ve not been to.  I walk past the odd person I don&#8217;t recognise &#8211; well, why would I?  I know that home is nearby, somewhere, and yet, without a clue as to where I am, I could be out here all night&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A story?  A metaphor?  A parable?  Is it real?  Is it trying to tell me something?  What is it?<\/p>\n<p>I love the medium, the magic and the mystery of storytelling.  It&#8217;s an art that we&#8217;ve lost in modern times.<\/p>\n<p>I discovered it at Lee Abbey Summer Camp in Devon when I met a man called Simon &#8211; a really fun and interesting man who was a storyteller in his spare time.  He taught us some of the tricks of the trade in a short workshop and I was hooked.  He could communicate ideas, facts, morals, history, dreams and sometimes just stories, in such a captivating way.  It was amazing.<\/p>\n<p>I like storytelling as a means of communicating and I think that we should do it more.  Jesus told lots of stories to communicate important things to people in memorable ways.  Many will know the story of the Good Samaritan, and maybe the Prodigal Son.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, storytelling is a very good thing.  So why then do I find it so overused?<\/p>\n<p>In church services people pepper their talks, sermons or messages with little anecdotes to draw you in or make the points more practical.  Yet I find this dilutes a talk rather than enhancing it.<\/p>\n<p>In modern non-fiction books (and especially in books that fall into the &#8220;Christian Living&#8221; category) I find myself wallowing in stories and struggling to get to what&#8217;s actually being said.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m currently trying to work out my love-hate relationship with storytelling.<\/p>\n<p>I THINK that what I see in talks and books are short anecdotes &#8211; not proper storytelling as such.  And these are useful.  But I think we need to be careful how, and how much, we use them, otherwise our message gets diluted, or our audience drifts off at the thought of another of so-and-so&#8217;s tiresome tales.<\/p>\n<p>What I saw Simon doing at Lee Abbey was REAL storytelling.  He didn&#8217;t need to add to it, or explain it.  The story itself &#8211; and the way he told it &#8211; was enough.  Sometimes he left you with questions, but that was OK; sometimes that WAS the point!<\/p>\n<p>Rob Bell of the Mars Hill Church in the US does a good mixture of both in his &#8220;Nooma&#8221; videos.  He tells a story.  One story.  That&#8217;s his parable, that&#8217;s his hook to get you in and to give you something to remember.  But then he develops that story into a message.  And it works.  We saw one of these videos on Sunday night.  I&#8217;d seen it before a few months ago and it was very familiar.  I can tell you all about Rob walking along the beach telling the story, his little boy wanting the thing on a strap that will hit him in the face and screaming &#8220;I WAAAAANT one&#8221; and &#8220;I NEEEED it&#8221; when daddy knows better.  And not just because I wrote about it in my &#8220;Sunday evening brain dump&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fed up with the books I&#8217;m reading full of anecdotes, and I don&#8217;t connect with preaching that mixes up powerful truth and personal tales; they make me feel like a guy who&#8217;s lost in the fog who wishes he could find what he&#8217;s really looking for.  A story should get to the heart of the matter, it should be told passionately, and it should teach a simple truth.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, I&#8217;m not really sure what to make of storytelling.  I&#8217;ll keep trying to work out what I make of it.  I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s no perfect formula but I just think it&#8217;s a means of communication that we could use better.  I&#8217;ll keep struggling with my books &#8211; there are good, real-life illustrations in there that make a point real.  I&#8217;ll keep listening to my preachers and teachers because, after all, they&#8217;re far wiser and more knowledgeable than I about most things.<\/p>\n<p>And hopefully the signposts and the people I come across will help me find my home.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s dark, it&#8217;s cold, my skin is wet from walking through dense fog, and I want to know the way home.  Keeping my hands in my pockets, I shiver and shuffle around in my coat and draw it closer.  I&#8217;m lost, in a place I don&#8217;t know very well.  I don&#8217;t recognise anything.  Signposts tell me the way to streets and landmarks I&#8217;ve not been to.  I walk past the odd person I don&#8217;t recognise &#8211; well, why would I?  I know that home is nearby, somewhere, and yet, without a clue as to where I am, I could be out here all night&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A story?  A metaphor?  A parable?  Is it real?  Is it trying to tell me something?  What is it?<\/p>\n<p>I love the medium, the magic and the mystery of storytelling.  It&#8217;s an art that we&#8217;ve lost in modern times.<\/p>\n<p>I discovered it at Lee Abbey Summer Camp in Devon when I met a man called Simon &#8211; a really fun and interesting man who was a storyteller in his spare time.  He taught us some of the tricks of the trade in a short workshop and I was hooked.  He could communicate ideas, facts, morals, history, dreams and sometimes just stories, in such a captivating way.  It was amazing.<\/p>\n<p>I like storytelling as a means of communicating and I think that we should do it more.  Jesus told lots of stories to communicate important things to people in memorable ways.  Many will know the story of the Good Samaritan, and maybe the Prodigal Son.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, storytelling is a very good thing.  So why then do I find it so overused?<\/p>\n<p>In church services people pepper their talks, sermons or messages with little anecdotes to draw you in or make the points more practical.  Yet I find this dilutes a talk rather than enhancing it.<\/p>\n<p>In modern non-fiction books (and especially in books that fall into the &#8220;Christian Living&#8221; category) I find myself wallowing in stories and struggling to get to what&#8217;s actually being said.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m currently trying to work out my love-hate relationship with storytelling.<\/p>\n<p>I THINK that what I see in talks and books are short anecdotes &#8211; not proper storytelling as such.  And these are useful.  But I think we need to be careful how, and how much, we use them, otherwise our message gets diluted, or our audience drifts off at the thought of another of so-and-so&#8217;s tiresome tales.<\/p>\n<p>What I saw Simon doing at Lee Abbey was REAL storytelling.  He didn&#8217;t need to add to it, or explain it.  The story itself &#8211; and the way he told it &#8211; was enough.  Sometimes he left you with questions, but that was OK; sometimes that WAS the point!<\/p>\n<p>Rob Bell of the Mars Hill Church in the US does a good mixture of both in his &#8220;Nooma&#8221; videos.  He tells a story.  One story.  That&#8217;s his parable, that&#8217;s his hook to get you in and to give you something to remember.  But then he develops that story into a message.  And it works.  We saw one of these videos on Sunday night.  I&#8217;d seen it before a few months ago and it was very familiar.  I can tell you all about Rob walking along the beach telling the story, his little boy wanting the thing on a strap that will hit him in the face and screaming &#8220;I WAAAAANT one&#8221; and &#8220;I NEEEED it&#8221; when daddy knows better.  And not just because I wrote about it in my &#8220;Sunday evening brain dump&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fed up with the books I&#8217;m reading full of anecdotes, and I don&#8217;t connect with preaching that mixes up powerful truth and personal tales; they make me feel like a guy who&#8217;s lost in the fog who wishes he could find what he&#8217;s really looking for.  A story should get to the heart of the matter, it should be told passionately, and it should teach a simple truth.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, I&#8217;m not really sure what to make of storytelling.  I&#8217;ll keep trying to work out what I make of it.  I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s no perfect formula but I just think it&#8217;s a means of communication that we could use better.  I&#8217;ll keep struggling with my books &#8211; there are good, real-life illustrations in there that make a point real.  I&#8217;ll keep listening to my preachers and teachers because, after all, they&#8217;re far wiser and more knowledgeable than I about most things.<\/p>\n<p>And hopefully the signposts and the people I come across will help me find my home.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>It&#8217;s been a LONG week.  The days have been passing very slowly and I&#8217;m a bit confused as to which of these events, thoughts and discoveries are from this week and which are older, but hey. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been back in the saddle with my journey&#8217;s to work and back, and this has raised a few interesting cycling things.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Clothing<\/span><\/p>\n<p>First, a long overdue note on clothing.  You&#8217;ve probably noticed that my blog is titled &#8220;Magic Roundabouts and Padded Pants&#8221;.  This is partly from my love of the Magic Roundabout &#8211; iconic of Swindon, my home town and the place we have recently moved to &#8211; and partly inspired by a writer in the Guardian who recently wrote an article on cycling entitled &#8220;Padded pants saved my life&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Now, it&#8217;s not like she fell off into her bike into a lake and would have drowned if it weren&#8217;t for the foam padding in her cycling shorts keeping her afloat (I&#8217;m sure someone can come up with a better story to match the headline) &#8211; she is, of course, speaking metaphorically.  And I can wholeheartedly agree with her sentiment.<\/p>\n<p>Though I don&#8217;t consider myself an official &#8220;lycra lout&#8221;, and despite a healthy dose of initial skepticism, I have definitely discovered &#8220;technical&#8221; clothing.  And there&#8217;s quite a lot of it!  Thankfully, my wife assures me that I don&#8217;t look completely stupid when wearing my cycle gear.  And I don&#8217;t really care if other people do&#8230;my prepared response to anyone who might say that I look stupid would be &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m warm, dry, comfortable and stupid&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of my finds&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>1) Baggies<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve taken to wearing &#8220;Baggies&#8221;, which are padded lycra shorts but they have water-resistant &#8220;baggy&#8221; shorts over the top.  These are great and, so I&#8217;m told, they even look cool!  The difference they make to ride comfort is quite impressive.  I wouldn&#8217;t cycle without them!  They dry quickly too so if you get caught in the rain they&#8217;re usually OK to use again after a few hours.<\/p>\n<p>2) Wrap-around shades<\/p>\n<p>I HATE the thought of these, but they&#8217;re REALLY important.  They keep dirt, grit, wind, rain, flies, branches, sunlight and harmful UV rays out of your eyes.  But surely ordinary shades are OK?  Well, I thought that.  But I bought a pair of inexpensive DHB shades from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiggle.co.uk\/\">Wiggle<\/a> andI wear them ALL the time (when cycling) because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wind gets round frames and still blows into your eyes.<\/li>\n<li>If you have frames you can&#8217;t see out the corner of your eyes &#8211; important when looking around\/behind you.<\/li>\n<li>They have interchangable lenses so you can use them in different lights and weathers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;ll excuse the pun, I&#8217;ve not looked back since!<\/p>\n<p>3) Technical Tee&#8217;s and Jerseys<\/p>\n<p>This took the most convincing before I invested, but it&#8217;s quite simple.  Cotton T-shirts soak up sweat and hold it!  This means that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>they take ages to dry;<\/li>\n<li>they make you cold in a wind;<\/li>\n<li>they saturate &#8211; so they reach a point where they can&#8217;t absorb more sweat, meaning YOU get wet, which is not particularly pleasant<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, &#8220;wicking&#8221; clothing is the answer.  These carry moisture away from the body and let it evaporate quickly.  &#8220;Base layers&#8221; are used for skiing, walking, climbing, etc, and could probably be used for winter cycling.  These are fitted and good for keeping you warm.  You wear them under other things.  &#8220;Technical Tees&#8221; are thinner, cooler and loose-fitting.<\/p>\n<p>I also have a couple of cycle &#8220;jerseys&#8221;, which are more like base layers than tees but have lots of useful pockets and a zip to allow them to be breathable.  My favourite jersey is long-sleeved.  You&#8217;d be surprised how cold your arms get when cycling!  They also tend to come in bright colours &#8211; good for visibility.<\/p>\n<p>4) Gloves<\/p>\n<p>Most obviously for keeping your hands warm &#8211; and you be surprised how you need them even in mild weather!  Especially as you don&#8217;t use your hands and arms much in cycling.  Also important for a bit of shock-protection and pressure relief.  You have important nerves running through your wrist (I&#8217;ll maybe write about RSI involving such nerves at some point!), and continuous pressure and vibration is not really good for any part of your body.<\/p>\n<p>5) Water\/wind proofs!<\/p>\n<p>A lightweight, water and wind-proof top is pretty essential too.  They make these incredibly thin and light these days so you can pack it a small sack even in good weather (this is England we&#8217;re talking about).  From what I can tell you can get specific wind-proofs, but I&#8217;ve got a cheap (\u00a38!) water and wind proof that does the job for my commute.<\/p>\n<p>6) Overshoes<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not SO convinced about these but they&#8217;re worth a mention.  Overshoes are water-resistant, and have a thin layer of something like fleece or neoprene inside.  As the name suggests you wear them over your shoes.  They ARE pretty good at keeping your feet warm, and slightly dry.  They&#8217;re good for really cold weather.  But they don&#8217;t look good and they&#8217;re a bit of overkill really.<\/p>\n<p>7) Headband\/skullcap<\/p>\n<p>Finally, and well worth a mention&#8230;I have a thin, fleecy headband.  With all else covered up, on a cold, wet, windy winters day, your forehead gets REALLY cold when cycling.  It gets painful!  This little thing is a few quid VERY well spent.  My friend Mike is a bit lacking in hair so he has an all-over skullcap equivalent (sorry Mike &#8211; had to mention that!).<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Chains and Sprockets<\/span><\/p>\n<p>My chain broke this week.  Not a complete break, but a link became splayed.  Easily fixed with a pair of pliers but I&#8217;m worried about having a weak link now.  The bike shop says it should be fine but it got me looking at the chain a bit.<\/p>\n<p>I remember when it happened &#8211; I was turning a corner, changing down gears, and there was a clunk.  I didn&#8217;t notice until the next morning.  It seems, and it makes sense the lateral movement from changing gears bends the chain a little.  If you put too much pressure on the chain while it&#8217;s bent in this way, you can weaken or damage the links.<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t have to do it in the end but my cycle maintenance book says that changing the chain can require you to change the rear &#8220;cassette&#8221; &#8211; the gear cogs &#8211; as the sprockets get worn down.  So I had a look at those too while I was looking at the chain and, sure enough, my cogs are looking pretty worn after 800 miles.  I&#8217;ll try to get a photo here at some point.<\/p>\n<p>Chains are important and I&#8217;ll be watching and maintaining my &#8220;transmission&#8221; system more carefully from now on.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Servicing<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So, having had the chain incident I took the bike in for a service &#8211; mostly because we&#8217;re taking the bikes off on holiday to Cornwall and I don&#8217;t want to get caught in the middle of nowhere with something broken.<\/p>\n<p>They didn&#8217;t think the chain would be a problem so that&#8217;s been left&#8230;which makes me cringe slightly in fear&#8230;I hope they know best.<\/p>\n<p>So they offered me a &#8220;brakes and gears&#8221; or a &#8220;full service&#8221;.  I asked how much the full service was and they told me it would be \u00a325.  Which seems very cheap to me &#8211; so I put it in for a full service.<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t expect much for \u00a325.  That can&#8217;t even be 30 minutes labour can it?<\/p>\n<p>Anyway the bike came back.  Disappointingly the gears were worse than when I took it in.  But it was running VERY smooth.<\/p>\n<p>Was it worth it?  Probably not.  I reckon a chain clean and lube, brake adjustment, pumping up the tyres.  That will probably just about do it.  But then \u00a325 wasn&#8217;t much so maybe it was.  Anyone know what they do in a &#8220;full service&#8221;?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Tyres<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I mentioned the tyres.  I&#8217;ve done a couple of REALLY speedy rides recently and I think having well-inflated tyres helps a lot.  I&#8217;ve put a track pump on my Wiggle wish list!!!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Action<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Cycling is a complex thing to get right.  I&#8217;ve been playing around with foot position to try to stop my knees hurting (see <a href=\"http:\/\/wintle.blogspot.com\/2007\/05\/good-20-miles-and-some-amateur.html\">my post on amateur physiology<\/a>).  I do seem to have had some success (25.5 miles today with little pain), but in working out how to do this I think I&#8217;ve realised that I&#8217;m pedalling inefficiently.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been pushing mostly down, starting my push at about 2 o&#8217;clock (if you look at the pedal from the side).  What I&#8217;ve found is that pushing FORWARD from the top of the revolution, from 12 o&#8217;clock, feels much more efficient &#8211; the pedalling action is smoother and it feels like you get power through the full revolution.<\/p>\n<p>Definitely something to work on and possibly to research!  Oh, and I&#8217;m sure cycling shoes and clipless pedals (with the slots that you slot cycling shoes into) probably help with all this too&#8230;that&#8217;s a whole other subject!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Computers and Cadence<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And finally (gosh this has turned into a marathon post), a note on cycle computers.  I bought one ages ago and it&#8217;s REALLY useful.  I spent \u00a335 on a Cateye Micro Wireless.<\/p>\n<p>I hate all the cables that you get with a non-wireless and, despite the advice of the guy in the shop, I gave this a try&#8230;and it&#8217;s been fine!  I&#8217;ve had no problems with it what so ever.  The batteries have lasted well over 6 months and, as far as I know, it&#8217;s never skipped a pulse.<\/p>\n<p>My only regret is not buying one with MORE functions.  You can get computers with what&#8217;s called &#8220;cadence&#8221;.  That is, your rate of pedalling (RPM).  Which, it turns out, is a really useful thing to know.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to trade-up just yet.  But if I was starting again I&#8217;d go for something bigger and better!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Summary<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Phew &#8211; what a lot.  But to anyone serious about getting into cycling, on clothing, on computers, on maintenance, on tools, on ALL the things I&#8217;ve talked about and more, it&#8217;s worth investing a little more to get something extra.  You might not need it now, but you&#8217;ll appreciate having it later on!<\/p>\n",

The days have been passing very slowly and I&#8217;m a bit confused as to which of these events, thoughts and discoveries are from this week and which are older, but hey. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been back in the saddle with my journey&#8217;s to work and back, and this has raised a few interesting cycling things.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Clothing<\/span><\/p>\n<p>First, a long overdue note on clothing.  You&#8217;ve probably noticed that my blog is titled &#8220;Magic Roundabouts and Padded Pants&#8221;.  This is partly from my love of the Magic Roundabout &#8211; iconic of Swindon, my home town and the place we have recently moved to &#8211; and partly inspired by a writer in the Guardian who recently wrote an article on cycling entitled &#8220;Padded pants saved my life&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Now, it&#8217;s not like she fell off into her bike into a lake and would have drowned if it weren&#8217;t for the foam padding in her cycling shorts keeping her afloat (I&#8217;m sure someone can come up with a better story to match the headline) &#8211; she is, of course, speaking metaphorically.  And I can wholeheartedly agree with her sentiment.<\/p>\n<p>Though I don&#8217;t consider myself an official &#8220;lycra lout&#8221;, and despite a healthy dose of initial skepticism, I have definitely discovered &#8220;technical&#8221; clothing.  And there&#8217;s quite a lot of it!  Thankfully, my wife assures me that I don&#8217;t look completely stupid when wearing my cycle gear.  And I don&#8217;t really care if other people do&#8230;my prepared response to anyone who might say that I look stupid would be &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m warm, dry, comfortable and stupid&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of my finds&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>1) Baggies<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve taken to wearing &#8220;Baggies&#8221;, which are padded lycra shorts but they have water-resistant &#8220;baggy&#8221; shorts over the top.  These are great and, so I&#8217;m told, they even look cool!  The difference they make to ride comfort is quite impressive.  I wouldn&#8217;t cycle without them!  They dry quickly too so if you get caught in the rain they&#8217;re usually OK to use again after a few hours.<\/p>\n<p>2) Wrap-around shades<\/p>\n<p>I HATE the thought of these, but they&#8217;re REALLY important.  They keep dirt, grit, wind, rain, flies, branches, sunlight and harmful UV rays out of your eyes.  But surely ordinary shades are OK?  Well, I thought that.  But I bought a pair of inexpensive DHB shades from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiggle.co.uk\/\">Wiggle<\/a> andI wear them ALL the time (when cycling) because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wind gets round frames and still blows into your eyes.<\/li>\n<li>If you have frames you can&#8217;t see out the corner of your eyes &#8211; important when looking around\/behind you.<\/li>\n<li>They have interchangable lenses so you can use them in different lights and weathers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;ll excuse the pun, I&#8217;ve not looked back since!<\/p>\n<p>3) Technical Tee&#8217;s and Jerseys<\/p>\n<p>This took the most convincing before I invested, but it&#8217;s quite simple.  Cotton T-shirts soak up sweat and hold it!  This means that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>they take ages to dry;<\/li>\n<li>they make you cold in a wind;<\/li>\n<li>they saturate &#8211; so they reach a point where they can&#8217;t absorb more sweat, meaning YOU get wet, which is not particularly pleasant<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, &#8220;wicking&#8221; clothing is the answer.  These carry moisture away from the body and let it evaporate quickly.  &#8220;Base layers&#8221; are used for skiing, walking, climbing, etc, and could probably be used for winter cycling.  These are fitted and good for keeping you warm.  You wear them under other things.  &#8220;Technical Tees&#8221; are thinner, cooler and loose-fitting.<\/p>\n<p>I also have a couple of cycle &#8220;jerseys&#8221;, which are more like base layers than tees but have lots of useful pockets and a zip to allow them to be breathable.  My favourite jersey is long-sleeved.  You&#8217;d be surprised how cold your arms get when cycling!  They also tend to come in bright colours &#8211; good for visibility.<\/p>\n<p>4) Gloves<\/p>\n<p>Most obviously for keeping your hands warm &#8211; and you be surprised how you need them even in mild weather!  Especially as you don&#8217;t use your hands and arms much in cycling.  Also important for a bit of shock-protection and pressure relief.  You have important nerves running through your wrist (I&#8217;ll maybe write about RSI involving such nerves at some point!), and continuous pressure and vibration is not really good for any part of your body.<\/p>\n<p>5) Water\/wind proofs!<\/p>\n<p>A lightweight, water and wind-proof top is pretty essential too.  They make these incredibly thin and light these days so you can pack it a small sack even in good weather (this is England we&#8217;re talking about).  From what I can tell you can get specific wind-proofs, but I&#8217;ve got a cheap (\u00a38!) water and wind proof that does the job for my commute.<\/p>\n<p>6) Overshoes<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not SO convinced about these but they&#8217;re worth a mention.  Overshoes are water-resistant, and have a thin layer of something like fleece or neoprene inside.  As the name suggests you wear them over your shoes.  They ARE pretty good at keeping your feet warm, and slightly dry.  They&#8217;re good for really cold weather.  But they don&#8217;t look good and they&#8217;re a bit of overkill really.<\/p>\n<p>7) Headband\/skullcap<\/p>\n<p>Finally, and well worth a mention&#8230;I have a thin, fleecy headband.  With all else covered up, on a cold, wet, windy winters day, your forehead gets REALLY cold when cycling.  It gets painful!  This little thing is a few quid VERY well spent.  My friend Mike is a bit lacking in hair so he has an all-over skullcap equivalent (sorry Mike &#8211; had to mention that!).<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Chains and Sprockets<\/span><\/p>\n<p>My chain broke this week.  Not a complete break, but a link became splayed.  Easily fixed with a pair of pliers but I&#8217;m worried about having a weak link now.  The bike shop says it should be fine but it got me looking at the chain a bit.<\/p>\n<p>I remember when it happened &#8211; I was turning a corner, changing down gears, and there was a clunk.  I didn&#8217;t notice until the next morning.  It seems, and it makes sense the lateral movement from changing gears bends the chain a little.  If you put too much pressure on the chain while it&#8217;s bent in this way, you can weaken or damage the links.<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t have to do it in the end but my cycle maintenance book says that changing the chain can require you to change the rear &#8220;cassette&#8221; &#8211; the gear cogs &#8211; as the sprockets get worn down.  So I had a look at those too while I was looking at the chain and, sure enough, my cogs are looking pretty worn after 800 miles.  I&#8217;ll try to get a photo here at some point.<\/p>\n<p>Chains are important and I&#8217;ll be watching and maintaining my &#8220;transmission&#8221; system more carefully from now on.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Servicing<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So, having had the chain incident I took the bike in for a service &#8211; mostly because we&#8217;re taking the bikes off on holiday to Cornwall and I don&#8217;t want to get caught in the middle of nowhere with something broken.<\/p>\n<p>They didn&#8217;t think the chain would be a problem so that&#8217;s been left&#8230;which makes me cringe slightly in fear&#8230;I hope they know best.<\/p>\n<p>So they offered me a &#8220;brakes and gears&#8221; or a &#8220;full service&#8221;.  I asked how much the full service was and they told me it would be \u00a325.  Which seems very cheap to me &#8211; so I put it in for a full service.<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t expect much for \u00a325.  That can&#8217;t even be 30 minutes labour can it?<\/p>\n<p>Anyway the bike came back.  Disappointingly the gears were worse than when I took it in.  But it was running VERY smooth.<\/p>\n<p>Was it worth it?  Probably not.  I reckon a chain clean and lube, brake adjustment, pumping up the tyres.  That will probably just about do it.  But then \u00a325 wasn&#8217;t much so maybe it was.  Anyone know what they do in a &#8220;full service&#8221;?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Tyres<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I mentioned the tyres.  I&#8217;ve done a couple of REALLY speedy rides recently and I think having well-inflated tyres helps a lot.  I&#8217;ve put a track pump on my Wiggle wish list!!!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Action<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Cycling is a complex thing to get right.  I&#8217;ve been playing around with foot position to try to stop my knees hurting (see <a href=\"http:\/\/wintle.blogspot.com\/2007\/05\/good-20-miles-and-some-amateur.html\">my post on amateur physiology<\/a>).  I do seem to have had some success (25.5 miles today with little pain), but in working out how to do this I think I&#8217;ve realised that I&#8217;m pedalling inefficiently.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been pushing mostly down, starting my push at about 2 o&#8217;clock (if you look at the pedal from the side).  What I&#8217;ve found is that pushing FORWARD from the top of the revolution, from 12 o&#8217;clock, feels much more efficient &#8211; the pedalling action is smoother and it feels like you get power through the full revolution.<\/p>\n<p>Definitely something to work on and possibly to research!  Oh, and I&#8217;m sure cycling shoes and clipless pedals (with the slots that you slot cycling shoes into) probably help with all this too&#8230;that&#8217;s a whole other subject!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Computers and Cadence<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And finally (gosh this has turned into a marathon post), a note on cycle computers.  I bought one ages ago and it&#8217;s REALLY useful.  I spent \u00a335 on a Cateye Micro Wireless.<\/p>\n<p>I hate all the cables that you get with a non-wireless and, despite the advice of the guy in the shop, I gave this a try&#8230;and it&#8217;s been fine!  I&#8217;ve had no problems with it what so ever.  The batteries have lasted well over 6 months and, as far as I know, it&#8217;s never skipped a pulse.<\/p>\n<p>My only regret is not buying one with MORE functions.  You can get computers with what&#8217;s called &#8220;cadence&#8221;.  That is, your rate of pedalling (RPM).  Which, it turns out, is a really useful thing to know.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to trade-up just yet.  But if I was starting again I&#8217;d go for something bigger and better!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Summary<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Phew &#8211; what a lot.  But to anyone serious about getting into cycling, on clothing, on computers, on maintenance, on tools, on ALL the things I&#8217;ve talked about and more, it&#8217;s worth investing a little more to get something extra.  You might not need it now, but you&#8217;ll appreciate having it later on!<\/p>\n",

Probably not something to be proud of but it made me smile!<\/p>\n<p>This afternoon I was a bit wiped out.  Felt quite dizzy and light-headed for most of it.  I think I<br \/>overdo it when I go out cycling on my own.<\/p>\n<p>I heard from an old friend who sounds very serious and grown up now.  That was nice.  Did some gardening, and then generally relaxed.  Something I&#8217;m learning more about how to do these days.<\/p>\n<p>Blimey &#8211; what a mundane post.  I&#8217;m turning into a dull-as-dishwater, serial blogger.  ARRGHH!!!  Why did I feel the need to write that?  No idea.  Ho hum.<\/p>\n",
