Yes, sadly, on a treadmill!<\/p>\n<p>Now, some runners at work have mocked this slightly, calling it things like &#8220;Just bobbing up and down and not really going anywhere&#8221;, and I confess, that&#8217;s exactly what it is.  It&#8217;s not really like running.  But that&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s completely dissimilar too, and with my possibly painful knee I didn&#8217;t want to run 2 miles and have to abort and walk home, so it seemed like the thing to do.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m pleased to say it was a success!  I did get a bit of knee pain, in the left knee, but it wasn&#8217;t too bad and I ran through it and clocked up 5km.  I felt pretty OK afterwards too.<\/p>\n<p>The treadmill was funny.  I mentioned about liking a long stride in my first run, and it was really hard to get that in the gym.  It also seemed to take FOREVER to run 5km.  I can see why people much prefer running outdoors.<\/p>\n<p>But at the same time it was good.  I did the 5km.  I didn&#8217;t get as hot and sweaty as I thought I would.  And I got to watch the highlights of Obama&#8217;s inauguration on the news while I did it.<\/p>\n<p>I now have an odd pain just behind my right knee.  It&#8217;s fading a bit but persisting.  It&#8217;s not holding up the cycling, but I&#8217;m taking it easy, and definitely not running again, until it&#8217;s definitely OK.<\/p>\n<p>The Swindon Half Marathon&#8217;s not quite in sight yet. But maybe I could get used to this running lark after all?!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>So, not to be beaten after a single run, and slightly concerned about the very slight pain in my knee, I headed to the gym last week for my second run.  Yes, sadly, on a treadmill!<\/p>\n<p>Now, some runners at work have mocked this slightly, calling it things like &#8220;Just bobbing up and down and not really going anywhere&#8221;, and I confess, that&#8217;s exactly what it is.  It&#8217;s not really like running.  But that&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s completely dissimilar too, and with my possibly painful knee I didn&#8217;t want to run 2 miles and have to abort and walk home, so it seemed like the thing to do.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m pleased to say it was a success!  I did get a bit of knee pain, in the left knee, but it wasn&#8217;t too bad and I ran through it and clocked up 5km.  I felt pretty OK afterwards too.<\/p>\n<p>The treadmill was funny.  I mentioned about liking a long stride in my first run, and it was really hard to get that in the gym.  It also seemed to take FOREVER to run 5km.  I can see why people much prefer running outdoors.<\/p>\n<p>But at the same time it was good.  I did the 5km.  I didn&#8217;t get as hot and sweaty as I thought I would.  And I got to watch the highlights of Obama&#8217;s inauguration on the news while I did it.<\/p>\n<p>I now have an odd pain just behind my right knee.  It&#8217;s fading a bit but persisting.  It&#8217;s not holding up the cycling, but I&#8217;m taking it easy, and definitely not running again, until it&#8217;s definitely OK.<\/p>\n<p>The Swindon Half Marathon&#8217;s not quite in sight yet. But maybe I could get used to this running lark after all?!<\/p>\n",

\u00a0So I&#8217;m told. \u00a0Weird!<\/p>\n<p>I tried in London. \u00a0Short runs around our old stomping ground there, round Hammersmith Park, under the shadow of BBC TV Centre and past Loftus Road Stadium. \u00a0Even, I might add, down Swindon Street!<\/p>\n<p>But even gait analysis and proper running shoes didn&#8217;t help. \u00a0My knees still hurt.<\/p>\n<p>I did end up seeing a physio though and she gave me some excellent pointers.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever run in Swindon. \u00a0I&#8217;ve not even done the treadmill thing. \u00a0But I have been cycling&#8230;building up fitness and some leg strength.<\/p>\n<p>I guess it was bound to come.\u00a0 It was even somewhat predicted <a title=\"Clapped Out\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/12\/clapped-out\/\">back in October<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>The First Outing<\/h2>\n<p>Wednesday was fine. \u00a0Sunny if cool. \u00a0I&#8217;m just about over my cold and have been back on the bike.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d packed spare clothes for a lunchtime bike ride. \u00a0I think, secretly, running was in the back of my head. \u00a0I knew some of the guys were out running at lunchtimes mid-week.<\/p>\n<p>It was a date with destiny.<\/p>\n<p>The men made the invite and I couldn&#8217;t refuse. \u00a0I tentatively changed into my T-Shirt, cycling longs and my Windstopper jacket. \u00a0I stretched to warm up. \u00a0I checked my watch. \u00a0And&#8230;.I&#8230;.ran!!!<\/p>\n<h2>Relentless<\/h2>\n<p>I deliberately held back. \u00a0I didn&#8217;t want to knacker my knees first time. \u00a0The others were doing a relatively slow pace as they&#8217;re building up fitness themselves, and I didn&#8217;t want to overdo it at the start. \u00a0My aim, if my running continues, is to build on that first run slowly, with the hope of strengthening up the things that usually give me grief.<\/p>\n<p>But despite my slow pace, I found running tough. \u00a0I&#8217;ve always favoured sports with bursts of activity: squash and five-a-side mentioned earlier, and cycling allows it too. \u00a0But my legs don&#8217;t have a freewheel. \u00a0I just had to keep going.<\/p>\n<p>I was also paying a lot of attention to HOW I was running. \u00a0I&#8217;m flat footed and so I was consciously rolling down from the outside edge of my foot. \u00a0I was really noticing that my style got heavy when I was tired or stopped thinking. \u00a0And I was trying out different styles &#8211; a long pace felt easier as I could skim the ground rather then up-and-downing so much &#8211; this felt good but was hard to keep up.<\/p>\n<p>I was also very conscious of my breathing. \u00a0The relentless nature of it meant I didn&#8217;t have time to catch breath, and I was breathing a good deep breath over and over for the whole 4 miles.<\/p>\n<h2>Lessons<\/h2>\n<p>My knees felt OK afterwards, but my back had been hurting and my legs were very tired&#8230;but a nice, well-used kind of tiredness.<\/p>\n<p>It was a great experience. \u00a0I was chuffed to have got round and finished second out of the four of us in about 36 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>But I also learned some things that I&#8217;ll carry on to the bike. \u00a0That control of pace that meant I could keep up a reasonable output continuously. \u00a0And the deeper, slower, more controlled breathing that went along with it. \u00a0There are things that I hope to take on to the wheels to see if they improve my riding.<\/p>\n<h2>Next Time<\/h2>\n<p>Will there be one?<\/p>\n<p>Well, yesterday I did 14 miles on the bike and there is some knee pain coming. \u00a0I wasn&#8217;t running in my proper running shoes and it was a bit far for a first run, so maybe I&#8217;ll try doing the same and see if it gets worse.<\/p>\n<p>I have plenty of physio-prescribed stretches and orthotics for my shoes that should all help.<\/p>\n<p>And, I confess, I enjoyed.<\/p>\n<p>So watch this space, either for reports of the demise of my limb joints, or for the result of my first half marathon!<\/p>\n",

\u00a0So I&#8217;m told. \u00a0Weird!<\/p>\n<p>I tried in London. \u00a0Short runs around our old stomping ground there, round Hammersmith Park, under the shadow of BBC TV Centre and past Loftus Road Stadium. \u00a0Even, I might add, down Swindon Street!<\/p>\n<p>But even gait analysis and proper running shoes didn&#8217;t help. \u00a0My knees still hurt.<\/p>\n<p>I did end up seeing a physio though and she gave me some excellent pointers.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever run in Swindon. \u00a0I&#8217;ve not even done the treadmill thing. \u00a0But I have been cycling&#8230;building up fitness and some leg strength.<\/p>\n<p>I guess it was bound to come.\u00a0 It was even somewhat predicted <a title=\"Clapped Out\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/12\/clapped-out\/\">back in October<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>The First Outing<\/h2>\n<p>Wednesday was fine. \u00a0Sunny if cool. \u00a0I&#8217;m just about over my cold and have been back on the bike.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d packed spare clothes for a lunchtime bike ride. \u00a0I think, secretly, running was in the back of my head. \u00a0I knew some of the guys were out running at lunchtimes mid-week.<\/p>\n<p>It was a date with destiny.<\/p>\n<p>The men made the invite and I couldn&#8217;t refuse. \u00a0I tentatively changed into my T-Shirt, cycling longs and my Windstopper jacket. \u00a0I stretched to warm up. \u00a0I checked my watch. \u00a0And&#8230;.I&#8230;.ran!!!<\/p>\n<h2>Relentless<\/h2>\n<p>I deliberately held back. \u00a0I didn&#8217;t want to knacker my knees first time. \u00a0The others were doing a relatively slow pace as they&#8217;re building up fitness themselves, and I didn&#8217;t want to overdo it at the start. \u00a0My aim, if my running continues, is to build on that first run slowly, with the hope of strengthening up the things that usually give me grief.<\/p>\n<p>But despite my slow pace, I found running tough. \u00a0I&#8217;ve always favoured sports with bursts of activity: squash and five-a-side mentioned earlier, and cycling allows it too. \u00a0But my legs don&#8217;t have a freewheel. \u00a0I just had to keep going.<\/p>\n<p>I was also paying a lot of attention to HOW I was running. \u00a0I&#8217;m flat footed and so I was consciously rolling down from the outside edge of my foot. \u00a0I was really noticing that my style got heavy when I was tired or stopped thinking. \u00a0And I was trying out different styles &#8211; a long pace felt easier as I could skim the ground rather then up-and-downing so much &#8211; this felt good but was hard to keep up.<\/p>\n<p>I was also very conscious of my breathing. \u00a0The relentless nature of it meant I didn&#8217;t have time to catch breath, and I was breathing a good deep breath over and over for the whole 4 miles.<\/p>\n<h2>Lessons<\/h2>\n<p>My knees felt OK afterwards, but my back had been hurting and my legs were very tired&#8230;but a nice, well-used kind of tiredness.<\/p>\n<p>It was a great experience. \u00a0I was chuffed to have got round and finished second out of the four of us in about 36 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>But I also learned some things that I&#8217;ll carry on to the bike. \u00a0That control of pace that meant I could keep up a reasonable output continuously. \u00a0And the deeper, slower, more controlled breathing that went along with it. \u00a0There are things that I hope to take on to the wheels to see if they improve my riding.<\/p>\n<h2>Next Time<\/h2>\n<p>Will there be one?<\/p>\n<p>Well, yesterday I did 14 miles on the bike and there is some knee pain coming. \u00a0I wasn&#8217;t running in my proper running shoes and it was a bit far for a first run, so maybe I&#8217;ll try doing the same and see if it gets worse.<\/p>\n<p>I have plenty of physio-prescribed stretches and orthotics for my shoes that should all help.<\/p>\n<p>And, I confess, I enjoyed.<\/p>\n<p>So watch this space, either for reports of the demise of my limb joints, or for the result of my first half marathon!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Happy New Year folks.<\/p>\n<p>In amongst all the technical learning I&#8217;ve been doing there&#8217;s been plenty of other stuff going on that I&#8217;ve not had time to write about.<\/p>\n<h2>Christmas<\/h2>\n<p>We hosted Christmas for the first time this year.\u00a0 It was quite a success too!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We&#8217;d planned the meal well, keeping it simple but tasty.\u00a0 Hint: smoked salmon on garlic-rubbed bruschetta with a dollop of pesto&#8230;YUM!<\/li>\n<li>Our fears of not finding a Turkey were not met (but we were surprised at how expensive they were).<\/li>\n<li>We learned how not to make stuffing.\u00a0 We&#8217;ve yet to learn the correct way!<\/li>\n<li>Starting cooking was much easier than finishing it all off.<\/li>\n<li>We learned not to plan to host a big meal with lots of leftovers and then go away for a week!<\/li>\n<li>Washing up is more of a job than the preparation and cooking.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Anyway, a good experience of cooking a fancy meal for five and we&#8217;d do it again!<\/p>\n<h2>The Cough<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been fighting off my FOURTH attack from the really nasty cold that&#8217;s been going around this year.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the same one and I&#8217;ve not been able to fight it off.\u00a0 The last few months has been really bad for illnesses for everyone.\u00a0 Even the toughest people I know have had some sort of illness and time off work, and most have been got several times.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re now also in the grip of a really cold snap which can&#8217;t be helping.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I had a couple of days of feeling really cold-infected whilst we were down in Devon over Christmas and New Year, and that quickly went away, but I&#8217;m still dealing with the aftermath &#8211; an annoying tickly dry cough.\u00a0 It&#8217;s almost gone now but has been quite an irritant in the last week and a half.<\/p>\n<h2>Back and Cycling<\/h2>\n<p>Unfortunately all the sitting down I&#8217;ve done as a result of lazing around in comfy chairs and extra-soft mattresses in Devon over Christmas has given me a bad back again (seems to be a normal way for me to start the year).<\/p>\n<p>This along with extra-cold, icy, and dangerous weather, and the need to shuttle various things to work and back, has meant that I&#8217;ve not been cycling much.<\/p>\n<p>This is a bit disappointing for me, as I really wanted to try and keep my fitness up over the winter for a good start in the spring, and I was getting all kitted out to do that!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also annoying because once you&#8217;ve had a bit of time out it&#8217;s even harder to get up the motivation to get going again.<\/p>\n<p>I did manage to cycle-commute once this week, on Thursday.\u00a0 But to my dismay I found that the council don&#8217;t seem to do much (any) gritting of cycle paths, and there were some fairly treacherous bits of cycling to be done.\u00a0 So I really need to wait for a thaw.<\/p>\n<p>Today it&#8217;s been sub-zero all day.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s hope that the forecast for a warmer Saturday is correct!<\/p>\n<p>In any case, I still have a good 2 months of winter left so I need to be disciplined and get some daylight riding in, alongside some trips to the gym, to get fitness up!<\/p>\n<p>Roll on 2009 then!!!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>Geeky post&#8230;sorry if you get lost.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m still playing with Web Development languages and tools.\u00a0 A few days in Devon with not much to do is a good time to invest in some self-learning and I&#8217;ve been given the O&#8217;Reilly <a href=\"http:\/\/oreilly.com\/catalog\/9780596514082\/\">JavaScript and DHTML Cookbook<\/a> for Christmas too, so I&#8217;m working through that.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty proficient with server-side scripting now, but it had limitatations and performance issues.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve been so impressed by some of the Web 2.0-type sites out there (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.letsfreckle.com\">www.letsfreckle.com<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\">www.twitter.com<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\">www.facebook.com<\/a>) that I feel I really need to get a handle on client-side scripting too.\u00a0 That&#8217;s where JavaScript and DHTML come in.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m really not liking JavaScript.\u00a0 See, I was educated with a quite deep knowledge of programming languages.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve studied both imperative (statement-based) and declarative (logic-based) languages.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve studied compiler construction and language structure and analysis.\u00a0 I understand object-orientation.\u00a0 I know what&#8217;s going on under the hood, and I know the pitfalls of various programming languages styles.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also got a background in safety-critical software engineering.\u00a0 Writing programs where you know what must happen and if that doesn&#8217;t happen then people&#8217;s lives are at risk.\u00a0 I like to know what my programs are doing.<\/p>\n<p>And with JavaScript, most of the time, I don&#8217;t have a clue what&#8217;s going on!\u00a0 The language makes so many guesses on your behalf, allows you to pass objects and functions as data and doesn&#8217;t (appear to) contain notation for distinguishing between passing parameters by value and by reference.<\/p>\n<p>To the uninitiated this will mean nothing&#8230;let&#8217;s take an example.\u00a0 Lets say we want to write a little computer program called &#8220;add-one&#8221;.\u00a0 This program has one input, a number, and one output, which will be the number plus one.<\/p>\n<p>The preferred way to do this is to write what&#8217;s called a &#8220;function&#8221;.\u00a0 A function is a little program which gives you back a value.\u00a0 Like this:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">function add-one ( x )\nbegin\n\u00a0 return x + 1\nend<\/pre>\n<p>Here, x is the input and we &#8220;return&#8221; x + 1.\u00a0 Simple.\u00a0 So we can now do:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">a =\u00a01\nprint a\nb = add-one ( a )\nprint b<\/pre>\n<p>I hope you can see (I&#8217;m racing ahead) that this will print &#8220;1&#8221; then &#8220;2&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>But you can also write this as what&#8217;s called a procedure.\u00a0 A procedure does some &#8220;stuff&#8221; but doesnt return a value.\u00a0 Like this:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">procedure add-one ( x )\nbegin\n\u00a0 x = x + 1\nend<\/pre>\n<p>So what happens if we do the following with the procedure?:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">a = 1\nprint a\nadd-one ( a )\nprint a<\/pre>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy!&#8221; you may say, &#8220;it prints 1 then 2 again&#8221;.\u00a0 But it&#8217;s not that easy.\u00a0 Sometimes the language will take a &#8220;copy&#8221; of x into the procedure and modify the copy, leaving the original untouched.\u00a0 This is called &#8220;pass-by-value&#8221;.\u00a0 Why would you want to do this?\u00a0 Well, let&#8217;s write a procedure that has someone&#8217;s full name as an input and prints their first name:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">procedure print-first-name ( name )\nbegin\n\u00a0\u00a0remove surname from name\n\u00a0 print name\nend<\/pre>\n<p>In this case we only want &#8220;name&#8221; to change within the procedure or the following would not work:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name = \"Fred Flintstone\"\nprint-first-name ( my-name )\u00a0\nprint-surname ( my-name )<\/pre>\n<p>Here, print-surname would not work because the print-first-name removed the surname from my-name.<\/p>\n<p>Your head probably aches now.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, JavaScript does LOTS of this sort of thing where pass-by-vaue and pass-by-reference really make a difference.<\/p>\n<p>Another complication is that there&#8217;s two ways to create strings that return different types:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name1 = \"Fred Flintstone\";<\/pre>\n<p>and<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name2 =\u00a0new string(\"Fred Flintstone\");<\/pre>\n<p>But these actualy do different things.\u00a0 One creates a string <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">value<\/span> and one creates a string <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">object<\/span>.\u00a0 And we find that:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name1 == my-name2<\/pre>\n<p>is true because the interpreter automatically converts the type but<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name1 === my-name2<\/pre>\n<p>is false because it does type comparison too.<\/p>\n<p>It has a variable called &#8220;this&#8221;, which refers to different things in different contexts.<\/p>\n<p>And it doesn&#8217;t enforce important bits of syntax.\u00a0 You&#8217;re supposed to end statements with a semi-colon, but if you split a statement over a line, then it will add the semi-colon at the line end (if that&#8217;s a valid place to end a statement).<\/p>\n<p>These are all very minor examples of how this is a complex, weakly-typed, language the enforces very little checking on the programmer, makes lots of assumptions about what you mean in your program, and doesn&#8217;t seem to give you ways to enforce the meaning that you want.<\/p>\n<p>All in all, I can see why so many web applications are so liable to not working.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps with a proper JavaScript tutorial, rather than just a cookbook, I might get a better grasp of the language and find some strong typing and better structures.<\/p>\n<p>But for the moment it&#8217;s looking pretty complicated and chaotic!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Geeky post&#8230;sorry if you get lost.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m still playing with Web Development languages and tools.\u00a0 A few days in Devon with not much to do is a good time to invest in some self-learning and I&#8217;ve been given the O&#8217;Reilly <a href=\"http:\/\/oreilly.com\/catalog\/9780596514082\/\">JavaScript and DHTML Cookbook<\/a> for Christmas too, so I&#8217;m working through that.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty proficient with server-side scripting now, but it had limitatations and performance issues.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve been so impressed by some of the Web 2.0-type sites out there (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.letsfreckle.com\">www.letsfreckle.com<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\">www.twitter.com<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\">www.facebook.com<\/a>) that I feel I really need to get a handle on client-side scripting too.\u00a0 That&#8217;s where JavaScript and DHTML come in.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m really not liking JavaScript.\u00a0 See, I was educated with a quite deep knowledge of programming languages.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve studied both imperative (statement-based) and declarative (logic-based) languages.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve studied compiler construction and language structure and analysis.\u00a0 I understand object-orientation.\u00a0 I know what&#8217;s going on under the hood, and I know the pitfalls of various programming languages styles.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also got a background in safety-critical software engineering.\u00a0 Writing programs where you know what must happen and if that doesn&#8217;t happen then people&#8217;s lives are at risk.\u00a0 I like to know what my programs are doing.<\/p>\n<p>And with JavaScript, most of the time, I don&#8217;t have a clue what&#8217;s going on!\u00a0 The language makes so many guesses on your behalf, allows you to pass objects and functions as data and doesn&#8217;t (appear to) contain notation for distinguishing between passing parameters by value and by reference.<\/p>\n<p>To the uninitiated this will mean nothing&#8230;let&#8217;s take an example.\u00a0 Lets say we want to write a little computer program called &#8220;add-one&#8221;.\u00a0 This program has one input, a number, and one output, which will be the number plus one.<\/p>\n<p>The preferred way to do this is to write what&#8217;s called a &#8220;function&#8221;.\u00a0 A function is a little program which gives you back a value.\u00a0 Like this:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">function add-one ( x )\nbegin\n\u00a0 return x + 1\nend<\/pre>\n<p>Here, x is the input and we &#8220;return&#8221; x + 1.\u00a0 Simple.\u00a0 So we can now do:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">a =\u00a01\nprint a\nb = add-one ( a )\nprint b<\/pre>\n<p>I hope you can see (I&#8217;m racing ahead) that this will print &#8220;1&#8221; then &#8220;2&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>But you can also write this as what&#8217;s called a procedure.\u00a0 A procedure does some &#8220;stuff&#8221; but doesnt return a value.\u00a0 Like this:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">procedure add-one ( x )\nbegin\n\u00a0 x = x + 1\nend<\/pre>\n<p>So what happens if we do the following with the procedure?:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">a = 1\nprint a\nadd-one ( a )\nprint a<\/pre>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy!&#8221; you may say, &#8220;it prints 1 then 2 again&#8221;.\u00a0 But it&#8217;s not that easy.\u00a0 Sometimes the language will take a &#8220;copy&#8221; of x into the procedure and modify the copy, leaving the original untouched.\u00a0 This is called &#8220;pass-by-value&#8221;.\u00a0 Why would you want to do this?\u00a0 Well, let&#8217;s write a procedure that has someone&#8217;s full name as an input and prints their first name:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">procedure print-first-name ( name )\nbegin\n\u00a0\u00a0remove surname from name\n\u00a0 print name\nend<\/pre>\n<p>In this case we only want &#8220;name&#8221; to change within the procedure or the following would not work:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name = \"Fred Flintstone\"\nprint-first-name ( my-name )\u00a0\nprint-surname ( my-name )<\/pre>\n<p>Here, print-surname would not work because the print-first-name removed the surname from my-name.<\/p>\n<p>Your head probably aches now.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, JavaScript does LOTS of this sort of thing where pass-by-vaue and pass-by-reference really make a difference.<\/p>\n<p>Another complication is that there&#8217;s two ways to create strings that return different types:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name1 = \"Fred Flintstone\";<\/pre>\n<p>and<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name2 =\u00a0new string(\"Fred Flintstone\");<\/pre>\n<p>But these actualy do different things.\u00a0 One creates a string <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">value<\/span> and one creates a string <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">object<\/span>.\u00a0 And we find that:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name1 == my-name2<\/pre>\n<p>is true because the interpreter automatically converts the type but<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name1 === my-name2<\/pre>\n<p>is false because it does type comparison too.<\/p>\n<p>It has a variable called &#8220;this&#8221;, which refers to different things in different contexts.<\/p>\n<p>And it doesn&#8217;t enforce important bits of syntax.\u00a0 You&#8217;re supposed to end statements with a semi-colon, but if you split a statement over a line, then it will add the semi-colon at the line end (if that&#8217;s a valid place to end a statement).<\/p>\n<p>These are all very minor examples of how this is a complex, weakly-typed, language the enforces very little checking on the programmer, makes lots of assumptions about what you mean in your program, and doesn&#8217;t seem to give you ways to enforce the meaning that you want.<\/p>\n<p>All in all, I can see why so many web applications are so liable to not working.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps with a proper JavaScript tutorial, rather than just a cookbook, I might get a better grasp of the language and find some strong typing and better structures.<\/p>\n<p>But for the moment it&#8217;s looking pretty complicated and chaotic!<\/p>\n",

&#8211; an idea which hasn&#8217;t taken off in a big way but which is still milling around.\u00a0 My old friend and ex-colleague <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/04\/24\/a-tribute-to-peter-amey\/\">Peter Amey<\/a> lost his long fight against cancer.\u00a0 And we had a go at <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/04\/24\/freecycling\/\">Freecycling<\/a> some of our stuff &#8211; which turned out to be a joy!<\/p>\n<p><strong>May<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well into Spring and with summer coming we had to get some serious work in on the garden, <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/05\/03\/my-new-least-favourite-plants\/\">fighting off the weeds<\/a>\u00a0and generally <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/05\/11\/garden-progress\/\">making the vegetable patch useful<\/a> for growing vegetables in.\u00a0 We also discovered that we might, at some point, be involved in a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/05\/04\/church-planting\/\">missional church plant<\/a>!\u00a0 This is slowly becoming reality but in God&#8217;s time, not ours!<\/p>\n<p><strong>June<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The summer was a bit of a wash out from what I remember, but we had glorious weather for <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/06\/01\/the-week-in-summary\/\">M and A&#8217;s Wedding<\/a> with a fantastic reception at the Four Pillars\u00a0Hotel.\u00a0 We started <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/06\/13\/shopping-beer-and-slugs\/\">waging war against the slugs<\/a> and we <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/06\/14\/having-a-wii\/\">bought a Wii <\/a>(which I posted some <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/11\/02\/the-wii\/\">more detailed comments <\/a>on later in the year) and a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/11\/08\/getting-wii-fit\/\">Wii Fit<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>July<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This was a good cycling month.\u00a0 Well, it started badly by <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/07\/01\/the-green-cross-code\/\">crashing into a schoolgirl<\/a>, but I was subsequently inspired with new cycling gadgets (<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/07\/12\/race-blades-tm\/\">Race Blades<\/a> and a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/08\/06\/garmin-forerunner-50-heart-rate-monitor\/\">Garmin Heart Rate Monitor<\/a>),\u00a0the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/07\/17\/lots-of-bike-news\/\">Swindon Cycle Challenge<\/a>\u00a0(which I was quite <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/11\/07\/eek-im-an-evangelist\/\">an evangelist <\/a>for)\u00a0and the long, warm days.\u00a0 We had a week&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/08\/28\/holidays-part-1-a-holiday-in-northern-ireland\/\">holiday in Northern Ireland<\/a>\u00a0and, amazingly, stuff seemed to actually be growing in our garden.\u00a0 Finally, internet search engine Cuil was lanched and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/07\/28\/how-cuil\/\">I\u00a0did my best at putting it through its paces<\/a> on behalf of the world.\u00a0 This was a good month!<\/p>\n<p><strong>August<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Was WET.\u00a0 Which presented it&#8217;s own <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/08\/20\/wet-weather\/\">set of cycling problems<\/a>, but I found a dry day on which to do <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/08\/23\/small-improvements\/\">my longest bike ride so far<\/a>\u00a0and Sally spent 10 days away at the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/08\/26\/a-visit-to-yomac\/\">YOMAC Residential<\/a>\u00a0&#8211; the start of something good as running YOMAC is now part of her job!<\/p>\n<p><strong>September<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/09\/03\/google-chrome\/\">Google launched Chrome<\/a>.\u00a0 We started <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/09\/08\/the-harvest\/\">harvesting<\/a> from the garden.\u00a0 We took up <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/09\/30\/dancing\/\">latin and ballroom dance classes<\/a> (well, we did that in the summer but I only just got around to writing about it), and we had a fantastic <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/09\/30\/on-the-leftagain\/\">holiday in Sicily<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>October<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Looks like I spent most of October writing up our holiday to Sicily!\u00a0 But there were lots more new things too.\u00a0 We somehow found time to cheer on our friends in the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/12\/clapped-out\/\">Swindon Half Marathon<\/a>, I started to try <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/15\/playing-with-symfony\/\">learning web development methods <\/a>(and I still am).\u00a0 I took up <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/16\/new-gamenew-dangers\/\">a dangerous new sport<\/a>.\u00a0 And <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/19\/discipleship-academy-and-soulspace\/\">Discipleship Academy and Soul Space<\/a> had inspiring starts at church.\u00a0 I also took up leading music in church, but I don&#8217;t seem to have written anything about it here.<\/p>\n<p><strong>November<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Was busy and I didn&#8217;t get to write much.\u00a0 But busy is good!\u00a0 We finally seemed to <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/11\/19\/a-busy-time\/\">find the source of the rats, we did a grand tour of the north and had &#8220;fun&#8221; at Ikea<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>December<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Nights drew in and with colds and busy times at work we weren&#8217;t up to much.\u00a0 I found time to <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/12\/21\/a-successful-move\/\">move the blog<\/a> to its new home and get <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/12\/21\/spin-spin-spin-the-wheel-of-fortune\/\">intrigued by roulette<\/a> at my work Christmas party.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Looking back<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So, what a year!\u00a0 It&#8217;s not felt like we&#8217;ve done much.\u00a0 The garden was neglected, we didn&#8217;t do as much house decorating as we would have liked, but looking back, we&#8217;ve done a heck of a lot!\u00a0 God has been at work, healing me back in February and\u00a0leading us towards new bits of work and new involvement in our community, and we thank God for working in our lives.<\/p>\n<p>Our hopes next year are for another year of being settled in Swindon and of good health, especially for me.\u00a0 We hope that the Church Plant will take off and that that will be something we&#8217;re a part of.\u00a0 We hope for another successful harvest (after another load of hard work).\u00a0 We hope that we&#8217;ll get our bedroom decorated, and clear out a load of stuff from the house at the same time.\u00a0 We hope that, in this time of difficulty for business, we&#8217;ll both be putting our trust in our God and not in our jobs or our money or our posessions.\u00a0 And above all, we pray that God will, again, be a part of our lives in 2009.<\/p>\n",

No no no.\u00a0 You&#8217;ve got it ALL wrong.<\/p>\n<p>Oh dear.\u00a0 I&#8217;m sounding a bit &#8220;bah humbug&#8221;&#8230;time to turn the emotion around.<\/p>\n<p>I like Christmas.\u00a0 And I love giving gifts.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve not been very good this year, but I&#8217;m generally pretty good at mentally noting things people like or are interested in so that that can become a gift.\u00a0 And it&#8217;s always fun and exciting watching someone discover a creative and well-thought-out gift.<\/p>\n<p>Giving is a joy.\u00a0 But it&#8217;s not a responsibility as such, and I, personally, would rather not have to wait for birthdays to give people gifts or, worse still, Christmas, when you have to do lots all at once.\u00a0 Spontaneous giving is more even more fun and exciting than scheduled giving!<\/p>\n<p>And, of course, we must not forget that Christmas is really about celebrating the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ.\u00a0 And, much as he received the first Christmas gifts of Gold, Incense and Myrrh, as a symbol of his status and his destiny, he would much rather we gave gifts of love, justice, mercy, and grace.\u00a0 He wouldn&#8217;t have us put up signs saying &#8220;Santa Stop Here&#8221; so that we can get given gifts; he would have us leave our own homes and go and find people who are really in need and give to them.<\/p>\n<p>Happy Christmas one and all.\u00a0 I hope that you are the recipient of many useful, well-thought-out presents.\u00a0 I hope that you gracefully and joyfully receive them.\u00a0 I hope that you enjoy your own giving &#8211; whatever form it may take.\u00a0 And I hope also that you know God&#8217;s gift of peace.<\/p>\n<p>P.S. My favourite version of the real Christmas story is from Luke&#8217;s Gospel.\u00a0\u00a0 <a title=\"The Christmas Story from the Gospel of Luke\" href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Luke1:1-2:20;&amp;version=31;\" target=\"_blank\">Perhaps you&#8217;ll join with me in reading it<\/a>.<\/p>\n",

No no no.\u00a0 You&#8217;ve got it ALL wrong.<\/p>\n<p>Oh dear.\u00a0 I&#8217;m sounding a bit &#8220;bah humbug&#8221;&#8230;time to turn the emotion around.<\/p>\n<p>I like Christmas.\u00a0 And I love giving gifts.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve not been very good this year, but I&#8217;m generally pretty good at mentally noting things people like or are interested in so that that can become a gift.\u00a0 And it&#8217;s always fun and exciting watching someone discover a creative and well-thought-out gift.<\/p>\n<p>Giving is a joy.\u00a0 But it&#8217;s not a responsibility as such, and I, personally, would rather not have to wait for birthdays to give people gifts or, worse still, Christmas, when you have to do lots all at once.\u00a0 Spontaneous giving is more even more fun and exciting than scheduled giving!<\/p>\n<p>And, of course, we must not forget that Christmas is really about celebrating the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ.\u00a0 And, much as he received the first Christmas gifts of Gold, Incense and Myrrh, as a symbol of his status and his destiny, he would much rather we gave gifts of love, justice, mercy, and grace.\u00a0 He wouldn&#8217;t have us put up signs saying &#8220;Santa Stop Here&#8221; so that we can get given gifts; he would have us leave our own homes and go and find people who are really in need and give to them.<\/p>\n<p>Happy Christmas one and all.\u00a0 I hope that you are the recipient of many useful, well-thought-out presents.\u00a0 I hope that you gracefully and joyfully receive them.\u00a0 I hope that you enjoy your own giving &#8211; whatever form it may take.\u00a0 And I hope also that you know God&#8217;s gift of peace.<\/p>\n<p>P.S. My favourite version of the real Christmas story is from Luke&#8217;s Gospel.\u00a0\u00a0 <a title=\"The Christmas Story from the Gospel of Luke\" href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Luke1:1-2:20;&amp;version=31;\" target=\"_blank\">Perhaps you&#8217;ll join with me in reading it<\/a>.<\/p>\n",
