                "rendered": "<p>We started work on the garden again last weekend.  Sally&#8217;s been quite prepared with ideas and we&#8217;ve ordered our seeds for the year.  The weekend was mild and dryish&#8230;time to start preparing the ground!<\/p>\n<p>The plan is to have raised beds.  This is where you put wooden borders up and contain within it a raised area of soil.  Sally&#8217;s mum, a VERY keen gardener, raves about them and we&#8217;ve been told that they have many benefits, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Warming up quicker in spring<\/li>\n<li>Not needing digging<\/li>\n<li>Better drainage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Plus, you get to put paths between them, which, potentially means you don&#8217;t get as muddy.  You just kneel at the side and reach in to do your planting\/tending\/harvesting.<\/p>\n<p>So, this weekend we tried to start making this a reality, and rapidly ran into some stumbling blocks.<\/p>\n<p>We measured up and did the maths.  Our plot can have 4 beds, each the full width of the garden (about 5 metres), and each about 1.5 metres wide.  A nice lot of space.<\/p>\n<p>But that means we&#8217;ll need about 26 metres of timber for each plot to do the edges.  Once that&#8217;s done we&#8217;ll need to fill them with earth too.  We calculated this on the basis of needing 30cm deep of earth and it came to around 2500 litres of soil for each bed.<\/p>\n<p>WOW!!!<\/p>\n<p>In reality it won&#8217;t quite be that much.  But it&#8217;s still going to be a lot.<\/p>\n<p>So, looks like it&#8217;s off to the reclaimed timber yard for some wood at some point, and then to the council&#8230;several times&#8230;for some cheap compost.<\/p>\n<p>You know, maybe we won&#8217;t get ALL the beds done this year.  But we&#8217;ll try and make a start. Watch this space for progress.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>We started work on the garden again last weekend.  Sally&#8217;s been quite prepared with ideas and we&#8217;ve ordered our seeds for the year.  The weekend was mild and dryish&#8230;time to start preparing the ground!<\/p>\n<p>The plan is to have raised beds.  This is where you put wooden borders up and contain within it a raised area of soil.  Sally&#8217;s mum, a VERY keen gardener, raves about them and we&#8217;ve been told that they have many benefits, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Warming up quicker in spring<\/li>\n<li>Not needing digging<\/li>\n<li>Better drainage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Plus, you get to put paths between them, which, potentially means you don&#8217;t get as muddy.  You just kneel at the side and reach in to do your planting\/tending\/harvesting.<\/p>\n<p>So, this weekend we tried to start making this a reality, and rapidly ran into some stumbling blocks.<\/p>\n<p>We measured up and did the maths.  Our plot can have 4 beds, each the full width of the garden (about 5 metres), and each about 1.5 metres wide.  A nice lot of space.<\/p>\n<p>But that means we&#8217;ll need about 26 metres of timber for each plot to do the edges.  Once that&#8217;s done we&#8217;ll need to fill them with earth too.  We calculated this on the basis of needing 30cm deep of earth and it came to around 2500 litres of soil for each bed.<\/p>\n<p>WOW!!!<\/p>\n<p>In reality it won&#8217;t quite be that much.  But it&#8217;s still going to be a lot.<\/p>\n<p>So, looks like it&#8217;s off to the reclaimed timber yard for some wood at some point, and then to the council&#8230;several times&#8230;for some cheap compost.<\/p>\n<p>You know, maybe we won&#8217;t get ALL the beds done this year.  But we&#8217;ll try and make a start. Watch this space for progress.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>So, not to be beaten after a single run, and slightly concerned about the very slight pain in my knee, I headed to the gym last week for my second run.  Yes, sadly, on a treadmill!<\/p>\n<p>Now, some runners at work have mocked this slightly, calling it things like &#8220;Just bobbing up and down and not really going anywhere&#8221;, and I confess, that&#8217;s exactly what it is.  It&#8217;s not really like running.  But that&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s completely dissimilar too, and with my possibly painful knee I didn&#8217;t want to run 2 miles and have to abort and walk home, so it seemed like the thing to do.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m pleased to say it was a success!  I did get a bit of knee pain, in the left knee, but it wasn&#8217;t too bad and I ran through it and clocked up 5km.  I felt pretty OK afterwards too.<\/p>\n<p>The treadmill was funny.  I mentioned about liking a long stride in my first run, and it was really hard to get that in the gym.  It also seemed to take FOREVER to run 5km.  I can see why people much prefer running outdoors.<\/p>\n<p>But at the same time it was good.  I did the 5km.  I didn&#8217;t get as hot and sweaty as I thought I would.  And I got to watch the highlights of Obama&#8217;s inauguration on the news while I did it.<\/p>\n<p>I now have an odd pain just behind my right knee.  It&#8217;s fading a bit but persisting.  It&#8217;s not holding up the cycling, but I&#8217;m taking it easy, and definitely not running again, until it&#8217;s definitely OK.<\/p>\n<p>The Swindon Half Marathon&#8217;s not quite in sight yet. But maybe I could get used to this running lark after all?!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>So, not to be beaten after a single run, and slightly concerned about the very slight pain in my knee, I headed to the gym last week for my second run.  Yes, sadly, on a treadmill!<\/p>\n<p>Now, some runners at work have mocked this slightly, calling it things like &#8220;Just bobbing up and down and not really going anywhere&#8221;, and I confess, that&#8217;s exactly what it is.  It&#8217;s not really like running.  But that&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s completely dissimilar too, and with my possibly painful knee I didn&#8217;t want to run 2 miles and have to abort and walk home, so it seemed like the thing to do.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m pleased to say it was a success!  I did get a bit of knee pain, in the left knee, but it wasn&#8217;t too bad and I ran through it and clocked up 5km.  I felt pretty OK afterwards too.<\/p>\n<p>The treadmill was funny.  I mentioned about liking a long stride in my first run, and it was really hard to get that in the gym.  It also seemed to take FOREVER to run 5km.  I can see why people much prefer running outdoors.<\/p>\n<p>But at the same time it was good.  I did the 5km.  I didn&#8217;t get as hot and sweaty as I thought I would.  And I got to watch the highlights of Obama&#8217;s inauguration on the news while I did it.<\/p>\n<p>I now have an odd pain just behind my right knee.  It&#8217;s fading a bit but persisting.  It&#8217;s not holding up the cycling, but I&#8217;m taking it easy, and definitely not running again, until it&#8217;s definitely OK.<\/p>\n<p>The Swindon Half Marathon&#8217;s not quite in sight yet. But maybe I could get used to this running lark after all?!<\/p>\n",

\u00a0So I&#8217;m told. \u00a0Weird!<\/p>\n<p>I tried in London. \u00a0Short runs around our old stomping ground there, round Hammersmith Park, under the shadow of BBC TV Centre and past Loftus Road Stadium. \u00a0Even, I might add, down Swindon Street!<\/p>\n<p>But even gait analysis and proper running shoes didn&#8217;t help. \u00a0My knees still hurt.<\/p>\n<p>I did end up seeing a physio though and she gave me some excellent pointers.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever run in Swindon. \u00a0I&#8217;ve not even done the treadmill thing. \u00a0But I have been cycling&#8230;building up fitness and some leg strength.<\/p>\n<p>I guess it was bound to come.\u00a0 It was even somewhat predicted <a title=\"Clapped Out\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/12\/clapped-out\/\">back in October<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>The First Outing<\/h2>\n<p>Wednesday was fine. \u00a0Sunny if cool. \u00a0I&#8217;m just about over my cold and have been back on the bike.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d packed spare clothes for a lunchtime bike ride. \u00a0I think, secretly, running was in the back of my head. \u00a0I knew some of the guys were out running at lunchtimes mid-week.<\/p>\n<p>It was a date with destiny.<\/p>\n<p>The men made the invite and I couldn&#8217;t refuse. \u00a0I tentatively changed into my T-Shirt, cycling longs and my Windstopper jacket. \u00a0I stretched to warm up. \u00a0I checked my watch. \u00a0And&#8230;.I&#8230;.ran!!!<\/p>\n<h2>Relentless<\/h2>\n<p>I deliberately held back. \u00a0I didn&#8217;t want to knacker my knees first time. \u00a0The others were doing a relatively slow pace as they&#8217;re building up fitness themselves, and I didn&#8217;t want to overdo it at the start. \u00a0My aim, if my running continues, is to build on that first run slowly, with the hope of strengthening up the things that usually give me grief.<\/p>\n<p>But despite my slow pace, I found running tough. \u00a0I&#8217;ve always favoured sports with bursts of activity: squash and five-a-side mentioned earlier, and cycling allows it too. \u00a0But my legs don&#8217;t have a freewheel. \u00a0I just had to keep going.<\/p>\n<p>I was also paying a lot of attention to HOW I was running. \u00a0I&#8217;m flat footed and so I was consciously rolling down from the outside edge of my foot. \u00a0I was really noticing that my style got heavy when I was tired or stopped thinking. \u00a0And I was trying out different styles &#8211; a long pace felt easier as I could skim the ground rather then up-and-downing so much &#8211; this felt good but was hard to keep up.<\/p>\n<p>I was also very conscious of my breathing. \u00a0The relentless nature of it meant I didn&#8217;t have time to catch breath, and I was breathing a good deep breath over and over for the whole 4 miles.<\/p>\n<h2>Lessons<\/h2>\n<p>My knees felt OK afterwards, but my back had been hurting and my legs were very tired&#8230;but a nice, well-used kind of tiredness.<\/p>\n<p>It was a great experience. \u00a0I was chuffed to have got round and finished second out of the four of us in about 36 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>But I also learned some things that I&#8217;ll carry on to the bike. \u00a0That control of pace that meant I could keep up a reasonable output continuously. \u00a0And the deeper, slower, more controlled breathing that went along with it. \u00a0There are things that I hope to take on to the wheels to see if they improve my riding.<\/p>\n<h2>Next Time<\/h2>\n<p>Will there be one?<\/p>\n<p>Well, yesterday I did 14 miles on the bike and there is some knee pain coming. \u00a0I wasn&#8217;t running in my proper running shoes and it was a bit far for a first run, so maybe I&#8217;ll try doing the same and see if it gets worse.<\/p>\n<p>I have plenty of physio-prescribed stretches and orthotics for my shoes that should all help.<\/p>\n<p>And, I confess, I enjoyed.<\/p>\n<p>So watch this space, either for reports of the demise of my limb joints, or for the result of my first half marathon!<\/p>\n",

\u00a0So I&#8217;m told. \u00a0Weird!<\/p>\n<p>I tried in London. \u00a0Short runs around our old stomping ground there, round Hammersmith Park, under the shadow of BBC TV Centre and past Loftus Road Stadium. \u00a0Even, I might add, down Swindon Street!<\/p>\n<p>But even gait analysis and proper running shoes didn&#8217;t help. \u00a0My knees still hurt.<\/p>\n<p>I did end up seeing a physio though and she gave me some excellent pointers.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever run in Swindon. \u00a0I&#8217;ve not even done the treadmill thing. \u00a0But I have been cycling&#8230;building up fitness and some leg strength.<\/p>\n<p>I guess it was bound to come.\u00a0 It was even somewhat predicted <a title=\"Clapped Out\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/12\/clapped-out\/\">back in October<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>The First Outing<\/h2>\n<p>Wednesday was fine. \u00a0Sunny if cool. \u00a0I&#8217;m just about over my cold and have been back on the bike.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d packed spare clothes for a lunchtime bike ride. \u00a0I think, secretly, running was in the back of my head. \u00a0I knew some of the guys were out running at lunchtimes mid-week.<\/p>\n<p>It was a date with destiny.<\/p>\n<p>The men made the invite and I couldn&#8217;t refuse. \u00a0I tentatively changed into my T-Shirt, cycling longs and my Windstopper jacket. \u00a0I stretched to warm up. \u00a0I checked my watch. \u00a0And&#8230;.I&#8230;.ran!!!<\/p>\n<h2>Relentless<\/h2>\n<p>I deliberately held back. \u00a0I didn&#8217;t want to knacker my knees first time. \u00a0The others were doing a relatively slow pace as they&#8217;re building up fitness themselves, and I didn&#8217;t want to overdo it at the start. \u00a0My aim, if my running continues, is to build on that first run slowly, with the hope of strengthening up the things that usually give me grief.<\/p>\n<p>But despite my slow pace, I found running tough. \u00a0I&#8217;ve always favoured sports with bursts of activity: squash and five-a-side mentioned earlier, and cycling allows it too. \u00a0But my legs don&#8217;t have a freewheel. \u00a0I just had to keep going.<\/p>\n<p>I was also paying a lot of attention to HOW I was running. \u00a0I&#8217;m flat footed and so I was consciously rolling down from the outside edge of my foot. \u00a0I was really noticing that my style got heavy when I was tired or stopped thinking. \u00a0And I was trying out different styles &#8211; a long pace felt easier as I could skim the ground rather then up-and-downing so much &#8211; this felt good but was hard to keep up.<\/p>\n<p>I was also very conscious of my breathing. \u00a0The relentless nature of it meant I didn&#8217;t have time to catch breath, and I was breathing a good deep breath over and over for the whole 4 miles.<\/p>\n<h2>Lessons<\/h2>\n<p>My knees felt OK afterwards, but my back had been hurting and my legs were very tired&#8230;but a nice, well-used kind of tiredness.<\/p>\n<p>It was a great experience. \u00a0I was chuffed to have got round and finished second out of the four of us in about 36 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>But I also learned some things that I&#8217;ll carry on to the bike. \u00a0That control of pace that meant I could keep up a reasonable output continuously. \u00a0And the deeper, slower, more controlled breathing that went along with it. \u00a0There are things that I hope to take on to the wheels to see if they improve my riding.<\/p>\n<h2>Next Time<\/h2>\n<p>Will there be one?<\/p>\n<p>Well, yesterday I did 14 miles on the bike and there is some knee pain coming. \u00a0I wasn&#8217;t running in my proper running shoes and it was a bit far for a first run, so maybe I&#8217;ll try doing the same and see if it gets worse.<\/p>\n<p>I have plenty of physio-prescribed stretches and orthotics for my shoes that should all help.<\/p>\n<p>And, I confess, I enjoyed.<\/p>\n<p>So watch this space, either for reports of the demise of my limb joints, or for the result of my first half marathon!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Learning all this new software development stuff is all well and good, but at some point you actually have to develop something.\u00a0 And developing a computer program of any size, like any engineering trade, requires some tools and some planning.<\/p>\n<p>One of my main applications of what I&#8217;m learning is to a database that I maintain at work.\u00a0 This is currently running on a Windows server with MS SQL as the database and MS IIS (Internet Information Service?) as the web server.<\/p>\n<p>This is all well and good, but it&#8217;s not an environment I can easily and cheaply re-create for testing and development purposes, and some of my code is not portable between databases.\u00a0 (I&#8217;ve made a good attempt at adding a database abstraction layer, but it&#8217;s not QUITE there).<\/p>\n<p>So, the natural thing to do is to migrate to Unix, Apache and MySQL, which I can freely and easily deploy pretty much anywhere.\u00a0 And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been up to this week.<\/p>\n<h2>I LIKE Windows?<\/h2>\n<p>I do link Unix.\u00a0 It&#8217;s a much better server OS than Windows, in my opinon.\u00a0 But I&#8217;m also a user &#8211; even as a developer &#8211; and Windows IS much more user friendly.<\/p>\n<p>For example, I&#8217;ve been using NotePad++ as my text editor, which has syntax-highlighting, auto-indentation, auto-completion of words, good handling of multiple files, and a whole host of other lovely things.<\/p>\n<p>Moving to Unix means moving to Vi or EMACS.\u00a0 Tools which are great but not simple to learn (do I HAVE to learn to use another tool to do this?!).<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I like vi, in a massochistic sort of way, but not for writing a complex software project!<\/p>\n<h2>Keeping Track<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m also vaguely aware that this sort of project would be good to have under version control (which I won&#8217;t explain here &#8211; ask if you want to know).<\/p>\n<p>I used to use CVS in my old job and it was a great help.\u00a0 If I&#8217;m setting up a development system, making significant code changes, and migrating to a new platform, then a version control system would be a great help.<\/p>\n<h2>Considering My Options<\/h2>\n<p>So I need some of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a nice Unix text editor for my command line\/terminal<\/li>\n<li>a GUI for my Unix system (with a nice GUI text editor)<\/li>\n<li>a version control system<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Asking around, the text editor of choice with Unix boffins is&#8230;vi!\u00a0 But I&#8217;m not happy with that.\u00a0 vim has been suggested as it has syntax-highlighting, split screens, and stuff like that.\u00a0 Maybe it&#8217;s a nice half-way house.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been playing with getting the X Windowing System to work.\u00a0 There&#8217;s a free, open source X server called &#8220;X Ming&#8221; which does the job and works prett seamlessly over ssh tunnels, but I&#8217;ve found setting up the client side (which is actually on the server!) a bit difficult.\u00a0 Too complicated.\u00a0 And I&#8217;d probably only end up using xvim, which would probably only be a three-quarters-way house.<\/p>\n<h2>Sublime Subversion<\/h2>\n<p>Version control has been a boon though!\u00a0 I quickly read the important bits of <a title=\"the subversion book\" href=\"http:\/\/svnbook.red-bean.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">the Subversion book<\/a> and\u00a0 realised what I&#8217;d been missing.\u00a0 My vague rememberance of CVS should have spurred me on sooner &#8211; this is REALLY important stuff!<\/p>\n<p>In minutes (well, OK, hours, but not many) I had a SVN server accessible locally and over SVN and SSH protocols, with my production code on it and with all my development areas, in both Windows and Unix land, using checked-out, version-controlled copies.\u00a0 Woo hoo!!\u00a0 I was genuinely excitied &#8211; in a geeky sort of way.<\/p>\n<h2>Where now?<\/h2>\n<p>Well, I&#8217;m mostly happy with the set up.\u00a0 I&#8217;ll probably miss my Windows editors for a while, but I&#8217;m generally content.<\/p>\n<p>I have a Linux production server, running open-source tools, which I&#8217;ve nearly migrated to.\u00a0 I have easy and safe access to the code from multiple locations.\u00a0 I have a reasonably good text editor, with scope for GUI access in the future.\u00a0 I can bring my code home to develop.\u00a0 And I can easily and cheaply set up a test or development environment if I need to.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a whole world better than the old Microsoft one!\u00a0 And I&#8217;ve learned some good stuff along the way.<\/p>\n<p>Now&#8230;the tools are in place&#8230;time to apply my new HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, W3C DOM, Apache and MySQL skills to the task!<\/p>\n<p>Amazingly, I&#8217;m not feeling very confused by this.\u00a0 Are you?<\/p>\n<p>[polldaddy poll=1264157]<\/p>\n",

x + 1.\u00a0 Simple.\u00a0 So we can now do:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">a =\u00a01\nprint a\nb = add-one ( a )\nprint b<\/pre>\n<p>I hope you can see (I&#8217;m racing ahead) that this will print &#8220;1&#8221; then &#8220;2&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>But you can also write this as what&#8217;s called a procedure.\u00a0 A procedure does some &#8220;stuff&#8221; but doesnt return a value.\u00a0 Like this:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">procedure add-one ( x )\nbegin\n\u00a0 x = x + 1\nend<\/pre>\n<p>So what happens if we do the following with the procedure?:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">a = 1\nprint a\nadd-one ( a )\nprint a<\/pre>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy!&#8221; you may say, &#8220;it prints 1 then 2 again&#8221;.\u00a0 But it&#8217;s not that easy.\u00a0 Sometimes the language will take a &#8220;copy&#8221; of x into the procedure and modify the copy, leaving the original untouched.\u00a0 This is called &#8220;pass-by-value&#8221;.\u00a0 Why would you want to do this?\u00a0 Well, let&#8217;s write a procedure that has someone&#8217;s full name as an input and prints their first name:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">procedure print-first-name ( name )\nbegin\n\u00a0\u00a0remove surname from name\n\u00a0 print name\nend<\/pre>\n<p>In this case we only want &#8220;name&#8221; to change within the procedure or the following would not work:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name = \"Fred Flintstone\"\nprint-first-name ( my-name )\u00a0\nprint-surname ( my-name )<\/pre>\n<p>Here, print-surname would not work because the print-first-name removed the surname from my-name.<\/p>\n<p>Your head probably aches now.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, JavaScript does LOTS of this sort of thing where pass-by-vaue and pass-by-reference really make a difference.<\/p>\n<p>Another complication is that there&#8217;s two ways to create strings that return different types:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name1 = \"Fred Flintstone\";<\/pre>\n<p>and<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name2 =\u00a0new string(\"Fred Flintstone\");<\/pre>\n<p>But these actualy do different things.\u00a0 One creates a string <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">value<\/span> and one creates a string <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">object<\/span>.\u00a0 And we find that:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name1 == my-name2<\/pre>\n<p>is true because the interpreter automatically converts the type but<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name1 === my-name2<\/pre>\n<p>is false because it does type comparison too.<\/p>\n<p>It has a variable called &#8220;this&#8221;, which refers to different things in different contexts.<\/p>\n<p>And it doesn&#8217;t enforce important bits of syntax.\u00a0 You&#8217;re supposed to end statements with a semi-colon, but if you split a statement over a line, then it will add the semi-colon at the line end (if that&#8217;s a valid place to end a statement).<\/p>\n<p>These are all very minor examples of how this is a complex, weakly-typed, language the enforces very little checking on the programmer, makes lots of assumptions about what you mean in your program, and doesn&#8217;t seem to give you ways to enforce the meaning that you want.<\/p>\n<p>All in all, I can see why so many web applications are so liable to not working.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps with a proper JavaScript tutorial, rather than just a cookbook, I might get a better grasp of the language and find some strong typing and better structures.<\/p>\n<p>But for the moment it&#8217;s looking pretty complicated and chaotic!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Geeky post&#8230;sorry if you get lost.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m still playing with Web Development languages and tools.\u00a0 A few days in Devon with not much to do is a good time to invest in some self-learning and I&#8217;ve been given the O&#8217;Reilly <a href=\"http:\/\/oreilly.com\/catalog\/9780596514082\/\">JavaScript and DHTML Cookbook<\/a> for Christmas too, so I&#8217;m working through that.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty proficient with server-side scripting now, but it had limitatations and performance issues.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve been so impressed by some of the Web 2.0-type sites out there (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.letsfreckle.com\">www.letsfreckle.com<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\">www.twitter.com<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\">www.facebook.com<\/a>) that I feel I really need to get a handle on client-side scripting too.\u00a0 That&#8217;s where JavaScript and DHTML come in.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m really not liking JavaScript.\u00a0 See, I was educated with a quite deep knowledge of programming languages.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve studied both imperative (statement-based) and declarative (logic-based) languages.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve studied compiler construction and language structure and analysis.\u00a0 I understand object-orientation.\u00a0 I know what&#8217;s going on under the hood, and I know the pitfalls of various programming languages styles.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also got a background in safety-critical software engineering.\u00a0 Writing programs where you know what must happen and if that doesn&#8217;t happen then people&#8217;s lives are at risk.\u00a0 I like to know what my programs are doing.<\/p>\n<p>And with JavaScript, most of the time, I don&#8217;t have a clue what&#8217;s going on!\u00a0 The language makes so many guesses on your behalf, allows you to pass objects and functions as data and doesn&#8217;t (appear to) contain notation for distinguishing between passing parameters by value and by reference.<\/p>\n<p>To the uninitiated this will mean nothing&#8230;let&#8217;s take an example.\u00a0 Lets say we want to write a little computer program called &#8220;add-one&#8221;.\u00a0 This program has one input, a number, and one output, which will be the number plus one.<\/p>\n<p>The preferred way to do this is to write what&#8217;s called a &#8220;function&#8221;.\u00a0 A function is a little program which gives you back a value.\u00a0 Like this:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">function add-one ( x )\nbegin\n\u00a0 return x + 1\nend<\/pre>\n<p>Here, x is the input and we &#8220;return&#8221; x + 1.\u00a0 Simple.\u00a0 So we can now do:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">a =\u00a01\nprint a\nb = add-one ( a )\nprint b<\/pre>\n<p>I hope you can see (I&#8217;m racing ahead) that this will print &#8220;1&#8221; then &#8220;2&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>But you can also write this as what&#8217;s called a procedure.\u00a0 A procedure does some &#8220;stuff&#8221; but doesnt return a value.\u00a0 Like this:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">procedure add-one ( x )\nbegin\n\u00a0 x = x + 1\nend<\/pre>\n<p>So what happens if we do the following with the procedure?:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">a = 1\nprint a\nadd-one ( a )\nprint a<\/pre>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy!&#8221; you may say, &#8220;it prints 1 then 2 again&#8221;.\u00a0 But it&#8217;s not that easy.\u00a0 Sometimes the language will take a &#8220;copy&#8221; of x into the procedure and modify the copy, leaving the original untouched.\u00a0 This is called &#8220;pass-by-value&#8221;.\u00a0 Why would you want to do this?\u00a0 Well, let&#8217;s write a procedure that has someone&#8217;s full name as an input and prints their first name:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">procedure print-first-name ( name )\nbegin\n\u00a0\u00a0remove surname from name\n\u00a0 print name\nend<\/pre>\n<p>In this case we only want &#8220;name&#8221; to change within the procedure or the following would not work:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name = \"Fred Flintstone\"\nprint-first-name ( my-name )\u00a0\nprint-surname ( my-name )<\/pre>\n<p>Here, print-surname would not work because the print-first-name removed the surname from my-name.<\/p>\n<p>Your head probably aches now.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, JavaScript does LOTS of this sort of thing where pass-by-vaue and pass-by-reference really make a difference.<\/p>\n<p>Another complication is that there&#8217;s two ways to create strings that return different types:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name1 = \"Fred Flintstone\";<\/pre>\n<p>and<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name2 =\u00a0new string(\"Fred Flintstone\");<\/pre>\n<p>But these actualy do different things.\u00a0 One creates a string <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">value<\/span> and one creates a string <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">object<\/span>.\u00a0 And we find that:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name1 == my-name2<\/pre>\n<p>is true because the interpreter automatically converts the type but<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name1 === my-name2<\/pre>\n<p>is false because it does type comparison too.<\/p>\n<p>It has a variable called &#8220;this&#8221;, which refers to different things in different contexts.<\/p>\n<p>And it doesn&#8217;t enforce important bits of syntax.\u00a0 You&#8217;re supposed to end statements with a semi-colon, but if you split a statement over a line, then it will add the semi-colon at the line end (if that&#8217;s a valid place to end a statement).<\/p>\n<p>These are all very minor examples of how this is a complex, weakly-typed, language the enforces very little checking on the programmer, makes lots of assumptions about what you mean in your program, and doesn&#8217;t seem to give you ways to enforce the meaning that you want.<\/p>\n<p>All in all, I can see why so many web applications are so liable to not working.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps with a proper JavaScript tutorial, rather than just a cookbook, I might get a better grasp of the language and find some strong typing and better structures.<\/p>\n<p>But for the moment it&#8217;s looking pretty complicated and chaotic!<\/p>\n",

at Ikea<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>December<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Nights drew in and with colds and busy times at work we weren&#8217;t up to much.\u00a0 I found time to <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/12\/21\/a-successful-move\/\">move the blog<\/a> to its new home and get <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/12\/21\/spin-spin-spin-the-wheel-of-fortune\/\">intrigued by roulette<\/a> at my work Christmas party.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Looking back<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So, what a year!\u00a0 It&#8217;s not felt like we&#8217;ve done much.\u00a0 The garden was neglected, we didn&#8217;t do as much house decorating as we would have liked, but looking back, we&#8217;ve done a heck of a lot!\u00a0 God has been at work, healing me back in February and\u00a0leading us towards new bits of work and new involvement in our community, and we thank God for working in our lives.<\/p>\n<p>Our hopes next year are for another year of being settled in Swindon and of good health, especially for me.\u00a0 We hope that the Church Plant will take off and that that will be something we&#8217;re a part of.\u00a0 We hope for another successful harvest (after another load of hard work).\u00a0 We hope that we&#8217;ll get our bedroom decorated, and clear out a load of stuff from the house at the same time.\u00a0 We hope that, in this time of difficulty for business, we&#8217;ll both be putting our trust in our God and not in our jobs or our money or our posessions.\u00a0 And above all, we pray that God will, again, be a part of our lives in 2009.<\/p>\n",
