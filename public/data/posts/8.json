                "rendered": "\n<p>I have a confession: despite being a WordPress developer since 2010, I&#8217;ve rarely used WooCommerce! Where I have I&#8217;ve only done the very basics. And now I&#8217;m knee deep in a custom WooCommerce project with a lot to figure out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating custom fields on the checkout was a particular area of confusion. Here&#8217;s what I needed:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A bunch of custom fields&#8230;<\/li><li>with conditional logic (i.e. some fields are only sometimes visible depending on values of other fields)&#8230;<\/li><li>that save in the order (and get displayed in the back-end order screen, and, potentially, in emails)&#8230;<\/li><li>and that can be passed to MailChimp &#8211; again, conditionally, based on the values of some fields.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The logic is something like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Ask if a user is over 18.<\/li><li>If they are collect their year of birth and send it to MailChimp as part of the ordering process.<\/li><li>If they aren&#8217;t collect their date of birth, and only let them order if they are over 13, and send the date of birth to MailChimp as part of the ordering process.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially I was thinking that I could do this with some custom fields plugin maybe? But I consulted with some expert friends and they encouraged me to code this myself. Which, for this application with two interacting integrations (custom fields and MailChimp) and the conditional logic and stuff was probably a good idea. Bullying off-the-shelf plugins into doing this was never going to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that WooCommerce has <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.woocommerce.com\/document\/tutorial-customising-checkout-fields-using-actions-and-filters\/\">a pretty good guide<\/a> to doing most of this. And they have REALLY EXTENSIVE <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.woocommerce.com\/document\/introduction-to-hooks-actions-and-filters\/\">action and filter hooks<\/a> &#8211; so much so that it&#8217;s hard to know what you should be hooking into.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was one thing that tripped me up along the way though. I was trying to write some JavaScript to work on some markup that was added with the <code>woocommerce_checkout_before_terms_and_conditions<\/code> hook, just above the button to make the purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any event handlers added to input in this area were inactive. It was like WooCommerce was removing them or intercepting them somehow, and despite <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/woocommerce\/woocommerce\/blob\/4dd42309315b8938beb47b3e877d0ae8dc56db83\/assets\/js\/frontend\/checkout.js#L247\">source-diving<\/a> a little I&#8217;ve still not quite figured out what it was doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that every time the cart updates via AJAX on the checkout page, the HTML elements are re-created. And there is an update when the page first loads. So any event handlers I added during page initialisation were immediately overridden or remvoed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution was to add my event handlers when the <code>updated_checkout<\/code> event fired in JavaScript. This ensured that after the checkout update, my handlers were added to the elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phew!<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Custom WooCommerce Checkout Fields",
        "content": "\n<p>I have a confession: despite being a WordPress developer since 2010, I&#8217;ve rarely used WooCommerce! Where I have I&#8217;ve only done the very basics. And now I&#8217;m knee deep in a custom WooCommerce project with a lot to figure out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating custom fields on the checkout was a particular area of confusion. Here&#8217;s what I needed:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A bunch of custom fields&#8230;<\/li><li>with conditional logic (i.e. some fields are only sometimes visible depending on values of other fields)&#8230;<\/li><li>that save in the order (and get displayed in the back-end order screen, and, potentially, in emails)&#8230;<\/li><li>and that can be passed to MailChimp &#8211; again, conditionally, based on the values of some fields.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The logic is something like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Ask if a user is over 18.<\/li><li>If they are collect their year of birth and send it to MailChimp as part of the ordering process.<\/li><li>If they aren&#8217;t collect their date of birth, and only let them order if they are over 13, and send the date of birth to MailChimp as part of the ordering process.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially I was thinking that I could do this with some custom fields plugin maybe? But I consulted with some expert friends and they encouraged me to code this myself. Which, for this application with two interacting integrations (custom fields and MailChimp) and the conditional logic and stuff was probably a good idea. Bullying off-the-shelf plugins into doing this was never going to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that WooCommerce has <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.woocommerce.com\/document\/tutorial-customising-checkout-fields-using-actions-and-filters\/\">a pretty good guide<\/a> to doing most of this. And they have REALLY EXTENSIVE <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.woocommerce.com\/document\/introduction-to-hooks-actions-and-filters\/\">action and filter hooks<\/a> &#8211; so much so that it&#8217;s hard to know what you should be hooking into.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was one thing that tripped me up along the way though. I was trying to write some JavaScript to work on some markup that was added with the <code>woocommerce_checkout_before_terms_and_conditions<\/code> hook, just above the button to make the purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any event handlers added to input in this area were inactive. It was like WooCommerce was removing them or intercepting them somehow, and despite <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/woocommerce\/woocommerce\/blob\/4dd42309315b8938beb47b3e877d0ae8dc56db83\/assets\/js\/frontend\/checkout.js#L247\">source-diving<\/a> a little I&#8217;ve still not quite figured out what it was doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that every time the cart updates via AJAX on the checkout page, the HTML elements are re-created. And there is an update when the page first loads. So any event handlers I added during page initialisation were immediately overridden or remvoed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution was to add my event handlers when the <code>updated_checkout<\/code> event fired in JavaScript. This ensured that after the checkout update, my handlers were added to the elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phew!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>UPDATE &#8211; 6\/10\/2020<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article was written before the Jetstream Drama over the weekend and it&#8217;s worth clarifying a few things, and saying what I&#8217;ve learned from the drama.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>I really hope I didn&#8217;t contribute any hate. That&#8217;s really NOT my intention. I&#8217;ve tried to say that I think Laravel and Jetstream are amazing things and Taylor has my utmost respect and thanks. My comments are meant to be entirely constructive. And I&#8217;ve presented small, concrete things that I think could improve first-time experience with Jetstream for some audiences.<\/li><li>I come at this from the point of view of someone who&#8217;s far from a Laravel expert &#8211; I&#8217;m really still learning. But that&#8217;s part of my point: for someone in my position, Jetstream feels a bit inaccessible.<\/li><li>Taylor Otwell (the creator of Laravel) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=krn39HjxPTs\">has clarified<\/a> that he made Jetstream as the kind of thing that HE would use. So in some ways, any critique of it from a less-experienced Laravel developer&#8217;s perspective (which is what this article presents) isn&#8217;t valid. Is it fair to say that it seems this is not a tool intended for beginners with the framework?<\/li><li>However, I feel that with a few small changes and some additions to the documentation, it could be made more accessible for beginners and this would be a good thing for everyone.<\/li><li>Yes, I should have read more of the docs before diving in. But Jetstream seems too inviting, I dived in headfirst and so got stuck. That&#8217;s a lesson for me. <\/li><li>It&#8217;s because I think Laravel and Jetstream are awesome that I&#8217;d love them to be more accessible to more developers. Jetstream is actually a really good example of a set of components and classes at work, and it could serve as some easily explorable code demonstrating good practices. Auth scaffolding is like the &#8220;Hello world&#8221; of Laravel and I&#8217;d love for it to be as easy for the first time Laravel dev to explore as it is for the experienced one.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel 8 is out today, along with the amazing new &#8220;Jetstream&#8221; authentication scaffolding that has been built.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve just worked through doing a quick install and had a poke around and it is incredible what you get out of the box now. But also, I have two issues with it. This isn&#8217;t really a rant, I do love it. Just observations and possible things that could be thought about for the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. The barrier to entry is too high now<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you install Laravel + Jetstream (the Livewire version), you are now faced with this as your welcome template:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;x-app-layout&gt;\n    &lt;x-slot name=&quot;header&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;h2 class=&quot;font-semibold text-xl text-gray-800 leading-tight&quot;&gt;\n            Dashboard\n        &lt;\/h2&gt;\n    &lt;\/x-slot&gt;\n\n    &lt;div class=&quot;py-12&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;max-w-7xl mx-auto sm:px-6 lg:px-8&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;bg-white overflow-hidden shadow-xl sm:rounded-lg&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;x-jet-welcome \/&gt;\n            &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/x-app-layout&gt;\n\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>My first question was &#8220;How can I customise the welcome component? That <code>&lt;x-jet-welcome \/&gt;<\/code> bit?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I spent half an hour tracking down the <code>JetstreamServiceProvider.php<\/code> which registers all the components using this method:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nprotected function registerComponent(string $component)\n    {\n        Blade::component('jetstream::components.'.$component, 'jet-'.$component);\n    }\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And what&#8217;s super-annoying about this is that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>a) Because the <code>registerComponent()<\/code> method dynamically prefixes the component name with <code>'jet-<\/code>&#8216;, you can&#8217;t search the code for the full component name and find where it&#8217;s registered<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>b) Even if you could, it wouldn&#8217;t help very much finding the component template, but it would at least leave you able to search for the component name and find something!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So anyone without a pretty good grasp of Blade components and how to dive around in the vendor directory to find stuff, is going to be a bit stuck!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless they notice that you can publish the components (if you know what that means), which you need to do to modify them. Sure, you can find out about publishing the components by reading <a href=\"https:\/\/jetstream.laravel.com\/1.x\/installation.html#livewire-components\">the Jetstream docs<\/a>. But I was keen to dive in and thought it would be easy to see how to edit what is effectively the &#8220;Hello world&#8221; page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like if I came from basic PHP, or some other eco system into Laravel now, I&#8217;d get stuck pretty quickly. There&#8217;s a LOT of implied knowledge needed to get started: Tailwind; Blade Components; Livewire\/Inertia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That barrier to entry just got a whole heap higher!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. There&#8217;s too much out of the box<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>[Note: Taylor took note of people&#8217;s feedback on this and has disabled the API and profile photos by default as of <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/laravel\/jetstream\/releases\/tag\/v1.3.2\">version 1.3.2<\/a>!]<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E8pZvl6L5N4\">a live-streamed chat<\/a> with some WordPress friends today about the benefits of looking into Laravel if you&#8217;re a WordPress developer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one thing I said was that so often with WordPress core and many plugins, I find myself with too much stuff and wanting to turn some of it off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really think that the out-of-the box Laravel Jetstream setup has too much turned on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>API tokens<\/li><li>Profile photos<\/li><li>2FA<\/li><li>Account deleting<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I LOVE that I could turn these on with a single-line-of-code change, but, perhaps with the exception of 2FA, should these really all be on by default? I&#8217;m really not sure they should, and my first step on many projects will be to turn some of these features off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is easy enough to do: the <code>config\/jetstream.php<\/code> file has a features array that allows you to turn off profile pictures and the API bits:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n    'features' =&gt; &#x5B;\n        Features::profilePhotos(),\n        Features::api(),\n        \/\/ Features::teams(),\n    ],\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p> But I still think they should be off by default!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">In summary<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a slightly-experienced Laravel developer, this is all really exciting stuff, if a little enigmatic in places &#8211; how DOES this stuff work!?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as someone who wants to introduce people to Laravel as a way to build cool stuff, I really feel like there are some issues here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But who am I to say? Kudos to Taylor and the team for an awesome release.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m off to build something!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>UPDATE &#8211; 6\/10\/2020<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article was written before the Jetstream Drama over the weekend and it&#8217;s worth clarifying a few things, and saying what I&#8217;ve learned from the drama.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>I really hope I didn&#8217;t contribute any hate. That&#8217;s really NOT my intention. I&#8217;ve tried to say that I think Laravel and Jetstream are amazing things and Taylor has my utmost respect and thanks. My comments are meant to be entirely constructive. And I&#8217;ve presented small, concrete things that I think could improve first-time experience with Jetstream for some audiences.<\/li><li>I come at this from the point of view of someone who&#8217;s far from a Laravel expert &#8211; I&#8217;m really still learning. But that&#8217;s part of my point: for someone in my position, Jetstream feels a bit inaccessible.<\/li><li>Taylor Otwell (the creator of Laravel) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=krn39HjxPTs\">has clarified<\/a> that he made Jetstream as the kind of thing that HE would use. So in some ways, any critique of it from a less-experienced Laravel developer&#8217;s perspective (which is what this article presents) isn&#8217;t valid. Is it fair to say that it seems this is not a tool intended for beginners with the framework?<\/li><li>However, I feel that with a few small changes and some additions to the documentation, it could be made more accessible for beginners and this would be a good thing for everyone.<\/li><li>Yes, I should have read more of the docs before diving in. But Jetstream seems too inviting, I dived in headfirst and so got stuck. That&#8217;s a lesson for me. <\/li><li>It&#8217;s because I think Laravel and Jetstream are awesome that I&#8217;d love them to be more accessible to more developers. Jetstream is actually a really good example of a set of components and classes at work, and it could serve as some easily explorable code demonstrating good practices. Auth scaffolding is like the &#8220;Hello world&#8221; of Laravel and I&#8217;d love for it to be as easy for the first time Laravel dev to explore as it is for the experienced one.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel 8 is out today, along with the amazing new &#8220;Jetstream&#8221; authentication scaffolding that has been built.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve just worked through doing a quick install and had a poke around and it is incredible what you get out of the box now. But also, I have two issues with it. This isn&#8217;t really a rant, I do love it. Just observations and possible things that could be thought about for the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. The barrier to entry is too high now<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you install Laravel + Jetstream (the Livewire version), you are now faced with this as your welcome template:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;x-app-layout&gt;\n    &lt;x-slot name=&quot;header&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;h2 class=&quot;font-semibold text-xl text-gray-800 leading-tight&quot;&gt;\n            Dashboard\n        &lt;\/h2&gt;\n    &lt;\/x-slot&gt;\n\n    &lt;div class=&quot;py-12&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;max-w-7xl mx-auto sm:px-6 lg:px-8&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;bg-white overflow-hidden shadow-xl sm:rounded-lg&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;x-jet-welcome \/&gt;\n            &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/x-app-layout&gt;\n\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>My first question was &#8220;How can I customise the welcome component? That <code>&lt;x-jet-welcome \/&gt;<\/code> bit?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I spent half an hour tracking down the <code>JetstreamServiceProvider.php<\/code> which registers all the components using this method:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nprotected function registerComponent(string $component)\n    {\n        Blade::component('jetstream::components.'.$component, 'jet-'.$component);\n    }\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And what&#8217;s super-annoying about this is that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>a) Because the <code>registerComponent()<\/code> method dynamically prefixes the component name with <code>'jet-<\/code>&#8216;, you can&#8217;t search the code for the full component name and find where it&#8217;s registered<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>b) Even if you could, it wouldn&#8217;t help very much finding the component template, but it would at least leave you able to search for the component name and find something!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So anyone without a pretty good grasp of Blade components and how to dive around in the vendor directory to find stuff, is going to be a bit stuck!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless they notice that you can publish the components (if you know what that means), which you need to do to modify them. Sure, you can find out about publishing the components by reading <a href=\"https:\/\/jetstream.laravel.com\/1.x\/installation.html#livewire-components\">the Jetstream docs<\/a>. But I was keen to dive in and thought it would be easy to see how to edit what is effectively the &#8220;Hello world&#8221; page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like if I came from basic PHP, or some other eco system into Laravel now, I&#8217;d get stuck pretty quickly. There&#8217;s a LOT of implied knowledge needed to get started: Tailwind; Blade Components; Livewire\/Inertia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That barrier to entry just got a whole heap higher!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. There&#8217;s too much out of the box<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>[Note: Taylor took note of people&#8217;s feedback on this and has disabled the API and profile photos by default as of <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/laravel\/jetstream\/releases\/tag\/v1.3.2\">version 1.3.2<\/a>!]<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E8pZvl6L5N4\">a live-streamed chat<\/a> with some WordPress friends today about the benefits of looking into Laravel if you&#8217;re a WordPress developer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one thing I said was that so often with WordPress core and many plugins, I find myself with too much stuff and wanting to turn some of it off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really think that the out-of-the box Laravel Jetstream setup has too much turned on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>API tokens<\/li><li>Profile photos<\/li><li>2FA<\/li><li>Account deleting<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I LOVE that I could turn these on with a single-line-of-code change, but, perhaps with the exception of 2FA, should these really all be on by default? I&#8217;m really not sure they should, and my first step on many projects will be to turn some of these features off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is easy enough to do: the <code>config\/jetstream.php<\/code> file has a features array that allows you to turn off profile pictures and the API bits:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n    'features' =&gt; &#x5B;\n        Features::profilePhotos(),\n        Features::api(),\n        \/\/ Features::teams(),\n    ],\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p> But I still think they should be off by default!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">In summary<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a slightly-experienced Laravel developer, this is all really exciting stuff, if a little enigmatic in places &#8211; how DOES this stuff work!?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as someone who wants to introduce people to Laravel as a way to build cool stuff, I really feel like there are some issues here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But who am I to say? Kudos to Taylor and the team for an awesome release.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m off to build something!<\/p>\n",

But I think there&#8217;s an opportunity to do everything better.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caveats: OK, I&#8217;m not an economist; I&#8217;m not a town planner. I have no expertise here. I&#8217;m well aware of this. And I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a reason no one is talking about this particular approach. But I present it anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A dream<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a sub-urban town where COVID changed everything for the better. The high street was dying, but the council saw an opportunity and took it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cars are few and far between. Congestion is minimal. Yet the high street thrives. White-collar office workers can choose to work from home, or to gather with colleagues in town-centre offices. Their commutes are short and many cycle or use the cheap, electric buses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Health has improved. Air quality is high. The local economy is booming. Social mobility is high and unemployment is low.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Planners from other towns come just to see what has been done. It is a model of sustainable and equitable growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how did they get there from here?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This town is a dream, of course. But I&#8217;ve long had ideas about how the high street might look different based on my experience of many years working both in corporates and for myself as a freelance, remote and home worker. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Remote Working Fallacy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The COVID 19 lockdown has forced many people to work from home and there has been a boom in remote and home working. Large companies have announced that offices will be closed for the medium term, or that remote working will now be permanent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, the UK government are urging people to go back to work to stimulate life and the economy in city and town centres. And I&#8217;m seeing a lot of push-back on this idea of the return to office life: home working has been shown to be effective; why should we return?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Yet, in my bubble at least, I&#8217;m seeing overwhelming support for home\/remote working, and little critique of it.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, my bubble contains a lot of white collar office and information sector workers, many of whom already home work or remote work. And this includes myself &#8211; effectively a home\/remote worker for the last 10 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The downside to the economy has been discussed a LOT. But other issues haven&#8217;t. So beyond the death of Pret-a-Manger and the obvious &#8220;you can&#8217;t chat in person with your colleagues&#8221; thing (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/helloalegria\/status\/1301290315593191426\/photo\/1\">today known as &#8220;Proper bants&#8221;, &#8220;The boss&#8217;s jokes&#8221; and &#8220;Hearing buzzwords&#8221;<\/a>), what might the critique of home-working be?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a few things that bother me about it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Equality<\/strong>: Not everyone has an office or spare room in their house that they can use to work from. So if you require people to work from home there&#8217;s no guarantee that they have an appropriate space to work from, and you might put off attracting people into jobs if they don&#8217;t have such a space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Equipment<\/strong>: Full-time office work from home requires a desk, a decent chair, a decent, ergonomic keyboard and mouse, and if you&#8217;re doing video calls you may want a better camera and mic than you have in your laptop, or maybe a headset.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure many employers happily provide these, but I&#8217;m also sure that some won&#8217;t, expecting the employer to stump up for them instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Health and Safety<\/strong>: Large offices usually have people who do health and safety, ergonomics and occupational health. I wonder how much of this crucial input to the well-being of employees is missed with home\/remote working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transitions<\/strong>: I actually find the transition between home and work very useful. Granted, my commute is normally a 15 &#8211; 20 minute bike ride, but even a bus ride is a good time to chill out, reflect on what&#8217;s coming or has happened in the day, listen to a podcast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find the near-instant transition from work-brain to home\/dad-brain when I&#8217;m working at home really quite difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, my bike ride is one of my main forms of regular exercise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The home-to-office transition is actually very useful for some. But only if it&#8217;s short.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I also think we have a real problem with long-distance commuting, which is bad for people, really expensive, and unsustainable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Utility costs<\/strong>: Office-working from home requires a good, fast internet connection, and working from home will increase your utility bills. Plus you&#8217;ll have to provide things like your own tea\/coffee. These are savings for the employer, but I wonder if they are passed on?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguably, if the employee was commuting to the office, then they could be saving money here. And the employer may need additional IT infrastructure to provide things like VPNs. So some things will balance out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do wonder if some unscrupulous companies might see this as a way to cut costs at the expense of employees absorbing the impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, my main worry is that some corporates might see this as a chance to ditch large office costs, but then not fulfill their new responsibilities to their new home-workers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could be wrong, and I&#8217;m sure that most companies will do a good job here. But I&#8217;m also sure that not all will.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s sum up:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remote\/homeworking has benefits:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Employees don&#8217;t have to commute.<\/li><li>Employees get more flexibility.<\/li><li>Employers can recruit from a broader pool of (non-local) people.<\/li><li>Employers potentially have much lower costs.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But remote\/home working may have drawbacks for some people:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A negative effect on the town\/city-centre economy.<\/li><li>Issues with not meeting and working face-to-face.<\/li><li>Employees may not have a space to work in and this may prevent people from applying for or getting jobs.<\/li><li>Employers may not invest in employees&#8217; well-being and compensate them for additional equipment and utilities.<\/li><li>Employees may lack useful transition time or not get exercise &#8211; never leaving the house can be a thing!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The high street issue<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the high-street issue is pretty clear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The boom in online shopping and the exodus of companies from expensive town-centre offices, all compounded by the effects of COVID 19, means retail on the high street is dying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, by my observation, service industries still seem to be doing OK, if not booming! There are SO many cafe&#8217;s and coffee shops in my local town centre now. I still travel in specifically to do banking sometimes. People seem to use hairdressers and gyms and post offices and so on. Things that you have to go in person to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So what can we do instead? How do we get the benefits of home remote working and avoid the pitfalls, while also benefiting the high street?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Remote working hubs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s where the dream comes in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The council, with support and commitment from a collective of companies, converts some dis-used office space in the town centre into remote working hubs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Larger companies, with a workforce spread across a number of different &#8220;home&#8221; locations, rent space in these hubs for the employees that live in and around that town.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The space is secure and has good connectivity secured by the company VPN. It&#8217;s the company&#8217;s space, so they are still required to furnish and equip it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular visits from health and safety\/occupational health ensure legal compliance and wellbeing of staff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smaller companies can rent this space too, and you could build in co-working for individuals. The space can run events &#8211; both educational and social &#8211; for people that use the building. Co-working spaces like this have begun to thrive in recent years prior to COVID 19 and lockdown!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Travel planning is done properly and multiple incentives are offered to encourage employees to not use single-occupancy cars, with walking, cycling and well-subsidised bus networks encouraging people to not use cars at all unless they have special needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the high street, retail declines, but services boom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People go back to the town centre in the week. They eat and drink in the morning and at lunchtime, sure. But there are also collection and return points for their online-ordered goods. They get their hair cut or do a bit of shopping in their lunch break and pick up some things for dinner before going home. Maybe they pop out for dinner with some colleagues or visit a bar or cinema after work? They try out technology in phone shops and get advice and customer service in person for things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This plan:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>taps into the booming co-working culture;<\/li><li>gives people the flexibility of choosing home OR office work;<\/li><li>reduces commute distances\/times while still enabling transitions if people want them;<\/li><li>gets people into the town centre and grows town-centre service economies, while propping up retail a little too;<\/li><li>enables employees to be properly supported by employers in an real office environment;<\/li><li>retains &#8211; probably improves &#8211; equality of employment opportunities, by not demanding people travel long distances to a central office, but also not demanding they have a space to work from at home<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I see two possible downsides:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>This is more expensive for larger employers as they may now maintain multiple office locations.<\/li><li>Large corporates may not be happy sharing a building with other large corporates. Could information leak between them if people intermingle in communal areas? What are the physical and &#8220;cyber&#8221; security risks? Are they worse than home-working? Or just different?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Could this work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There will certainly be office-based roles that need to be in a specific location. But this approach seems, to me, to be hugely beneficial to pretty much everyone. A best-of-both-worlds compromise between central offices and home-working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder why it&#8217;s not been discussed much? Has it not been thought of? Is it just too hard a change to make? Are those security issues just too big a barrier to overcome?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said at the start &#8211; I&#8217;m not qualified to be coming up with ideas like this and analysing the pros and cons. So: over to you&#8230; who IS? Could this work? What are the blockers? How might we take steps towards this dream?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>The high street is dying. Remote\/home working as a result of COVID 19 is exacerbating this. But I think there&#8217;s an opportunity to do everything better.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caveats: OK, I&#8217;m not an economist; I&#8217;m not a town planner. I have no expertise here. I&#8217;m well aware of this. And I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a reason no one is talking about this particular approach. But I present it anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A dream<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a sub-urban town where COVID changed everything for the better. The high street was dying, but the council saw an opportunity and took it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cars are few and far between. Congestion is minimal. Yet the high street thrives. White-collar office workers can choose to work from home, or to gather with colleagues in town-centre offices. Their commutes are short and many cycle or use the cheap, electric buses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Health has improved. Air quality is high. The local economy is booming. Social mobility is high and unemployment is low.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Planners from other towns come just to see what has been done. It is a model of sustainable and equitable growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how did they get there from here?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This town is a dream, of course. But I&#8217;ve long had ideas about how the high street might look different based on my experience of many years working both in corporates and for myself as a freelance, remote and home worker. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Remote Working Fallacy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The COVID 19 lockdown has forced many people to work from home and there has been a boom in remote and home working. Large companies have announced that offices will be closed for the medium term, or that remote working will now be permanent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, the UK government are urging people to go back to work to stimulate life and the economy in city and town centres. And I&#8217;m seeing a lot of push-back on this idea of the return to office life: home working has been shown to be effective; why should we return?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Yet, in my bubble at least, I&#8217;m seeing overwhelming support for home\/remote working, and little critique of it.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, my bubble contains a lot of white collar office and information sector workers, many of whom already home work or remote work. And this includes myself &#8211; effectively a home\/remote worker for the last 10 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The downside to the economy has been discussed a LOT. But other issues haven&#8217;t. So beyond the death of Pret-a-Manger and the obvious &#8220;you can&#8217;t chat in person with your colleagues&#8221; thing (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/helloalegria\/status\/1301290315593191426\/photo\/1\">today known as &#8220;Proper bants&#8221;, &#8220;The boss&#8217;s jokes&#8221; and &#8220;Hearing buzzwords&#8221;<\/a>), what might the critique of home-working be?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a few things that bother me about it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Equality<\/strong>: Not everyone has an office or spare room in their house that they can use to work from. So if you require people to work from home there&#8217;s no guarantee that they have an appropriate space to work from, and you might put off attracting people into jobs if they don&#8217;t have such a space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Equipment<\/strong>: Full-time office work from home requires a desk, a decent chair, a decent, ergonomic keyboard and mouse, and if you&#8217;re doing video calls you may want a better camera and mic than you have in your laptop, or maybe a headset.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure many employers happily provide these, but I&#8217;m also sure that some won&#8217;t, expecting the employer to stump up for them instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Health and Safety<\/strong>: Large offices usually have people who do health and safety, ergonomics and occupational health. I wonder how much of this crucial input to the well-being of employees is missed with home\/remote working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transitions<\/strong>: I actually find the transition between home and work very useful. Granted, my commute is normally a 15 &#8211; 20 minute bike ride, but even a bus ride is a good time to chill out, reflect on what&#8217;s coming or has happened in the day, listen to a podcast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find the near-instant transition from work-brain to home\/dad-brain when I&#8217;m working at home really quite difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, my bike ride is one of my main forms of regular exercise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The home-to-office transition is actually very useful for some. But only if it&#8217;s short.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I also think we have a real problem with long-distance commuting, which is bad for people, really expensive, and unsustainable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Utility costs<\/strong>: Office-working from home requires a good, fast internet connection, and working from home will increase your utility bills. Plus you&#8217;ll have to provide things like your own tea\/coffee. These are savings for the employer, but I wonder if they are passed on?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguably, if the employee was commuting to the office, then they could be saving money here. And the employer may need additional IT infrastructure to provide things like VPNs. So some things will balance out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do wonder if some unscrupulous companies might see this as a way to cut costs at the expense of employees absorbing the impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, my main worry is that some corporates might see this as a chance to ditch large office costs, but then not fulfill their new responsibilities to their new home-workers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could be wrong, and I&#8217;m sure that most companies will do a good job here. But I&#8217;m also sure that not all will.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s sum up:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remote\/homeworking has benefits:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Employees don&#8217;t have to commute.<\/li><li>Employees get more flexibility.<\/li><li>Employers can recruit from a broader pool of (non-local) people.<\/li><li>Employers potentially have much lower costs.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But remote\/home working may have drawbacks for some people:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A negative effect on the town\/city-centre economy.<\/li><li>Issues with not meeting and working face-to-face.<\/li><li>Employees may not have a space to work in and this may prevent people from applying for or getting jobs.<\/li><li>Employers may not invest in employees&#8217; well-being and compensate them for additional equipment and utilities.<\/li><li>Employees may lack useful transition time or not get exercise &#8211; never leaving the house can be a thing!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The high street issue<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the high-street issue is pretty clear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The boom in online shopping and the exodus of companies from expensive town-centre offices, all compounded by the effects of COVID 19, means retail on the high street is dying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, by my observation, service industries still seem to be doing OK, if not booming! There are SO many cafe&#8217;s and coffee shops in my local town centre now. I still travel in specifically to do banking sometimes. People seem to use hairdressers and gyms and post offices and so on. Things that you have to go in person to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So what can we do instead? How do we get the benefits of home remote working and avoid the pitfalls, while also benefiting the high street?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Remote working hubs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s where the dream comes in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The council, with support and commitment from a collective of companies, converts some dis-used office space in the town centre into remote working hubs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Larger companies, with a workforce spread across a number of different &#8220;home&#8221; locations, rent space in these hubs for the employees that live in and around that town.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The space is secure and has good connectivity secured by the company VPN. It&#8217;s the company&#8217;s space, so they are still required to furnish and equip it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular visits from health and safety\/occupational health ensure legal compliance and wellbeing of staff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smaller companies can rent this space too, and you could build in co-working for individuals. The space can run events &#8211; both educational and social &#8211; for people that use the building. Co-working spaces like this have begun to thrive in recent years prior to COVID 19 and lockdown!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Travel planning is done properly and multiple incentives are offered to encourage employees to not use single-occupancy cars, with walking, cycling and well-subsidised bus networks encouraging people to not use cars at all unless they have special needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the high street, retail declines, but services boom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People go back to the town centre in the week. They eat and drink in the morning and at lunchtime, sure. But there are also collection and return points for their online-ordered goods. They get their hair cut or do a bit of shopping in their lunch break and pick up some things for dinner before going home. Maybe they pop out for dinner with some colleagues or visit a bar or cinema after work? They try out technology in phone shops and get advice and customer service in person for things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This plan:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>taps into the booming co-working culture;<\/li><li>gives people the flexibility of choosing home OR office work;<\/li><li>reduces commute distances\/times while still enabling transitions if people want them;<\/li><li>gets people into the town centre and grows town-centre service economies, while propping up retail a little too;<\/li><li>enables employees to be properly supported by employers in an real office environment;<\/li><li>retains &#8211; probably improves &#8211; equality of employment opportunities, by not demanding people travel long distances to a central office, but also not demanding they have a space to work from at home<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I see two possible downsides:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>This is more expensive for larger employers as they may now maintain multiple office locations.<\/li><li>Large corporates may not be happy sharing a building with other large corporates. Could information leak between them if people intermingle in communal areas? What are the physical and &#8220;cyber&#8221; security risks? Are they worse than home-working? Or just different?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Could this work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There will certainly be office-based roles that need to be in a specific location. But this approach seems, to me, to be hugely beneficial to pretty much everyone. A best-of-both-worlds compromise between central offices and home-working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder why it&#8217;s not been discussed much? Has it not been thought of? Is it just too hard a change to make? Are those security issues just too big a barrier to overcome?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said at the start &#8211; I&#8217;m not qualified to be coming up with ideas like this and analysing the pros and cons. So: over to you&#8230; who IS? Could this work? What are the blockers? How might we take steps towards this dream?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

I love it as a CMS. But I often feel like I push it to its limits. As a back-end developer who deals with complex data and builds applications, I\u2019ve needed alternatives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I found the <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/\">Laravel<\/a> framework!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning Laravel and being immersed in its ecosystem &#8211; the tooling, the learning resources, the people in the community &#8211; has been hugely beneficial for my work and career. Including ongoing WordPress work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I want to bring those benefits to others who&#8217;ve not found these things yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-white-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-1024x147.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9465\" width=\"501\" height=\"72\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-1024x147.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-300x43.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-768x110.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-1536x220.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-2048x293.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, I\u2019m not the only person that spans WordPress and Laravel worlds. But I made a <a href=\"https:\/\/wptolaravel.com\">WordPress-to-Laravel<\/a> course, and some videos about useful PHP tools. And I\u2019ve come to see one of my roles as being a bridge between these communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond WP gives some structure to this. To start with, it will be an occasional email (I can\u2019t promise a schedule) with useful stuff from outside the WP bubble that I think will interest and inspire WordPress developers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If people like it I may expand the format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you will read more and sign up at <a href=\"https:\/\/beyond-wp.com\/\">https:\/\/beyond-wp.com\/<\/a>, and please share this with others. You can follow on Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/beyond_wp\">@beyond_wp<\/a> too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join me in taking a step Beyond WP! It\u2019s exciting and inspiring and fun.<\/p>\n",

I love it as a CMS. But I often feel like I push it to its limits. As a back-end developer who deals with complex data and builds applications, I\u2019ve needed alternatives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I found the <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/\">Laravel<\/a> framework!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning Laravel and being immersed in its ecosystem &#8211; the tooling, the learning resources, the people in the community &#8211; has been hugely beneficial for my work and career. Including ongoing WordPress work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I want to bring those benefits to others who&#8217;ve not found these things yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-white-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-1024x147.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9465\" width=\"501\" height=\"72\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-1024x147.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-300x43.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-768x110.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-1536x220.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-2048x293.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, I\u2019m not the only person that spans WordPress and Laravel worlds. But I made a <a href=\"https:\/\/wptolaravel.com\">WordPress-to-Laravel<\/a> course, and some videos about useful PHP tools. And I\u2019ve come to see one of my roles as being a bridge between these communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond WP gives some structure to this. To start with, it will be an occasional email (I can\u2019t promise a schedule) with useful stuff from outside the WP bubble that I think will interest and inspire WordPress developers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If people like it I may expand the format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you will read more and sign up at <a href=\"https:\/\/beyond-wp.com\/\">https:\/\/beyond-wp.com\/<\/a>, and please share this with others. You can follow on Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/beyond_wp\">@beyond_wp<\/a> too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join me in taking a step Beyond WP! It\u2019s exciting and inspiring and fun.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ve read articles about <a href=\"https:\/\/richtabor.com\/block-patterns\/\">Block Patterns<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/impress.org\/wordpress-full-site-editing-gutenberg-7-7\/\">Full Site Editing<\/a> and I keep up with <a href=\"https:\/\/wptavern.com\/?s=gutenberg\">WP Tavern&#8217;s excellent coverage<\/a> of development on the editor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve not done much other than simple post writing, and development of custom blocks using Advanced Custom Field&#8217;s excellent features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s time I caught up with new features and dived into what&#8217;s been going on and what the future looks like for the editor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg development happens outside of WordPress &#8220;core&#8221; in the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/gutenberg\/\">Gutenberg plugin<\/a>. I&#8217;d been saving up articles to read on each of the Gutenberg releases with the aim of reviewing them and trying things out. But I wasn&#8217;t getting through them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Live Streaming Gutenberg Releases<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Live Streaming &#8211; it&#8217;s what the cool kids do these days. And while I&#8217;m not a cool kid, and I have some objections to live streaming (mostly I don&#8217;t have time to watch everyone else&#8217;s streams &#8211; there&#8217;s too much interesting content!!), it&#8217;s something I thought I&#8217;d try out because:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It kinda makes me accountable for doing things.<\/li><li>If I recorded and published video I&#8217;d want to edit it and I often get stuck at the very-time-consuming editing stage &#8211; live streaming means I just do it and publish.<\/li><li>It will help me develop a video &#8220;style&#8221;.<\/li><li>It will get me used to recording my work again &#8211; something I want to do for some projects in the future.<\/li><li>Maybe, if people come along for the ride, I&#8217;ll get some help as I explore Gutenberg!<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m keeping it simple, just streaming on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/the_magicroundabout\">Twitch<\/a>, and publishing later on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCkx-5bxvKn1mGn90XfLikBA\">YouTube<\/a>.

So finding quieter times when I won&#8217;t be interrupted is hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Technology:<\/strong> While I have a pretty good A\/V setup, my laptop is pretty old and struggling with the job of working, streaming and recording, so, compared to others, the streams aren&#8217;t brilliant quality, but I&#8217;m working with what I have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also new to streaming. <a href=\"https:\/\/streamlabs.com\/\">StreamLabs OBS<\/a> is good software and is helping me a lot. But I am getting to grips with it as I go, and for the early streams I&#8217;m using an out-of-the-box &#8220;theme&#8221;. But if you&#8217;re a regular streamer yourself, or used to watching streams, know that mine won&#8217;t be the best, but they are getting better!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thoughts and reflections<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m enjoying the streaming<\/strong>, and it&#8217;s good to be getting back into video and learning what&#8217;s coming in Gutenberg. I&#8217;ve already learned a lot about both!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Streaming software is pretty good.<\/strong> I&#8217;ve played with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjN9fj2ssfqAhXXQUEAHYocCRA4FBAWMAB6BAgGEAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecamm.com%2Fmac%2Fecammlive%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1_hQf3vhAgGFP1oOrWTDej\">eCamm Live<\/a> (paid), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjfkfeqs8fqAhXKilwKHcJFARcQFjAAegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fobsproject.com%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw054AIqrSkxDm8_ctWCSWgb\">OBS<\/a> (free\/open source, but clunky) and now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjf2Oiys8fqAhVGilwKHY_uABUQFjAAegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstreamlabs.com%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1GJO6w3mUw7KXC_z7IGH04\">StreamLabs<\/a>. StreamLabs is based on OBS but seems simpler to use. And there&#8217;s a mobile app you can use as a remote control that&#8217;s a real bonus and gives you a mini control deck without needing something like a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elgato.com\/en\/gaming\/stream-deck\">Stream Deck<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mine is a simple and low cost setup, but it works for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Streaming is hard<\/strong>: typing; thinking; talking; making sure audio and video are working; making sure you don&#8217;t disclose passwords and other secrets while on screen. There&#8217;s a LOT to be doing all at once. And that&#8217;s before people start to chat!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Properly streaming also looks like a lot of work<\/strong>. You start seeing how others are managing their stream schedule, building communities in the chat, giving people chat moderation permissions, and designing all the screens and layouts and stuff. It&#8217;s a huge commitment to do it properly, and my reasons for doing it are so that I can do video more ad-hoc and SAVE me time. So there&#8217;s a bit of a conflict of needs there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I&#8217;ve chosen NOT to do too much promotion.<\/strong> On a Friday my Twitter feed becomes a stream of &#8220;Streaming in&#8230;&#8221; posts from others, most of which, as far as I can tell, are unnecessary because Twitch emails me when someone starts streaming. Plus, I&#8217;m nervous about putting myself out there in the early days while I&#8217;m still learning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s early days, and it&#8217;s mostly just me. But hopefully this Exploring Gutenberg process is helpful to others.<\/p>\n",

Join me on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/the_magicroundabout\">Twitch<\/a>. Or catch up and subscribe on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCkx-5bxvKn1mGn90XfLikBA\">YouTube.<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Getting behind the blocks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got quite behind on the functionality of the &#8220;Gutenberg&#8221; Block Editor in WordPress. I&#8217;ve read articles about <a href=\"https:\/\/richtabor.com\/block-patterns\/\">Block Patterns<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/impress.org\/wordpress-full-site-editing-gutenberg-7-7\/\">Full Site Editing<\/a> and I keep up with <a href=\"https:\/\/wptavern.com\/?s=gutenberg\">WP Tavern&#8217;s excellent coverage<\/a> of development on the editor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve not done much other than simple post writing, and development of custom blocks using Advanced Custom Field&#8217;s excellent features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s time I caught up with new features and dived into what&#8217;s been going on and what the future looks like for the editor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg development happens outside of WordPress &#8220;core&#8221; in the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/gutenberg\/\">Gutenberg plugin<\/a>. I&#8217;d been saving up articles to read on each of the Gutenberg releases with the aim of reviewing them and trying things out. But I wasn&#8217;t getting through them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Live Streaming Gutenberg Releases<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Live Streaming &#8211; it&#8217;s what the cool kids do these days. And while I&#8217;m not a cool kid, and I have some objections to live streaming (mostly I don&#8217;t have time to watch everyone else&#8217;s streams &#8211; there&#8217;s too much interesting content!!), it&#8217;s something I thought I&#8217;d try out because:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It kinda makes me accountable for doing things.<\/li><li>If I recorded and published video I&#8217;d want to edit it and I often get stuck at the very-time-consuming editing stage &#8211; live streaming means I just do it and publish.<\/li><li>It will help me develop a video &#8220;style&#8221;.<\/li><li>It will get me used to recording my work again &#8211; something I want to do for some projects in the future.<\/li><li>Maybe, if people come along for the ride, I&#8217;ll get some help as I explore Gutenberg!<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m keeping it simple, just streaming on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/the_magicroundabout\">Twitch<\/a>, and publishing later on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCkx-5bxvKn1mGn90XfLikBA\">YouTube<\/a>.

So finding quieter times when I won&#8217;t be interrupted is hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Technology:<\/strong> While I have a pretty good A\/V setup, my laptop is pretty old and struggling with the job of working, streaming and recording, so, compared to others, the streams aren&#8217;t brilliant quality, but I&#8217;m working with what I have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also new to streaming. <a href=\"https:\/\/streamlabs.com\/\">StreamLabs OBS<\/a> is good software and is helping me a lot. But I am getting to grips with it as I go, and for the early streams I&#8217;m using an out-of-the-box &#8220;theme&#8221;. But if you&#8217;re a regular streamer yourself, or used to watching streams, know that mine won&#8217;t be the best, but they are getting better!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thoughts and reflections<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m enjoying the streaming<\/strong>, and it&#8217;s good to be getting back into video and learning what&#8217;s coming in Gutenberg. I&#8217;ve already learned a lot about both!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Streaming software is pretty good.<\/strong> I&#8217;ve played with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjN9fj2ssfqAhXXQUEAHYocCRA4FBAWMAB6BAgGEAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecamm.com%2Fmac%2Fecammlive%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1_hQf3vhAgGFP1oOrWTDej\">eCamm Live<\/a> (paid), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjfkfeqs8fqAhXKilwKHcJFARcQFjAAegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fobsproject.com%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw054AIqrSkxDm8_ctWCSWgb\">OBS<\/a> (free\/open source, but clunky) and now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjf2Oiys8fqAhVGilwKHY_uABUQFjAAegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstreamlabs.com%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1GJO6w3mUw7KXC_z7IGH04\">StreamLabs<\/a>. StreamLabs is based on OBS but seems simpler to use. And there&#8217;s a mobile app you can use as a remote control that&#8217;s a real bonus and gives you a mini control deck without needing something like a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elgato.com\/en\/gaming\/stream-deck\">Stream Deck<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mine is a simple and low cost setup, but it works for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Streaming is hard<\/strong>: typing; thinking; talking; making sure audio and video are working; making sure you don&#8217;t disclose passwords and other secrets while on screen. There&#8217;s a LOT to be doing all at once. And that&#8217;s before people start to chat!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Properly streaming also looks like a lot of work<\/strong>. You start seeing how others are managing their stream schedule, building communities in the chat, giving people chat moderation permissions, and designing all the screens and layouts and stuff. It&#8217;s a huge commitment to do it properly, and my reasons for doing it are so that I can do video more ad-hoc and SAVE me time. So there&#8217;s a bit of a conflict of needs there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I&#8217;ve chosen NOT to do too much promotion.<\/strong> On a Friday my Twitter feed becomes a stream of &#8220;Streaming in&#8230;&#8221; posts from others, most of which, as far as I can tell, are unnecessary because Twitch emails me when someone starts streaming. Plus, I&#8217;m nervous about putting myself out there in the early days while I&#8217;m still learning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s early days, and it&#8217;s mostly just me. But hopefully this Exploring Gutenberg process is helpful to others.<\/p>\n",

So&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I exist in geeky tech spaces where kindness is often far too lacking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opinions abound. Pragmatism, spectrums of opinion, and nuance in debate is rare. Right\/wrong dichotomies abound, and discussion can be heartless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kindness to me is acceptance that I don&#8217;t know everything; that the opinions of others are valid even if they are different to mine; that asking questions is better than stating opinions; that the person I&#8217;m talking with or thinking about is a person with feelings just like me, and that I should treat them as I would want myself to be treated. Yes, this is ancient and Biblical, but for me it defines kindness!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also once heard this seemingly-bizarre thing about &#8220;cows looking at cars&#8221; that has had a profound impact on me. I probably remember it because the picture it conjures is so odd and yet so meaningful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is from a monologue about what &#8220;love&#8221; (the non-romantic kind) is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>So when you&#8217;re walking around in the world you see lots of people. But you don&#8217;t really see them. They&#8217;re just objects. They are functions. You&#8217;re like a cow looking at cars. You know, a cow looks at a car. They watch it. But nothing&#8217;s going on. When you drive past a cow [in Ireland] it looks up, it watches, but there&#8217;s nothing going on inside. And then it goes back to eating. That&#8217;s how we treat people in daily life.<\/p><p>But when you love somebody, some individual comes out of that background and you see them in their subjectivity. You see them as an individual.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this notion that I can look at a person as an object without soul, without mind, without feelings, thoughts or a &#8220;spirit&#8221; of the person. If I see them like that I can justify all sorts of bad behaviour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I stop and think that that person is a person like me: an individual; something more than a functional mass of atoms. Then, regardless of our differences of opinion, I find I have no choice but to consider my actions carefully and be kind.<\/p>\n",

So&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I exist in geeky tech spaces where kindness is often far too lacking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opinions abound. Pragmatism, spectrums of opinion, and nuance in debate is rare. Right\/wrong dichotomies abound, and discussion can be heartless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kindness to me is acceptance that I don&#8217;t know everything; that the opinions of others are valid even if they are different to mine; that asking questions is better than stating opinions; that the person I&#8217;m talking with or thinking about is a person with feelings just like me, and that I should treat them as I would want myself to be treated. Yes, this is ancient and Biblical, but for me it defines kindness!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also once heard this seemingly-bizarre thing about &#8220;cows looking at cars&#8221; that has had a profound impact on me. I probably remember it because the picture it conjures is so odd and yet so meaningful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is from a monologue about what &#8220;love&#8221; (the non-romantic kind) is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>So when you&#8217;re walking around in the world you see lots of people. But you don&#8217;t really see them. They&#8217;re just objects. They are functions. You&#8217;re like a cow looking at cars. You know, a cow looks at a car. They watch it. But nothing&#8217;s going on. When you drive past a cow [in Ireland] it looks up, it watches, but there&#8217;s nothing going on inside. And then it goes back to eating. That&#8217;s how we treat people in daily life.<\/p><p>But when you love somebody, some individual comes out of that background and you see them in their subjectivity. You see them as an individual.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this notion that I can look at a person as an object without soul, without mind, without feelings, thoughts or a &#8220;spirit&#8221; of the person. If I see them like that I can justify all sorts of bad behaviour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I stop and think that that person is a person like me: an individual; something more than a functional mass of atoms. Then, regardless of our differences of opinion, I find I have no choice but to consider my actions carefully and be kind.<\/p>\n",
