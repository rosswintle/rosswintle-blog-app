I&#8217;m therefore willing to pay large amounts of money for small, clever little gadgets, like a decent mobile phone, or an electronic organiser.  Yes, I spend hundreds on little devices that fit in the palm of my hand.<\/p>\n<p>So as a first time homeowner, and beginner gardener, I&#8217;ve been a bit overwhelmed by&#8230;well&#8230;by stuff.  By the sheer quantities of things that you can buy from places like B&amp;Q.<\/p>\n<p>For example, \u00a3200 will buy you a tiny media player with a bright colour screen and 32GB of solid-state storage.<\/p>\n<p>But it will also buy you about 1200 litres of compost.  That a LOT of compost.<\/p>\n<p>It will buy you a large pallate of bricks!<\/p>\n<p>If we go to the council recycling centre, it will buy you 200 bags of woodchips!<\/p>\n<p>It will buy you vast quantities of aggregates, cement, gravel and so on.<\/p>\n<p>It will buy many, many large pots of paint.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit baffling to someone that&#8217;s never bought anything larger than a sofa!<\/p>\n<p>And it troubles me somewhat &#8211; especially buying these things from somewhere like B&amp;Q.  I&#8217;m concerned by where these palletes of bricks and compost and aggregates come from.  How far have they travelled?  It must use an extraordinary about of lorry space carting this stuff around the country, and that can&#8217;t be good.  Can it?<\/p>\n<p>And what about all the building that&#8217;s going on?  Houses, shops, offices.  Thousands of big buildings going up all over the country.  These must consume huge amounts of resources, not just raw materials but again, fuel to move them around and energy to get them out of the ground and process them.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, in my 31st year, I&#8217;m only just starting to realise how big everything is!<\/p>\n<p>When we were at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cat.org.uk\">Centre for Alternative Energy<\/a> at the end of our holiday, we read a lot about the &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Embodied_energy\">Embodied Energy<\/a>&#8220;of buildings.  Relative to the amount of energy a building uses over its lifetime this is quite small, but I begin to see how use of local resources in building can make a major impact on sustainability.<\/p>\n<p>I, personally, will continue to be in awe at the sheer amount of &#8220;stuff&#8221; that I, as a homeowner, and we, as inhabitants of this planet, consume.  But we should all be thinking about where that \u00a33 bag of compost has come from and whether we could get it from a local source &#8211; or even make it ourselves (!!) rather than making a quick and easy trip to B&amp;Q.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m therefore willing to pay large amounts of money for small, clever little gadgets, like a decent mobile phone, or an electronic organiser.  Yes, I spend hundreds on little devices that fit in the palm of my hand.<\/p>\n<p>So as a first time homeowner, and beginner gardener, I&#8217;ve been a bit overwhelmed by&#8230;well&#8230;by stuff.  By the sheer quantities of things that you can buy from places like B&amp;Q.<\/p>\n<p>For example, \u00a3200 will buy you a tiny media player with a bright colour screen and 32GB of solid-state storage.<\/p>\n<p>But it will also buy you about 1200 litres of compost.  That a LOT of compost.<\/p>\n<p>It will buy you a large pallate of bricks!<\/p>\n<p>If we go to the council recycling centre, it will buy you 200 bags of woodchips!<\/p>\n<p>It will buy you vast quantities of aggregates, cement, gravel and so on.<\/p>\n<p>It will buy many, many large pots of paint.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit baffling to someone that&#8217;s never bought anything larger than a sofa!<\/p>\n<p>And it troubles me somewhat &#8211; especially buying these things from somewhere like B&amp;Q.  I&#8217;m concerned by where these palletes of bricks and compost and aggregates come from.  How far have they travelled?  It must use an extraordinary about of lorry space carting this stuff around the country, and that can&#8217;t be good.  Can it?<\/p>\n<p>And what about all the building that&#8217;s going on?  Houses, shops, offices.  Thousands of big buildings going up all over the country.  These must consume huge amounts of resources, not just raw materials but again, fuel to move them around and energy to get them out of the ground and process them.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, in my 31st year, I&#8217;m only just starting to realise how big everything is!<\/p>\n<p>When we were at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cat.org.uk\">Centre for Alternative Energy<\/a> at the end of our holiday, we read a lot about the &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Embodied_energy\">Embodied Energy<\/a>&#8220;of buildings.  Relative to the amount of energy a building uses over its lifetime this is quite small, but I begin to see how use of local resources in building can make a major impact on sustainability.<\/p>\n<p>I, personally, will continue to be in awe at the sheer amount of &#8220;stuff&#8221; that I, as a homeowner, and we, as inhabitants of this planet, consume.  But we should all be thinking about where that \u00a33 bag of compost has come from and whether we could get it from a local source &#8211; or even make it ourselves (!!) rather than making a quick and easy trip to B&amp;Q.<\/p>\n",

But last year my health wasn&#8217;t great.  I had a heavy, clunky, cheap bike.<\/p>\n<p>Since then I&#8217;ve acquired Fuzzy (or possibly, Fuzzy acquired me &#8211; I can never quite tell), who&#8217;s lighter, more aerodynamic, with higher gearing and great climbing capability.  I&#8217;ve been riding further and faster far more often and should generally be a lot fitter.<\/p>\n<p>I was to my slight surprise then that I managed to do the ride today just 0.4 mph faster than last time!<\/p>\n<p>And thus, I must offer my excuses, for there are senses in which this wasn&#8217;t a controlled comparison.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I had the heart rate monitor on and, though I spent nearly an hour over my defined aerobic zone, I was very aware of not pushing too hard.  Last time I would just have been going flat out to the limit of my ability.<\/li>\n<li>There was a lesser tailwind.  I remember there being a strong westerly last time.  There was a slight south-westerly breeze today.<\/li>\n<li>I went to the gym on Wednesday and played squash on Friday &#8211; it was quite frantic, and so I was probably a bit tired and low on energy.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Err..that&#8217;s probably it!  I wish I could think of more.<\/p>\n<p>Still, I did about a mile and a half more this time around, still got in under 2 hours, and averaged 18.1 for the whole 2 hours (with one 5-minute break to stretch and eat a banana).<\/p>\n<p>It was a GLORIOUS day for it, and I passed a bunch of guys on better bikes, who were cycling to Pangbourne &#8211; a little further than I was going, but my pace was significantly faster!<\/p>\n<p>I felt a little woozy afterwards, despite taking in a whole water-bottle full of Rego, and my legs were pretty tired, so I feel like I&#8217;ve pushed myself pretty hard.  I don&#8217;t really do leisurely.<\/p>\n<p>It was fun and I had a great day with my Uncle, Aunt and Cousin once I arrived and then caught the train back home.<\/p>\n<p>Must try it again sometime &#8211; only I&#8217;m quite quickly running out of summer!!!  Eeek!<\/p>\n",

But last year my health wasn&#8217;t great.  I had a heavy, clunky, cheap bike.<\/p>\n<p>Since then I&#8217;ve acquired Fuzzy (or possibly, Fuzzy acquired me &#8211; I can never quite tell), who&#8217;s lighter, more aerodynamic, with higher gearing and great climbing capability.  I&#8217;ve been riding further and faster far more often and should generally be a lot fitter.<\/p>\n<p>I was to my slight surprise then that I managed to do the ride today just 0.4 mph faster than last time!<\/p>\n<p>And thus, I must offer my excuses, for there are senses in which this wasn&#8217;t a controlled comparison.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I had the heart rate monitor on and, though I spent nearly an hour over my defined aerobic zone, I was very aware of not pushing too hard.  Last time I would just have been going flat out to the limit of my ability.<\/li>\n<li>There was a lesser tailwind.  I remember there being a strong westerly last time.  There was a slight south-westerly breeze today.<\/li>\n<li>I went to the gym on Wednesday and played squash on Friday &#8211; it was quite frantic, and so I was probably a bit tired and low on energy.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Err..that&#8217;s probably it!  I wish I could think of more.<\/p>\n<p>Still, I did about a mile and a half more this time around, still got in under 2 hours, and averaged 18.1 for the whole 2 hours (with one 5-minute break to stretch and eat a banana).<\/p>\n<p>It was a GLORIOUS day for it, and I passed a bunch of guys on better bikes, who were cycling to Pangbourne &#8211; a little further than I was going, but my pace was significantly faster!<\/p>\n<p>I felt a little woozy afterwards, despite taking in a whole water-bottle full of Rego, and my legs were pretty tired, so I feel like I&#8217;ve pushed myself pretty hard.  I don&#8217;t really do leisurely.<\/p>\n<p>It was fun and I had a great day with my Uncle, Aunt and Cousin once I arrived and then caught the train back home.<\/p>\n<p>Must try it again sometime &#8211; only I&#8217;m quite quickly running out of summer!!!  Eeek!<\/p>\n",

I had to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>get to know everyone, despite only being there for just over 24 hours;<\/li>\n<li>help out with some of the work;<\/li>\n<li>try desperately NOT to chip in too much (the project is led by the youth with adults just facilitating);<\/li>\n<li>find my way around the campsite and bothey;<\/li>\n<li>stay out of people&#8217;s way where necessary;<\/li>\n<li>learn the in-jokes and find my way around some of the more difficult aspects of communication and relationships that go on in any 10-day residential with hugely diverse people;<\/li>\n<li>find some quality time with Sally;<\/li>\n<li>and, of course, I wanted to feel like I&#8217;d left my mark, been myself and made a difference.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It was a bit of a mental, physical and emotional juggling and it left me pretty tired.<\/p>\n<p>But, what I saw while there was a hugely diverse group of young people aged 14-19 with a huge passion for educating people about climate change, working their socks of and contributing all sorts of wonderful gifts and talents to the cause.<\/p>\n<p>There were actors, artists, scientists, IT &#8220;geeks&#8221;, vegans and meat-eaters, nature lovers and city-slickers, people who love camping and people who hate it.  They were from all over the country and haven&#8217;t spent much time together but they got on like a really good team.  They were bright and understood not only climate change issues but a whole variety of other political issues.<\/p>\n<p>I was really very impressed with the young people.  The news may portray the bad things about our youth: knife crime, grafitti, yobs and hoodies; but the opposite end of that scale is people like the ones I met on Saturday: talented, hard working, committed, fun, intelligent teenagers who want to make a positive impact on the world in which they live.<\/p>\n<p>Go YOMAC!<\/p>\n",

They were from all over the country and haven&#8217;t spent much time together but they got on like a really good team.  They were bright and understood not only climate change issues but a whole variety of other political issues.<\/p>\n<p>I was really very impressed with the young people.  The news may portray the bad things about our youth: knife crime, grafitti, yobs and hoodies; but the opposite end of that scale is people like the ones I met on Saturday: talented, hard working, committed, fun, intelligent teenagers who want to make a positive impact on the world in which they live.<\/p>\n<p>Go YOMAC!<\/p>\n",

\u00a0And no force 8 gale up the Irish Channel was stopping it from sailing.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The crossing was a little rough and windy, but the weirdest thing was that we felt so out\u00a0of place. \u00a0There were so few people like us there. \u00a0Young twenty&#8230;.oops&#8230;thirty-somethings obviously don&#8217;t do ferries to Ireland in June. \u00a0Was this a taste of things to come?<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Leg 3: Getting out of Dublin<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We&#8217;d made the assumption that we would need no Euros. \u00a0The plan was to get to Dublin, and straight up to Northern Ireland where our beloved Grear British Pounds would be welcome.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>No such luck!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>As we left the port we were directed to the main N1 motorway via a Toll Tunnel. \u00a0With no idea if we could use pounds in the toll we followed the other sign saying &#8220;All routes avoiding Toll Tunnel&#8221;.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Sadly, this was the last sign we saw for a while. \u00a0There are, apparently, no signs in Dublin. \u00a0Not even for the N1 to Belfast. \u00a0They just don&#8217;t exist. \u00a0And so, 40 minutes, lots of Dublin&#8217;s suburbs, and very little helpful signage later, we eventually found the N1.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>That was not to be the last toll though, or the last bit of bad signage, and we struggled Northwards, stopping to buy a out-of-date map on the way. \u00a0They seem to be building roads in Ireland faster than the maps can keep up with!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Once we were north of all the tolls we had a smooth journey. \u00a0Past Belfast we picked up the M2 and and the smaller roads to Ballycastle &#8211; our destination &#8211; were surprisingly good.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Weather:<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>There was LOTS of weather! \u00a0All week! \u00a0Not all of it bad. \u00a0Some quite good! \u00a0But lots of it. \u00a0This was wild remote British Isles at their best!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>We coped but packing for a day out was hard. \u00a0Sun hats and sun cream alongside waterproofs and fleeces. \u00a0We took it all on most days. \u00a0Oh, and the forecasts were not much use, with daily predictions of rain, even on the days we got sunburnt!<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The B&amp;B:<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We stayed at a lovely boutique B&amp;B that&#8217;s recently been set up by some absurdly creative and go-getting artists\/entrepreneurs who recently moved to N. Ireland from London.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Our hosts were lovely people, hugely welcoming and helpful &#8211; possibly a little too much so for my liking. \u00a0I, personally, wasn&#8217;t sure what to make of them. \u00a0They were very high-class arty types and&#8230;well&#8230;I&#8217;m not&#8230;at all!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>But the food and rooms were excellent and the location was perfect too; out of town but within easy walking distance. \u00a0Ballycastle is an excellent base to explore the North Coast and Glens, so this B&amp;B comes recommended from many points of view. \u00a0It&#8217;s called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.glentaisie.co.uk\/\">Glentaisie<\/a> &#8211; though whether or not the owners will have moved on to their next big project when you read this is unknown!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Monday: Giant&#8217;s Causeway<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>One of our main reasons for heading to Northern Ireland was to check out the Causeway Coast and the famous Giant&#8217;s Causeway. \u00a0We weren&#8217;t disappointed.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>This is a weird and wonderful place. \u00a0It&#8217;s astounding that natural process formed such regular structures, and they&#8217;re much bigger than I thought they would be (though the area across which they are formed and visible wasn&#8217;t so impressive).<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>It was, of course, very touristy. \u00a0I felt young and very English. \u00a0But a cliff-top walk was a fine way to escape the crowds and see some of the other fascinating and bizarre rocks on display. \u00a0As always, well done to the National Trust for looking after it and for excellent visitor facilities.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Next stop was supposed to be the Carrick-a-rede Rope Bridge, but we stopped off at a quiet beach on the way. \u00a0A pleasant interlude, but I wouldn&#8217;t recommend swimming, even in mid-summer! So VERY cold!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Carrick-a-rede was disappointing and slightly uninteresting. \u00a0The rope bridge isn&#8217;t old or even vaguely scary (unless you&#8217;re afraid of heights, which I&#8217;m not). \u00a0It&#8217;s very much a recreation specifically for tourists. \u00a0Worth a little walk over though to see the nesting birds &#8211; just take a peg to put on your nose because the bird poo really smells!<\/div>\n<div>We dined on Monday night at the Central Wine Bar in Ballycastle. \u00a0We got good food for a good price. But skip the coffee at the end. \u00a0I had a VERY milky cappucino. \u00a0In fact, I&#8217;d doubt the presence of coffee in it at all!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Tuesday:\u00a0Strangford Lough &amp; Mount Stewart<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Tuesday saw a jaunt south in the car to Mount Stewart. \u00a0This is another National Trust property \u00a0(making good use of Sally&#8217;s staff card!).\u00a0<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We started out on the coast road, which was great fun and gave us some great views on a pretty clear morning. \u00a0It was slow going though.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We eventually hit some bigger roads and made our way down through Belfast to Strangford. \u00a0A beautiful place, and Mount Stewart was easy to find.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We booked onto<br \/>\n a timed tour of the house (the only way you can see it), and explored the fantastic gardens while waiting. \u00a0It&#8217;s worth a trip just for the gardens! \u00a0They&#8217;re split into different parts and there&#8217;s everything from formal gardens to an arboretum.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The tour of the house, which is still occupied by its owner, was also incredibly interesting and entertaining, with LOTS of insight into the property and its history and lots of things that take you by surprise (no spoilers here!!!).<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I, however, started feeling ill and ducked out. \u00a0Sally was good enough to drive me home and I felt quite a bit better by the time we got back to Ballycastle. \u00a0Seems I occasionally have little bits of nausea and I&#8217;m still a bit nervous after my long summer of being unwell last year.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Back in Ballycastle it was raining slightly, but we got Fish &amp; Chips and sat and ate it in our waterproofs on the seafront in the drizzle &#8211; very&#8230;VERY British!<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Wednesday: Rathlin Island<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>You can see Rathlin Island from Ballycastle. \u00a0It&#8217;s a little boomerang-shaped piece of inhabited land a few miles from the north coast of northern island. \u00a0About 80 people live there. \u00a0And lots of birds.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We were determined to visit, it would be a whole day out with a short ferry trip and some nice walking or cycling \u00a0through some remote land.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We didn&#8217;t plan our day very well though. \u00a0The ferry was the first little problem. \u00a0We&#8217;d planned getting the fasttrack but it was a little windy, and the fasttrack ferry didn&#8217;t sail. \u00a0We&#8217;d just missed the big slow ferry though, so we had to wait for the next crossing, thus wasting over an hour.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We eventually arrived with the intention of hiring a bike and cycling to the remote RSPB station to see the nesting puffins. \u00a0But we couldn&#8217;t find the bike man. \u00a0More time wasted. \u00a0So we decided to walk.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We got about half way before the &#8220;Puffin Bus&#8221; pulled up and opened its door. \u00a0The nice bus driver informed us that by the time we&#8217;d walked to the RSPB station we&#8217;d probably be about ready to get on the last bus back to the ferry.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>He gave us a free ride on the way out and we paid a single for the return. \u00a0Nice man.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>But how he got that bus to the RSPB station I won&#8217;t know. \u00a0It really was at the very end of the very last &#8220;road&#8221; of a remote island. \u00a0They were still building bits of footpath and handrail for pedestrains &#8211; let alone having a bus-ready road!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Anyway, by the time we got there the wind had picked up. \u00a0We struggled down the path to the RSPB station, which is sited in a disused light house. \u00a0As always, the RSPB setup is excellent. \u00a0Like with the National Trust we&#8217;re always impressed at their facilities, and building a new visitor centre in such a remote location is even more impressive. \u00a0The people are friendly, informative and knowledgable, and we had a fun and interesting hour peering at the birds through RSPB binoculars and warming up with a cup of tea.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The Puffin Bus took us back to the main town on the island and we hopped off and had a wander round the bay and saw some seals! \u00a0Then back to the ferry.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The wind had picked up more and the crossing back was really rough. \u00a0Great fun but a little scary, and occasionally very wet.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>All in all a good day out but we learned not to wing it&#8230;if you&#8217;re on a day out that involves lots of different timetables &#8211; plan it well! We ended up not having long on the island and we were hurried. \u00a0And had it not been for the nice man on the bus we&#8217;d probably have ended up having to stay overnight on the island or something. \u00a0Plan plan plan for days out!!!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>What we did plan was our evening meal. \u00a0We booked into a place called the Cellar recommended by the people in our B&amp;B. \u00a0 We failed to understand why. \u00a0The food was OK, but not great quality and too much of it. \u00a0Service was brusque too and I felt that we were imposing on them! \u00a0The fish was nice though.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Thursday: Glenarrif<\/span><\/div>\n<div>Northern Ireland has some great hills and valleys &#8211; the Glens. \u00a0We picked the biggest and best to explore &#8211; Glenarrif: Queen of the Glens. \u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>Again it was a bit of a drive to get there and we took the beautiful, off-road scenic route via Torr Head &#8211; this was mostly deserted and had fantastic views. \u00a0A most enjoyable bit of driving.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We arrived at\u00a0Glenarrif Forest Park. \u00a0The place was fairly quiet given what a tourist trap it looked like it could be. \u00a0We had a cuppa before starting out on one of the well signposted walks. \u00a0The sceneray was beautiful &amp; the paths well maintained and allowing access to parts of the forest that you wouldn&#8217;t normally be able to get to.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>What it lacked was an element of wilderness. \u00a0I like walking off the beaten track. \u00a0Finding my own way a little. \u00a0There&#8217;s a balance to be had between making a place accessible and allowing it to keep it&#8217;s character. \u00a0I felt this place had slightly lost some of its charm by being tamed by the forrestry people.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I would also add that this is a much better place to go in the morning. \u00a0The afternoon light leads to a lack of rainbows on the &#8220;Rainbow Walk&#8221; through the waterfall of the valley. \u00a0Well worth doing though.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>For the evening we went out for food again. \u00a0The B&amp;B people had recommended against restaurant &#8220;Quay 23&#8221; but we really liked it. \u00a0There was excellent, varied, modern food and a good atmosphere. \u00a0But as with everywhere else, the dishes were too big! \u00a0We also found that sevice tailed off when busy. \u00a0But probably our favourite of the three places we ate.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dublin<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/><\/span><\/div>\n<div>We left Ballycastle on Friday morning to head to Dublin for a day. The drive was good and we stopped early on to get some Euros to pay for any tolls we came across. \u00a0Signs on the way into Dublin were fine (the mysteries of the Emerald Isle!), even if our detailed directions to the hotel were only OK for 90% of the way.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We found the hotel in the end, checked in, and headed into town to explore. \u00a0We&#8217;d decided to do a general city-wide wander and check out the University Library and Book of Kells on Saturday morning.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The visitor centre was excellent and we had lunch in the cafe there. \u00a0We spent a lot of time wandering around but most of it in the trendy Temple Bar area. \u00a0It&#8217;s very much a city of art and culture and we enjoyed just milling around.\u00a0<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>As evening came the stag and hen parties started coming out, so we popped into a little Italian restaurant for dinner and headed back to the hotel to rest.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>On Saturday we woke up and headed off to see the Books in the University Library. \u00a0After picking up a wonderful breakfast in one of the city&#8217;s many independant cafe&#8217;s, we headed straight to the University Library. \u00a0This too is an awe-inspiring place. \u00a0The exhibition about the ancient books is very well put together and highly informative, seeing the books themselves is impressive too, but possibly a little disappointing after the big build up, and the library building itself is incredibly grand!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>What&#8217;s really impressive is seeing how much effort people put into creating a gospel book. \u00a0These people had such reverence for God&#8217;s word. \u00a0It&#8217;s really quite inspiring. \u00a0These are truly holy objects and fascinating pieces of art and history at the same time.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\nspan class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Heading back<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/><\/span><\/div>\n<div>The trip back was quick and easy. \u00a0We rushed off from the town centre to get the &#8220;Jonathon Swift&#8221; &#8211; the fast ferry &#8211; back to Holyhead. \u00a0And fast it is too!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We had a pleasant stop off with Sally&#8217;s uncle and aunt, who live on Anglessey on the way back. \u00a0This was nice and gave us more rest before the long drive back to Swindon on the Sunday.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Wrapping Up<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>In summary &#8211; we had a really good, if pretty busy holiday.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I&#8217;d recommend a visit to Northern Ireland, but probably only the one. \u00a0There was good stuff to see but not so much that it&#8217;s somewhere I&#8217;d rush back to (contrast with Rome, which we barely scraped the surface of when we went to visit).<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>There was LOTS of really good tourist information and I felt most things were easy to do. \u00a0But, as with the Forest Park, I felt the place had been sanitised too much. \u00a0It was TOO touristy and had lost some of it&#8217;s charm as a result.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I felt a little out of place at most times &#8211; I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a place where many people like us go on holiday. \u00a0But I don&#8217;t think that should put you off. \u00a0The Irish are friendly and welcoming people who&#8217;ll have anyone round for a drink.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Having said that, we probably failed to engage much with Irish culture. \u00a0We&#8217;re not big drinkers and we found ourselves heading to bed pretty early most nights. \u00a0There&#8217;s certainly a side of Ireland we didn&#8217;t see!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>As I finish writing this stupidly long post, I&#8217;ve just finished work before departing to Sicily on Monday. \u00a0Hopefully I&#8217;ll write a bit tomorrow about how we came to be going there. \u00a0Oh, and some more photos may appear as and when they get uploaded.<\/div>\n",

\u00a0Well, they didn&#8217;t sleep on the summit and the didn&#8217;t see a sunrise. \u00a0But they did the walking and bivvying. \u00a0Nutters!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SM7Q0XYdH6I\/AAAAAAAAC_g\/B_hAnh57fsA\/s288\/IMG_0749.JPG\" style=\"float:left;cursor:hand;width:320px;margin:0 10px 10px 0;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Leg 2: Snowdon to Dublin<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Sally&#8217;s friend was a fine host, we took a little tour of Anglesey on the Saturday and generally chilled out before a nice dinner in her lovely little cottage. \u00a0We&#8217;d visited the National Trust&#8217;s Plas Newydd on Anglessey &#8211; a strange mix of battelfield history, historic house and art &#8211; but well worth going for the astounding Rex Whistler mural.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>On Sunday morning we headed back over Anglesey to the Holyhead ferry port. \u00a0The weather still being a bit nasty, we&#8217;d checked that the ferry was actually sailing. \u00a0But this wasn&#8217;t any old ferry&#8230;noooo sir!&#8230;this was\u00a0Ulysses &#8211; the worlds biggest ferry!!! \u00a0And no force 8 gale up the Irish Channel was stopping it from sailing.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The crossing was a little rough and windy, but the weirdest thing was that we felt so out\u00a0of place. \u00a0There were so few people like us there. \u00a0Young twenty&#8230;.oops&#8230;thirty-somethings obviously don&#8217;t do ferries to Ireland in June. \u00a0Was this a taste of things to come?<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Leg 3: Getting out of Dublin<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We&#8217;d made the assumption that we would need no Euros. \u00a0The plan was to get to Dublin, and straight up to Northern Ireland where our beloved Grear British Pounds would be welcome.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>No such luck!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>As we left the port we were directed to the main N1 motorway via a Toll Tunnel. \u00a0With no idea if we could use pounds in the toll we followed the other sign saying &#8220;All routes avoiding Toll Tunnel&#8221;.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Sadly, this was the last sign we saw for a while. \u00a0There are, apparently, no signs in Dublin. \u00a0Not even for the N1 to Belfast. \u00a0They just don&#8217;t exist. \u00a0And so, 40 minutes, lots of Dublin&#8217;s suburbs, and very little helpful signage later, we eventually found the N1.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>That was not to be the last toll though, or the last bit of bad signage, and we struggled Northwards, stopping to buy a out-of-date map on the way. \u00a0They seem to be building roads in Ireland faster than the maps can keep up with!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Once we were north of all the tolls we had a smooth journey. \u00a0Past Belfast we picked up the M2 and and the smaller roads to Ballycastle &#8211; our destination &#8211; were surprisingly good.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Weather:<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>There was LOTS of weather! \u00a0All week! \u00a0Not all of it bad. \u00a0Some quite good! \u00a0But lots of it. \u00a0This was wild remote British Isles at their best!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>We coped but packing for a day out was hard. \u00a0Sun hats and sun cream alongside waterproofs and fleeces. \u00a0We took it all on most days. \u00a0Oh, and the forecasts were not much use, with daily predictions of rain, even on the days we got sunburnt!<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The B&amp;B:<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We stayed at a lovely boutique B&amp;B that&#8217;s recently been set up by some absurdly creative and go-getting artists\/entrepreneurs who recently moved to N. Ireland from London.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Our hosts were lovely people, hugely welcoming and helpful &#8211; possibly a little too much so for my liking. \u00a0I, personally, wasn&#8217;t sure what to make of them. \u00a0They were very high-class arty types and&#8230;well&#8230;I&#8217;m not&#8230;at all!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>But the food and rooms were excellent and the location was perfect too; out of town but within easy walking distance. \u00a0Ballycastle is an excellent base to explore the North Coast and Glens, so this B&amp;B comes recommended from many points of view. \u00a0It&#8217;s called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.glentaisie.co.uk\/\">Glentaisie<\/a> &#8211; though whether or not the owners will have moved on to their next big project when you read this is unknown!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Monday: Giant&#8217;s Causeway<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>One of our main reasons for heading to Northern Ireland was to check out the Causeway Coast and the famous Giant&#8217;s Causeway. \u00a0We weren&#8217;t disappointed.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>This is a weird and wonderful place. \u00a0It&#8217;s astounding that natural process formed such regular structures, and they&#8217;re much bigger than I thought they would be (though the area across which they are formed and visible wasn&#8217;t so impressive).<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>It was, of course, very touristy. \u00a0I felt young and very English. \u00a0But a cliff-top walk was a fine way to escape the crowds and see some of the other fascinating and bizarre rocks on display. \u00a0As always, well done to the National Trust for looking after it and for excellent visitor facilities.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Next stop was supposed to be the Carrick-a-rede Rope Bridge, but we stopped off at a quiet beach on the way. \u00a0A pleasant interlude, but I wouldn&#8217;t recommend swimming, even in mid-summer! So VERY cold!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Carrick-a-rede was disappointing and slightly uninteresting. \u00a0The rope bridge isn&#8217;t old or even vaguely scary (unless you&#8217;re afraid of heights, which I&#8217;m not). \u00a0It&#8217;s very much a recreation specifically for tourists. \u00a0Worth a little walk over though to see the nesting birds &#8211; just take a peg to put on your nose because the bird poo really smells!<\/div>\n<div>We dined on Monday night at the Central Wine Bar in Ballycastle. \u00a0We got good food for a good price. But skip the coffee at the end. \u00a0I had a VERY milky cappucino. \u00a0In fact, I&#8217;d doubt the presence of coffee in it at all!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Tuesday:\u00a0Strangford Lough &amp; Mount Stewart<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Tuesday saw a jaunt south in the car to Mount Stewart. \u00a0This is another National Trust property \u00a0(making good use of Sally&#8217;s staff card!).\u00a0<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We started out on the coast road, which was great fun and gave us some great views on a pretty clear morning. \u00a0It was slow going though.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We eventually hit some bigger roads and made our way down through Belfast to Strangford. \u00a0A beautiful place, and Mount Stewart was easy to find.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We booked onto<br \/>\n a timed tour of the house (the only way you can see it), and explored the fantastic gardens while waiting. \u00a0It&#8217;s worth a trip just for the gardens! \u00a0They&#8217;re split into different parts and there&#8217;s everything from formal gardens to an arboretum.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The tour of the house, which is still occupied by its owner, was also incredibly interesting and entertaining, with LOTS of insight into the property and its history and lots of things that take you by surprise (no spoilers here!!!).<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I, however, started feeling ill and ducked out. \u00a0Sally was good enough to drive me home and I felt quite a bit better by the time we got back to Ballycastle. \u00a0Seems I occasionally have little bits of nausea and I&#8217;m still a bit nervous after my long summer of being unwell last year.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Back in Ballycastle it was raining slightly, but we got Fish &amp; Chips and sat and ate it in our waterproofs on the seafront in the drizzle &#8211; very&#8230;VERY British!<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Wednesday: Rathlin Island<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>You can see Rathlin Island from Ballycastle. \u00a0It&#8217;s a little boomerang-shaped piece of inhabited land a few miles from the north coast of northern island. \u00a0About 80 people live there. \u00a0And lots of birds.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We were determined to visit, it would be a whole day out with a short ferry trip and some nice walking or cycling \u00a0through some remote land.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We didn&#8217;t plan our day very well though. \u00a0The ferry was the first little problem. \u00a0We&#8217;d planned getting the fasttrack but it was a little windy, and the fasttrack ferry didn&#8217;t sail. \u00a0We&#8217;d just missed the big slow ferry though, so we had to wait for the next crossing, thus wasting over an hour.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We eventually arrived with the intention of hiring a bike and cycling to the remote RSPB station to see the nesting puffins. \u00a0But we couldn&#8217;t find the bike man. \u00a0More time wasted. \u00a0So we decided to walk.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We got about half way before the &#8220;Puffin Bus&#8221; pulled up and opened its door. \u00a0The nice bus driver informed us that by the time we&#8217;d walked to the RSPB station we&#8217;d probably be about ready to get on the last bus back to the ferry.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>He gave us a free ride on the way out and we paid a single for the return. \u00a0Nice man.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>But how he got that bus to the RSPB station I won&#8217;t know. \u00a0It really was at the very end of the very last &#8220;road&#8221; of a remote island. \u00a0They were still building bits of footpath and handrail for pedestrains &#8211; let alone having a bus-ready road!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Anyway, by the time we got there the wind had picked up. \u00a0We struggled down the path to the RSPB station, which is sited in a disused light house. \u00a0As always, the RSPB setup is excellent. \u00a0Like with the National Trust we&#8217;re always impressed at their facilities, and building a new visitor centre in such a remote location is even more impressive. \u00a0The people are friendly, informative and knowledgable, and we had a fun and interesting hour peering at the birds through RSPB binoculars and warming up with a cup of tea.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The Puffin Bus took us back to the main town on the island and we hopped off and had a wander round the bay and saw some seals! \u00a0Then back to the ferry.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The wind had picked up more and the crossing back was really rough. \u00a0Great fun but a little scary, and occasionally very wet.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>All in all a good day out but we learned not to wing it&#8230;if you&#8217;re on a day out that involves lots of different timetables &#8211; plan it well! We ended up not having long on the island and we were hurried. \u00a0And had it not been for the nice man on the bus we&#8217;d probably have ended up having to stay overnight on the island or something. \u00a0Plan plan plan for days out!!!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>What we did plan was our evening meal. \u00a0We booked into a place called the Cellar recommended by the people in our B&amp;B. \u00a0 We failed to understand why. \u00a0The food was OK, but not great quality and too much of it. \u00a0Service was brusque too and I felt that we were imposing on them! \u00a0The fish was nice though.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Thursday: Glenarrif<\/span><\/div>\n<div>Northern Ireland has some great hills and valleys &#8211; the Glens. \u00a0We picked the biggest and best to explore &#8211; Glenarrif: Queen of the Glens. \u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>Again it was a bit of a drive to get there and we took the beautiful, off-road scenic route via Torr Head &#8211; this was mostly deserted and had fantastic views. \u00a0A most enjoyable bit of driving.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We arrived at\u00a0Glenarrif Forest Park. \u00a0The place was fairly quiet given what a tourist trap it looked like it could be. \u00a0We had a cuppa before starting out on one of the well signposted walks. \u00a0The sceneray was beautiful &amp; the paths well maintained and allowing access to parts of the forest that you wouldn&#8217;t normally be able to get to.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>What it lacked was an element of wilderness. \u00a0I like walking off the beaten track. \u00a0Finding my own way a little. \u00a0There&#8217;s a balance to be had between making a place accessible and allowing it to keep it&#8217;s character. \u00a0I felt this place had slightly lost some of its charm by being tamed by the forrestry people.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I would also add that this is a much better place to go in the morning. \u00a0The afternoon light leads to a lack of rainbows on the &#8220;Rainbow Walk&#8221; through the waterfall of the valley. \u00a0Well worth doing though.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>For the evening we went out for food again. \u00a0The B&amp;B people had recommended against restaurant &#8220;Quay 23&#8221; but we really liked it. \u00a0There was excellent, varied, modern food and a good atmosphere. \u00a0But as with everywhere else, the dishes were too big! \u00a0We also found that sevice tailed off when busy. \u00a0But probably our favourite of the three places we ate.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dublin<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/><\/span><\/div>\n<div>We left Ballycastle on Friday morning to head to Dublin for a day. The drive was good and we stopped early on to get some Euros to pay for any tolls we came across. \u00a0Signs on the way into Dublin were fine (the mysteries of the Emerald Isle!), even if our detailed directions to the hotel were only OK for 90% of the way.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We found the hotel in the end, checked in, and headed into town to explore. \u00a0We&#8217;d decided to do a general city-wide wander and check out the University Library and Book of Kells on Saturday morning.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The visitor centre was excellent and we had lunch in the cafe there. \u00a0We spent a lot of time wandering around but most of it in the trendy Temple Bar area. \u00a0It&#8217;s very much a city of art and culture and we enjoyed just milling around.\u00a0<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>As evening came the stag and hen parties started coming out, so we popped into a little Italian restaurant for dinner and headed back to the hotel to rest.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>On Saturday we woke up and headed off to see the Books in the University Library. \u00a0After picking up a wonderful breakfast in one of the city&#8217;s many independant cafe&#8217;s, we headed straight to the University Library. \u00a0This too is an awe-inspiring place. \u00a0The exhibition about the ancient books is very well put together and highly informative, seeing the books themselves is impressive too, but possibly a little disappointing after the big build up, and the library building itself is incredibly grand!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>What&#8217;s really impressive is seeing how much effort people put into creating a gospel book. \u00a0These people had such reverence for God&#8217;s word. \u00a0It&#8217;s really quite inspiring. \u00a0These are truly holy objects and fascinating pieces of art and history at the same time.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\nspan class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Heading back<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/><\/span><\/div>\n<div>The trip back was quick and easy. \u00a0We rushed off from the town centre to get the &#8220;Jonathon Swift&#8221; &#8211; the fast ferry &#8211; back to Holyhead. \u00a0And fast it is too!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We had a pleasant stop off with Sally&#8217;s uncle and aunt, who live on Anglessey on the way back. \u00a0This was nice and gave us more rest before the long drive back to Swindon on the Sunday.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Wrapping Up<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>In summary &#8211; we had a really good, if pretty busy holiday.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I&#8217;d recommend a visit to Northern Ireland, but probably only the one. \u00a0There was good stuff to see but not so much that it&#8217;s somewhere I&#8217;d rush back to (contrast with Rome, which we barely scraped the surface of when we went to visit).<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>There was LOTS of really good tourist information and I felt most things were easy to do. \u00a0But, as with the Forest Park, I felt the place had been sanitised too much. \u00a0It was TOO touristy and had lost some of it&#8217;s charm as a result.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I felt a little out of place at most times &#8211; I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a place where many people like us go on holiday. \u00a0But I don&#8217;t think that should put you off. \u00a0The Irish are friendly and welcoming people who&#8217;ll have anyone round for a drink.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Having said that, we probably failed to engage much with Irish culture. \u00a0We&#8217;re not big drinkers and we found ourselves heading to bed pretty early most nights. \u00a0There&#8217;s certainly a side of Ireland we didn&#8217;t see!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>As I finish writing this stupidly long post, I&#8217;ve just finished work before departing to Sicily on Monday. \u00a0Hopefully I&#8217;ll write a bit tomorrow about how we came to be going there. \u00a0Oh, and some more photos may appear as and when they get uploaded.<\/div>\n",
