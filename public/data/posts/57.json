That discussion was a chance to put my long-mulled-over thoughts into text, and I&#8217;m formalising and publicising that here.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know what Gutenberg is then go and read <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/01\/wordpress-gutenberg-user\/\">my previous post about it<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Context: My business<\/h3>\n<p>The context of this is that I&#8217;m a freelance software developer whose bread and butter is MOSTLY writing code for WordPress: custom themes and plugins for clients.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve been doing this for 6 years now, and some clients have come and gone, but I&#8217;ve still got a lot of highly-customised WordPress projects that I maintain and develop, and sites that I host for people.<\/p>\n<p>And WordPress&#8217;s current plan with Gutenberg is to have it on, by default, for everyone that updates to version 5.0 of WordPress when it&#8217;s released sometime in the first half of this year.<\/p>\n<h3>My response<\/h3>\n<p>I can see that this will totally confuse most of the people that I look after sites for.\u00a0 Bear in mind that quite a lot of my clients are small charities or very small businesses &#8211; some of them very rarely log in to their sites. And when they do log in and see something so very different it <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">will<\/span> confuse them and I&#8217;ll have to spend time helping them.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also concerned about custom fields\/meta boxes not working (though I&#8217;m trusting that this will all work without change), and the suitability of the Gutenberg interface for editing certain types of content.<\/p>\n<p>So my default position is that for existing sites I will probably install the Classic Editor Plugin until either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>sites have been reviewed and are ready to have Gutenberg enabled; or<\/li>\n<li>clients have requested the new editor and we&#8217;ve explained the caveats around it; or<\/li>\n<li>I otherwise become confident that nothing will break and my clients have been adequately briefed and trained.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The response from one person I work with to this was &#8220;Do you mean to say that we won\u2019t support this new WP feature?\u00a0\u00a0That feels like a big step &#8211; essentially the 1st time we\u2019ve done such a thing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And to respond to that I put forward some of the issues in more depth.<\/p>\n<h3>Gutenberg Issues<\/h3>\n<h4>1 &#8211; This is a drastically new interface.<\/h4>\n<p>Allowing all sites to suddenly have it will probably result in a raft of support requests and confusion. My opinion (and I&#8217;ve made this clear to core developers) is that NEW sites should have it enabled by default and existing sites should have it as opt-in. BUT it looks like they&#8217;re just going to push it out to everyone as of v5.0.<\/p>\n<h4>2 &#8211;\u00a0The Gutenberg interface simply isn&#8217;t suitable for quite a lot of applications.<\/h4>\n<p>You might not want Gutenberg for editing some custom post types like events or countries. And to have it enabled for <em>some<\/em> post types and not others will be doubly confusing for users.<\/p>\n<h4>2a &#8211; Selective disabling will require code changes<\/h4>\n<p>In any case disabling Gutenberg on a per-post-type basis will PROBABLY require code changes on every site that I\/we have developed that has custom post types. (It&#8217;s not quite clear how this will work yet though).<\/p>\n<h4>2b) Making Gutenberg work the way it&#8217;s been suggested you should is a LOT of work!<\/h4>\n<p>The suggested way to adapt custom-field-heavy post types to Gutenberg that has been <a href=\"https:\/\/riad.blog\/2017\/12\/11\/with-gutenberg-what-happens-to-my-custom-fields\/\">stated by an Automattic engineer<\/a> is:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create Gutenberg blocks instead of meta boxes for custom fields\/post meta data.<\/li>\n<li>Link the blocks to the post meta data so that data is properly structured inside WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Provide a Gutenberg &#8220;template&#8221; layout that contains all the elements\/data in the right places on the screen.<\/li>\n<li>FIX this layout so that the user can&#8217;t modify the layout\/structure\/fields &#8211; only the content.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I have described this as like upgrading a bicycle (a vehicle that&#8217;s cheap, that&#8217;s clean, that you can ride without training and licensing) to a motorbike, and then attaching pedals so that you can get all the benefits of the bike back.<\/p>\n<p>This is a bit of a crazy workaround. And it&#8217;s a large amount of effort to get back functionality that you used to have for free.<\/p>\n<p><em>(Note that yes, a motorbike has its own advantages over a bicycle &#8211; it&#8217;s faster and louder and many would consider it an upgrade! But you have to want a motorbike, and you have to get trained to use it and you have to license it and insure it and buy a helmet and so on&#8230; You don&#8217;t just give everyone a motorbike because you think it&#8217;s better &#8211; some people love <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2015\/11\/new-friend-marin-muirwoods-29er-review\/\">their bicycles<\/a>!)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I trust that custom fields will continue to work. But this alternative, Gutenberg-ready approach is a lot more effort and requires learning\/training for a lot of developers.<\/p>\n<p>I also can&#8217;t help thinking that what developers really wanted was a fields API.\u00a0 And I also find the WordPress data model pretty restrictive and would like something like post relationships in core rather than having to fudge it with <code>post_meta<\/code>\u00a0or a custom table.\u00a0 Gutenberg &#8220;blocks&#8221; are great, but they aren&#8217;t structured data. They&#8217;re just a blob of text in the database. And connecting blocks to an already-lacking data structure as a workaround really doesn&#8217;t seem helpful.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note\/plug: if you liked that paragraph then you might want to <a href=\"https:\/\/wptolaravel.com\/\">learn about MVC frameworks like Laravel<\/a> instead.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>3 &#8211; We don&#8217;t know what will break and how to fix it<\/h4>\n<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear if and how all our meta boxes and ACF fields and stuff will work in a new Gutenberg world. They should all &#8220;just work&#8221; (the ACF guys in particular <a href=\"https:\/\/www.advancedcustomfields.com\/blog\/acf-year-review-2017\/\">seem to be on it<\/a>) but again, it&#8217;s not clear at this point if any work will be required. Right now we don&#8217;t know what, if anything, will break and how much effort it will be to fix it.<\/p>\n<h4>4 &#8211; What will clients do with it?<\/h4>\n<p>Do we really want to let all clients have an interface where they can create columns, layouts, tables, and whatever other &#8220;blocks&#8221; are present in the system? This is nearly the equivalent of installing a page builder for everyone? Is this a good idea?<\/p>\n<p>Opinion amongst the people I work with is divided.\u00a0 And I do understand that some clients have been wanting this. But part of our job is implementing a design and layout that works, and I&#8217;m concerned that Gutenberg allows clients to step outside of our expertly-crafted page structures.\u00a0 Yes, you can lock the layouts. But that&#8217;s more effort again. So I don&#8217;t know what to think here.<\/p>\n<h3>Summary<\/h3>\n<p>Having Gutenberg will be great for new websites and new projects going forward, but I&#8217;ve yet to be convinced that enabling it for all sites when they update to WordPress 5.0 is a good idea. So my plan is not to do that &#8211; to disable it until sites and people are ready for it.<\/p>\n<p>What are your plans?\u00a0 If you&#8217;re a client of mine, feel free to drop me a line to discuss Gutenberg, or even to try it out.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><em>For more on this topic, see &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/01\/wordpress-gutenberg-user\/\">Where I&#8217;m at with WordPress: Gutenberg &#8211; as a user<\/a>&#8220;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The awesome development team at Delicious Brains (yes, that&#8217;s really their company name) posted <a href=\"https:\/\/deliciousbrains.com\/wordpress-gutenberg\/\">this excellent write up of the Gutenberg project<\/a>\u00a0today, and it prompted me to write more.<\/p>\n<p>This is actually text taken from a discussion I had with a team that I work with. That discussion was a chance to put my long-mulled-over thoughts into text, and I&#8217;m formalising and publicising that here.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know what Gutenberg is then go and read <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/01\/wordpress-gutenberg-user\/\">my previous post about it<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Context: My business<\/h3>\n<p>The context of this is that I&#8217;m a freelance software developer whose bread and butter is MOSTLY writing code for WordPress: custom themes and plugins for clients.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve been doing this for 6 years now, and some clients have come and gone, but I&#8217;ve still got a lot of highly-customised WordPress projects that I maintain and develop, and sites that I host for people.<\/p>\n<p>And WordPress&#8217;s current plan with Gutenberg is to have it on, by default, for everyone that updates to version 5.0 of WordPress when it&#8217;s released sometime in the first half of this year.<\/p>\n<h3>My response<\/h3>\n<p>I can see that this will totally confuse most of the people that I look after sites for.\u00a0 Bear in mind that quite a lot of my clients are small charities or very small businesses &#8211; some of them very rarely log in to their sites. And when they do log in and see something so very different it <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">will<\/span> confuse them and I&#8217;ll have to spend time helping them.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also concerned about custom fields\/meta boxes not working (though I&#8217;m trusting that this will all work without change), and the suitability of the Gutenberg interface for editing certain types of content.<\/p>\n<p>So my default position is that for existing sites I will probably install the Classic Editor Plugin until either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>sites have been reviewed and are ready to have Gutenberg enabled; or<\/li>\n<li>clients have requested the new editor and we&#8217;ve explained the caveats around it; or<\/li>\n<li>I otherwise become confident that nothing will break and my clients have been adequately briefed and trained.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The response from one person I work with to this was &#8220;Do you mean to say that we won\u2019t support this new WP feature?\u00a0\u00a0That feels like a big step &#8211; essentially the 1st time we\u2019ve done such a thing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And to respond to that I put forward some of the issues in more depth.<\/p>\n<h3>Gutenberg Issues<\/h3>\n<h4>1 &#8211; This is a drastically new interface.<\/h4>\n<p>Allowing all sites to suddenly have it will probably result in a raft of support requests and confusion. My opinion (and I&#8217;ve made this clear to core developers) is that NEW sites should have it enabled by default and existing sites should have it as opt-in. BUT it looks like they&#8217;re just going to push it out to everyone as of v5.0.<\/p>\n<h4>2 &#8211;\u00a0The Gutenberg interface simply isn&#8217;t suitable for quite a lot of applications.<\/h4>\n<p>You might not want Gutenberg for editing some custom post types like events or countries. And to have it enabled for <em>some<\/em> post types and not others will be doubly confusing for users.<\/p>\n<h4>2a &#8211; Selective disabling will require code changes<\/h4>\n<p>In any case disabling Gutenberg on a per-post-type basis will PROBABLY require code changes on every site that I\/we have developed that has custom post types. (It&#8217;s not quite clear how this will work yet though).<\/p>\n<h4>2b) Making Gutenberg work the way it&#8217;s been suggested you should is a LOT of work!<\/h4>\n<p>The suggested way to adapt custom-field-heavy post types to Gutenberg that has been <a href=\"https:\/\/riad.blog\/2017\/12\/11\/with-gutenberg-what-happens-to-my-custom-fields\/\">stated by an Automattic engineer<\/a> is:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create Gutenberg blocks instead of meta boxes for custom fields\/post meta data.<\/li>\n<li>Link the blocks to the post meta data so that data is properly structured inside WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Provide a Gutenberg &#8220;template&#8221; layout that contains all the elements\/data in the right places on the screen.<\/li>\n<li>FIX this layout so that the user can&#8217;t modify the layout\/structure\/fields &#8211; only the content.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I have described this as like upgrading a bicycle (a vehicle that&#8217;s cheap, that&#8217;s clean, that you can ride without training and licensing) to a motorbike, and then attaching pedals so that you can get all the benefits of the bike back.<\/p>\n<p>This is a bit of a crazy workaround. And it&#8217;s a large amount of effort to get back functionality that you used to have for free.<\/p>\n<p><em>(Note that yes, a motorbike has its own advantages over a bicycle &#8211; it&#8217;s faster and louder and many would consider it an upgrade! But you have to want a motorbike, and you have to get trained to use it and you have to license it and insure it and buy a helmet and so on&#8230; You don&#8217;t just give everyone a motorbike because you think it&#8217;s better &#8211; some people love <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2015\/11\/new-friend-marin-muirwoods-29er-review\/\">their bicycles<\/a>!)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I trust that custom fields will continue to work. But this alternative, Gutenberg-ready approach is a lot more effort and requires learning\/training for a lot of developers.<\/p>\n<p>I also can&#8217;t help thinking that what developers really wanted was a fields API.\u00a0 And I also find the WordPress data model pretty restrictive and would like something like post relationships in core rather than having to fudge it with <code>post_meta<\/code>\u00a0or a custom table.\u00a0 Gutenberg &#8220;blocks&#8221; are great, but they aren&#8217;t structured data. They&#8217;re just a blob of text in the database. And connecting blocks to an already-lacking data structure as a workaround really doesn&#8217;t seem helpful.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note\/plug: if you liked that paragraph then you might want to <a href=\"https:\/\/wptolaravel.com\/\">learn about MVC frameworks like Laravel<\/a> instead.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>3 &#8211; We don&#8217;t know what will break and how to fix it<\/h4>\n<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear if and how all our meta boxes and ACF fields and stuff will work in a new Gutenberg world. They should all &#8220;just work&#8221; (the ACF guys in particular <a href=\"https:\/\/www.advancedcustomfields.com\/blog\/acf-year-review-2017\/\">seem to be on it<\/a>) but again, it&#8217;s not clear at this point if any work will be required. Right now we don&#8217;t know what, if anything, will break and how much effort it will be to fix it.<\/p>\n<h4>4 &#8211; What will clients do with it?<\/h4>\n<p>Do we really want to let all clients have an interface where they can create columns, layouts, tables, and whatever other &#8220;blocks&#8221; are present in the system? This is nearly the equivalent of installing a page builder for everyone? Is this a good idea?<\/p>\n<p>Opinion amongst the people I work with is divided.\u00a0 And I do understand that some clients have been wanting this. But part of our job is implementing a design and layout that works, and I&#8217;m concerned that Gutenberg allows clients to step outside of our expertly-crafted page structures.\u00a0 Yes, you can lock the layouts. But that&#8217;s more effort again. So I don&#8217;t know what to think here.<\/p>\n<h3>Summary<\/h3>\n<p>Having Gutenberg will be great for new websites and new projects going forward, but I&#8217;ve yet to be convinced that enabling it for all sites when they update to WordPress 5.0 is a good idea. So my plan is not to do that &#8211; to disable it until sites and people are ready for it.<\/p>\n<p>What are your plans?\u00a0 If you&#8217;re a client of mine, feel free to drop me a line to discuss Gutenberg, or even to try it out.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

Here&#x27;s my initial thoughts after paddling around in the shallow end for a little bit.\ufeff<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TDD &#8211; Test Driven Development &#8211; has been on my radar for a while. This week, following conversations with friends\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/keiron\">Keiron<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/joelambert\">Joe<\/a>, I decided I&#x27;d try to dig in a little bit in my &quot;spare time&quot; and give it a go on a micro-side-project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x27;m signed up to Adam Wathan&#x27;s video course <a href=\"https:\/\/adamwathan.me\/test-driven-laravel\/\">Test Driven Laravel<\/a> (which, it turns out, is one of the best produced video courses I&#x27;ve taken &#8211; so far at least). So I&#x27;m using that to find out both Adam&#x27;s way of developing with Laravel, and how to use PHPUnit (and all of Laravel&#x27;s helpers) along with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Initial Impressions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x27;d watched an intro video, and I&#x27;d seen other Laravel videos on TDD, and my initial impression has always been that this looks like a very tedious way of writing code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The loop of run test -&gt; determine failure -&gt; write the next bit of code -&gt; run test without any thinking ahead of what you might do next (e.g. I KNOW I have to create a model, migration and controller to make this test pass, so why don&#x27;t I just go ahead and do all of that) has always bothered me slightly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I put this aside on the advice of others to try it out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Questions as I went<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x27;ve watched 11 of the videos now &#8211; I&#x27;m just at the stage where we&#x27;re simulating a real data-creation procedure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I&#x27;ve gone through, I&#x27;ve been trying to apply what I&#x27;ve learned directly to this tiny micro-project I&#x27;ve started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few questions came up for me when I hit data creation that haven&#x27;t been addressed yet, but I suspect will come up in future videos soon. But at the moment they are real questions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n    <li>How do I test CRSF tokens?<\/li>\n    <li>How do I check constraints that SHOULD be in the database (but aren&#x27;t yet) such as column uniqueness?<\/li>\n    <li>And, following on from question 2: if, as I&#x27;m doing the test -&gt; write -&gt; test loop, I have thoughts about what needs to happen in future (e.g. some column in my database will need to have unique values), where do I record those? Should I go off and write some kind of stub of a test that just passes for now?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see that small questions about the specifics of testing lead to bigger ones about the nature of how I should develop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x27;m SURE all this will be addressed in the course.\u00a0 But at the moment, I have a growing list of these kinds of issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Screen-Shot-2018-01-24-at-23.05.04.png\" alt=\"Screengrab of lovely green TDD tests\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other thoughts about the TDD process<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The TDD process has other things about it that need shifts inside my head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other things that have come up:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n    <li>How do I commit this stuff to version control in an orderly fashion? Do I commit the test and the code that makes the test pass at the same time? I wouldn&#x27;t normally commit a whole set of route, controller, model and migration all at once. Is this the way now?<\/li>\n    <li>It&#x27;s REALLY weird being able to write code that I know works, because the tests pass, but without actually having to visit the pages you&#x27;re creating. But GOOD weird!<\/li>\n    <li>How do I track all the stubbed-out stuff and work that needs to be done to complete it? Adam, in the videos, is striving to get his tests to green, and he sometimes makes tests pass by creating some incomplete stub. If the development process is being driven by the tests, and the tests are all running OK, then how am I supposed to know that there is more work to do?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summing up<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x27;m enjoying this process. I&#x27;m enjoying learning. And Adam&#x27;s course is fantastic. And I REALLY want to get to grips with testing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at the moment, I feel like I&#x27;ve learned enough to be able to ask more and bigger questions. And I&#x27;m concerned that it will take a while to get those bigger questions answered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you a developer who does TDD? What do you love about it? How did you learn? What questions &#8211; or answers &#8211; do you have?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>TDD is a BIG change of mindset for development. Here&#x27;s my initial thoughts after paddling around in the shallow end for a little bit.\ufeff<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TDD &#8211; Test Driven Development &#8211; has been on my radar for a while. This week, following conversations with friends\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/keiron\">Keiron<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/joelambert\">Joe<\/a>, I decided I&#x27;d try to dig in a little bit in my &quot;spare time&quot; and give it a go on a micro-side-project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x27;m signed up to Adam Wathan&#x27;s video course <a href=\"https:\/\/adamwathan.me\/test-driven-laravel\/\">Test Driven Laravel<\/a> (which, it turns out, is one of the best produced video courses I&#x27;ve taken &#8211; so far at least). So I&#x27;m using that to find out both Adam&#x27;s way of developing with Laravel, and how to use PHPUnit (and all of Laravel&#x27;s helpers) along with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Initial Impressions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x27;d watched an intro video, and I&#x27;d seen other Laravel videos on TDD, and my initial impression has always been that this looks like a very tedious way of writing code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The loop of run test -&gt; determine failure -&gt; write the next bit of code -&gt; run test without any thinking ahead of what you might do next (e.g. I KNOW I have to create a model, migration and controller to make this test pass, so why don&#x27;t I just go ahead and do all of that) has always bothered me slightly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I put this aside on the advice of others to try it out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Questions as I went<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x27;ve watched 11 of the videos now &#8211; I&#x27;m just at the stage where we&#x27;re simulating a real data-creation procedure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I&#x27;ve gone through, I&#x27;ve been trying to apply what I&#x27;ve learned directly to this tiny micro-project I&#x27;ve started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few questions came up for me when I hit data creation that haven&#x27;t been addressed yet, but I suspect will come up in future videos soon. But at the moment they are real questions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n    <li>How do I test CRSF tokens?<\/li>\n    <li>How do I check constraints that SHOULD be in the database (but aren&#x27;t yet) such as column uniqueness?<\/li>\n    <li>And, following on from question 2: if, as I&#x27;m doing the test -&gt; write -&gt; test loop, I have thoughts about what needs to happen in future (e.g. some column in my database will need to have unique values), where do I record those? Should I go off and write some kind of stub of a test that just passes for now?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see that small questions about the specifics of testing lead to bigger ones about the nature of how I should develop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x27;m SURE all this will be addressed in the course.\u00a0 But at the moment, I have a growing list of these kinds of issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Screen-Shot-2018-01-24-at-23.05.04.png\" alt=\"Screengrab of lovely green TDD tests\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other thoughts about the TDD process<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The TDD process has other things about it that need shifts inside my head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other things that have come up:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n    <li>How do I commit this stuff to version control in an orderly fashion? Do I commit the test and the code that makes the test pass at the same time? I wouldn&#x27;t normally commit a whole set of route, controller, model and migration all at once. Is this the way now?<\/li>\n    <li>It&#x27;s REALLY weird being able to write code that I know works, because the tests pass, but without actually having to visit the pages you&#x27;re creating. But GOOD weird!<\/li>\n    <li>How do I track all the stubbed-out stuff and work that needs to be done to complete it? Adam, in the videos, is striving to get his tests to green, and he sometimes makes tests pass by creating some incomplete stub. If the development process is being driven by the tests, and the tests are all running OK, then how am I supposed to know that there is more work to do?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summing up<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x27;m enjoying this process. I&#x27;m enjoying learning. And Adam&#x27;s course is fantastic. And I REALLY want to get to grips with testing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at the moment, I feel like I&#x27;ve learned enough to be able to ask more and bigger questions. And I&#x27;m concerned that it will take a while to get those bigger questions answered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you a developer who does TDD? What do you love about it? How did you learn? What questions &#8211; or answers &#8211; do you have?<\/p>\n",

Here&#8217;s my updated thoughts and reflections.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>My previous post about <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/01\/wordpress-gutenberg-business-owner-developer\/\">Gutenberg as a business owner and developer<\/a> got quite a lot of feedback from other people who felt a similar way, and generated some discussion. This is an update on that after exploring and thinking and conversing a bit about the topic.<\/p>\n<h3>What prompted the update?<\/h3>\n<p>This update stems from some thoughts that came about from doing Zac Gordon&#8217;s excellent video course on <a href=\"https:\/\/gutenberg.courses\/development\/\">Gutenberg for developers<\/a>.\u00a0 I reached a point on this course where I realised that if you create a custom Gutenberg block in the way that was being demonstrated in the course, it would save the block&#8217;s content to HTML, using a template that you define, in the post content. And if you decided to change the template that the block used to save its content then you would have to re-save every post that uses that block to update them all.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ooooooooh. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/WordPress?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/gutenberg?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#gutenberg<\/a> Just realised that Gutenberg saves block markup\/output to post content when saving the post. If the markup for a block changes you&#39;ll have to re-save every post that uses that block. ?<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Ross Wintle (@magicroundabout) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/957381194395594753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 27, 2018<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p><em>Note: some of you will be thinking &#8220;yes, but that&#8217;s not the only way to save data in Gutenberg&#8221;. And you&#8217;re right. And I&#8217;m coming to that!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I actually got some good responses to the Tweet above. Matthew Haines-Young, in particular, made some comments that got me thinking:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Think of these as separate things. One is an interface for editing. One is   the rendered output. Even if there is some overlap because you want them to look the same, they\u2019ll probable be quite different.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Matthew Haines-Young (@matth_eu) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/matth_eu\/status\/957615443069538305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2018<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Well you can have the code to create the output markup in JS if you want it together. And probably in future there will be plugins that let you create a basic block UI in PHP. Or just have a directory for each block with a PHP and a JS file in it.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Matthew Haines-Young (@matth_eu) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/matth_eu\/status\/957630683408666624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2018<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>I actually stopped replying to the conversation at that point because I wanted to think. I wanted to consolidate my thoughts.<\/p>\n<h3>So where are you at now?<\/h3>\n<p>I think what happened was this: while watching Zac&#8217;s videos (which I&#8217;m only part way through) I got stuck in the mindset of only having <code>registerBlockType<\/code>&#8216;s <code>edit<\/code>\u00a0and <code>save<\/code>\u00a0attributes to work with. These allow you to specify, in JavaScript, what the editing interface for your block looks like, and what information gets saved to the post content when the block is saved.<\/p>\n<p>So I was stuck with only these options. But also, I was stuck with the impression that this should be a WYSIWYG as possible: the editing experience should look much like the front end.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I realised that editing and displaying don&#8217;t need to look the same<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My first change of mind was to realise that currently, in WordPress, my editing interface for most of my structured data &#8211; custom meta boxes &#8211; looks and works very differently to the output that&#8217;s generated (if any) from those meta boxes. So they can actually be very different things.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, the equivalent of <code>registerBlockType<\/code>&#8216;s edit setting is all my meta box code. And the equivalent of <code>registerBlockType<\/code>&#8216;s save setting is&#8230;well&#8230;it depends on where you&#8217;re saving your block data to.<\/p>\n<p>But if you&#8217;re saving the block&#8217;s content to post-meta (which is possible in Gutenberg) then I guess the save method doesn&#8217;t apply, I&#8217;m generating PHP in my template files, and I&#8217;m not really any worse off than I was when I was using custom meta boxes. The code for editing and output is very different and is in different places.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I realised that thoughtful code organisation can help solve the JS+PHP issue<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Having accepted that it&#8217;s OK to save my data to post-meta and generate my output elsewhere, the next issue is the clumsy fact that I have code about the same block type in both JS and PHP.<\/p>\n<p>Why is this an issue? Well, mostly for reasons of understandability and maintainability of my code.<\/p>\n<p>So the question then is how can I structure the code for my blocks so that it all makes sense and is easily maintainable by future developers.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s be clear: having code about the same thing in both PHP and JS is never going to be great. But it&#8217;s going to happen more and more in modern web development that I have to describe my data in two very different places, so I kinda have to get used to this and figure out ways to work with it.<\/p>\n<p>Matthew&#8217;s idea of putting both PHP and JS for a block in the same directory is good and I&#8217;m sure there will be other architectural solutions to this.<\/p>\n<p>I then have questions like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do I pull all the JS into the build process?<\/li>\n<li>Do I even want to pull all the JS into a build process, or should I avoid code that needs to be compiled\/transpiled?<\/li>\n<li>Do I want one big JS\/CSS file that loads on every page regardless of which blocks are used?<\/li>\n<li>If I want separate JS\/CSS for blocks, how do I configure the build process to make multiple outputs?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And so on.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m not quite there with the detail. But nothing that can&#8217;t be worked out, I think.<\/p>\n<p>I still have a problem with post meta data being in blocks. It doesn&#8217;t always seem like the right thing. But that&#8217;s for future thought.<\/p>\n<h3>Can you sum up the technical bits?<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ll try.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>My issues with Gutenberg from a development standpoint have been around how I can manage structured data that I would typically store in post meta.<\/li>\n<li>I trust that the Gutenberg developers will find an appropriate way to keep existing meta boxes working. PLEASE!!!<\/li>\n<li>For better or worse &#8211; probably both depending on&#8230;stuff &#8211; Gutenberg gives us a new way to build interfaces for that post meta.<\/li>\n<li>Yes, Gutenberg can save the data in a block to post meta!<\/li>\n<li>The editing interface for post meta, and the display of post meta do not have to look or work the same &#8211; they aren&#8217;t with the current meta boxes!<\/li>\n<li>There are ways that you can structure your code so that having PHP and JS code about the same data objects is understandable and maintainable and probably no worse than current solutions for building meta boxes.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Well, of course! Gosh, it took you a long time to figure that out?<\/h3>\n<p>Again, this may be what some of you are thinking.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s get a couple of things clear:<\/p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m struggling with this a bit<\/strong>. It&#8217;s a big change learning Gutenberg, bits of React, assessing it from both a user and developer perspective, talking to others, raising issues, making voices heard.\u00a0 It will change how I&#8217;m going to work and I&#8217;m trying to learn, process, think, and plan while looking after two small children, doing my day job, and having a life. So I&#8217;m sorry if I&#8217;m a bit behind.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;<strong>I hope that this process has shown that I&#8217;m\u00a0<em>trying<\/em><\/strong> to be as open minded as I can, and that, though I&#8217;m struggling, I want to be positive about Gutenberg.<\/p>\n<h3>Lessons<\/h3>\n<p>I think there are some lessons from this process too though.<\/p>\n<p>The people building Gutenberg are doing an AMAZING job. I can&#8217;t over-state that fact. But there&#8217;s this perfectly natural phenomenon whereby if you&#8217;re deeply involved in something and have been working on it for a long time, you&#8217;ve been on a journey of learning and understanding and changing your mindset that&#8217;s taken months.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m trying to take that same mindset-changing journey in a shorter space of time and with lots of other things going on around me (GDPR anyone? A two-year-old&#8217;s birthday? My day job? ARGH <a href=\"https:\/\/wpbristol.co.uk\/developer-tools-tips-tricks-and-social-media-for-business-qa-tues-6th-feb\/\">I&#8217;M PRESENTING AT WORDPRESS BRISTOL PEOPLE NEXT WEEK<\/a>!!!).\u00a0 I&#8217;m playing catchup with limited mental capacity for it.<\/p>\n<p>And I sometimes feel like responses to questions or statements I&#8217;ve made about Gutenberg have been of the form &#8220;but it works if you use this method\/trick\/workaround, so what&#8217;s the problem?&#8221;, when actually, what&#8217;s needed isn&#8217;t a one-off workaround, but for me to have my mind changed about something more fundamental.<\/p>\n<p>This is NOT blaming any person for any specific comment or interaction. And us developers shouldn&#8217;t expect the Gutenberg developers to have time to be coaching us individually on changing our mindset (though they are having a really good job at trying).<\/p>\n<p>But it is an observation about communication that is limited by where different people are in their thinking, the time that people have, the written medium we have in GitHub issues and Tweets to convey complex ideas.\u00a0 And it&#8217;s as much my fault for leaping into discussions at the wrong times and places and without thinking things through before venting. For which I&#8217;m sorry.<\/p>\n<p>Basically, I&#8217;m an old dude who thinks hard about everything and is set in my old WordPressy ways &#8211; heck, I&#8217;d still be writing <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SPARK_(programming_language)\">SPARK Ada<\/a> if I could. It&#8217;s hard to teach me new things. You have to be slow and deliberate and careful. You can&#8217;t always just tell me stuff; sometimes I have to find it out for myself.<\/p>\n<p>And I suspect others are in the same boat.<\/p>\n<h3>So what&#8217;s next?<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m choosing to persevere and I&#8217;m grateful to those who have helped.<\/p>\n<p>I see the opportunity, but I sense and understand a lot of developer unhappiness, and I still have some of my own too, and that has some good foundation in some cases.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m starting to think this will be OK from a developer point of view. It will be hard, there is work to do, but it will be OK.<\/p>\n<p>If you, like me, are a WordPress developer getting to grips with all this, I urge you to persevere; to ask questions; to read <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/gutenberg\/handbook\/\">the handbook<\/a>;\u00a0to\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/gutenberg.news\/\">track down the resources<\/a>\u00a0people are making available; to be in the learning process for the long game, not the quick win; and to remember as you do so that the answers may not be simple workarounds, they may be more difficult shifts of thinking.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re way ahead with thinking about Gutenberg then please remember to be gentle with old dinosaurs like me who lack a bit of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Neuroplasticity\">neuroplasticity<\/a> and are trying their best to catch up. We may need more than a quick fix!<\/p>\n<p>I still have reservations about Gutenberg as a user, and I still think the upgrade process will be a shock to many who use WordPress. But as a developer, I think I&#8217;m coming around.<\/p>\n<p>And I hope you will too.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

This is an update on that after exploring and thinking and conversing a bit about the topic.<\/p>\n<h3>What prompted the update?<\/h3>\n<p>This update stems from some thoughts that came about from doing Zac Gordon&#8217;s excellent video course on <a href=\"https:\/\/gutenberg.courses\/development\/\">Gutenberg for developers<\/a>.\u00a0 I reached a point on this course where I realised that if you create a custom Gutenberg block in the way that was being demonstrated in the course, it would save the block&#8217;s content to HTML, using a template that you define, in the post content. And if you decided to change the template that the block used to save its content then you would have to re-save every post that uses that block to update them all.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ooooooooh. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/WordPress?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/gutenberg?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#gutenberg<\/a> Just realised that Gutenberg saves block markup\/output to post content when saving the post. If the markup for a block changes you&#39;ll have to re-save every post that uses that block. ?<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Ross Wintle (@magicroundabout) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/957381194395594753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 27, 2018<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p><em>Note: some of you will be thinking &#8220;yes, but that&#8217;s not the only way to save data in Gutenberg&#8221;. And you&#8217;re right. And I&#8217;m coming to that!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I actually got some good responses to the Tweet above. Matthew Haines-Young, in particular, made some comments that got me thinking:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Think of these as separate things. One is an interface for editing. One is   the rendered output. Even if there is some overlap because you want them to look the same, they\u2019ll probable be quite different.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Matthew Haines-Young (@matth_eu) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/matth_eu\/status\/957615443069538305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2018<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Well you can have the code to create the output markup in JS if you want it together. And probably in future there will be plugins that let you create a basic block UI in PHP. Or just have a directory for each block with a PHP and a JS file in it.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Matthew Haines-Young (@matth_eu) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/matth_eu\/status\/957630683408666624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2018<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>I actually stopped replying to the conversation at that point because I wanted to think. I wanted to consolidate my thoughts.<\/p>\n<h3>So where are you at now?<\/h3>\n<p>I think what happened was this: while watching Zac&#8217;s videos (which I&#8217;m only part way through) I got stuck in the mindset of only having <code>registerBlockType<\/code>&#8216;s <code>edit<\/code>\u00a0and <code>save<\/code>\u00a0attributes to work with. These allow you to specify, in JavaScript, what the editing interface for your block looks like, and what information gets saved to the post content when the block is saved.<\/p>\n<p>So I was stuck with only these options. But also, I was stuck with the impression that this should be a WYSIWYG as possible: the editing experience should look much like the front end.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I realised that editing and displaying don&#8217;t need to look the same<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My first change of mind was to realise that currently, in WordPress, my editing interface for most of my structured data &#8211; custom meta boxes &#8211; looks and works very differently to the output that&#8217;s generated (if any) from those meta boxes. So they can actually be very different things.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, the equivalent of <code>registerBlockType<\/code>&#8216;s edit setting is all my meta box code. And the equivalent of <code>registerBlockType<\/code>&#8216;s save setting is&#8230;well&#8230;it depends on where you&#8217;re saving your block data to.<\/p>\n<p>But if you&#8217;re saving the block&#8217;s content to post-meta (which is possible in Gutenberg) then I guess the save method doesn&#8217;t apply, I&#8217;m generating PHP in my template files, and I&#8217;m not really any worse off than I was when I was using custom meta boxes. The code for editing and output is very different and is in different places.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I realised that thoughtful code organisation can help solve the JS+PHP issue<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Having accepted that it&#8217;s OK to save my data to post-meta and generate my output elsewhere, the next issue is the clumsy fact that I have code about the same block type in both JS and PHP.<\/p>\n<p>Why is this an issue? Well, mostly for reasons of understandability and maintainability of my code.<\/p>\n<p>So the question then is how can I structure the code for my blocks so that it all makes sense and is easily maintainable by future developers.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s be clear: having code about the same thing in both PHP and JS is never going to be great. But it&#8217;s going to happen more and more in modern web development that I have to describe my data in two very different places, so I kinda have to get used to this and figure out ways to work with it.<\/p>\n<p>Matthew&#8217;s idea of putting both PHP and JS for a block in the same directory is good and I&#8217;m sure there will be other architectural solutions to this.<\/p>\n<p>I then have questions like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do I pull all the JS into the build process?<\/li>\n<li>Do I even want to pull all the JS into a build process, or should I avoid code that needs to be compiled\/transpiled?<\/li>\n<li>Do I want one big JS\/CSS file that loads on every page regardless of which blocks are used?<\/li>\n<li>If I want separate JS\/CSS for blocks, how do I configure the build process to make multiple outputs?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And so on.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m not quite there with the detail. But nothing that can&#8217;t be worked out, I think.<\/p>\n<p>I still have a problem with post meta data being in blocks. It doesn&#8217;t always seem like the right thing. But that&#8217;s for future thought.<\/p>\n<h3>Can you sum up the technical bits?<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ll try.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>My issues with Gutenberg from a development standpoint have been around how I can manage structured data that I would typically store in post meta.<\/li>\n<li>I trust that the Gutenberg developers will find an appropriate way to keep existing meta boxes working. PLEASE!!!<\/li>\n<li>For better or worse &#8211; probably both depending on&#8230;stuff &#8211; Gutenberg gives us a new way to build interfaces for that post meta.<\/li>\n<li>Yes, Gutenberg can save the data in a block to post meta!<\/li>\n<li>The editing interface for post meta, and the display of post meta do not have to look or work the same &#8211; they aren&#8217;t with the current meta boxes!<\/li>\n<li>There are ways that you can structure your code so that having PHP and JS code about the same data objects is understandable and maintainable and probably no worse than current solutions for building meta boxes.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Well, of course! Gosh, it took you a long time to figure that out?<\/h3>\n<p>Again, this may be what some of you are thinking.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s get a couple of things clear:<\/p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m struggling with this a bit<\/strong>. It&#8217;s a big change learning Gutenberg, bits of React, assessing it from both a user and developer perspective, talking to others, raising issues, making voices heard.\u00a0 It will change how I&#8217;m going to work and I&#8217;m trying to learn, process, think, and plan while looking after two small children, doing my day job, and having a life. So I&#8217;m sorry if I&#8217;m a bit behind.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;<strong>I hope that this process has shown that I&#8217;m\u00a0<em>trying<\/em><\/strong> to be as open minded as I can, and that, though I&#8217;m struggling, I want to be positive about Gutenberg.<\/p>\n<h3>Lessons<\/h3>\n<p>I think there are some lessons from this process too though.<\/p>\n<p>The people building Gutenberg are doing an AMAZING job. I can&#8217;t over-state that fact. But there&#8217;s this perfectly natural phenomenon whereby if you&#8217;re deeply involved in something and have been working on it for a long time, you&#8217;ve been on a journey of learning and understanding and changing your mindset that&#8217;s taken months.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m trying to take that same mindset-changing journey in a shorter space of time and with lots of other things going on around me (GDPR anyone? A two-year-old&#8217;s birthday? My day job? ARGH <a href=\"https:\/\/wpbristol.co.uk\/developer-tools-tips-tricks-and-social-media-for-business-qa-tues-6th-feb\/\">I&#8217;M PRESENTING AT WORDPRESS BRISTOL PEOPLE NEXT WEEK<\/a>!!!).\u00a0 I&#8217;m playing catchup with limited mental capacity for it.<\/p>\n<p>And I sometimes feel like responses to questions or statements I&#8217;ve made about Gutenberg have been of the form &#8220;but it works if you use this method\/trick\/workaround, so what&#8217;s the problem?&#8221;, when actually, what&#8217;s needed isn&#8217;t a one-off workaround, but for me to have my mind changed about something more fundamental.<\/p>\n<p>This is NOT blaming any person for any specific comment or interaction. And us developers shouldn&#8217;t expect the Gutenberg developers to have time to be coaching us individually on changing our mindset (though they are having a really good job at trying).<\/p>\n<p>But it is an observation about communication that is limited by where different people are in their thinking, the time that people have, the written medium we have in GitHub issues and Tweets to convey complex ideas.\u00a0 And it&#8217;s as much my fault for leaping into discussions at the wrong times and places and without thinking things through before venting. For which I&#8217;m sorry.<\/p>\n<p>Basically, I&#8217;m an old dude who thinks hard about everything and is set in my old WordPressy ways &#8211; heck, I&#8217;d still be writing <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SPARK_(programming_language)\">SPARK Ada<\/a> if I could. It&#8217;s hard to teach me new things. You have to be slow and deliberate and careful. You can&#8217;t always just tell me stuff; sometimes I have to find it out for myself.<\/p>\n<p>And I suspect others are in the same boat.<\/p>\n<h3>So what&#8217;s next?<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m choosing to persevere and I&#8217;m grateful to those who have helped.<\/p>\n<p>I see the opportunity, but I sense and understand a lot of developer unhappiness, and I still have some of my own too, and that has some good foundation in some cases.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m starting to think this will be OK from a developer point of view. It will be hard, there is work to do, but it will be OK.<\/p>\n<p>If you, like me, are a WordPress developer getting to grips with all this, I urge you to persevere; to ask questions; to read <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/gutenberg\/handbook\/\">the handbook<\/a>;\u00a0to\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/gutenberg.news\/\">track down the resources<\/a>\u00a0people are making available; to be in the learning process for the long game, not the quick win; and to remember as you do so that the answers may not be simple workarounds, they may be more difficult shifts of thinking.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re way ahead with thinking about Gutenberg then please remember to be gentle with old dinosaurs like me who lack a bit of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Neuroplasticity\">neuroplasticity<\/a> and are trying their best to catch up. We may need more than a quick fix!<\/p>\n<p>I still have reservations about Gutenberg as a user, and I still think the upgrade process will be a shock to many who use WordPress. But as a developer, I think I&#8217;m coming around.<\/p>\n<p>And I hope you will too.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>I don&#8217;t like Twitter threads. I don&#8217;t like putting my content on a commercial platform that way where I&#8217;m the customer. BUT&#8230;I wrote a thread today and it got a lot of engagement. So it turns out they work.<\/p>\n<p>But I don&#8217;t want my content JUST sat on someone else&#8217;s servers. So I&#8217;m copying it here.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a thread designed to help non-web people understand how something that seems trivial on a website can lead to so many micro-decisions needing to be made.<\/p>\n<h3>I need to add social sharing buttons to a website&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>First of all, I could use a plugin. But most of the plugins for social sharing are terrible. Many use third party services with tracking. They often can&#8217;t be styled to match the site. So I&#8217;m not going with that approach.<\/p>\n<p>I could use standard buttons from the social media platforms themselves, but, though are nice to use and have good user interfaces, they are basically hidden tracking tags for the social networks. And they can&#8217;t be styled. So I&#8217;m not using them either.<\/p>\n<p>So I think I&#8217;ll use the basic sharing links, which aren&#8217;t quite as nice to use, but no-one uses these things anyway (Do they? Why do we have these buttons at all? Are they even needed?). I can generate those at <a href=\"http:\/\/sharingbuttons.io\/\">http:\/\/sharingbuttons.io\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Now I have to actually add the icons themselves. We don&#8217;t use standard fixed-resolution images (jpg or png files) these days. So we&#8217;ll use some kind of &#8220;vector&#8221; that will look nice on any screen. I could use inline icons with SVG or an icon font like FontAwesome.<\/p>\n<p>But I don&#8217;t want to include the WHOLE of FontAwesome because it&#8217;s full of icons and code that I won&#8217;t use. (Unless I already am including it on this project for some reason. Am I? No, I&#8217;m not. OK.)<\/p>\n<p>And, actually, my links have text in and I&#8217;m using a CSS text-hiding technique to not show it. So I can&#8217;t use inline icons. I&#8217;ll have to use a positioned CSS pseudo-class. That works best with FontAwesome and the like but I think I&#8217;ve ruled that out for bloat. So&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I think I&#8217;m back to using SVG. Probably positioned using CSS with the icon as a background image. So I need the icons as SVG&#8217;s. Sure I can find them somewhere. Ah! <a href=\"http:\/\/sharingbuttons.io\/\">http:\/\/sharingbuttons.io\/<\/a> includes them. Hurrah! But they&#8217;re inline and I don&#8217;t want inline.<\/p>\n<p>So options are:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; put each SVG in a separate file<br \/>\n&#8211; use an SVG sprite<br \/>\n&#8211; insert it directly into my CSS styles somehow<\/p>\n<p>Each of these has pros and cons.<\/p>\n<p>SVGs in separate files are maybe fine if you&#8217;re running HTTP2 on the web server which needs HTTPS as well.<\/p>\n<p>But I don&#8217;t really want lots of separate files.<\/p>\n<p>SVG sprites (which have more than one image in a single image file and you only show the bit you need) can be done, but it&#8217;s ugly.<\/p>\n<p>So including in my CSS seems like the favoured option.<\/p>\n<p>(I&#8217;m sure this is what I normally do, but I seem to go through this process every time. This thread is partly me documenting the process for the next time I go through it. Thanks for bearing with me.)<\/p>\n<p>Aside: My office mate is reading. We have agreed that front-end development is&#8230;a word that I won&#8217;t use. Oh how simple it was when you just inserted a image.<\/p>\n<p>But all these &#8220;retina&#8221; and &#8220;3x&#8221; devices came along, which is what &#8220;vector&#8221; graphics are great for.<\/p>\n<p>Needs must!<\/p>\n<p>Right, so I&#8217;ve got the SVG code from http:\/\/sharingbuttons.io\/. All I need to do is encode it in BASE64, and stick it into my CSS &#8211; probably (as I&#8217;m using SASS) as a handy variable or mixin.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the downside of this is that I won&#8217;t be able to re-style the icon as a different colour if I need to. But I THINK I&#8217;m only using them in white on this site. Hmm.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well. Off to Dan&#8217;s Tools to encode the icons. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cleancss.com\/base64-encode\/\">https:\/\/www.cleancss.com\/base64-encode\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>So there we go. &#8220;Just&#8221; adding sharing buttons. Simple, huh?<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully that&#8217;s given some insight into the mind of a web developer.<\/p>\n<p>We have to think of future-proofing, performance, hi-res displays, privacy, accessibility, security, user experience &amp; more!<\/p>\n<p>Ta for reading!<\/p>\n<p><em>Note: this was the end of the thread, but then&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Actually, I just found a better way. In this case I CAN inline the SVG in my HTML and then use CSS to absolutely position it thus avoiding the text-hiding. I could probably avoid the text-hiding with an icon font this way too. You learn\/figure out every day on this job!<\/p>\n<p>Also, it wasn&#8217;t my intention to share this when I started, but if this has been of interest &amp; you want to know a bit more about how people like me have to think about what we&#8217;re making, I did a fun, fast-paced talk on User Experience a while back.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/XskEx1b9n9g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

But most of the plugins for social sharing are terrible. Many use third party services with tracking. They often can&#8217;t be styled to match the site. So I&#8217;m not going with that approach.<\/p>\n<p>I could use standard buttons from the social media platforms themselves, but, though are nice to use and have good user interfaces, they are basically hidden tracking tags for the social networks. And they can&#8217;t be styled. So I&#8217;m not using them either.<\/p>\n<p>So I think I&#8217;ll use the basic sharing links, which aren&#8217;t quite as nice to use, but no-one uses these things anyway (Do they? Why do we have these buttons at all? Are they even needed?). I can generate those at <a href=\"http:\/\/sharingbuttons.io\/\">http:\/\/sharingbuttons.io\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Now I have to actually add the icons themselves. We don&#8217;t use standard fixed-resolution images (jpg or png files) these days. So we&#8217;ll use some kind of &#8220;vector&#8221; that will look nice on any screen. I could use inline icons with SVG or an icon font like FontAwesome.<\/p>\n<p>But I don&#8217;t want to include the WHOLE of FontAwesome because it&#8217;s full of icons and code that I won&#8217;t use. (Unless I already am including it on this project for some reason. Am I? No, I&#8217;m not. OK.)<\/p>\n<p>And, actually, my links have text in and I&#8217;m using a CSS text-hiding technique to not show it. So I can&#8217;t use inline icons. I&#8217;ll have to use a positioned CSS pseudo-class. That works best with FontAwesome and the like but I think I&#8217;ve ruled that out for bloat. So&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I think I&#8217;m back to using SVG. Probably positioned using CSS with the icon as a background image. So I need the icons as SVG&#8217;s. Sure I can find them somewhere. Ah! <a href=\"http:\/\/sharingbuttons.io\/\">http:\/\/sharingbuttons.io\/<\/a> includes them. Hurrah! But they&#8217;re inline and I don&#8217;t want inline.<\/p>\n<p>So options are:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; put each SVG in a separate file<br \/>\n&#8211; use an SVG sprite<br \/>\n&#8211; insert it directly into my CSS styles somehow<\/p>\n<p>Each of these has pros and cons.<\/p>\n<p>SVGs in separate files are maybe fine if you&#8217;re running HTTP2 on the web server which needs HTTPS as well.<\/p>\n<p>But I don&#8217;t really want lots of separate files.<\/p>\n<p>SVG sprites (which have more than one image in a single image file and you only show the bit you need) can be done, but it&#8217;s ugly.<\/p>\n<p>So including in my CSS seems like the favoured option.<\/p>\n<p>(I&#8217;m sure this is what I normally do, but I seem to go through this process every time. This thread is partly me documenting the process for the next time I go through it. Thanks for bearing with me.)<\/p>\n<p>Aside: My office mate is reading. We have agreed that front-end development is&#8230;a word that I won&#8217;t use. Oh how simple it was when you just inserted a image.<\/p>\n<p>But all these &#8220;retina&#8221; and &#8220;3x&#8221; devices came along, which is what &#8220;vector&#8221; graphics are great for.<\/p>\n<p>Needs must!<\/p>\n<p>Right, so I&#8217;ve got the SVG code from http:\/\/sharingbuttons.io\/. All I need to do is encode it in BASE64, and stick it into my CSS &#8211; probably (as I&#8217;m using SASS) as a handy variable or mixin.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the downside of this is that I won&#8217;t be able to re-style the icon as a different colour if I need to. But I THINK I&#8217;m only using them in white on this site. Hmm.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well. Off to Dan&#8217;s Tools to encode the icons. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cleancss.com\/base64-encode\/\">https:\/\/www.cleancss.com\/base64-encode\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>So there we go. &#8220;Just&#8221; adding sharing buttons. Simple, huh?<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully that&#8217;s given some insight into the mind of a web developer.<\/p>\n<p>We have to think of future-proofing, performance, hi-res displays, privacy, accessibility, security, user experience &amp; more!<\/p>\n<p>Ta for reading!<\/p>\n<p><em>Note: this was the end of the thread, but then&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Actually, I just found a better way. In this case I CAN inline the SVG in my HTML and then use CSS to absolutely position it thus avoiding the text-hiding. I could probably avoid the text-hiding with an icon font this way too. You learn\/figure out every day on this job!<\/p>\n<p>Also, it wasn&#8217;t my intention to share this when I started, but if this has been of interest &amp; you want to know a bit more about how people like me have to think about what we&#8217;re making, I did a fun, fast-paced talk on User Experience a while back.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/XskEx1b9n9g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

But it will be fun and interesting! Come along!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about GDPR lately and considering how I will become compliant with it as I run my business and projects, so I&#8217;m looking to slim down the data that I capture about people.\u00a0 The topics of both analytics and server logs has come up several times. It&#8217;s not entirely clear to me that either fall into the category of personal data, but I&#8217;ve been considering my use of them anyway.<\/p>\n<p>I use Google Analytics on most sites\/projects that I create, but I&#8217;m not that sophisticated in my use of it. I&#8217;m mostly interested in:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>how many visitors I&#8217;m getting and when<\/li>\n<li>which pages are popular<\/li>\n<li>where people are coming from<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>and it occurred to me that I can collect this data without using cookies and without collecting anything that would personally identify someone.<\/p>\n<p>I would also be happier if my analytics were stored on a server in the EU rather than in the US &#8211; I can&#8217;t find any guarantee that my Google Analytics data is and remains EU-based.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m aware that there are self-hosted, open-source analytics solutions like <a href=\"https:\/\/matomo.org\/\">Matomo<\/a> (previously Piwik) and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openwebanalytics.com\/\">Open Web Analytics<\/a>. But they always seem very large and clunky. I&#8217;ve tried them and never got to grips with them.<\/p>\n<p>So I wondered: how hard would it be to build my own, simple, high-privacy, cookie-free analytics tool?<\/p>\n<p>Now, I know that my requirements for analytics aren&#8217;t common. Many people need conversion rates, events, goals, unique visitors, returning visitors, and so on. So a tool with these limitations wouldn&#8217;t be for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>But, as with all side projects, I feel like I could learn a lot by making something like this. It would be a step above my usual side projects, and a chance to learn more about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>handling large volumes of data and scaling for that<\/li>\n<li>how regular web analytics works (and what has to be considered when making something like this)<\/li>\n<li>Laravel and Vue or React<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So&#8230;I did start a little while ago, and have made some progress. There&#8217;s a lot of decisions to make and I&#8217;m documenting the process at <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/\">https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/<\/a>\u00a0and development is happening on <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/kownter\">GitHub<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, &#8220;Kownter&#8221; is the silly name I&#8217;ve given this project. It&#8217;s pronounced &#8220;Counter&#8221; but includes the concept of OWNing your analytics. It had a domain available so I just went with it when I thought of it. I&#8217;m not the world&#8217;s best marketer, so go easy on my branding decisions!<\/p>\n<p>Do follow along if you&#8217;re interested. Comments are welcome on the blog if you&#8217;re more experienced than I with this stuff, or if you have ideas that might help out. Or open issues on GitHub if that&#8217;s you&#8217;re thing.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fully anticipating that this may be a journey that ends with me saying &#8220;This is too hard &#8211; I&#8217;m gonna leave this to people who&#8217;ve thought through all these things already&#8221; and revert to an existing tool. But the journey seems like an interesting one to go on.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m developing this VERY slowly and it&#8217;s very early stages, but I thought the process might be useful for others to follow. It may end in nothing, but maybe the end product will actually be of use to people.<\/p>\n<p>Please don&#8217;t comment below to tell me that I&#8217;m crazy! ?<\/p>\n",

But it will be fun and interesting! Come along!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about GDPR lately and considering how I will become compliant with it as I run my business and projects, so I&#8217;m looking to slim down the data that I capture about people.\u00a0 The topics of both analytics and server logs has come up several times. It&#8217;s not entirely clear to me that either fall into the category of personal data, but I&#8217;ve been considering my use of them anyway.<\/p>\n<p>I use Google Analytics on most sites\/projects that I create, but I&#8217;m not that sophisticated in my use of it. I&#8217;m mostly interested in:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>how many visitors I&#8217;m getting and when<\/li>\n<li>which pages are popular<\/li>\n<li>where people are coming from<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>and it occurred to me that I can collect this data without using cookies and without collecting anything that would personally identify someone.<\/p>\n<p>I would also be happier if my analytics were stored on a server in the EU rather than in the US &#8211; I can&#8217;t find any guarantee that my Google Analytics data is and remains EU-based.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m aware that there are self-hosted, open-source analytics solutions like <a href=\"https:\/\/matomo.org\/\">Matomo<\/a> (previously Piwik) and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openwebanalytics.com\/\">Open Web Analytics<\/a>. But they always seem very large and clunky. I&#8217;ve tried them and never got to grips with them.<\/p>\n<p>So I wondered: how hard would it be to build my own, simple, high-privacy, cookie-free analytics tool?<\/p>\n<p>Now, I know that my requirements for analytics aren&#8217;t common. Many people need conversion rates, events, goals, unique visitors, returning visitors, and so on. So a tool with these limitations wouldn&#8217;t be for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>But, as with all side projects, I feel like I could learn a lot by making something like this. It would be a step above my usual side projects, and a chance to learn more about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>handling large volumes of data and scaling for that<\/li>\n<li>how regular web analytics works (and what has to be considered when making something like this)<\/li>\n<li>Laravel and Vue or React<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So&#8230;I did start a little while ago, and have made some progress. There&#8217;s a lot of decisions to make and I&#8217;m documenting the process at <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/\">https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/<\/a>\u00a0and development is happening on <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/kownter\">GitHub<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, &#8220;Kownter&#8221; is the silly name I&#8217;ve given this project. It&#8217;s pronounced &#8220;Counter&#8221; but includes the concept of OWNing your analytics. It had a domain available so I just went with it when I thought of it. I&#8217;m not the world&#8217;s best marketer, so go easy on my branding decisions!<\/p>\n<p>Do follow along if you&#8217;re interested. Comments are welcome on the blog if you&#8217;re more experienced than I with this stuff, or if you have ideas that might help out. Or open issues on GitHub if that&#8217;s you&#8217;re thing.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fully anticipating that this may be a journey that ends with me saying &#8220;This is too hard &#8211; I&#8217;m gonna leave this to people who&#8217;ve thought through all these things already&#8221; and revert to an existing tool. But the journey seems like an interesting one to go on.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m developing this VERY slowly and it&#8217;s very early stages, but I thought the process might be useful for others to follow. It may end in nothing, but maybe the end product will actually be of use to people.<\/p>\n<p>Please don&#8217;t comment below to tell me that I&#8217;m crazy! ?<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p><em>I&#8217;m using Test Driven Development (TDD) for the first (and second) time on a couple of side projects. I <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/01\/testing-out-tdd-initial-thoughts\/\">wrote up some of my really early thoughts<\/a> on the process before, but here are some further reflections on the process and issues I&#8217;ve come across.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Assurance is good!<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s great having my test suite able to tell me that I&#8217;ve not broken any core functionality. The flexibility that this gives me to change the structure of my code (&#8220;re-factoring&#8221; they call it) without changing what it does is great, and the confidence I have when adding new functionality is wonderful.<\/p>\n<h2>A mindset change is (possibly) coming<\/h2>\n<p>I mentioned in <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/01\/testing-out-tdd-initial-thoughts\/\">the previous TDD article<\/a> that I was thinking ahead a little as I coded and was wondering where to store those thoughts about what this thing will need to do in the future. And this is still a problem.<\/p>\n<p>But I can see a slight change of mindset happening. I can see how I might be starting to think more in terms of features and functions as I write, and less in terms of data.<\/p>\n<p>To explain, let&#8217;s take and example. I&#8217;m (stupidly) <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/about-kownter\/\">attempting to build my own analytics<\/a>. In its very basic form this has &#8220;sites&#8221; and &#8220;views&#8221; and each view belongs to a site. But in future I can see that I would want multiple users and the ability to assign sites to users.<\/p>\n<p>In the past I&#8217;d have got all hung up on making this ALL work together &#8211; define all my data structures, create my routes, and then build out all my models and controllers to make it all hang together. But with TDD I&#8217;ve taken <a href=\"https:\/\/course.testdrivenlaravel.com\/\">Adam<\/a>&#8216;s approach from his course, and got right down to the core of what this application does &#8211; sites and views &#8211; and written my tests for those things and built them up in code.<\/p>\n<p>So, right now, I have a working system with none of the complexity of users and site ownership.<\/p>\n<p>I still have the issue of not knowing where to store my thoughts about future functionality. So for example, I might have a <code class=\"code-inline\">sites_can_be_displayed<\/code> test, but in future I will need:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"code-inline\">a_user_can_see_their_own_sites<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code class=\"code-inline\">a_user_can_not_see_other_peoples_sites<\/code><\/li>\n<li>and <code class=\"code-inline\">a_guest_can_not_see_any_sites<\/code><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So what then happens to my <code class=\"code-inline\">sites_can_be_displayed<\/code> test? Will that still work? Do I still need it? Do I need to review all my existing tests when I make a change? Or will this test break somehow when I add the new functionality in, prompting me to update or remove the it? Tricky.<\/p>\n<p>I can also see that there might be overhead in building a feature at a time. If I anticipate features and build multiple features at the same time, I can get the benefit of knowing how it ALL hangs together from the start. Doing things a feature at a time might introduce inefficiencies that need to be re-factored away. Of course, having the tests helps with re-factoring, but it&#8217;s still overhead.<\/p>\n<h2>Redirects as responses<\/h2>\n<p>I realised quite early on that testing for HTTP responses in HTTP tests was good. You could test for exceptions as Jeffrey Way does on <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/lets-build-a-forum-with-laravel\/\">his Laracasts TDD course<\/a>, but I&#8217;m not quite there yet. But checking for an appropriate response has been helpful.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;you do need to understand what responses you should be getting. When building out user registration responses, for example, I forgot that Laravel redirects to somewhere immediately after registration. So my test call to:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$response = $this-&gt;post('\/register', &#x5B;\r\n'name' =&gt; 'Testy McTesterson',\r\n'email' =&gt; 'test@example.com',\r\n'password' =&gt; 'blahblah',\r\n'password_confirmation' =&gt; 'blahblah',\r\n] );\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>didn&#8217;t get a 200 response &#8211; my:<\/p>\n<p><code>$response-&gt;assertStatus(200);<\/code><\/p>\n<p>failed, it got a redirect instead! So I needed to&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><code>$response-&gt;assertRedirect('some_path');<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Note that I also got caught out by the default password length check and forgot that this also redirects me back to the register page rather than giving me an HTTP error status.<\/p>\n<p>(Aside: yes, I will use factories at some point)<\/p>\n<p>And all this registration form testing leads to&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>How much should I test?<\/h2>\n<p>One question I had as I went along is: How much should I test at this point?<\/p>\n<p>Should I be testing the default password length check? The registration process at all? Can I just assume that this works?<\/p>\n<p>I think I decided that I should test critical and\/or customised parts &#8211; so I test user registration as that could contain custom fields or parameters that could change, but not login as that&#8217;s pretty much out of the box and doesn&#8217;t really modify any data in the system.<\/p>\n<h2>from() on form requests<\/h2>\n<p>The failed registration also raised another issue. The redirect it created uses the <code class=\"code-inline\">back()<\/code> method (I assume) to send you back to the page you filled the form in on. This, in turn, makes use of the referer header. Which I wasn&#8217;t sending.<\/p>\n<p>So even when I&#8217;d written my <code class=\"code-inline\">assertRedirect()<\/code>, it was failing, because my <code class=\"code-inline\">$this-&gt;post()<\/code> request wasn&#8217;t sending a referer. So this relatively simple form-submitting test tripped me up in quite a few ways.<\/p>\n<p>The fix for this was to use the <code class=\"code-inline\">from()<\/code> method to set the referrer &#8211; so the request in this test is actually:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$response = $this-&gt;from('\/register')-&gt;post('\/register', &#x5B;\r\n  'name' =&gt; 'Testy McTesterson',\r\n  'email' =&gt; 'test@example.com',\r\n  'password' =&gt; 'blah',\r\n  'password_confirmation' =&gt; 'blahblah',\r\n] );\r\n<\/pre>\n<h2>CSRFs and middleware<\/h2>\n<p>As I was writing the form submission test I thought: &#8220;But there&#8217;s a CSRF check. How do I pass that in my request?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And, well, it turns out CSRF checks are disabled in the test suite which makes things a whole load easier.<\/p>\n<p>But should I be bothered by this? Shouldn&#8217;t I be testing that <code class=\"code-inline\">submitting_a_form_without_a_valid_csrf_token_fails<\/code>? How do I know if I&#8217;m supposed to test this or not? Where do I go to find this out?<\/p>\n<h2>Laravel release notes<\/h2>\n<p>In attempting to find out if I should test CSRF checks I found (probably via some forum threads, I don&#8217;t remember) the <code class=\"code-inline\">withoutMiddleware<\/code> trait that you could use. This, it turns out, <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.2\/testing#disabling-middleware\">is optional up to Laravel 5.2<\/a>, but it&#8217;s not &#8211; according to the docs &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.6\/testing\">in the latest version of Laravel<\/a> (5.6 at writing).<\/p>\n<p>My instinct, when I found a thing that was documented in 5.2, but not 5.6 was to look for <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.6\/releases\">release notes<\/a> for Laravel saying what has changed. But the <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.6\/releases\">latest release notes page<\/a> doesn&#8217;t show any historical release notes.<\/p>\n<p>This turns out to be stupidity on my part and you just need to use the version selector to view past release notes (e.g. <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.3\/releases\">these<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>And in any case, the release notes turned out not to mention the <code class=\"code-inline\">withoutMiddleware<\/code> change.<\/p>\n<p>I guess the release notes can&#8217;t detail every tiny little thing that&#8217;s different, and not finding the release notes was kinda my own fault, but it was just another tiny little thing that piled on top of all the other things I was confused about and got in the way of my learning. But I was expecting the documentation to answer my question and it didn&#8217;t seem to exist and when I did find it it didn&#8217;t answer my question. Grrrr.<\/p>\n<h2>On getting to MVP slower and the value of TDD<\/h2>\n<p>On the face of it, getting to MVP is harder and slower. You write a test for a feature, and then build the feature. But in doing that you realise you need to spawn other tests for the same feature. E.g. <code class=\"code-inline\">user_can_create_thing<\/code> might lead to <code class=\"code-inline\">a_new_thing_has_a_default_state_of_x<\/code> or <code class=\"code-inline\">a_guest_can_not_create_a_thing<\/code> or <code class=\"code-inline\">a_thing_must_have_a_unique_name<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Writing all these tests for the simple feature that you just built helps you refine the feature, sure. But it slows you down.<\/p>\n<p>Or does it? Is this just because I\u2019m learning? Will it speed me up later? Is this not really a good process for small side projects?<\/p>\n<p>I think what I&#8217;ve come to realise is that there is an initial outlay\/investment in getting your test suite off the ground. Those initial tests for simple stuff like creating a user are things that you will do on lots of projects. You&#8217;ll write factories for data early on and use them again and again in your future tests.<\/p>\n<p>So for a relatively small side-project this overhead represents a significant part of the work and probably doesn&#8217;t get you much payback as you won&#8217;t run the tests as much.<\/p>\n<p>But for a large project, the testing overhead is smaller and the value of the tests is much greater. So it will feel more worthwhile.<\/p>\n<h2>Where I&#8217;m at<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m enjoying using TDD, but, as I just mentioned, for the small things I&#8217;m building with it, it feels like a lot of effort.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;this is serving me well for the future. I HAVE to build these small projects using it because without them I won&#8217;t have confidence that I can use TDD on the larger projects that may come along.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not a 100% convert to either the <a href=\"https:\/\/course.testdrivenlaravel.com\/\">Wathan Way<\/a> or the <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/lets-build-a-forum-with-laravel\/\">Jeffrey Way<\/a> (the Way Way?) of TDD and I think they&#8217;d both say I should be pragmatic and thoughtful in my approach anyway rather than religiously following either of their approaches.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m being pulled up short a bit on unit testing too &#8211; this is something I need to delve into more. Currently most of my tests are feature\/HTTP tests. And unit tests feel a bit like:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$test = x;\r\n$this-&gt;assertEquals(x, $test);\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>I mean, not quite like that &#8211; it&#8217;s an extreme example. But you get the idea. And I&#8217;m sure I feel this way because I&#8217;m testing the wrong things. So still plenty to learn.<\/p>\n<p>Leave your TTD tips and tricks and wisdom for me and others below. Thanks!<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Laravel: Further forays into Test Driven Development (TDD)",
        "content": "<p><em>I&#8217;m using Test Driven Development (TDD) for the first (and second) time on a couple of side projects. I <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/01\/testing-out-tdd-initial-thoughts\/\">wrote up some of my really early thoughts<\/a> on the process before, but here are some further reflections on the process and issues I&#8217;ve come across.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Assurance is good!<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s great having my test suite able to tell me that I&#8217;ve not broken any core functionality. The flexibility that this gives me to change the structure of my code (&#8220;re-factoring&#8221; they call it) without changing what it does is great, and the confidence I have when adding new functionality is wonderful.<\/p>\n<h2>A mindset change is (possibly) coming<\/h2>\n<p>I mentioned in <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/01\/testing-out-tdd-initial-thoughts\/\">the previous TDD article<\/a> that I was thinking ahead a little as I coded and was wondering where to store those thoughts about what this thing will need to do in the future. And this is still a problem.<\/p>\n<p>But I can see a slight change of mindset happening. I can see how I might be starting to think more in terms of features and functions as I write, and less in terms of data.<\/p>\n<p>To explain, let&#8217;s take and example. I&#8217;m (stupidly) <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/about-kownter\/\">attempting to build my own analytics<\/a>. In its very basic form this has &#8220;sites&#8221; and &#8220;views&#8221; and each view belongs to a site. But in future I can see that I would want multiple users and the ability to assign sites to users.<\/p>\n<p>In the past I&#8217;d have got all hung up on making this ALL work together &#8211; define all my data structures, create my routes, and then build out all my models and controllers to make it all hang together. But with TDD I&#8217;ve taken <a href=\"https:\/\/course.testdrivenlaravel.com\/\">Adam<\/a>&#8216;s approach from his course, and got right down to the core of what this application does &#8211; sites and views &#8211; and written my tests for those things and built them up in code.<\/p>\n<p>So, right now, I have a working system with none of the complexity of users and site ownership.<\/p>\n<p>I still have the issue of not knowing where to store my thoughts about future functionality. So for example, I might have a <code class=\"code-inline\">sites_can_be_displayed<\/code> test, but in future I will need:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"code-inline\">a_user_can_see_their_own_sites<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code class=\"code-inline\">a_user_can_not_see_other_peoples_sites<\/code><\/li>\n<li>and <code class=\"code-inline\">a_guest_can_not_see_any_sites<\/code><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So what then happens to my <code class=\"code-inline\">sites_can_be_displayed<\/code> test? Will that still work? Do I still need it? Do I need to review all my existing tests when I make a change? Or will this test break somehow when I add the new functionality in, prompting me to update or remove the it? Tricky.<\/p>\n<p>I can also see that there might be overhead in building a feature at a time. If I anticipate features and build multiple features at the same time, I can get the benefit of knowing how it ALL hangs together from the start. Doing things a feature at a time might introduce inefficiencies that need to be re-factored away. Of course, having the tests helps with re-factoring, but it&#8217;s still overhead.<\/p>\n<h2>Redirects as responses<\/h2>\n<p>I realised quite early on that testing for HTTP responses in HTTP tests was good. You could test for exceptions as Jeffrey Way does on <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/lets-build-a-forum-with-laravel\/\">his Laracasts TDD course<\/a>, but I&#8217;m not quite there yet. But checking for an appropriate response has been helpful.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;you do need to understand what responses you should be getting. When building out user registration responses, for example, I forgot that Laravel redirects to somewhere immediately after registration. So my test call to:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$response = $this-&gt;post('\/register', &#x5B;\r\n'name' =&gt; 'Testy McTesterson',\r\n'email' =&gt; 'test@example.com',\r\n'password' =&gt; 'blahblah',\r\n'password_confirmation' =&gt; 'blahblah',\r\n] );\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>didn&#8217;t get a 200 response &#8211; my:<\/p>\n<p><code>$response-&gt;assertStatus(200);<\/code><\/p>\n<p>failed, it got a redirect instead! So I needed to&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><code>$response-&gt;assertRedirect('some_path');<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Note that I also got caught out by the default password length check and forgot that this also redirects me back to the register page rather than giving me an HTTP error status.<\/p>\n<p>(Aside: yes, I will use factories at some point)<\/p>\n<p>And all this registration form testing leads to&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>How much should I test?<\/h2>\n<p>One question I had as I went along is: How much should I test at this point?<\/p>\n<p>Should I be testing the default password length check? The registration process at all? Can I just assume that this works?<\/p>\n<p>I think I decided that I should test critical and\/or customised parts &#8211; so I test user registration as that could contain custom fields or parameters that could change, but not login as that&#8217;s pretty much out of the box and doesn&#8217;t really modify any data in the system.<\/p>\n<h2>from() on form requests<\/h2>\n<p>The failed registration also raised another issue. The redirect it created uses the <code class=\"code-inline\">back()<\/code> method (I assume) to send you back to the page you filled the form in on. This, in turn, makes use of the referer header. Which I wasn&#8217;t sending.<\/p>\n<p>So even when I&#8217;d written my <code class=\"code-inline\">assertRedirect()<\/code>, it was failing, because my <code class=\"code-inline\">$this-&gt;post()<\/code> request wasn&#8217;t sending a referer. So this relatively simple form-submitting test tripped me up in quite a few ways.<\/p>\n<p>The fix for this was to use the <code class=\"code-inline\">from()<\/code> method to set the referrer &#8211; so the request in this test is actually:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$response = $this-&gt;from('\/register')-&gt;post('\/register', &#x5B;\r\n  'name' =&gt; 'Testy McTesterson',\r\n  'email' =&gt; 'test@example.com',\r\n  'password' =&gt; 'blah',\r\n  'password_confirmation' =&gt; 'blahblah',\r\n] );\r\n<\/pre>\n<h2>CSRFs and middleware<\/h2>\n<p>As I was writing the form submission test I thought: &#8220;But there&#8217;s a CSRF check. How do I pass that in my request?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And, well, it turns out CSRF checks are disabled in the test suite which makes things a whole load easier.<\/p>\n<p>But should I be bothered by this? Shouldn&#8217;t I be testing that <code class=\"code-inline\">submitting_a_form_without_a_valid_csrf_token_fails<\/code>? How do I know if I&#8217;m supposed to test this or not? Where do I go to find this out?<\/p>\n<h2>Laravel release notes<\/h2>\n<p>In attempting to find out if I should test CSRF checks I found (probably via some forum threads, I don&#8217;t remember) the <code class=\"code-inline\">withoutMiddleware<\/code> trait that you could use. This, it turns out, <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.2\/testing#disabling-middleware\">is optional up to Laravel 5.2<\/a>, but it&#8217;s not &#8211; according to the docs &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.6\/testing\">in the latest version of Laravel<\/a> (5.6 at writing).<\/p>\n<p>My instinct, when I found a thing that was documented in 5.2, but not 5.6 was to look for <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.6\/releases\">release notes<\/a> for Laravel saying what has changed. But the <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.6\/releases\">latest release notes page<\/a> doesn&#8217;t show any historical release notes.<\/p>\n<p>This turns out to be stupidity on my part and you just need to use the version selector to view past release notes (e.g. <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.3\/releases\">these<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>And in any case, the release notes turned out not to mention the <code class=\"code-inline\">withoutMiddleware<\/code> change.<\/p>\n<p>I guess the release notes can&#8217;t detail every tiny little thing that&#8217;s different, and not finding the release notes was kinda my own fault, but it was just another tiny little thing that piled on top of all the other things I was confused about and got in the way of my learning. But I was expecting the documentation to answer my question and it didn&#8217;t seem to exist and when I did find it it didn&#8217;t answer my question. Grrrr.<\/p>\n<h2>On getting to MVP slower and the value of TDD<\/h2>\n<p>On the face of it, getting to MVP is harder and slower. You write a test for a feature, and then build the feature. But in doing that you realise you need to spawn other tests for the same feature. E.g. <code class=\"code-inline\">user_can_create_thing<\/code> might lead to <code class=\"code-inline\">a_new_thing_has_a_default_state_of_x<\/code> or <code class=\"code-inline\">a_guest_can_not_create_a_thing<\/code> or <code class=\"code-inline\">a_thing_must_have_a_unique_name<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Writing all these tests for the simple feature that you just built helps you refine the feature, sure. But it slows you down.<\/p>\n<p>Or does it? Is this just because I\u2019m learning? Will it speed me up later? Is this not really a good process for small side projects?<\/p>\n<p>I think what I&#8217;ve come to realise is that there is an initial outlay\/investment in getting your test suite off the ground. Those initial tests for simple stuff like creating a user are things that you will do on lots of projects. You&#8217;ll write factories for data early on and use them again and again in your future tests.<\/p>\n<p>So for a relatively small side-project this overhead represents a significant part of the work and probably doesn&#8217;t get you much payback as you won&#8217;t run the tests as much.<\/p>\n<p>But for a large project, the testing overhead is smaller and the value of the tests is much greater. So it will feel more worthwhile.<\/p>\n<h2>Where I&#8217;m at<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m enjoying using TDD, but, as I just mentioned, for the small things I&#8217;m building with it, it feels like a lot of effort.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;this is serving me well for the future. I HAVE to build these small projects using it because without them I won&#8217;t have confidence that I can use TDD on the larger projects that may come along.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not a 100% convert to either the <a href=\"https:\/\/course.testdrivenlaravel.com\/\">Wathan Way<\/a> or the <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/lets-build-a-forum-with-laravel\/\">Jeffrey Way<\/a> (the Way Way?) of TDD and I think they&#8217;d both say I should be pragmatic and thoughtful in my approach anyway rather than religiously following either of their approaches.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m being pulled up short a bit on unit testing too &#8211; this is something I need to delve into more. Currently most of my tests are feature\/HTTP tests. And unit tests feel a bit like:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$test = x;\r\n$this-&gt;assertEquals(x, $test);\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>I mean, not quite like that &#8211; it&#8217;s an extreme example. But you get the idea. And I&#8217;m sure I feel this way because I&#8217;m testing the wrong things. So still plenty to learn.<\/p>\n<p>Leave your TTD tips and tricks and wisdom for me and others below. Thanks!<\/p>\n",
