But last year my health wasn&#8217;t great.  I had a heavy, clunky, cheap bike.<\/p>\n<p>Since then I&#8217;ve acquired Fuzzy (or possibly, Fuzzy acquired me &#8211; I can never quite tell), who&#8217;s lighter, more aerodynamic, with higher gearing and great climbing capability.  I&#8217;ve been riding further and faster far more often and should generally be a lot fitter.<\/p>\n<p>I was to my slight surprise then that I managed to do the ride today just 0.4 mph faster than last time!<\/p>\n<p>And thus, I must offer my excuses, for there are senses in which this wasn&#8217;t a controlled comparison.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I had the heart rate monitor on and, though I spent nearly an hour over my defined aerobic zone, I was very aware of not pushing too hard.  Last time I would just have been going flat out to the limit of my ability.<\/li>\n<li>There was a lesser tailwind.  I remember there being a strong westerly last time.  There was a slight south-westerly breeze today.<\/li>\n<li>I went to the gym on Wednesday and played squash on Friday &#8211; it was quite frantic, and so I was probably a bit tired and low on energy.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Err..that&#8217;s probably it!  I wish I could think of more.<\/p>\n<p>Still, I did about a mile and a half more this time around, still got in under 2 hours, and averaged 18.1 for the whole 2 hours (with one 5-minute break to stretch and eat a banana).<\/p>\n<p>It was a GLORIOUS day for it, and I passed a bunch of guys on better bikes, who were cycling to Pangbourne &#8211; a little further than I was going, but my pace was significantly faster!<\/p>\n<p>I felt a little woozy afterwards, despite taking in a whole water-bottle full of Rego, and my legs were pretty tired, so I feel like I&#8217;ve pushed myself pretty hard.  I don&#8217;t really do leisurely.<\/p>\n<p>It was fun and I had a great day with my Uncle, Aunt and Cousin once I arrived and then caught the train back home.<\/p>\n<p>Must try it again sometime &#8211; only I&#8217;m quite quickly running out of summer!!!

I had a heavy, clunky, cheap bike.<\/p>\n<p>Since then I&#8217;ve acquired Fuzzy (or possibly, Fuzzy acquired me &#8211; I can never quite tell), who&#8217;s lighter, more aerodynamic, with higher gearing and great climbing capability.  I&#8217;ve been riding further and faster far more often and should generally be a lot fitter.<\/p>\n<p>I was to my slight surprise then that I managed to do the ride today just 0.4 mph faster than last time!<\/p>\n<p>And thus, I must offer my excuses, for there are senses in which this wasn&#8217;t a controlled comparison.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I had the heart rate monitor on and, though I spent nearly an hour over my defined aerobic zone, I was very aware of not pushing too hard.  Last time I would just have been going flat out to the limit of my ability.<\/li>\n<li>There was a lesser tailwind.  I remember there being a strong westerly last time.  There was a slight south-westerly breeze today.<\/li>\n<li>I went to the gym on Wednesday and played squash on Friday &#8211; it was quite frantic, and so I was probably a bit tired and low on energy.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Err..that&#8217;s probably it!  I wish I could think of more.<\/p>\n<p>Still, I did about a mile and a half more this time around, still got in under 2 hours, and averaged 18.1 for the whole 2 hours (with one 5-minute break to stretch and eat a banana).<\/p>\n<p>It was a GLORIOUS day for it, and I passed a bunch of guys on better bikes, who were cycling to Pangbourne &#8211; a little further than I was going, but my pace was significantly faster!<\/p>\n<p>I felt a little woozy afterwards, despite taking in a whole water-bottle full of Rego, and my legs were pretty tired, so I feel like I&#8217;ve pushed myself pretty hard.  I don&#8217;t really do leisurely.<\/p>\n<p>It was fun and I had a great day with my Uncle, Aunt and Cousin once I arrived and then caught the train back home.<\/p>\n<p>Must try it again sometime &#8211; only I&#8217;m quite quickly running out of summer!!!  Eeek!<\/p>\n",

You just suddenly stop and realise that you&#8217;ve been using phrases like &#8220;overpayment fund&#8221; and &#8220;fixed rate&#8221; and talking about things that will happen in 20 years time.<\/p>\n<p>Sad and scary.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Exhibit C: Holidays<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Our choice of holiday destination seems to have gone awry.  We went on holiday to Northern Ireland.  And enjoyed it.  Need I say more?<\/p>\n<p>Well I will:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We were fascinated by The Giant&#8217;s Causeway.<\/li>\n<li>We visited National Trust properties at the drop of a hat.<\/li>\n<li>We visited an RSPB outpost and spent and hour watching puffins through binoculars.<\/li>\n<li>We and had an interesting tour of an Uncle and Aunt&#8217;s garden on the way home.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Exhibit D: Food<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not a fussy eater (maybe that is a sign of getting old too?), but it&#8217;s slightly concerning that we get excited about things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New potatoes<\/li>\n<li>Sweet potatoes<\/li>\n<li>Dried cranberries<\/li>\n<li>Mixed nuts and seeds<\/li>\n<li>Granary bread<\/li>\n<li>Muesli<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>while shunning, with a righteous indignation, any mention of McDonalds, KFC and Pizza Hut.<\/p>\n<p>I still love a good curry though!!!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure there are many other things that would put Sally and I into a more &#8220;mature&#8221; demographic, not the least of which is my greying hair.  But we both fight to retain our inner youth and we have great fun flitting between youthfulness and grown-up-ness.  May that be the way for many years to come.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m therefore willing to pay large amounts of money for small, clever little gadgets, like a decent mobile phone, or an electronic organiser.  Yes, I spend hundreds on little devices that fit in the palm of my hand.<\/p>\n<p>So as a first time homeowner, and beginner gardener, I&#8217;ve been a bit overwhelmed by&#8230;well&#8230;by stuff.  By the sheer quantities of things that you can buy from places like B&amp;Q.<\/p>\n<p>For example, \u00a3200 will buy you a tiny media player with a bright colour screen and 32GB of solid-state storage.<\/p>\n<p>But it will also buy you about 1200 litres of compost.  That a LOT of compost.<\/p>\n<p>It will buy you a large pallate of bricks!<\/p>\n<p>If we go to the council recycling centre, it will buy you 200 bags of woodchips!<\/p>\n<p>It will buy you vast quantities of aggregates, cement, gravel and so on.<\/p>\n<p>It will buy many, many large pots of paint.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit baffling to someone that&#8217;s never bought anything larger than a sofa!<\/p>\n<p>And it troubles me somewhat &#8211; especially buying these things from somewhere like B&amp;Q.  I&#8217;m concerned by where these palletes of bricks and compost and aggregates come from.  How far have they travelled?  It must use an extraordinary about of lorry space carting this stuff around the country, and that can&#8217;t be good.  Can it?<\/p>\n<p>And what about all the building that&#8217;s going on?  Houses, shops, offices.  Thousands of big buildings going up all over the country.  These must consume huge amounts of resources, not just raw materials but again, fuel to move them around and energy to get them out of the ground and process them.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, in my 31st year, I&#8217;m only just starting to realise how big everything is!<\/p>\n<p>When we were at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cat.org.uk\">Centre for Alternative Energy<\/a> at the end of our holiday, we read a lot about the &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Embodied_energy\">Embodied Energy<\/a>&#8220;of buildings.  Relative to the amount of energy a building uses over its lifetime this is quite small, but I begin to see how use of local resources in building can make a major impact on sustainability.<\/p>\n<p>I, personally, will continue to be in awe at the sheer amount of &#8220;stuff&#8221; that I, as a homeowner, and we, as inhabitants of this planet, consume.  But we should all be thinking about where that \u00a33 bag of compost has come from and whether we could get it from a local source &#8211; or even make it ourselves (!!) rather than making a quick and easy trip to B&amp;Q.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m therefore willing to pay large amounts of money for small, clever little gadgets, like a decent mobile phone, or an electronic organiser.  Yes, I spend hundreds on little devices that fit in the palm of my hand.<\/p>\n<p>So as a first time homeowner, and beginner gardener, I&#8217;ve been a bit overwhelmed by&#8230;well&#8230;by stuff.  By the sheer quantities of things that you can buy from places like B&amp;Q.<\/p>\n<p>For example, \u00a3200 will buy you a tiny media player with a bright colour screen and 32GB of solid-state storage.<\/p>\n<p>But it will also buy you about 1200 litres of compost.  That a LOT of compost.<\/p>\n<p>It will buy you a large pallate of bricks!<\/p>\n<p>If we go to the council recycling centre, it will buy you 200 bags of woodchips!<\/p>\n<p>It will buy you vast quantities of aggregates, cement, gravel and so on.<\/p>\n<p>It will buy many, many large pots of paint.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit baffling to someone that&#8217;s never bought anything larger than a sofa!<\/p>\n<p>And it troubles me somewhat &#8211; especially buying these things from somewhere like B&amp;Q.  I&#8217;m concerned by where these palletes of bricks and compost and aggregates come from.  How far have they travelled?  It must use an extraordinary about of lorry space carting this stuff around the country, and that can&#8217;t be good.  Can it?<\/p>\n<p>And what about all the building that&#8217;s going on?  Houses, shops, offices.  Thousands of big buildings going up all over the country.  These must consume huge amounts of resources, not just raw materials but again, fuel to move them around and energy to get them out of the ground and process them.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, in my 31st year, I&#8217;m only just starting to realise how big everything is!<\/p>\n<p>When we were at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cat.org.uk\">Centre for Alternative Energy<\/a> at the end of our holiday, we read a lot about the &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Embodied_energy\">Embodied Energy<\/a>&#8220;of buildings.  Relative to the amount of energy a building uses over its lifetime this is quite small, but I begin to see how use of local resources in building can make a major impact on sustainability.<\/p>\n<p>I, personally, will continue to be in awe at the sheer amount of &#8220;stuff&#8221; that I, as a homeowner, and we, as inhabitants of this planet, consume.  But we should all be thinking about where that \u00a33 bag of compost has come from and whether we could get it from a local source &#8211; or even make it ourselves (!!) rather than making a quick and easy trip to B&amp;Q.<\/p>\n",

Hey, I lead an exciting life!!! \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been pretty wet lately.  And pretty unpredictably wet.  (&#8220;Welcome to England&#8221; I hear you cry&#8230;indeed!)  This has caused me some interesting problems like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do I pack my wet weather gear when it&#8217;s looking dry?<\/li>\n<li>Do I leave the office when it&#8217;s raining, or wait for it to clear up?<\/li>\n<li>Do I don my wet weather gear, if I have it, before doing my commute?<\/li>\n<li>How do I manage the problem of wet kit when I&#8217;ve been caught out and had a soaking?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Inspiring stuff&#8230;I know!  (&#8220;Yawn&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been thinking about expanding my wet weather wardrobe.  But in which direction?<\/p>\n<p>Mostly my top-half is fine.  I have a waterproof cycling jacket (but, oh for a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiggle.co.uk\/p\/Cycle\/7\/Gore_Countdown_II_Waterproof_Jacket\/5360030061\/\">Gore-Tex\u00aePaclite\u00aeShell<\/a> &#8211; anyone care to donate me \u00a3130?), and your head just gets wet, that&#8217;s fine.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is shoes, socks, shorts and overtrousers.  My overtrousers aren&#8217;t cycling-specific and send water straight down into my shoes or over-shoes.  Without them my shorts get sodden and I&#8217;d still get wet shoes.  This might not be a bad thing if I had spare shorts.  My summer gloves also get soaked and I don&#8217;t have spares.  The upshot of all this is that I&#8217;ve been getting wet, and my kit hasn&#8217;t had time to dry out.<\/p>\n<p>And decent wet-weather kit isn&#8217;t cheap.  So what do I invest in?  Do I go for spare shorts?  Or proper over trousers?  Do I get a second pair of gloves, or put up with them as they&#8217;re not too bad to wear when wet.  What about waterproof socks?  Shoes?  3\/4 length overshorts?<\/p>\n<p>Hmm&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I claim that cycling is great in lots of ways, but kitting yourself out can be an expensive chore!<\/p>\n",

Hey, I lead an exciting life!!! \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been pretty wet lately.  And pretty unpredictably wet.  (&#8220;Welcome to England&#8221; I hear you cry&#8230;indeed!)  This has caused me some interesting problems like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do I pack my wet weather gear when it&#8217;s looking dry?<\/li>\n<li>Do I leave the office when it&#8217;s raining, or wait for it to clear up?<\/li>\n<li>Do I don my wet weather gear, if I have it, before doing my commute?<\/li>\n<li>How do I manage the problem of wet kit when I&#8217;ve been caught out and had a soaking?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Inspiring stuff&#8230;I know!  (&#8220;Yawn&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been thinking about expanding my wet weather wardrobe.  But in which direction?<\/p>\n<p>Mostly my top-half is fine.  I have a waterproof cycling jacket (but, oh for a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiggle.co.uk\/p\/Cycle\/7\/Gore_Countdown_II_Waterproof_Jacket\/5360030061\/\">Gore-Tex\u00aePaclite\u00aeShell<\/a> &#8211; anyone care to donate me \u00a3130?), and your head just gets wet, that&#8217;s fine.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is shoes, socks, shorts and overtrousers.  My overtrousers aren&#8217;t cycling-specific and send water straight down into my shoes or over-shoes.  Without them my shorts get sodden and I&#8217;d still get wet shoes.  This might not be a bad thing if I had spare shorts.  My summer gloves also get soaked and I don&#8217;t have spares.  The upshot of all this is that I&#8217;ve been getting wet, and my kit hasn&#8217;t had time to dry out.<\/p>\n<p>And decent wet-weather kit isn&#8217;t cheap.  So what do I invest in?  Do I go for spare shorts?  Or proper over trousers?  Do I get a second pair of gloves, or put up with them as they&#8217;re not too bad to wear when wet.  What about waterproof socks?  Shoes?  3\/4 length overshorts?<\/p>\n<p>Hmm&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I claim that cycling is great in lots of ways, but kitting yourself out can be an expensive chore!<\/p>\n",

I bailed out of a long ride the other day due to being totally soaked through, and Sally and I went for a game of squash instead, which was pretty fun!  And just yesterday I went to the gym for the first time in a long time to do some rowing (man, I hate those machines, but it&#8217;s very good for me), cross training and resistance work (weights machines).<\/p>\n<p>My ride in this morning felt pretty good, so maybe this will be a new way to get even more of a boost!<\/p>\n<p>Though I have to say, there&#8217;s still nothing like a good, long ride on a nice day and when I am getting out for 10 miles or more it&#8217;s always with a lot of happiness!<\/p>\n",

The cycling has been going really well of late and I put in a record 254 miles in July.  I&#8217;m not injured and I&#8217;m feeling strong and fit, which is great!<\/p>\n<p>August, though, for various, non-cycling-related reasons has prompted lots of shorter rides and I&#8217;ve mostly just been doing my standard commutes.  We&#8217;re two thirds in and I&#8217;ve only done 89 miles.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve also been thinking about mixing up my exercise a bit.  I bailed out of a long ride the other day due to being totally soaked through, and Sally and I went for a game of squash instead, which was pretty fun!  And just yesterday I went to the gym for the first time in a long time to do some rowing (man, I hate those machines, but it&#8217;s very good for me), cross training and resistance work (weights machines).<\/p>\n<p>My ride in this morning felt pretty good, so maybe this will be a new way to get even more of a boost!<\/p>\n<p>Though I have to say, there&#8217;s still nothing like a good, long ride on a nice day and when I am getting out for 10 miles or more it&#8217;s always with a lot of happiness!<\/p>\n",
        "excerpt": "<p>Sorry &#8211; this is quite dull and is really just a note-to-self on fitness progress. The cycling has been going really well of late and I put in a record 254 miles in July.

                "rendered": "<p>I&#8217;ve had my HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) that I got for my cycle training for about 6 weeks now so it&#8217;s time I did a bit of a write up.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Why Bother?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>First of all, why bother with an HRM?  (If you haven&#8217;t spotted already I&#8217;m the kind of person that thinks a LOT and so my process of purchasing a new gadget is usually a long and drawn out one that involved justifying my spend and lots of research on the options before actually spending any cash)<\/p>\n<p>Well, I&#8217;ve been cycling more and more and longer distances and spending longer in the saddle.  Unfortunately for me I&#8217;m the kind of person who naturally pushes myself to my physical limit.  I need no encouragement to go faster or harder, I&#8217;m always trying to go as hard and fast as I can.  This, it turns out, is not good for you.  And you can increase aerobic capacity (fitness) by training in the right zones.<\/p>\n<p>So I wanted an HRM to encourage me to ride at a reasonable pace, so as to:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Not knacker myself out on longer rides.<\/li>\n<li>Help actually improve my fitness and endurance.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Makes sense.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A bit about Training Zones<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not expert but it goes something like this.<\/p>\n<p>Any training programme recommends spending time at different heart rate &#8220;zones&#8221;, which are percentages of your MHR (maximum heart rate).  It is generally considered that there are 5 zones called various things depending on who you ask but something like:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rest\/low activity<\/li>\n<li>Recovery<\/li>\n<li>Aerobic<\/li>\n<li>Anaerobic<\/li>\n<li>Maximum<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It turns out that I was spending most of my time in Anaerobic or maximum.  No wonder I was getting tired!<\/p>\n<p>The theory goes that spending time at Zone 3 increases aerobic capacity and endurance, Zone 4 builds strength, and zone 5 is for, well, sprinting and hill climbing.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Why the Garmin?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>There are plenty of HRMs on the market.  I chose the Garmin Forerunner 50 because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It didn&#8217;t look rubbish<\/li>\n<li>It was reasonably priced (relatively)<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s a watch so I can use it for running\/gym work as well as on the bike (I had considered a bike computer with built in HRM but dismissed this idea as lesss flexible)<\/li>\n<li>It has all the features I need.<\/li>\n<li>It has a data storage function that can wirelessly upload to Garmin software.  (I&#8217;m a bit obsessive about how fast\/far I&#8217;ve gone &#8211; now I can track my heart rate too!)<\/li>\n<li>It has the option to link to a foot pod (pedometer) and a bike sensor to expand its functionality.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Is it any good?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The HRM is fine!  Does what it says on the tin.  I&#8217;ve had a BIT of interferance from the bike computer on one ride, suggesting that it doesn&#8217;t use a coded signal (this would allow the watch to only count wireless pulses from the HRM), but it&#8217;s only been tempremental the once.  You need to make the chest sensors wet for it to work well too!<\/p>\n<p>The sensor takes a bit of getting used to but is comfortable.  I imagine that this is true of any monitor.<\/p>\n<p>The watch is a little bulky but not too un-cool.  If you have small arms it might look a bit silly.  The display is clear and large.  Turning your wrist slightly to look at the numbers while on the bike is a bit annoying.  In some ways I wish I&#8217;d got an integrated bike computer\/HRM, but I chose not to and that&#8217;s the price I pay.  It&#8217;s not too much of a problem though.<\/p>\n<p>The warning alarm that tells you if you&#8217;re outside of your (configurable) training zone is plenty loud and annoying enough.  In hindsight I&#8217;d like two different alarms, one to say I&#8217;m a little over and one to say I&#8217;m REALLY over.<\/p>\n<p>I read one review that suggested that the instructions weren&#8217;t that good and I tend to agree, I&#8217;ve found a lot out just by playing and button-pushing.<\/p>\n<p>Data storage and transfer works well and is very simple.  You can review some of the data on the watch itself but after upload to the Garmin software you can see detailed graphs (data is, I think, every 5 seconds).  The software really wants you to be using a more expensive GPS device and functionality is limited when just using the Forerunner 50.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a little annoying in that the HRM can&#8217;t take into account your circumstances.  If you&#8217;re pounding uphill, or in traffic, or trying to keep good up pace on a busy road, or fighting a headwind, you need to be pushing a bit to stay safe, or to get where you&#8217;re going and having the watch beep at you every 5 seconds doesn&#8217;t help.  Perhaps a mute button would be useful?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Has it worked?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>YES!  Well, I think so.  It&#8217;s certainly slowed me down as my MyCyclingLog.com stats show.  This is frustrating at times, like when you find your training zone only allows you to do 12mph uphill into a slight wind.  But I recover quicker and feel better after long rides and evidence would seem to show that I&#8217;m getting fitter.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s helped me &#8220;tune in&#8221; to my body a bit, know where I&#8217;m pushing too hard and where I could go harder &#8211; even without the watch now!  And as time has gone on and I&#8217;ve done more long rides at lower pace, I seem to be able to go faster for the same heart rate &#8211; evidence that my fitness is improving after only a few weeks?  I hope so!<\/p>\n<p>So, despite the few things that niggle me about it, I&#8217;ve found the experience pretty good and would recommend an HRM as a training tool for anyone doing regular lengthly exercise.  And the Forerunner 50 is a fine place to start!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Update: <\/span>Bizarrely, just today, BikeRadar published <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/fitness\/article\/technique-get-faster-by-riding-slowly-17447\">this article about training zones<\/a> and getting fitter by riding slower.  They&#8217;ve renumbered the zones slightly but it&#8217;s the same theory.  And it is only a theory &#8211; some of the commentors there disagree with that theory too!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;ve had my HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) that I got for my cycle training for about 6 weeks now so it&#8217;s time I did a bit of a write up.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Why Bother?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>First of all, why bother with an HRM?  (If you haven&#8217;t spotted already I&#8217;m the kind of person that thinks a LOT and so my process of purchasing a new gadget is usually a long and drawn out one that involved justifying my spend and lots of research on the options before actually spending any cash)<\/p>\n<p>Well, I&#8217;ve been cycling more and more and longer distances and spending longer in the saddle.  Unfortunately for me I&#8217;m the kind of person who naturally pushes myself to my physical limit.  I need no encouragement to go faster or harder, I&#8217;m always trying to go as hard and fast as I can.  This, it turns out, is not good for you.  And you can increase aerobic capacity (fitness) by training in the right zones.<\/p>\n<p>So I wanted an HRM to encourage me to ride at a reasonable pace, so as to:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Not knacker myself out on longer rides.<\/li>\n<li>Help actually improve my fitness and endurance.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Makes sense.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A bit about Training Zones<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not expert but it goes something like this.<\/p>\n<p>Any training programme recommends spending time at different heart rate &#8220;zones&#8221;, which are percentages of your MHR (maximum heart rate).  It is generally considered that there are 5 zones called various things depending on who you ask but something like:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rest\/low activity<\/li>\n<li>Recovery<\/li>\n<li>Aerobic<\/li>\n<li>Anaerobic<\/li>\n<li>Maximum<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It turns out that I was spending most of my time in Anaerobic or maximum.  No wonder I was getting tired!<\/p>\n<p>The theory goes that spending time at Zone 3 increases aerobic capacity and endurance, Zone 4 builds strength, and zone 5 is for, well, sprinting and hill climbing.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Why the Garmin?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>There are plenty of HRMs on the market.  I chose the Garmin Forerunner 50 because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It didn&#8217;t look rubbish<\/li>\n<li>It was reasonably priced (relatively)<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s a watch so I can use it for running\/gym work as well as on the bike (I had considered a bike computer with built in HRM but dismissed this idea as lesss flexible)<\/li>\n<li>It has all the features I need.<\/li>\n<li>It has a data storage function that can wirelessly upload to Garmin software.  (I&#8217;m a bit obsessive about how fast\/far I&#8217;ve gone &#8211; now I can track my heart rate too!)<\/li>\n<li>It has the option to link to a foot pod (pedometer) and a bike sensor to expand its functionality.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Is it any good?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The HRM is fine!  Does what it says on the tin.  I&#8217;ve had a BIT of interferance from the bike computer on one ride, suggesting that it doesn&#8217;t use a coded signal (this would allow the watch to only count wireless pulses from the HRM), but it&#8217;s only been tempremental the once.  You need to make the chest sensors wet for it to work well too!<\/p>\n<p>The sensor takes a bit of getting used to but is comfortable.  I imagine that this is true of any monitor.<\/p>\n<p>The watch is a little bulky but not too un-cool.  If you have small arms it might look a bit silly.  The display is clear and large.  Turning your wrist slightly to look at the numbers while on the bike is a bit annoying.  In some ways I wish I&#8217;d got an integrated bike computer\/HRM, but I chose not to and that&#8217;s the price I pay.  It&#8217;s not too much of a problem though.<\/p>\n<p>The warning alarm that tells you if you&#8217;re outside of your (configurable) training zone is plenty loud and annoying enough.  In hindsight I&#8217;d like two different alarms, one to say I&#8217;m a little over and one to say I&#8217;m REALLY over.<\/p>\n<p>I read one review that suggested that the instructions weren&#8217;t that good and I tend to agree, I&#8217;ve found a lot out just by playing and button-pushing.<\/p>\n<p>Data storage and transfer works well and is very simple.  You can review some of the data on the watch itself but after upload to the Garmin software you can see detailed graphs (data is, I think, every 5 seconds).  The software really wants you to be using a more expensive GPS device and functionality is limited when just using the Forerunner 50.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a little annoying in that the HRM can&#8217;t take into account your circumstances.  If you&#8217;re pounding uphill, or in traffic, or trying to keep good up pace on a busy road, or fighting a headwind, you need to be pushing a bit to stay safe, or to get where you&#8217;re going and having the watch beep at you every 5 seconds doesn&#8217;t help.  Perhaps a mute button would be useful?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Has it worked?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>YES!  Well, I think so.  It&#8217;s certainly slowed me down as my MyCyclingLog.com stats show.  This is frustrating at times, like when you find your training zone only allows you to do 12mph uphill into a slight wind.  But I recover quicker and feel better after long rides and evidence would seem to show that I&#8217;m getting fitter.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s helped me &#8220;tune in&#8221; to my body a bit, know where I&#8217;m pushing too hard and where I could go harder &#8211; even without the watch now!  And as time has gone on and I&#8217;ve done more long rides at lower pace, I seem to be able to go faster for the same heart rate &#8211; evidence that my fitness is improving after only a few weeks?  I hope so!<\/p>\n<p>So, despite the few things that niggle me about it, I&#8217;ve found the experience pretty good and would recommend an HRM as a training tool for anyone doing regular lengthly exercise.  And the Forerunner 50 is a fine place to start!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Update: <\/span>Bizarrely, just today, BikeRadar published <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/fitness\/article\/technique-get-faster-by-riding-slowly-17447\">this article about training zones<\/a> and getting fitter by riding slower.  They&#8217;ve renumbered the zones slightly but it&#8217;s the same theory.  And it is only a theory &#8211; some of the commentors there disagree with that theory too!<\/p>\n",

One of the boons of this has been watching the inspiring little comments of an old Bathonian friend of mine.<\/p>\n<p>My friend (I won&#8217;t name him unless he reads this and decides he would like me to) is&#8230;well&#8230;I don&#8217;t really know what he does now.  I think he used to work for the Institute of Physics or something, as a web designer, and he seems to have continued in a similar line of work.  And now, in the absence of anyone else, he&#8217;s my personal guru for all things web design, Web 2.0, blogs, social networking and so on.  I guess he inspires my inner-geek.<\/p>\n<p>And I do have a part of me that thrives on this stuff.  I love the interesting ways that people make innovative use of technology to achieve useful, and sometimes beautiful things.  Here are some other little web-based things that I&#8217;ve come across since following this person:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/last.fm\">last.fm<\/a> &#8211; great way to discover new music<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mycyclinglog.com\">mycyclinglog.com<\/a> &#8211; my current bike logger<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/identi.ca\">identi.ca<\/a> &#8211; open alternative to Twitter<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/ping.fm\">ping.fm<\/a> &#8211; update multiple statuses\/micro-blogs from one place<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opera.com\">Opera<\/a> &#8211; a rediscovery of the old alternative web-browser<\/p>\n<p>But not just those practical things.  My curiosity about the way people are using the web to communicate and interact has been roused.  I&#8217;m intrigued how people are creating web sites that are simple, functional and well-designed.  Things not only of purpose but of beauty.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m feeling behind and afraid though.  I barely know Java and have heard only rumours of Ajax, let alone other &#8220;next big things&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve been toying with client-side scripting, servlets, application frameworks, but not digging deep.  I have an excellent grounding in Computer Science and an inquisitive mind, but there&#8217;s so much to learn and I don&#8217;t have time enough to invest to satisfy my curiosity, let alone learn anything of much use.  And where would I start?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m afraid because of security, the nature of my online identity. I&#8217;m generally very open, as readers of this blog would know, but there&#8217;s stuff that I don&#8217;t want out there on the internet (mostly about other people and work, but sometimes about me).  Can I throw myself into the online world of sharing so much with so many in safety?  Do I want <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brightkite.com\">BrightKite.com<\/a> telling everyone where I am all the time?<\/p>\n<p>And there&#8217;s the issue of time.  My feed list in <a href=\"http:\/\/reader.google.com\">Google Reader<\/a> continues to grow and reading, as well as writing, is a chore.  Could I read the Twitter entries of more than about 20 people and have a real life too?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also uncertain about who to take on the journey with me.  In many ways I&#8217;m a long way ahead of my peers and I&#8217;d love to be able to introduce others to my personal world of customised web sites, RSS and Atom feeds, alternative browsers and web presence because I think these things are useful tools.  But would they get it?  How confusing is it to a non techie?  There are so many places to be with new networks and tools appearing all the time. If I can barely keep up, how will they?<\/p>\n<p>I think the web is an exciting, fun, and hugely creative place to be at the moment.  Yet it&#8217;s a big place.  A scary place.  A confusing place.  An ever-changing and unknown place.<\/p>\n<p>My online interaction with the friend I mentioned above is a fine example of how the web can bring together people with a common cause or interest.  It can be a very negative place, but it can be inspiring and friendly too.  With my friend&#8217;s help I hope to continue to be a part of this strange world, and to introduce others to it, and maybe, one day, to be responsible for a small part of it.<\/p>\n",

I love the interesting ways that people make innovative use of technology to achieve useful, and sometimes beautiful things.  Here are some other little web-based things that I&#8217;ve come across since following this person:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/last.fm\">last.fm<\/a> &#8211; great way to discover new music<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mycyclinglog.com\">mycyclinglog.com<\/a> &#8211; my current bike logger<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/identi.ca\">identi.ca<\/a> &#8211; open alternative to Twitter<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/ping.fm\">ping.fm<\/a> &#8211; update multiple statuses\/micro-blogs from one place<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opera.com\">Opera<\/a> &#8211; a rediscovery of the old alternative web-browser<\/p>\n<p>But not just those practical things.  My curiosity about the way people are using the web to communicate and interact has been roused.  I&#8217;m intrigued how people are creating web sites that are simple, functional and well-designed.  Things not only of purpose but of beauty.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m feeling behind and afraid though.  I barely know Java and have heard only rumours of Ajax, let alone other &#8220;next big things&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve been toying with client-side scripting, servlets, application frameworks, but not digging deep.  I have an excellent grounding in Computer Science and an inquisitive mind, but there&#8217;s so much to learn and I don&#8217;t have time enough to invest to satisfy my curiosity, let alone learn anything of much use.  And where would I start?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m afraid because of security, the nature of my online identity. I&#8217;m generally very open, as readers of this blog would know, but there&#8217;s stuff that I don&#8217;t want out there on the internet (mostly about other people and work, but sometimes about me).  Can I throw myself into the online world of sharing so much with so many in safety?  Do I want <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brightkite.com\">BrightKite.com<\/a> telling everyone where I am all the time?<\/p>\n<p>And there&#8217;s the issue of time.  My feed list in <a href=\"http:\/\/reader.google.com\">Google Reader<\/a> continues to grow and reading, as well as writing, is a chore.  Could I read the Twitter entries of more than about 20 people and have a real life too?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also uncertain about who to take on the journey with me.  In many ways I&#8217;m a long way ahead of my peers and I&#8217;d love to be able to introduce others to my personal world of customised web sites, RSS and Atom feeds, alternative browsers and web presence because I think these things are useful tools.  But would they get it?  How confusing is it to a non techie?  There are so many places to be with new networks and tools appearing all the time. If I can barely keep up, how will they?<\/p>\n<p>I think the web is an exciting, fun, and hugely creative place to be at the moment.  Yet it&#8217;s a big place.  A scary place.  A confusing place.  An ever-changing and unknown place.<\/p>\n<p>My online interaction with the friend I mentioned above is a fine example of how the web can bring together people with a common cause or interest.  It can be a very negative place, but it can be inspiring and friendly too.  With my friend&#8217;s help I hope to continue to be a part of this strange world, and to introduce others to it, and maybe, one day, to be responsible for a small part of it.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ve spent some time tonight on a post which I hope he doesn&#8217;t mind me cross-posting here.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8211;<\/p>\n<p>You may, like me, have noticed the latest big thing on the Internet\u2026a new search engine set up by some ex-Google employees at www.cuil.com (pronounced Cuil).<\/p>\n<p>We have conducted an extensive review of Cuil\u2019s search functionality (OK, we did a few searches, almost at random) and hereby bring you the definitive, Christian-themed review of this new tool.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve run a number of test searches, analysed the results and graded them out of 5.  We\u2019ve also stated the \u201csuggested searches\u201d that Cuil came up with as we typed, and what we actually thought we might get.<\/p>\n<p>We didn\u2019t have time (and we\u2019re not THAT sad) to do a complete comparison of Google, Yahoo, MSN and others, so we\u2019ve simply compared the results to those given with Google &#8211; it seems appropriate given the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 1 &#8211; \u201cWhat would Jesus Do?\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well\u2026what would he?  (For those that don&#8217;t know this was a cheesy Christian slogan used to remind people to ask the question themselves when making decisions &#8211; it was probably a good idea until someone got into printing it on merchandise galore &#8211; keyrings, wrist bands, etc).<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What would jesus buy<\/li>\n<li>What would jesus drive<\/li>\n<li>What would jesus eat<\/li>\n<li>what would jesus do<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: WWJD merchandise, or possibly a site actually stating some things that Jesus did.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: What would Jesus Buy (www.wwjbmovie.com)<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lots of references to the film above<\/li>\n<li>Christian weight loss: What would Jesus Eat?<\/li>\n<li>What would Jesus shave with?<\/li>\n<li>The Church of Stop Shopping (presumably related to the movie?)<\/li>\n<li>www.wwjd.com (we didn\u2019t follow the link and have no idea what it is)<\/li>\n<li>Listed Categories (to narrow your search): \u201cWorld Championship Wrestling Alumni\u201d and \u201cAmerican Professional Wrestlers\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What Would Jesus Do on Wikipedia<\/li>\n<li>WWJD merchandise at www.whatwouldjesusdo.com<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Result: Wrestling??? Seriously, we\u2019re NOT making this up!!!  Google wins by a clear mile.  Cuil gets 1 out of 5 for entertainment value only.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 2: \u201cThe Bible\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Can Cuil find me a Good Book?<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Bible (yay!  First hit!)<\/li>\n<li>History of the Bible<\/li>\n<li>How to Read the Bible<\/li>\n<li>The Bible Code<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Links to online bibles, or possibly reference articles explaining what the Bible is.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result:Track and Field News: The Bible of the Sport since 1948<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigating the Bible II<\/li>\n<li>bible.crosswalk.com (an actual Bible!)<\/li>\n<li>The Bible Society<\/li>\n<li>A few other random bible-related things, none of which seem very important<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says: www.biblegateway.com &#8211; everyone\u2019s favourite online bible!<\/p>\n<p>Result: Cuil gets closer but is again blown away by Google.  2 out of 5 for effort!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 3: Lalbagh Indian Cuisine<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u2026because even the faithful like a good curry now and then!<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lalbagh Fort<\/li>\n<li>Lalbagh Road<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Web page of my favourite local Indian takeaway, local directory entries and some reviews.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: Correct listing on donowdo.com (What\u2019s that then?)<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local newspaper reviews<\/li>\n<li>Other fairly random listings<\/li>\n<li>Category: Kings of Mysore<\/li>\n<li>Wikipedia article on Culture of Bangalore<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says: The Lalbagh Website, Yell and Thompson directory entries, and reviews of the intended, and other restaurants called \u201cLalbagh\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Result: Again, I got the information I needed, but a link to the restaurant\u2019s own web site didn\u2019t make the front page.  2 out of 5 again.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 4: \u201cCuil\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Can it find itself? And will Google list their new competitor?<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>None &#8211; though by this point I wasn\u2019t getting any suggested searches at all &#8211; perhaps the system was overloaded?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Cuil home page, lots of news articles from today about the launch.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: Properties for sale in Cuil Mhuine, Ireland on Properazzi.com<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>References to what appears to be a music album or a band called \u201cChase around the Windmill\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Books, and area guides relating to several places whose name includes the word \u201cCuil\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Categories: Towns and Villages in Sligo, French Cuisine, Local Breads, Lochaber, and Glens of Scotland.<\/li>\n<li>I also noticed that Cuil returned 121,578 results, compared to Google\u2019s \u201cabout 718,000? &#8211; I\u2019m open to the possibility that less is more in this case.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says: News results for Cuil from Information Week and 819 related articles. Cuil Homepage.<\/p>\n<p>Result: What?  They\u2019re not their own top search result?  Zero!!!!<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Test 5: \u201cHelp\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Maybe Cuil is a new breed of search engine and I\u2019m expecting the wrong sort of results.  Perhaps there\u2019s a help page?<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Still no suggested results at all.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Cuil help page.  Err\u2026not sure what else.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: This is really REALLY true.  I got a page back that said: \u201cNo results because of high load\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nothing<\/li>\n<li>Zip<\/li>\n<li>Zilch<\/li>\n<li>Not a sausage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>www.help.com &#8211; seems reasonable<\/li>\n<li>BBC Help (www.bbc.co.uk\/help)<\/li>\n<li>Ingenta Connect Help (???)<\/li>\n<li>Google Help (which is, of course, the equivalent of what we wanted)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Result: Another zero I\u2019m afraid.  An overloaded service is no service at all!<\/p>\n<p><strong>In conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve done our best to show you how this new search engine performs.  We\u2019ll leave you to make up your own mind from our results.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree they\u2019re a great help!<\/p>\n<p>We give Cuil a grand total of 4 out of a possible 25 points!<\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t think Google need worry too much.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Tuesday Update:<\/p>\n<p>The service is back up.  Searching for &#8220;help&#8221; didn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>Oddly, though searching for &#8220;Cuil&#8221; on Cuil.com gave random results, searching for &#8220;Google&#8221; on Cuil.com gave lots of links to Google&#8217;s sites.

I&#8217;ve spent some time tonight on a post which I hope he doesn&#8217;t mind me cross-posting here.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8211;<\/p>\n<p>You may, like me, have noticed the latest big thing on the Internet\u2026a new search engine set up by some ex-Google employees at www.cuil.com (pronounced Cuil).<\/p>\n<p>We have conducted an extensive review of Cuil\u2019s search functionality (OK, we did a few searches, almost at random) and hereby bring you the definitive, Christian-themed review of this new tool.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve run a number of test searches, analysed the results and graded them out of 5.  We\u2019ve also stated the \u201csuggested searches\u201d that Cuil came up with as we typed, and what we actually thought we might get.<\/p>\n<p>We didn\u2019t have time (and we\u2019re not THAT sad) to do a complete comparison of Google, Yahoo, MSN and others, so we\u2019ve simply compared the results to those given with Google &#8211; it seems appropriate given the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 1 &#8211; \u201cWhat would Jesus Do?\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well\u2026what would he?  (For those that don&#8217;t know this was a cheesy Christian slogan used to remind people to ask the question themselves when making decisions &#8211; it was probably a good idea until someone got into printing it on merchandise galore &#8211; keyrings, wrist bands, etc).<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What would jesus buy<\/li>\n<li>What would jesus drive<\/li>\n<li>What would jesus eat<\/li>\n<li>what would jesus do<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: WWJD merchandise, or possibly a site actually stating some things that Jesus did.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: What would Jesus Buy (www.wwjbmovie.com)<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lots of references to the film above<\/li>\n<li>Christian weight loss: What would Jesus Eat?<\/li>\n<li>What would Jesus shave with?<\/li>\n<li>The Church of Stop Shopping (presumably related to the movie?)<\/li>\n<li>www.wwjd.com (we didn\u2019t follow the link and have no idea what it is)<\/li>\n<li>Listed Categories (to narrow your search): \u201cWorld Championship Wrestling Alumni\u201d and \u201cAmerican Professional Wrestlers\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What Would Jesus Do on Wikipedia<\/li>\n<li>WWJD merchandise at www.whatwouldjesusdo.com<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Result: Wrestling??? Seriously, we\u2019re NOT making this up!!!  Google wins by a clear mile.  Cuil gets 1 out of 5 for entertainment value only.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 2: \u201cThe Bible\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Can Cuil find me a Good Book?<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Bible (yay!  First hit!)<\/li>\n<li>History of the Bible<\/li>\n<li>How to Read the Bible<\/li>\n<li>The Bible Code<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Links to online bibles, or possibly reference articles explaining what the Bible is.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result:Track and Field News: The Bible of the Sport since 1948<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigating the Bible II<\/li>\n<li>bible.crosswalk.com (an actual Bible!)<\/li>\n<li>The Bible Society<\/li>\n<li>A few other random bible-related things, none of which seem very important<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says: www.biblegateway.com &#8211; everyone\u2019s favourite online bible!<\/p>\n<p>Result: Cuil gets closer but is again blown away by Google.  2 out of 5 for effort!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 3: Lalbagh Indian Cuisine<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u2026because even the faithful like a good curry now and then!<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lalbagh Fort<\/li>\n<li>Lalbagh Road<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Web page of my favourite local Indian takeaway, local directory entries and some reviews.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: Correct listing on donowdo.com (What\u2019s that then?)<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local newspaper reviews<\/li>\n<li>Other fairly random listings<\/li>\n<li>Category: Kings of Mysore<\/li>\n<li>Wikipedia article on Culture of Bangalore<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says: The Lalbagh Website, Yell and Thompson directory entries, and reviews of the intended, and other restaurants called \u201cLalbagh\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Result: Again, I got the information I needed, but a link to the restaurant\u2019s own web site didn\u2019t make the front page.  2 out of 5 again.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 4: \u201cCuil\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Can it find itself? And will Google list their new competitor?<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>None &#8211; though by this point I wasn\u2019t getting any suggested searches at all &#8211; perhaps the system was overloaded?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Cuil home page, lots of news articles from today about the launch.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: Properties for sale in Cuil Mhuine, Ireland on Properazzi.com<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>References to what appears to be a music album or a band called \u201cChase around the Windmill\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Books, and area guides relating to several places whose name includes the word \u201cCuil\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Categories: Towns and Villages in Sligo, French Cuisine, Local Breads, Lochaber, and Glens of Scotland.<\/li>\n<li>I also noticed that Cuil returned 121,578 results, compared to Google\u2019s \u201cabout 718,000? &#8211; I\u2019m open to the possibility that less is more in this case.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says: News results for Cuil from Information Week and 819 related articles. Cuil Homepage.<\/p>\n<p>Result: What?  They\u2019re not their own top search result?  Zero!!!!<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Test 5: \u201cHelp\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Maybe Cuil is a new breed of search engine and I\u2019m expecting the wrong sort of results.  Perhaps there\u2019s a help page?<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Still no suggested results at all.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Cuil help page.  Err\u2026not sure what else.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: This is really REALLY true.  I got a page back that said: \u201cNo results because of high load\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nothing<\/li>\n<li>Zip<\/li>\n<li>Zilch<\/li>\n<li>Not a sausage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>www.help.com &#8211; seems reasonable<\/li>\n<li>BBC Help (www.bbc.co.uk\/help)<\/li>\n<li>Ingenta Connect Help (???)<\/li>\n<li>Google Help (which is, of course, the equivalent of what we wanted)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Result: Another zero I\u2019m afraid.  An overloaded service is no service at all!<\/p>\n<p><strong>In conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve done our best to show you how this new search engine performs.  We\u2019ll leave you to make up your own mind from our results.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree they\u2019re a great help!<\/p>\n<p>We give Cuil a grand total of 4 out of a possible 25 points!<\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t think Google need worry too much.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Tuesday Update:<\/p>\n<p>The service is back up.  Searching for &#8220;help&#8221; didn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>Oddly, though searching for &#8220;Cuil&#8221; on Cuil.com gave random results, searching for &#8220;Google&#8221; on Cuil.com gave lots of links to Google&#8217;s sites.
