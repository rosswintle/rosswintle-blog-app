Can you ride normally and comfortably, or you should accelerate or brake in order to prevent or counter a dangerous manoeuvre?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Among other hazards, the book also talks a lot about how it&#8217;s dangerous being ON a roundabout and how drivers coming onto the roundabout as you cycle past the other approaches may not see you on a bike:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The biggest danger to cyclists is on the circulating road as you pass an intermediate entry&#8230;Frequently drivers fail to cede your right of way at these places, sometimes because they haven&#8217;t noticed you.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been paying attention while driving up to and on roundabouts in the last few days, thinking about whether or not I would see a cyclist and how I would respond.<\/p>\n<p>Living in, and learning to drive in Swindon, I consider myself to be a bit of a roundabout expert.\u00a0 Franklin says &#8220;In fact, many motorists themselves fear roundabouts&#8221;&#8230;whereas I take great glee in negotiating the many circular islands of Swindon.\u00a0 So I often approach roundabouts at speed, using my experience to anticipate the movements of those on the roundabout to get onto and across it as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>But reading Cyclecraft has made me aware of the inherent danger of this type of manoeuvre, especially to cyclists!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s fascinating, and it strikes me that it&#8217;s probably more important that drivers understand some of what&#8217;s in Cyclecraft, than it is that cyclists understand it.<\/p>\n<p>I wonder how much bike-awareness is in modern-day driving lessons and tests, and how much there should be.\u00a0 Anyone learn to drive recently and care to comment?<\/p>\n<p>Finally, of course, I love Swindon&#8217;s &#8220;Magic&#8221; Roundabout.\u00a0 But what does Cyclecraft say about it?\u00a0 Simply this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Another, rarer, type of multiple roundabout is where there is a ring of mini-roundabouts around a large roundabout which can be travelled in either direction.\u00a0 These, too, need to be treated with caution.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Mr Franklin, the cyclists of Swindon appreciate your non&#8211;specific reference to their holy grail of gyratory systems&#8230;and <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">all<\/span> your wise experience and advice.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>After finally posting &#8220;<a title=\"Post: Crossings\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/10\/01\/crossings\/\" target=\"_self\">Crossings<\/a>&#8221; the other day, and after having more roundabout difficulty this week, I went back to the brilliant book &#8220;<a title=\"CycleCraft\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclecraft.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclecraft<\/a>&#8221; (recommended reading for anyone who ever cycles on a road) to see what it said about roundabouts.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><em>[At this point I should say that I&#8217;ve tried to contact both Mr Franklin and his publishers, The Stationary Office, for permission to quote the book, but the online form didn&#8217;t work and the email bounced respectivel.\u00a0 So, somewhat tentatively, I&#8217;m going to go ahead and just do it.\u00a0 Mr Franklin, TSO, WordPress.com, if there&#8217;s a problem with this then please contact me and I&#8217;ll happily remove the content.\u00a0 I&#8217;m hoping that my recommendation to buy this excellent book will cause you to look upon my plagiarism favourably.\u00a0 Thanks\/apologies.]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The book (mine is a less-up-to-date versions) explains the problem of dangerous approaches to roundabouts.\u00a0 This from the section on &#8220;single-lane roundabouts&#8221;, where I experience less difficulty:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The greatest danger is that some drivers race a cyclist to the roundabout, cutting sharply across the cyclists path in order to enter.\u00a0 Drivers often do not realise how great a cyclists speed can be [I love that bit&#8230;&#8221;how great&#8221;!- MR], and as a result there is often insufficient space to complete the overtaking manoeuvre safely, and the cyclist is put at risk&#8230;if there is an [entry] island and a driver still overtakes, it can act as a further hazard by creating a squeeze point.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Franklin agrees with the dilemma expressed in my previous post, but has a much better way and less aggressive way of putting it:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The difficulty for a cyclist lies in knowing the intentions of a driver behind. Can you ride normally and comfortably, or you should accelerate or brake in order to prevent or counter a dangerous manoeuvre?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Among other hazards, the book also talks a lot about how it&#8217;s dangerous being ON a roundabout and how drivers coming onto the roundabout as you cycle past the other approaches may not see you on a bike:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The biggest danger to cyclists is on the circulating road as you pass an intermediate entry&#8230;Frequently drivers fail to cede your right of way at these places, sometimes because they haven&#8217;t noticed you.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been paying attention while driving up to and on roundabouts in the last few days, thinking about whether or not I would see a cyclist and how I would respond.<\/p>\n<p>Living in, and learning to drive in Swindon, I consider myself to be a bit of a roundabout expert.\u00a0 Franklin says &#8220;In fact, many motorists themselves fear roundabouts&#8221;&#8230;whereas I take great glee in negotiating the many circular islands of Swindon.\u00a0 So I often approach roundabouts at speed, using my experience to anticipate the movements of those on the roundabout to get onto and across it as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>But reading Cyclecraft has made me aware of the inherent danger of this type of manoeuvre, especially to cyclists!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s fascinating, and it strikes me that it&#8217;s probably more important that drivers understand some of what&#8217;s in Cyclecraft, than it is that cyclists understand it.<\/p>\n<p>I wonder how much bike-awareness is in modern-day driving lessons and tests, and how much there should be.\u00a0 Anyone learn to drive recently and care to comment?<\/p>\n<p>Finally, of course, I love Swindon&#8217;s &#8220;Magic&#8221; Roundabout.\u00a0 But what does Cyclecraft say about it?\u00a0 Simply this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Another, rarer, type of multiple roundabout is where there is a ring of mini-roundabouts around a large roundabout which can be travelled in either direction.\u00a0 These, too, need to be treated with caution.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Mr Franklin, the cyclists of Swindon appreciate your non&#8211;specific reference to their holy grail of gyratory systems&#8230;and <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">all<\/span> your wise experience and advice.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<h3>What this is really all about<\/h3>\n<p>Ok, I confess.  This post started as a note to self about various things that I want to record for my own future reference.  I&#8217;ve tried to flesh it out into something that may be of interest to others.<\/p>\n<h3>A geek&#8217;s dilemma<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s probably quite clear that I&#8217;m a bit of a geek.  In fact I&#8217;ve already proudly annouced this fact at least twice here.  And one of the things about being a geek (of the computer kind) is that you discover lots of useful software tools for doing computery-type things.<\/p>\n<p>Some of these things aren&#8217;t useful for the everyday person.  I wouldn&#8217;t expect my average reader to care about <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/01\/10\/tools-of-the-trade\/\">subversion, vi or X<\/a> because you don&#8217;t do the sorts of tasks that those tools are designed to help with.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the tools are useful to non-geeks, but require some investment in learning about new technologies or concepts.\u00a0 Perhaps something like an RSS Feed Reader would come into this category.\u00a0 Some people jump at the idea of using a new tool to do something useful.\u00a0 Others take an &#8220;it ain&#8217;t broken so don&#8217;t fix it&#8221; approach.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the tools are not obviously useful in that they don&#8217;t let you do anything new or different &#8211; but they are &#8220;important&#8221;.\u00a0 Things like virus checkers, firewalls, and other security tools fit this category.<\/p>\n<p>And some of the tools are quick, simple little things, or incredibly useful things and you&#8217;ll wonder why you don&#8217;t know about them already (or perhaps you already do).<\/p>\n<p>This post is a little list of things that I&#8217;ve found useful as a computer user, making his way around the internet and sharing things with his friends as he does so.<\/p>\n<p>Not all of them fit into the last category, but I offer them for, as I said, both my own future reference and for the information of any readers.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Avast and AVG<\/h3>\n<p>Most virus software comes with updated for a year and I used to have a policy of buying new virus software within the last 3 months (when it started nagging me that the updates were running out). \u00a0There was almost always something for sale in WHSmith for half price.<\/p>\n<p>But most of the major anti-virus vendors sell huge packages full of software, most of which you don&#8217;t need, and some of which has, in my experience, broken other bits of software.<\/p>\n<p>So I started looking for something that was more light-weight &#8211; JUST a virus scanner.<\/p>\n<p>And it turns out there are some free ones around. \u00a0I&#8217;ve given both <a title=\"AVG Free\" href=\"http:\/\/free.avg.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">AVG Free<\/a> and <a title=\"Avast Home Edition Anti-Virus\" href=\"http:\/\/www.avast.com\/eng\/download-avast-home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Avast<\/a> a go and have had no problems with either. \u00a0Why pay?<\/p>\n<h3>Internet Link Tools<\/h3>\n<p>As you float around the Internet and surf the vast oceans of information that are out there, occasionally you come across things that you want to remember for later, or to send on to others.<\/p>\n<p>There are many ways of doing these things, but two that I use a lot are bit.ly and Delicious.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bit.ly<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Bit.ly\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/bit.ly<\/a> is a URL shortener. \u00a0This takes a long internet link like, say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><a title=\"BBC News: Barack Obama Wins Nobel Peace Prize\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/americas\/8299824.stm\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/americas\/8299824.stm<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a title=\"BBC News: Barack Obama Wins Nobel Peace Prize\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/americas\/8299824.stm\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a>and shortens it to something like<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><a title=\"BBC News: Barack Wins Nobel Peace Prize, via bit.ly\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2t8Oua\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/2t8Oua<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Why is this useful? \u00a0Well, mostly if you want to share a link when you&#8217;re constrained by the length of your message &#8211; like with Twitter where you can only use 140 characters. \u00a0But you could send links like this in SMS or emails.<\/p>\n<p>To make life quick and easy there are &#8220;bookmarklets&#8221; and plug-ins that let you get one-click buttons for shortening links.<\/p>\n<p>There are LOADS of link shortening services but bit.ly offers plenty more. \u00a0If it&#8217;s not taken already you can use your own reference for the link. It wouldn&#8217;t let me shorten this link to news about Obama&#8217;s Nobel prize to ObNob, but it would let me use <a title=\"BBC News: Obama Wins Nobel Prize\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/0bNob\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/0bNob<\/a><\/p>\n<p>And it tracks stats too&#8230;so if you&#8217;re running a marketing campaign and don&#8217;t have tools that will let you track who&#8217;s clicked on links that you&#8217;ve sent, bit.ly will tell you how many times the shortened link is clicked.<\/p>\n<p>A quick warning &#8211; when you shortened link you don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s going. It could go somewhere bad! \u00a0You can check the destination of a bit.ly link by adding a &#8220;+&#8221; to the end; e.g. <a title=\"Link Info\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/0bNob+\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/0bNob+<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Delicious<\/h3>\n<p>Do you ever, while browsing the internet, come across something &#8211; \u00a0say, a news article or a knitting pattern, or a nice bike &#8211; that you want to remember and recall, but you don&#8217;t want to clog up your browser bookmarks?<\/p>\n<p>I use a tool called Delicious for this. \u00a0It&#8217;s a &#8220;social bookmarking&#8221; tool&#8230;don&#8217;t get scared&#8230;it allows you to set up a user account and install a bookmarklet (a little button) or a browser plug in that lets you save stuff like this for later use.<\/p>\n<p>You can &#8220;tag&#8221; links to help you remember them. \u00a0So you could tag my Obama getting his Nobel Prize artical with the terms &#8220;obama, nobel, prize, news&#8221; and then use those tags to recall the article later.<\/p>\n<p>Then, when you think &#8220;Ah, didn&#8217;t I see a nice commuter bike the other day?&#8221;, you can <a title=\"Search Delicious for Bike and Commuter\" href=\"http:\/\/delicious.com\/rwintle\/bike+commuter\" target=\"_blank\">search for bike and commuter<\/a> tags and find it!<\/p>\n<p>Bookmarks can be shared too (this happens by default), so you can search for links that other people have tagged. \u00a0Here&#8217;s the <a title=\"Search Delicious for Bike and Commuter\" href=\"http:\/\/delicious.com\/tag\/bike+commuter\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;bike + commuter&#8221; list<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To top it all, there&#8217;s a great plug in for Firefox (see below) which makes saving and recall links easy!<\/p>\n<h3>Firefox\/Chrome<\/h3>\n<p>I suspect that if you&#8217;re reading my blog you&#8217;re probably a fairly advanced internet used. \u00a0But maybe not. \u00a0In which case, let me say a little about the tool that you use to browse the internet.<\/p>\n<p>Most people will use Internet Explorer (the big blue &#8220;e&#8221;) to get to the Internet. \u00a0But a lot of people would argue that this isn&#8217;t the best way.<\/p>\n<p>There are other free programs that do what Internet Explorer does, and they do it much better.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Firefox\" href=\"http:\/\/www.mozilla-europe.org\/en\/firefox\/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox<\/a> has been around for a while and, while I find it slow to start up, it&#8217;s quick once it gets going and has lots of options and a great plug-in system that makes it do more stuff (read about some of the plug-ins that I use below).<\/p>\n<p>I depend on it for most of my internet access both at home and at work because it&#8217;s fast and flexible.<\/p>\n<p>Google have recently released a web browser too, called <a title=\"Google Chrome\" href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/chrome\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome<\/a>. \u00a0It&#8217;s lightning fast, but still quite new on the scene so it doesn&#8217;t do quite as much as Firefox, but it will improve quickly.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a Mac user then you&#8217;re probably happy with Safari but Firefox is also available for you and will, with the right plug-ins handily syncronise your data with Firefox running on another computer.<\/p>\n<p>Installing a new program may sound a bit scary, but these things are hard to break and I encourage you to give them a try and check out the help pages and tutorials that show you what they do.<\/p>\n<h3>Firefox Add-Ons<\/h3>\n<p>Firefox does lots when you first install it, but people have written little <a title=\"Firefox Add Ons\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/\" target=\"_blank\">add-on bits<\/a> for it that make it do more. \u00a0Here are some that I use.<\/p>\n<h4>Fire Gestures<\/h4>\n<p>Gestures debuted in the Opera Web Browser which is also still around). \u00a0They allow you to move around the internet more easily with just a mouse. \u00a0A gesture usually involves holding down a mouse button and &#8220;swiping&#8221; the mouse in a direction to do something. \u00a0For example, holding down the right mouse button and moving the mouse left goes &#8220;back&#8221; (like clicking the big left arrow button).<\/p>\n<p>This can save you time and lots of mouse movement.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"FireGestures\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/6366\" target=\"_blank\">Fire Gestures<\/a> brings this to Firefox and it works a treat. \u00a0I get confused now when I CAN&#8217;T use gestures&#8230;why doesn&#8217;t it work?<\/p>\n<h4>Foxmarks\/XMarks<\/h4>\n<p>All web browsers have favourites, or bookmarks; places to store links that you go to often. \u00a0But a lot of people these days have more than one computer, so it would be handy to have the same lists of bookmarks on each computer.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"XMarks - Bookmark Sync and Search\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xmarks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">XMarks<\/a> (previously known as Foxmarks) does this; it synchronises your lists of bookmarks across different computers and broswers.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s clever, works without you really knowing it&#8217;s there, you can get to your bookmarks by going to a web page (e.g. if you&#8217;re in an internet cafe and can&#8217;t install the add-on), and you can even have &#8220;profiles&#8221; to keep your work and leisure bookmarks separate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gui:Config<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As the name might suggest, probably not for the average user, but <a title=\"GUI:Config add on\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/5523\" target=\"_blank\">this add on<\/a> gives you a whole extra load of settings for changing how the browser works<\/p>\n<h4>NoScript<\/h4>\n<p>A lot of the clever stuff that you can do on the Internet these days is accomplished using scripts &#8211; small bits of code that are downloaded from the internet and run on your computer.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with this is that people can write nasty scripts that do stuff that you don&#8217;t want.<\/p>\n<p>Again, don&#8217;t get scared. \u00a0For the average internet user this doesn&#8217;t happen much.<\/p>\n<p>What <a title=\"NoScript\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/722\" target=\"_blank\">NoScript<\/a> does is it blocks scripts from any sites that you haven&#8217;t approved. \u00a0This is highly annoying at first while you &#8220;whitelist&#8221; all the things that you actually need to be able to do. \u00a0But once you&#8217;ve been through that process you&#8217;re a fair bit safer than you were.<\/p>\n<p>Blocking scripts can also:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove adverts and automatically-appearing videos and sounds.<\/li>\n<li>Prevent you being redirected to nasty web sites.<\/li>\n<li>Prevent your visits being registered by sites which track visits<\/li>\n<li>Give you an insight into where all these scripts come from.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t essential security, but useful extra protection if you can spend some time working it out.<\/p>\n<h4>URLBarExt<\/h4>\n<p>Again, for more advanced users. \u00a0I&#8217;m not entirely convinced of its use just yet, but it adds a load of extra little icons to the address bar (aka the &#8220;Awesome Bar&#8221;) at the top of the browser.<\/p>\n<p>My favourite is the link shortener.<\/p>\n<p><em>[Advanced user note and note to self:<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>If you have a bit.ly API key you can configure the shortener to use a URL like: <\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>http:\/\/api.bit.ly\/shorten?version=2.0.1&amp;login=&lt;login&gt;&amp;apiKey=&lt;apiKey&gt;&amp;history=1&amp;longUrl=<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>and a filter like:<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>\\&#8221;shortUrl\\&#8221;: \\&#8221;(.+)\\&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>to have all shortened links tracked in your bit.ly account]<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>Other Add-Ons<\/h4>\n<p>Other add-ons I use are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Compact Menu 2\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/4550\" target=\"_blank\">Compact Menu 2<\/a> &#8211; reduces the menu bar to a single icon with a drop-down menu system &#8211; great for saving screen space and especially great for use on a NetBook with a small screen.<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Delicious Bookmarks Addon\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/3615\" target=\"_blank\">Delicious Bookmarks<\/a> &#8211;

almost-essential new options for using tabs.<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"EchoFon\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/5081\" target=\"_blank\">EchoFon<\/a> (was Twitterfox) &#8211; neat and unobtrusive Twitter gadget for Firefox.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Firefox Keyword Searches<\/h3>\n<p>One final note on Firefox before I shut up. Firefox has the ability to use &#8220;keywords&#8221; for searches. \u00a0This means that you can things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;amazon the da vinci code&#8221; to go straight to Amazon results for &#8220;the da vinci code&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;ebay food processor&#8221; to find food processors on ebay<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You get the idea.<\/p>\n<p>But these are also customisable. \u00a0So if there&#8217;s a site that you search a lot, set up a key word for it. \u00a0It&#8217;s usually enough just to find the text box where you type your search, right-click in it and select &#8220;Add a Keyword for this search&#8221;. \u00a0This is all described in more detail <a title=\"Mozillazine - Keyword Searches\" href=\"http:\/\/kb.mozillazine.org\/Using_keyword_searches\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Combined with the fact that pressing Ctrl-L on the keyboard takes you to the bar and you can do quick and easy searches without even using the mouse!<\/p>\n<h3>Summing Up<\/h3>\n<p>I like to think I&#8217;m a pretty advanced web user but I don&#8217;t know the half of what&#8217;s out there. I get lots of tips from the <a title=\"Lifehacker Blog\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lifehacker.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">LifeHacker Blog<\/a> and from people on Twitter who know more than I.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not entirely happy that I pitched this post at the right technical level. \u00a0Man, you could run week-long courses on this stuff. \u00a0Remember it was mostly notes to self, but hopefully there&#8217;s something useful for someone else too.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d encourage you not to be content with a half-hearted internet-browsing experience! \u00a0If you&#8217;re a novice, feel free to use the comments to ask me more. \u00a0Or perhaps you&#8217;d like to share a tip or two of your own&#8230;be my guest.<\/p>\n<p>Happy Browsing!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h3>What this is really all about<\/h3>\n<p>Ok, I confess.  This post started as a note to self about various things that I want to record for my own future reference.  I&#8217;ve tried to flesh it out into something that may be of interest to others.<\/p>\n<h3>A geek&#8217;s dilemma<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s probably quite clear that I&#8217;m a bit of a geek.  In fact I&#8217;ve already proudly annouced this fact at least twice here.  And one of the things about being a geek (of the computer kind) is that you discover lots of useful software tools for doing computery-type things.<\/p>\n<p>Some of these things aren&#8217;t useful for the everyday person.  I wouldn&#8217;t expect my average reader to care about <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/01\/10\/tools-of-the-trade\/\">subversion, vi or X<\/a> because you don&#8217;t do the sorts of tasks that those tools are designed to help with.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the tools are useful to non-geeks, but require some investment in learning about new technologies or concepts.\u00a0 Perhaps something like an RSS Feed Reader would come into this category.\u00a0 Some people jump at the idea of using a new tool to do something useful.\u00a0 Others take an &#8220;it ain&#8217;t broken so don&#8217;t fix it&#8221; approach.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the tools are not obviously useful in that they don&#8217;t let you do anything new or different &#8211; but they are &#8220;important&#8221;.\u00a0 Things like virus checkers, firewalls, and other security tools fit this category.<\/p>\n<p>And some of the tools are quick, simple little things, or incredibly useful things and you&#8217;ll wonder why you don&#8217;t know about them already (or perhaps you already do).<\/p>\n<p>This post is a little list of things that I&#8217;ve found useful as a computer user, making his way around the internet and sharing things with his friends as he does so.<\/p>\n<p>Not all of them fit into the last category, but I offer them for, as I said, both my own future reference and for the information of any readers.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Avast and AVG<\/h3>\n<p>Most virus software comes with updated for a year and I used to have a policy of buying new virus software within the last 3 months (when it started nagging me that the updates were running out). \u00a0There was almost always something for sale in WHSmith for half price.<\/p>\n<p>But most of the major anti-virus vendors sell huge packages full of software, most of which you don&#8217;t need, and some of which has, in my experience, broken other bits of software.<\/p>\n<p>So I started looking for something that was more light-weight &#8211; JUST a virus scanner.<\/p>\n<p>And it turns out there are some free ones around. \u00a0I&#8217;ve given both <a title=\"AVG Free\" href=\"http:\/\/free.avg.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">AVG Free<\/a> and <a title=\"Avast Home Edition Anti-Virus\" href=\"http:\/\/www.avast.com\/eng\/download-avast-home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Avast<\/a> a go and have had no problems with either. \u00a0Why pay?<\/p>\n<h3>Internet Link Tools<\/h3>\n<p>As you float around the Internet and surf the vast oceans of information that are out there, occasionally you come across things that you want to remember for later, or to send on to others.<\/p>\n<p>There are many ways of doing these things, but two that I use a lot are bit.ly and Delicious.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bit.ly<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Bit.ly\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/bit.ly<\/a> is a URL shortener. \u00a0This takes a long internet link like, say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><a title=\"BBC News: Barack Obama Wins Nobel Peace Prize\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/americas\/8299824.stm\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/americas\/8299824.stm<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a title=\"BBC News: Barack Obama Wins Nobel Peace Prize\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/americas\/8299824.stm\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a>and shortens it to something like<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><a title=\"BBC News: Barack Wins Nobel Peace Prize, via bit.ly\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2t8Oua\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/2t8Oua<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Why is this useful? \u00a0Well, mostly if you want to share a link when you&#8217;re constrained by the length of your message &#8211; like with Twitter where you can only use 140 characters. \u00a0But you could send links like this in SMS or emails.<\/p>\n<p>To make life quick and easy there are &#8220;bookmarklets&#8221; and plug-ins that let you get one-click buttons for shortening links.<\/p>\n<p>There are LOADS of link shortening services but bit.ly offers plenty more. \u00a0If it&#8217;s not taken already you can use your own reference for the link. It wouldn&#8217;t let me shorten this link to news about Obama&#8217;s Nobel prize to ObNob, but it would let me use <a title=\"BBC News: Obama Wins Nobel Prize\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/0bNob\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/0bNob<\/a><\/p>\n<p>And it tracks stats too&#8230;so if you&#8217;re running a marketing campaign and don&#8217;t have tools that will let you track who&#8217;s clicked on links that you&#8217;ve sent, bit.ly will tell you how many times the shortened link is clicked.<\/p>\n<p>A quick warning &#8211; when you shortened link you don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s going. It could go somewhere bad! \u00a0You can check the destination of a bit.ly link by adding a &#8220;+&#8221; to the end; e.g. <a title=\"Link Info\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/0bNob+\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/0bNob+<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Delicious<\/h3>\n<p>Do you ever, while browsing the internet, come across something &#8211; \u00a0say, a news article or a knitting pattern, or a nice bike &#8211; that you want to remember and recall, but you don&#8217;t want to clog up your browser bookmarks?<\/p>\n<p>I use a tool called Delicious for this. \u00a0It&#8217;s a &#8220;social bookmarking&#8221; tool&#8230;don&#8217;t get scared&#8230;it allows you to set up a user account and install a bookmarklet (a little button) or a browser plug in that lets you save stuff like this for later use.<\/p>\n<p>You can &#8220;tag&#8221; links to help you remember them. \u00a0So you could tag my Obama getting his Nobel Prize artical with the terms &#8220;obama, nobel, prize, news&#8221; and then use those tags to recall the article later.<\/p>\n<p>Then, when you think &#8220;Ah, didn&#8217;t I see a nice commuter bike the other day?&#8221;, you can <a title=\"Search Delicious for Bike and Commuter\" href=\"http:\/\/delicious.com\/rwintle\/bike+commuter\" target=\"_blank\">search for bike and commuter<\/a> tags and find it!<\/p>\n<p>Bookmarks can be shared too (this happens by default), so you can search for links that other people have tagged. \u00a0Here&#8217;s the <a title=\"Search Delicious for Bike and Commuter\" href=\"http:\/\/delicious.com\/tag\/bike+commuter\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;bike + commuter&#8221; list<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To top it all, there&#8217;s a great plug in for Firefox (see below) which makes saving and recall links easy!<\/p>\n<h3>Firefox\/Chrome<\/h3>\n<p>I suspect that if you&#8217;re reading my blog you&#8217;re probably a fairly advanced internet used. \u00a0But maybe not. \u00a0In which case, let me say a little about the tool that you use to browse the internet.<\/p>\n<p>Most people will use Internet Explorer (the big blue &#8220;e&#8221;) to get to the Internet. \u00a0But a lot of people would argue that this isn&#8217;t the best way.<\/p>\n<p>There are other free programs that do what Internet Explorer does, and they do it much better.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Firefox\" href=\"http:\/\/www.mozilla-europe.org\/en\/firefox\/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox<\/a> has been around for a while and, while I find it slow to start up, it&#8217;s quick once it gets going and has lots of options and a great plug-in system that makes it do more stuff (read about some of the plug-ins that I use below).<\/p>\n<p>I depend on it for most of my internet access both at home and at work because it&#8217;s fast and flexible.<\/p>\n<p>Google have recently released a web browser too, called <a title=\"Google Chrome\" href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/chrome\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome<\/a>. \u00a0It&#8217;s lightning fast, but still quite new on the scene so it doesn&#8217;t do quite as much as Firefox, but it will improve quickly.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a Mac user then you&#8217;re probably happy with Safari but Firefox is also available for you and will, with the right plug-ins handily syncronise your data with Firefox running on another computer.<\/p>\n<p>Installing a new program may sound a bit scary, but these things are hard to break and I encourage you to give them a try and check out the help pages and tutorials that show you what they do.<\/p>\n<h3>Firefox Add-Ons<\/h3>\n<p>Firefox does lots when you first install it, but people have written little <a title=\"Firefox Add Ons\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/\" target=\"_blank\">add-on bits<\/a> for it that make it do more. \u00a0Here are some that I use.<\/p>\n<h4>Fire Gestures<\/h4>\n<p>Gestures debuted in the Opera Web Browser which is also still around). \u00a0They allow you to move around the internet more easily with just a mouse. \u00a0A gesture usually involves holding down a mouse button and &#8220;swiping&#8221; the mouse in a direction to do something. \u00a0For example, holding down the right mouse button and moving the mouse left goes &#8220;back&#8221; (like clicking the big left arrow button).<\/p>\n<p>This can save you time and lots of mouse movement.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"FireGestures\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/6366\" target=\"_blank\">Fire Gestures<\/a> brings this to Firefox and it works a treat. \u00a0I get confused now when I CAN&#8217;T use gestures&#8230;why doesn&#8217;t it work?<\/p>\n<h4>Foxmarks\/XMarks<\/h4>\n<p>All web browsers have favourites, or bookmarks; places to store links that you go to often. \u00a0But a lot of people these days have more than one computer, so it would be handy to have the same lists of bookmarks on each computer.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"XMarks - Bookmark Sync and Search\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xmarks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">XMarks<\/a> (previously known as Foxmarks) does this; it synchronises your lists of bookmarks across different computers and broswers.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s clever, works without you really knowing it&#8217;s there, you can get to your bookmarks by going to a web page (e.g. if you&#8217;re in an internet cafe and can&#8217;t install the add-on), and you can even have &#8220;profiles&#8221; to keep your work and leisure bookmarks separate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gui:Config<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As the name might suggest, probably not for the average user, but <a title=\"GUI:Config add on\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/5523\" target=\"_blank\">this add on<\/a> gives you a whole extra load of settings for changing how the browser works<\/p>\n<h4>NoScript<\/h4>\n<p>A lot of the clever stuff that you can do on the Internet these days is accomplished using scripts &#8211; small bits of code that are downloaded from the internet and run on your computer.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with this is that people can write nasty scripts that do stuff that you don&#8217;t want.<\/p>\n<p>Again, don&#8217;t get scared. \u00a0For the average internet user this doesn&#8217;t happen much.<\/p>\n<p>What <a title=\"NoScript\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/722\" target=\"_blank\">NoScript<\/a> does is it blocks scripts from any sites that you haven&#8217;t approved. \u00a0This is highly annoying at first while you &#8220;whitelist&#8221; all the things that you actually need to be able to do. \u00a0But once you&#8217;ve been through that process you&#8217;re a fair bit safer than you were.<\/p>\n<p>Blocking scripts can also:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove adverts and automatically-appearing videos and sounds.<\/li>\n<li>Prevent you being redirected to nasty web sites.<\/li>\n<li>Prevent your visits being registered by sites which track visits<\/li>\n<li>Give you an insight into where all these scripts come from.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t essential security, but useful extra protection if you can spend some time working it out.<\/p>\n<h4>URLBarExt<\/h4>\n<p>Again, for more advanced users. \u00a0I&#8217;m not entirely convinced of its use just yet, but it adds a load of extra little icons to the address bar (aka the &#8220;Awesome Bar&#8221;) at the top of the browser.<\/p>\n<p>My favourite is the link shortener.<\/p>\n<p><em>[Advanced user note and note to self:<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>If you have a bit.ly API key you can configure the shortener to use a URL like: <\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>http:\/\/api.bit.ly\/shorten?version=2.0.1&amp;login=&lt;login&gt;&amp;apiKey=&lt;apiKey&gt;&amp;history=1&amp;longUrl=<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>and a filter like:<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>\\&#8221;shortUrl\\&#8221;: \\&#8221;(.+)\\&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>to have all shortened links tracked in your bit.ly account]<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>Other Add-Ons<\/h4>\n<p>Other add-ons I use are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Compact Menu 2\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/4550\" target=\"_blank\">Compact Menu 2<\/a> &#8211; reduces the menu bar to a single icon with a drop-down menu system &#8211; great for saving screen space and especially great for use on a NetBook with a small screen.<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Delicious Bookmarks Addon\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/3615\" target=\"_blank\">Delicious Bookmarks<\/a> &#8211; plug in for Delicious bookmarks mentioned above.<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Feedly\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/8538\" target=\"_blank\">Feedly<\/a> &#8211; if you use Google Reader you MUST check this out &#8211; it&#8217;s a magazine-style layout for your Google Reader items. \u00a0Brilliant!<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Tab Mix Plus\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/1122\" target=\"_blank\">Tab Mix Plus<\/a> &#8211; almost-essential new options for using tabs.<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"EchoFon\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/5081\" target=\"_blank\">EchoFon<\/a> (was Twitterfox) &#8211; neat and unobtrusive Twitter gadget for Firefox.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Firefox Keyword Searches<\/h3>\n<p>One final note on Firefox before I shut up. Firefox has the ability to use &#8220;keywords&#8221; for searches. \u00a0This means that you can things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;amazon the da vinci code&#8221; to go straight to Amazon results for &#8220;the da vinci code&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;ebay food processor&#8221; to find food processors on ebay<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You get the idea.<\/p>\n<p>But these are also customisable. \u00a0So if there&#8217;s a site that you search a lot, set up a key word for it. \u00a0It&#8217;s usually enough just to find the text box where you type your search, right-click in it and select &#8220;Add a Keyword for this search&#8221;. \u00a0This is all described in more detail <a title=\"Mozillazine - Keyword Searches\" href=\"http:\/\/kb.mozillazine.org\/Using_keyword_searches\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Combined with the fact that pressing Ctrl-L on the keyboard takes you to the bar and you can do quick and easy searches without even using the mouse!<\/p>\n<h3>Summing Up<\/h3>\n<p>I like to think I&#8217;m a pretty advanced web user but I don&#8217;t know the half of what&#8217;s out there. I get lots of tips from the <a title=\"Lifehacker Blog\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lifehacker.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">LifeHacker Blog<\/a> and from people on Twitter who know more than I.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not entirely happy that I pitched this post at the right technical level. \u00a0Man, you could run week-long courses on this stuff. \u00a0Remember it was mostly notes to self, but hopefully there&#8217;s something useful for someone else too.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d encourage you not to be content with a half-hearted internet-browsing experience! \u00a0If you&#8217;re a novice, feel free to use the comments to ask me more. \u00a0Or perhaps you&#8217;d like to share a tip or two of your own&#8230;be my guest.<\/p>\n<p>Happy Browsing!<\/p>\n",

They&#8217;re friendly, honest and do a good deal. \u00a0In the past they&#8217;ve done most repairs same-day too. \u00a0I&#8217;ve never had a reason not to go there. They shall remain nameless for now.<\/p>\n<p>I took the wheel in on Tuesday and was told it wouldn&#8217;t be ready until Friday at 4pm. \u00a0Hmm..OK. \u00a0Not hugely impressed but the fact that they&#8217;re busy is good right? \u00a0Means more bikes are in use! \u00a0Win!<\/p>\n<p>Friday at 3:15pm, I call them to check that it&#8217;ll be ready. \u00a0There&#8217;s some conversation and some scrabbling around and I&#8217;m told it&#8217;ll be ready by 4 as promised. \u00a0I was not so convinced.<\/p>\n<p>The wheel was ready by 4, but I wasn&#8217;t sure they&#8217;d done much to it. \u00a0I paid up and left half-satisfied.<\/p>\n<p>Then the front-wheel started making similar noises. \u00a0I decided to try somewhere new.<\/p>\n<p>The Big Adventure Store (I will name them as they&#8217;re excellent!) is a small shop for running, cycling, triathlon and adventure racing gear, with a bike clinic to boot!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the right side of town, open &#8217;til 7pm 4 days a week and run by people who really know their stuff. \u00a0It&#8217;s a little expensive and I was originally nervous about going there because I felt a little intimidated.<\/p>\n<p>But, can I say, their bike guy is superb! \u00a0He not only clearly demonstrated that he&#8217;d properly serviced my wheel by describing the damage done to the cones and talking about replacing the bearings and grease, but he went the extra mile by tightening up the spokes and cleaning the rims and hub. \u00a0And for only a couple of pounds more.<\/p>\n<p>I have a new favourite bike shop!<\/p>\n<p>The Big Adventure Store was also busy and took several days to turn the work around.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s great news that Swindon&#8217;s bike shops are busy, but annoying that that busyness means that work is being rushed and that I have to wait to have work done. \u00a0Perhaps we need a new bike shop?! \u00a0Any takers?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Fuzzy&#8217;s had some problems with wheels lately which has led me to reflect on my bike shop choice.<\/p>\n<p>It started with the back wheel crunching and clanking a bit. \u00a0I was sure I recognised the noise and that it was something really simple, but I couldn&#8217;t track it down and ended up committing the wheel to my local shop.<\/p>\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s not all that local really, but I like them. They&#8217;re friendly, honest and do a good deal. \u00a0In the past they&#8217;ve done most repairs same-day too. \u00a0I&#8217;ve never had a reason not to go there. They shall remain nameless for now.<\/p>\n<p>I took the wheel in on Tuesday and was told it wouldn&#8217;t be ready until Friday at 4pm. \u00a0Hmm..OK. \u00a0Not hugely impressed but the fact that they&#8217;re busy is good right? \u00a0Means more bikes are in use! \u00a0Win!<\/p>\n<p>Friday at 3:15pm, I call them to check that it&#8217;ll be ready. \u00a0There&#8217;s some conversation and some scrabbling around and I&#8217;m told it&#8217;ll be ready by 4 as promised. \u00a0I was not so convinced.<\/p>\n<p>The wheel was ready by 4, but I wasn&#8217;t sure they&#8217;d done much to it. \u00a0I paid up and left half-satisfied.<\/p>\n<p>Then the front-wheel started making similar noises. \u00a0I decided to try somewhere new.<\/p>\n<p>The Big Adventure Store (I will name them as they&#8217;re excellent!) is a small shop for running, cycling, triathlon and adventure racing gear, with a bike clinic to boot!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the right side of town, open &#8217;til 7pm 4 days a week and run by people who really know their stuff. \u00a0It&#8217;s a little expensive and I was originally nervous about going there because I felt a little intimidated.<\/p>\n<p>But, can I say, their bike guy is superb! \u00a0He not only clearly demonstrated that he&#8217;d properly serviced my wheel by describing the damage done to the cones and talking about replacing the bearings and grease, but he went the extra mile by tightening up the spokes and cleaning the rims and hub. \u00a0And for only a couple of pounds more.<\/p>\n<p>I have a new favourite bike shop!<\/p>\n<p>The Big Adventure Store was also busy and took several days to turn the work around.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s great news that Swindon&#8217;s bike shops are busy, but annoying that that busyness means that work is being rushed and that I have to wait to have work done. \u00a0Perhaps we need a new bike shop?! \u00a0Any takers?<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>I feel like I grumble a lot about some of the positive things that are going on with fighting climate change.\u00a0 I suppose my frustration comes from the fact that I see little bits of progress, but no one&#8217;s really willing to go out on a limb and make the big commitment, to say &#8220;Actually, this is REALLY important so lets make some sacrifices and do what we have to do to really tackle it&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So,two little bits of climate change news which have struck me in the last few days.\u00a0 But first, a revelation.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Fossil Fuels<\/h3>\n<p>You know, it never occurred to me that the term &#8220;fossil fuels&#8221; contained the word &#8220;fossil&#8221; and that this is hugely significant.\u00a0 Our fuels are the ancient remains of dead trees and plants.\u00a0 All that carbon was once living matter.\u00a0 And what gives fossil fuels their potency is that this is carbon that has accumulated over millions of years.<\/p>\n<p>And we&#8217;re releasing all that carbon by burning it.\u00a0 Millions of years worth of carbon taken out of the air, suddenly being put back into the air in a (relatively) VERY short space of time.<\/p>\n<p>And it will take millions of years to sink it all back into the ground again.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll let you make up your own mind whether this is a good idea or not.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;ve not tied these things together before, but it reinforces in my mind lots of things about our energy sources.<\/p>\n<h3>Energy Price Fears<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Fear of Steep Energy Bill Rises\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/business\/8297882.stm\" target=\"_blank\">This article<\/a>&#8216;s headline and opening paragraph caught my attention because the answer seems to simple.\u00a0 Energy prices rise?\u00a0 Well invest in energy efficiency!\u00a0 I don&#8217;t understand why people don&#8217;t get this.<\/p>\n<p>We import gas and oil, both of which will, eventually, run out, or become difficult to get hold of.\u00a0 Our supply of these things is by no means guaranteed, so if we wish to sustain any sort of economy, we must invest in becoming a self-sustaining nation.\u00a0 If we reduce consumption now we will be able to pay more per-energy unit to fund investment in sustainable solutions.\u00a0 If we have growing sustainable energy production then we both fight climate change and become more energy-secure. It&#8217;s win-win, if not win-win-win.\u00a0\u00a0 So why aren&#8217;t we getting on a doing it?<\/p>\n<h3>The Copenhagen Communiqu\u00e9<\/h3>\n<p>When I first read the Copenhagen Communiqu\u00e9 I was incensed at the seeming hypocrisy of it.\u00a0 More than 500 big companies, many multi-nationals, signing a request for the UN to put in place a climate change framework.\u00a0 Companies including BAA, BA, Air France, EasyJet, BP and Royal Dutch Shell.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, seriously?<\/p>\n<p>I can see what they&#8217;re trying to do.\u00a0 They&#8217;re saying &#8220;we&#8217;ve got the money and power to make big change, but we&#8217;ll only do it if the UN make conditions favourable for us to do it&#8221; (at least, that&#8217;s my reading of it).<\/p>\n<p>I like the Communiqu\u00e9&#8217;s holistic approach: developing and developed countries; adaptation frameworks for the poorest countries; halting deforestation.\u00a0 But it lacks something!<\/p>\n<p>Yes&#8230;it lacks any sort of commitment from the companies themselves.\u00a0 It looks, to me, too much like these companies are putting the onus on the governments and the developing countries without wanting to do much themselves.\u00a0 They want conditions that make it easy for them to survive.<\/p>\n<p>Of course I agree with the call for &#8220;an ambitions, robust and equitable global deal on climate change&#8221;, but it&#8217;s just something else that&#8217;s not enough&#8230;the big companies have to do their bit too and I don&#8217;t see that happening.\u00a0 If they think it&#8217;s so important, if they think it&#8217;s needed for the future why aren&#8217;t they leading the way?\u00a0 What right do they have to be lobbying the UN if their own house isn&#8217;t in, or getting in, order?\u00a0 And what are they going to when the UN turn around and ask for their help?<\/p>\n<p>Yes, I feel like a grumble guts.\u00a0 I like seeing progress on climate change, but I want MORE.\u00a0 More from our governments, more from the UN, more from big businesses, more from developed and developing countries, more aid, more targets, more investment.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t see a future without it.<\/p>\n<h3>P.S.<\/h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s one other little thing I wanted to mention on this topic.<\/p>\n<p>We were down in Devon lately and we visited a working water mill that powered tools used in a blacksmiths (Finch Foundry, if you&#8217;re wondering).<\/p>\n<p>It was incredible when the demonstrator pulled a leaver, the water was released, the wheel turned and this huge machinery came to life.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll never get all of our power from water, but seeing this simple, free, sustainable, green form of energy in use just got me thinking about how microgeneration could contribute.\u00a0 Perhaps it would do us all some good if we knew exactly where our energy came from!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I feel like I grumble a lot about some of the positive things that are going on with fighting climate change.\u00a0 I suppose my frustration comes from the fact that I see little bits of progress, but no one&#8217;s really willing to go out on a limb and make the big commitment, to say &#8220;Actually, this is REALLY important so lets make some sacrifices and do what we have to do to really tackle it&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So,two little bits of climate change news which have struck me in the last few days.\u00a0 But first, a revelation.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Fossil Fuels<\/h3>\n<p>You know, it never occurred to me that the term &#8220;fossil fuels&#8221; contained the word &#8220;fossil&#8221; and that this is hugely significant.\u00a0 Our fuels are the ancient remains of dead trees and plants.\u00a0 All that carbon was once living matter.\u00a0 And what gives fossil fuels their potency is that this is carbon that has accumulated over millions of years.<\/p>\n<p>And we&#8217;re releasing all that carbon by burning it.\u00a0 Millions of years worth of carbon taken out of the air, suddenly being put back into the air in a (relatively) VERY short space of time.<\/p>\n<p>And it will take millions of years to sink it all back into the ground again.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll let you make up your own mind whether this is a good idea or not.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;ve not tied these things together before, but it reinforces in my mind lots of things about our energy sources.<\/p>\n<h3>Energy Price Fears<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Fear of Steep Energy Bill Rises\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/business\/8297882.stm\" target=\"_blank\">This article<\/a>&#8216;s headline and opening paragraph caught my attention because the answer seems to simple.\u00a0 Energy prices rise?\u00a0 Well invest in energy efficiency!\u00a0 I don&#8217;t understand why people don&#8217;t get this.<\/p>\n<p>We import gas and oil, both of which will, eventually, run out, or become difficult to get hold of.\u00a0 Our supply of these things is by no means guaranteed, so if we wish to sustain any sort of economy, we must invest in becoming a self-sustaining nation.\u00a0 If we reduce consumption now we will be able to pay more per-energy unit to fund investment in sustainable solutions.\u00a0 If we have growing sustainable energy production then we both fight climate change and become more energy-secure. It&#8217;s win-win, if not win-win-win.\u00a0\u00a0 So why aren&#8217;t we getting on a doing it?<\/p>\n<h3>The Copenhagen Communiqu\u00e9<\/h3>\n<p>When I first read the Copenhagen Communiqu\u00e9 I was incensed at the seeming hypocrisy of it.\u00a0 More than 500 big companies, many multi-nationals, signing a request for the UN to put in place a climate change framework.\u00a0 Companies including BAA, BA, Air France, EasyJet, BP and Royal Dutch Shell.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, seriously?<\/p>\n<p>I can see what they&#8217;re trying to do.\u00a0 They&#8217;re saying &#8220;we&#8217;ve got the money and power to make big change, but we&#8217;ll only do it if the UN make conditions favourable for us to do it&#8221; (at least, that&#8217;s my reading of it).<\/p>\n<p>I like the Communiqu\u00e9&#8217;s holistic approach: developing and developed countries; adaptation frameworks for the poorest countries; halting deforestation.\u00a0 But it lacks something!<\/p>\n<p>Yes&#8230;it lacks any sort of commitment from the companies themselves.\u00a0 It looks, to me, too much like these companies are putting the onus on the governments and the developing countries without wanting to do much themselves.\u00a0 They want conditions that make it easy for them to survive.<\/p>\n<p>Of course I agree with the call for &#8220;an ambitions, robust and equitable global deal on climate change&#8221;, but it&#8217;s just something else that&#8217;s not enough&#8230;the big companies have to do their bit too and I don&#8217;t see that happening.\u00a0 If they think it&#8217;s so important, if they think it&#8217;s needed for the future why aren&#8217;t they leading the way?\u00a0 What right do they have to be lobbying the UN if their own house isn&#8217;t in, or getting in, order?\u00a0 And what are they going to when the UN turn around and ask for their help?<\/p>\n<p>Yes, I feel like a grumble guts.\u00a0 I like seeing progress on climate change, but I want MORE.\u00a0 More from our governments, more from the UN, more from big businesses, more from developed and developing countries, more aid, more targets, more investment.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t see a future without it.<\/p>\n<h3>P.S.<\/h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s one other little thing I wanted to mention on this topic.<\/p>\n<p>We were down in Devon lately and we visited a working water mill that powered tools used in a blacksmiths (Finch Foundry, if you&#8217;re wondering).<\/p>\n<p>It was incredible when the demonstrator pulled a leaver, the water was released, the wheel turned and this huge machinery came to life.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll never get all of our power from water, but seeing this simple, free, sustainable, green form of energy in use just got me thinking about how microgeneration could contribute.\u00a0 Perhaps it would do us all some good if we knew exactly where our energy came from!<\/p>\n",

First impressions are of solid build, great screen quality, and fantastically-responsive touch screen (I think it senses your touch by electric fields or something rather than by physical pressure &#8211; read up elsewhere from people that know &#8211; however it works, it works like a dream!)<\/p>\n<h3>A Good, Quick Job Won&#8217;t Be Cheap<\/h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s some truth in saying that you get what you pay for.  The iPod Touch, and, presumably, the iPhone, are expensive, but high-quality devices.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing I did was charge it and pay a few quid to update the OS (the system software) to v3.0.  This enables the device to do lots of very useful things that it couldn&#8217;t do before.<\/p>\n<p>Within a few moments of use I was almost speechless at its ease of use, fully-functional web browswer, speed, responsiveness, and after downloading a few free applications, functionality.<\/p>\n<p>The iPod Touch has a few neat tricks up its sleeve too.  I have big stubby fingers and normally hate small keyboards, but the on-screen keyboard here is REALLY good &#8211; especially combined with the often-magical auto-correction.  The little magnifying glass for positioning within text is genius and completely intuitive.  It magically knew my location (I&#8217;ve still not worked out how!).  With contacts, it knows how to put spaces into phone numbers (e.g. 01234567890 automatically becomes 01234 5678980, but 02012345678 becomes 020 1234 5678), and it knows to capitalise street names.<\/p>\n<p>First impressions: it&#8217;s jaw-droppingly good.  What more can it do?<\/p>\n<h3>It does it all!<\/h3>\n<p>Historically I&#8217;ve been against &#8220;convergence&#8221; &#8211; the idea of combining gadgets that do different things into one.  My traditional iPod has always been a good media player, but a rubbish organiser.  I&#8217;ve never been convinced that my organiser should be a phone &#8211; it&#8217;s the wrong size and shape.  And my phone has always been a rubbish media player and organiser.  But I LIKE the idea of having one set of contacts on my organiser and phone &#8211; and in my online email.  I was hoping that the iPod Touch would do some bits of convergence well.<\/p>\n<p>Email was easy to set up &#8211; give it my Google Mail details and it&#8217;s away with both a slinky mobile web interface and downloading to the iPod&#8217;s email app using IMAP.  With a few moments of configuration, I had it synchronising a Google calendar and contacts too.  My Sony Ericsson phone can also syncronise to Google contacts so my unified address book had arrived!<\/p>\n<p>Google Reader has a nice simple mobile web interface, which works a treat for catching up with Internet news feeds.  The little YouTube app just works giving high quality video with great ease.  The maps app is astonishingly slick, and you can download Google Earth too.  Downloading a few little games and tools showed off the accelerometer and what fun you can have with the touch screen.<\/p>\n<p>I downloaded a Twitter client (or several &#8211; still deciding which is best), and the free Facebook app.  I&#8217;d been recommended &#8220;Weather Pro&#8221; too, which I was initially sceptical of as it had a small cost attached, but it&#8217;s a great app with almost-real-time radar and satellite imagery so you can see what&#8217;s coming!.<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s got the organiser side of things wrapped up.  Well&#8230;in some ways it goes far beyond my old Palm organiser, and in other ways it&#8217;s a bit lacking; the standard note-taking tool is limited, and for some bizarre reason there&#8217;s no to-do list program, but these are minor complaints and can be got around.<\/p>\n<p>Being an iPod, it&#8217;s a media player too.  I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything here to blow you away.  It copies music, podcasts, video and photos from iTunes and presents them.  It&#8217;s pretty slick, but I actually think the fancy graphics and stuff get in the way a bit, and actually, the iPod bit has probably impressed the least.  There&#8217;s not much you can add to an already-decent media player.<\/p>\n<p>The one thing that did impress was the speed of the photo viewing and navigation.  Job VERY well done!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, this is an iPod touch, not an iPhone, so it&#8217;s not a completely converged device.  But two into one has gone very nicely.<\/p>\n<h3>&#8230;and it does a whole load more too!<\/h3>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s &#8220;App Store&#8221; (&#8220;app&#8221; is short for &#8220;Application&#8221;) is full of little programs that you can download, some for a small charge (most are less than a couple of quid), some for free!  And here&#8217;s where the fun begins.  What else do you want to do?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blog with the WordPress app<\/li>\n<li> Get real-time London Underground status, a map and journey planner with Tube Deluxe<\/li>\n<li>View Ordnance Survey mapping with iOSMaps<\/li>\n<li> Securely store passwords, pins and website logins.<\/li>\n<li> Chat with MSN or Yahoo contacts using eBuddy<\/li>\n<li> View Sky TV schedules and tell your Sky+ box to record with the Sky+ app<\/li>\n<li> Chat (text only) with Skype<\/li>\n<li> Browse and view photos on Flickr with the Flickr App<\/li>\n<li> Manage all aspects of you eBay account, browse the auctions, bid, watch items, leave feedback with the eBay app<\/li>\n<li> Manage a LinkedIn profile and network with the LinkedIn App<\/li>\n<li> Remotely control a computer using a VNC client<\/li>\n<li> If you&#8217;re a Geocacher, find caches, save details for offline referral, log finds &#8211; no more printing pages of logs!<\/li>\n<li> Play vast numbers of silly games &#8211; some of which are highly addictive time-killers (that&#8217;s you Flight Control!)<\/li>\n<li> Read books (I mostly use mine to carry round a reference Bible &#8211; probably the subject of a future post).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The only real problem is that, because you can do almost everything from this little device, it stays stuck to your left hand and you switch it on to answer any and all questions.  It becomes the oracle of your life.  It goes everywhere and&#8230;would I be lost without it?  Probably!<\/p>\n<h3>Flaws<\/h3>\n<p>OK.  This device is SO good, so fast, so functional, so slick, that can&#8217;t help feeling hugely let down when you find a flaw.  Here are some that I&#8217;ve noticed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> <strong>It should have a camera<\/strong>.  I know the iPhone has camera and GPS built in as well as being a phone.  But the iPod Touch really suffers by not having even just a camera (did I say that <a title=\"Pods and Parcels\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/16\/pods-and-parcels\/\" target=\"_blank\">I didn&#8217;t care about this before<\/a>?  Well with all these apps, I do now!)<\/li>\n<li><strong> To-do list<\/strong>.  It masquerades as an organiser with contacts and calendar, but it has no to-do list.  WHY???<\/li>\n<li><strong> Notes<\/strong>.  The standard notes application is half-hearted.  With a to-do list and categorised notes you could sell this as a high-spec personal information manager, but the notes app is lame.  Again&#8230;why???<\/li>\n<li><strong> Contacts-calendar-birthday sync<\/strong>.  The contacts and calendar are so good that I&#8217;m left wondering why they didn&#8217;t link the &#8220;Birthday&#8221; field in the contacts to the calendar.  Fortunately Google contacts\/calendar now does this for me, but it&#8217;s a striking omission from a device which does most things that you&#8217;d expect it to.<\/li>\n<li><strong> Not all apps have landscape<\/strong>.  I guess this is up to the application writers to code, but not all apps go widescreen when you turn the device sideways.  One app even insisted on using landscape keyboard all the time.<\/li>\n<li><strong> Too many clicks to shuffle an artist\/album or genre.<\/strong> There should be a quicker, cleverer way to do this!<\/li>\n<li><strong> It needs a universal &#8220;back&#8221; button.<\/strong> I&#8217;m definitely from the function-over-form school of design, and am sceptical of Apple minimalist devices as a result.  From what I understand they bowed to public pressure to add up\/down volume buttons to the two existing &#8220;sleep\/wake&#8221; and &#8220;Home&#8221; (i.e. &#8220;everything else&#8221;) buttons.  But I think it needs just one more&#8230;a back button.  Example: touching a contacts address takes you to that address in the maps application.  Very neat!  But what if I want to go back to the contact?  I have to press the home button, then select contacts and then find the contact again.  Being able to go back would be really useful!<\/li>\n<li> Talking of the clever address -&gt; map function&#8230;clicking an address on a contact takes you to the map, but clicking the location on an appointment in the calendar doesn&#8217;t.  Come on Apple&#8230;don&#8217;t set my expectations and then dash them.  If you&#8217;re going to let me tap an address and go to the map then make this happen consistently, or not at all!<\/li>\n<li> <strong>Audible alerts.<\/strong> Yes, the iPod Touch is the poor cousin of the iPhone, and I suspect the iPhone does this much better, but audible alerts aren&#8217;t always audible.  If I&#8217;ve turned the music volume down, I don&#8217;t hear an alert for an appointment.  If I&#8217;ve got headphones in then the alert sounds through the headphones &#8211; even if I don&#8217;t have them on\/in.  I suspect that, in some cases, this is the right thing to do, but it needs something like the &#8220;profiles&#8221; on my mobile phone so these things can be better customised.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Techies among you may be wondering if I&#8217;m disappointed by the lack of &#8220;multi-tasking&#8221;; that is, does it bother me that I can only run one app at a time and can&#8217;t have things running in the background?  The answer is no, but I&#8217;m not sure why.  I suppose it would be good to have, say, a Twitter client running in the background checking for new Tweets and alerting me.  But the truth is I don&#8217;t miss multi-tasking and it probably means that the apps that you do run run very quick.  Plus, switching apps is so quick that I don&#8217;t think it has the illusion of multi-tasking.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Summing Up<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I toyed with the idea of using the money from my headphones prize to buy a decent smart phone, but they were all too expensive.  I looked at iPhones too&#8230;WAY to expensive.  And yet, having used this device; having had it become indispensable, take over my life and change my whole notion of what it means to be &#8220;connected&#8221;, having realised that, actually, device convergance CAN be done and be done well; I find myself completely understanding those who pay over-the-odds for an iPhone.  The addition of a camera, phone and GPS would only serve to make this device more indispensable, it would complete the convergence by removing at least two other gadgets from my stash.<\/p>\n<p>I should emphasise that the iPod Touch is not just pretty, fast, slick.  It does a whole heap of useful stuff too.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s a downside to all this amazing electronic and software wizardry.<\/p>\n<p>I watched the Disney Pixar film Wall-E the other day (also highly recommended!) and there are some people in it who&#8217;ve become so immersed in portable video screens, so hooked into remote, electronic communication, and so pampered by robots and machines, that they&#8217;ve lost the simple pleasures of holding a hand, having a conversation, staring in awe at the stars, and working as a team to achieve something good.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, even for us, it&#8217;s SO easy to become immersed in technology and let ut rule us.  My iPod has taken over somewhat.  I&#8217;m slightly addicted to being so incredibly hooked up to the global internet, and perhaps a little at risk of forsaking the delights of the real world: walks in the country, sitting reading a book in the sunshine, conversing over a cup of coffee.  Technology is great but it&#8217;s addictive and does remove us from reality somewhat.  There&#8217;s something about the pages of a newspaper that beats Google Reader in a qualitative way.  There&#8217;s something special about writing a letter rather than an email.  There&#8217;s a certain joy in carrying a notebook and pen and writing things down in your own hand for later reading.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, the iPod Touch is a phenomenal and, dare I say it, life changing device &#8211; I would guess that the iPhone is more so.  But it should come with a health warning and we should constantly remind ourselves that we need to stay hooked up to the real world too!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><a title=\"Pods and Parcels\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/16\/pods-and-parcels\/\" target=\"_blank\">A while back<\/a> I mentioned that I&#8217;d sort-of won myself an Apple iPod Touch by winning a management-speak competition.<\/p>\n<p>These things are reviewed to death these days so, though this would probably be called a review, it&#8217;s more just my thoughts on the device.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Openings<\/h3>\n<p>The box it comes in is small but does the job.  First impressions are of solid build, great screen quality, and fantastically-responsive touch screen (I think it senses your touch by electric fields or something rather than by physical pressure &#8211; read up elsewhere from people that know &#8211; however it works, it works like a dream!)<\/p>\n<h3>A Good, Quick Job Won&#8217;t Be Cheap<\/h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s some truth in saying that you get what you pay for.  The iPod Touch, and, presumably, the iPhone, are expensive, but high-quality devices.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing I did was charge it and pay a few quid to update the OS (the system software) to v3.0.  This enables the device to do lots of very useful things that it couldn&#8217;t do before.<\/p>\n<p>Within a few moments of use I was almost speechless at its ease of use, fully-functional web browswer, speed, responsiveness, and after downloading a few free applications, functionality.<\/p>\n<p>The iPod Touch has a few neat tricks up its sleeve too.  I have big stubby fingers and normally hate small keyboards, but the on-screen keyboard here is REALLY good &#8211; especially combined with the often-magical auto-correction.  The little magnifying glass for positioning within text is genius and completely intuitive.  It magically knew my location (I&#8217;ve still not worked out how!).  With contacts, it knows how to put spaces into phone numbers (e.g. 01234567890 automatically becomes 01234 5678980, but 02012345678 becomes 020 1234 5678), and it knows to capitalise street names.<\/p>\n<p>First impressions: it&#8217;s jaw-droppingly good.  What more can it do?<\/p>\n<h3>It does it all!<\/h3>\n<p>Historically I&#8217;ve been against &#8220;convergence&#8221; &#8211; the idea of combining gadgets that do different things into one.  My traditional iPod has always been a good media player, but a rubbish organiser.  I&#8217;ve never been convinced that my organiser should be a phone &#8211; it&#8217;s the wrong size and shape.  And my phone has always been a rubbish media player and organiser.  But I LIKE the idea of having one set of contacts on my organiser and phone &#8211; and in my online email.  I was hoping that the iPod Touch would do some bits of convergence well.<\/p>\n<p>Email was easy to set up &#8211; give it my Google Mail details and it&#8217;s away with both a slinky mobile web interface and downloading to the iPod&#8217;s email app using IMAP.  With a few moments of configuration, I had it synchronising a Google calendar and contacts too.  My Sony Ericsson phone can also syncronise to Google contacts so my unified address book had arrived!<\/p>\n<p>Google Reader has a nice simple mobile web interface, which works a treat for catching up with Internet news feeds.  The little YouTube app just works giving high quality video with great ease.  The maps app is astonishingly slick, and you can download Google Earth too.  Downloading a few little games and tools showed off the accelerometer and what fun you can have with the touch screen.<\/p>\n<p>I downloaded a Twitter client (or several &#8211; still deciding which is best), and the free Facebook app.  I&#8217;d been recommended &#8220;Weather Pro&#8221; too, which I was initially sceptical of as it had a small cost attached, but it&#8217;s a great app with almost-real-time radar and satellite imagery so you can see what&#8217;s coming!.<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s got the organiser side of things wrapped up.  Well&#8230;in some ways it goes far beyond my old Palm organiser, and in other ways it&#8217;s a bit lacking; the standard note-taking tool is limited, and for some bizarre reason there&#8217;s no to-do list program, but these are minor complaints and can be got around.<\/p>\n<p>Being an iPod, it&#8217;s a media player too.  I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything here to blow you away.  It copies music, podcasts, video and photos from iTunes and presents them.  It&#8217;s pretty slick, but I actually think the fancy graphics and stuff get in the way a bit, and actually, the iPod bit has probably impressed the least.  There&#8217;s not much you can add to an already-decent media player.<\/p>\n<p>The one thing that did impress was the speed of the photo viewing and navigation.  Job VERY well done!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, this is an iPod touch, not an iPhone, so it&#8217;s not a completely converged device.  But two into one has gone very nicely.<\/p>\n<h3>&#8230;and it does a whole load more too!<\/h3>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s &#8220;App Store&#8221; (&#8220;app&#8221; is short for &#8220;Application&#8221;) is full of little programs that you can download, some for a small charge (most are less than a couple of quid), some for free!  And here&#8217;s where the fun begins.  What else do you want to do?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blog with the WordPress app<\/li>\n<li> Get real-time London Underground status, a map and journey planner with Tube Deluxe<\/li>\n<li>View Ordnance Survey mapping with iOSMaps<\/li>\n<li> Securely store passwords, pins and website logins.<\/li>\n<li> Chat with MSN or Yahoo contacts using eBuddy<\/li>\n<li> View Sky TV schedules and tell your Sky+ box to record with the Sky+ app<\/li>\n<li> Chat (text only) with Skype<\/li>\n<li> Browse and view photos on Flickr with the Flickr App<\/li>\n<li> Manage all aspects of you eBay account, browse the auctions, bid, watch items, leave feedback with the eBay app<\/li>\n<li> Manage a LinkedIn profile and network with the LinkedIn App<\/li>\n<li> Remotely control a computer using a VNC client<\/li>\n<li> If you&#8217;re a Geocacher, find caches, save details for offline referral, log finds &#8211; no more printing pages of logs!<\/li>\n<li> Play vast numbers of silly games &#8211; some of which are highly addictive time-killers (that&#8217;s you Flight Control!)<\/li>\n<li> Read books (I mostly use mine to carry round a reference Bible &#8211; probably the subject of a future post).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The only real problem is that, because you can do almost everything from this little device, it stays stuck to your left hand and you switch it on to answer any and all questions.  It becomes the oracle of your life.  It goes everywhere and&#8230;would I be lost without it?  Probably!<\/p>\n<h3>Flaws<\/h3>\n<p>OK.  This device is SO good, so fast, so functional, so slick, that can&#8217;t help feeling hugely let down when you find a flaw.  Here are some that I&#8217;ve noticed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> <strong>It should have a camera<\/strong>.  I know the iPhone has camera and GPS built in as well as being a phone.  But the iPod Touch really suffers by not having even just a camera (did I say that <a title=\"Pods and Parcels\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/16\/pods-and-parcels\/\" target=\"_blank\">I didn&#8217;t care about this before<\/a>?  Well with all these apps, I do now!)<\/li>\n<li><strong> To-do list<\/strong>.  It masquerades as an organiser with contacts and calendar, but it has no to-do list.  WHY???<\/li>\n<li><strong> Notes<\/strong>.  The standard notes application is half-hearted.  With a to-do list and categorised notes you could sell this as a high-spec personal information manager, but the notes app is lame.  Again&#8230;why???<\/li>\n<li><strong> Contacts-calendar-birthday sync<\/strong>.  The contacts and calendar are so good that I&#8217;m left wondering why they didn&#8217;t link the &#8220;Birthday&#8221; field in the contacts to the calendar.  Fortunately Google contacts\/calendar now does this for me, but it&#8217;s a striking omission from a device which does most things that you&#8217;d expect it to.<\/li>\n<li><strong> Not all apps have landscape<\/strong>.  I guess this is up to the application writers to code, but not all apps go widescreen when you turn the device sideways.  One app even insisted on using landscape keyboard all the time.<\/li>\n<li><strong> Too many clicks to shuffle an artist\/album or genre.<\/strong> There should be a quicker, cleverer way to do this!<\/li>\n<li><strong> It needs a universal &#8220;back&#8221; button.<\/strong> I&#8217;m definitely from the function-over-form school of design, and am sceptical of Apple minimalist devices as a result.  From what I understand they bowed to public pressure to add up\/down volume buttons to the two existing &#8220;sleep\/wake&#8221; and &#8220;Home&#8221; (i.e. &#8220;everything else&#8221;) buttons.  But I think it needs just one more&#8230;a back button.  Example: touching a contacts address takes you to that address in the maps application.  Very neat!  But what if I want to go back to the contact?  I have to press the home button, then select contacts and then find the contact again.  Being able to go back would be really useful!<\/li>\n<li> Talking of the clever address -&gt; map function&#8230;clicking an address on a contact takes you to the map, but clicking the location on an appointment in the calendar doesn&#8217;t.  Come on Apple&#8230;don&#8217;t set my expectations and then dash them.  If you&#8217;re going to let me tap an address and go to the map then make this happen consistently, or not at all!<\/li>\n<li> <strong>Audible alerts.<\/strong> Yes, the iPod Touch is the poor cousin of the iPhone, and I suspect the iPhone does this much better, but audible alerts aren&#8217;t always audible.  If I&#8217;ve turned the music volume down, I don&#8217;t hear an alert for an appointment.  If I&#8217;ve got headphones in then the alert sounds through the headphones &#8211; even if I don&#8217;t have them on\/in.  I suspect that, in some cases, this is the right thing to do, but it needs something like the &#8220;profiles&#8221; on my mobile phone so these things can be better customised.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Techies among you may be wondering if I&#8217;m disappointed by the lack of &#8220;multi-tasking&#8221;; that is, does it bother me that I can only run one app at a time and can&#8217;t have things running in the background?  The answer is no, but I&#8217;m not sure why.  I suppose it would be good to have, say, a Twitter client running in the background checking for new Tweets and alerting me.  But the truth is I don&#8217;t miss multi-tasking and it probably means that the apps that you do run run very quick.  Plus, switching apps is so quick that I don&#8217;t think it has the illusion of multi-tasking.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Summing Up<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I toyed with the idea of using the money from my headphones prize to buy a decent smart phone, but they were all too expensive.  I looked at iPhones too&#8230;WAY to expensive.  And yet, having used this device; having had it become indispensable, take over my life and change my whole notion of what it means to be &#8220;connected&#8221;, having realised that, actually, device convergance CAN be done and be done well; I find myself completely understanding those who pay over-the-odds for an iPhone.  The addition of a camera, phone and GPS would only serve to make this device more indispensable, it would complete the convergence by removing at least two other gadgets from my stash.<\/p>\n<p>I should emphasise that the iPod Touch is not just pretty, fast, slick.  It does a whole heap of useful stuff too.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s a downside to all this amazing electronic and software wizardry.<\/p>\n<p>I watched the Disney Pixar film Wall-E the other day (also highly recommended!) and there are some people in it who&#8217;ve become so immersed in portable video screens, so hooked into remote, electronic communication, and so pampered by robots and machines, that they&#8217;ve lost the simple pleasures of holding a hand, having a conversation, staring in awe at the stars, and working as a team to achieve something good.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, even for us, it&#8217;s SO easy to become immersed in technology and let ut rule us.  My iPod has taken over somewhat.  I&#8217;m slightly addicted to being so incredibly hooked up to the global internet, and perhaps a little at risk of forsaking the delights of the real world: walks in the country, sitting reading a book in the sunshine, conversing over a cup of coffee.  Technology is great but it&#8217;s addictive and does remove us from reality somewhat.  There&#8217;s something about the pages of a newspaper that beats Google Reader in a qualitative way.  There&#8217;s something special about writing a letter rather than an email.  There&#8217;s a certain joy in carrying a notebook and pen and writing things down in your own hand for later reading.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, the iPod Touch is a phenomenal and, dare I say it, life changing device &#8211; I would guess that the iPhone is more so.  But it should come with a health warning and we should constantly remind ourselves that we need to stay hooked up to the real world too!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>We have a new church!<\/p>\n<p>Well, there&#8217;s no building, and no official organisation.\u00a0 There are people, but not many.\u00a0 We have a leader.\u00a0 We don&#8217;t have a regular meeting time, but we do meet.<\/p>\n<p>The primary focus of this group of people is, I suppose, two-fold: loving God, and loving our neighbours.\u00a0 We meet together to worship, to pray, and to learn.\u00a0 But we are also heavily involved in the local community, and most of our &#8220;notices&#8221; when we meet are about how we can use the things that we have to help that community; not by having &#8220;church&#8221; events, where we invite people in, but by going out and helping people and spending time with people.<\/p>\n<p>And you know what? It&#8217;s amazing!!<\/p>\n<p>Since I started following Jesus about 10 years ago I&#8217;ve had a sense that the traditional, meet-in-a-big-old-building-every-Sunday church wasn&#8217;t quite right.\u00a0 It fosters a great community of people, but takes up lots of time.<\/p>\n<p>I heard an interesting talk by a guy recently who had this idea of &#8220;third place&#8221;.\u00a0 He said that we only have time for three places: our home and neighbourhood, our place of work or study, and a &#8220;third place&#8221;.\u00a0 Perhaps this is a football team, or your surfing buddies or your knitting group or just friends you go for nights out with.\u00a0 He said that for most people in churches, the church is their &#8220;third place&#8221;, and they don&#8217;t really have room to be committed to another regular activity or group of people.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s certainly my experience &#8211; being in a traditional church meant being on rotas, meeting in smaller groups, preparing for the Sunday service in some way, and being involved in other, less regular church activities too.\u00a0 Most of my &#8220;spare&#8221; time was spent with people from the church.\u00a0 And this makes the church very insular.<\/p>\n<p>We try to follow the way of Jesus, and the way of Jesus was to meet and help the poor and outcast from society.\u00a0 In my experience, church leaves little time for a guy like me to do this.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus usually upset those who had &#8220;tradition&#8221; too close to their hearts by disagreeing with them or breaking their overly-pious rules.\u00a0 From what I read, his life wasn&#8217;t well planned around temple and synagogue times, though he went there to worship.\u00a0 No, he met people&#8217;s needs as and when they had them.<\/p>\n<p>The early church was like this too.\u00a0 They were generous, pooling resources to help the needy; they were spontaneous, dealing with people and talking to people that they met as they journeyed, not just amongst themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Where mid-week activities with our old church were things like practicing the music for Sunday, planning talks, or running small study groups.\u00a0 Now we&#8217;re planning community events and parties, organising games with the young people of the area, cooking meals for people in crisis, and meeting with council officials to work out how to get people involved in caring for the environment or using sustainable forms of transport.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong.\u00a0 The traditional church holds an enormously important place in the community.\u00a0 I love it, I value it, it&#8217;s been a huge and incredibly positive influence on my life and I&#8217;ve seen it be a huge and positive influence in the community too.\u00a0 The church worldwide has a huge army of people who volunteer in soup kitches, community projects, with children and young people, with people with disabilities, with the elderly, with the homeless, with the poor.\u00a0 The church contributes millions of pounds and hours to local and national charities and to overseas aid.\u00a0 It campaigns on climate change, international justice, human rights, fair trade, water and sanititation.\u00a0\u00a0 The church has its struggles internally and externally, with politics and squabbles, and it has bits of crappy history, bits of often-still-crappy present, and probably plenty of bits of crapness to come in the future.\u00a0 But I can guarantee you that without the traditional church this nation and this world would be a lot worse off.<\/p>\n<p>[I&#8217;ll add a note here acknowledging that the church isn&#8217;t the only source of good things&#8230;there are many, many people of other faiths, and of no faith, that work tirelessly for good causes too.\u00a0 The world would be worse off without Islam, without humanism, and without people who love and serve just because they feel they should too. These people and groups should also be praised and respected.]<\/p>\n<p>But my PERSONAL experience of traditional church was that I spent more time doing things for the church than for the community.\u00a0 Most of the community work was done by the elders and ministers, or by people not holding down full-time jobs or running families who could volunteer.\u00a0 The need for people to serve on a Sunday meant that most of the people didn&#8217;t have much time to do stuff in the community &#8211; the stuff that Jesus did!<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;services&#8221; at the church we&#8217;re in now require very little planning and involvement from the &#8220;congregation&#8221;, and we are therefore free to use more of our spare time actually doing good stuff.<\/p>\n<p>And doing the good stuff in the community gives us reason to worship, and to pray.\u00a0 When we come together we give thanks for the positive things we see happen in the community, we pray for those in need, and we talk about how we can bless others &#8211; not because we want them to like us, or to become part of our group &#8211; just because we value each and every human life.<\/p>\n<p>There are said to be 4 stages of working together: forming, storming, norming and performing.\u00a0 We&#8217;re still probably in the storming phase.\u00a0 As our little gathering grows and changes we will need to &#8220;norm&#8221;.\u00a0 We will need more structure and direction in what we&#8217;re doing.\u00a0 One challenge will be finding a balance between structure and freedom.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m convinced that this is how the church &#8211; the followers of Jesus &#8211; should be.\u00a0 OK&#8230;I refine that&#8230;it&#8217;s how I think a growing proportion of the church should be.\u00a0 Not putting all their efforts into showing kindness to each other, but supporting each other and pooling resources as we show kindness to those outside of the church.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s exciting, it&#8217;s a little scary, it&#8217;s fun, it&#8217;s inspiring, and it&#8217;s great to be a part of.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>We have a new church!<\/p>\n<p>Well, there&#8217;s no building, and no official organisation.\u00a0 There are people, but not many.\u00a0 We have a leader.\u00a0 We don&#8217;t have a regular meeting time, but we do meet.<\/p>\n<p>The primary focus of this group of people is, I suppose, two-fold: loving God, and loving our neighbours.\u00a0 We meet together to worship, to pray, and to learn.\u00a0 But we are also heavily involved in the local community, and most of our &#8220;notices&#8221; when we meet are about how we can use the things that we have to help that community; not by having &#8220;church&#8221; events, where we invite people in, but by going out and helping people and spending time with people.<\/p>\n<p>And you know what? It&#8217;s amazing!!<\/p>\n<p>Since I started following Jesus about 10 years ago I&#8217;ve had a sense that the traditional, meet-in-a-big-old-building-every-Sunday church wasn&#8217;t quite right.\u00a0 It fosters a great community of people, but takes up lots of time.<\/p>\n<p>I heard an interesting talk by a guy recently who had this idea of &#8220;third place&#8221;.\u00a0 He said that we only have time for three places: our home and neighbourhood, our place of work or study, and a &#8220;third place&#8221;.\u00a0 Perhaps this is a football team, or your surfing buddies or your knitting group or just friends you go for nights out with.\u00a0 He said that for most people in churches, the church is their &#8220;third place&#8221;, and they don&#8217;t really have room to be committed to another regular activity or group of people.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s certainly my experience &#8211; being in a traditional church meant being on rotas, meeting in smaller groups, preparing for the Sunday service in some way, and being involved in other, less regular church activities too.\u00a0 Most of my &#8220;spare&#8221; time was spent with people from the church.\u00a0 And this makes the church very insular.<\/p>\n<p>We try to follow the way of Jesus, and the way of Jesus was to meet and help the poor and outcast from society.\u00a0 In my experience, church leaves little time for a guy like me to do this.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus usually upset those who had &#8220;tradition&#8221; too close to their hearts by disagreeing with them or breaking their overly-pious rules.\u00a0 From what I read, his life wasn&#8217;t well planned around temple and synagogue times, though he went there to worship.\u00a0 No, he met people&#8217;s needs as and when they had them.<\/p>\n<p>The early church was like this too.\u00a0 They were generous, pooling resources to help the needy; they were spontaneous, dealing with people and talking to people that they met as they journeyed, not just amongst themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Where mid-week activities with our old church were things like practicing the music for Sunday, planning talks, or running small study groups.\u00a0 Now we&#8217;re planning community events and parties, organising games with the young people of the area, cooking meals for people in crisis, and meeting with council officials to work out how to get people involved in caring for the environment or using sustainable forms of transport.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong.\u00a0 The traditional church holds an enormously important place in the community.\u00a0 I love it, I value it, it&#8217;s been a huge and incredibly positive influence on my life and I&#8217;ve seen it be a huge and positive influence in the community too.\u00a0 The church worldwide has a huge army of people who volunteer in soup kitches, community projects, with children and young people, with people with disabilities, with the elderly, with the homeless, with the poor.\u00a0 The church contributes millions of pounds and hours to local and national charities and to overseas aid.\u00a0 It campaigns on climate change, international justice, human rights, fair trade, water and sanititation.\u00a0\u00a0 The church has its struggles internally and externally, with politics and squabbles, and it has bits of crappy history, bits of often-still-crappy present, and probably plenty of bits of crapness to come in the future.\u00a0 But I can guarantee you that without the traditional church this nation and this world would be a lot worse off.<\/p>\n<p>[I&#8217;ll add a note here acknowledging that the church isn&#8217;t the only source of good things&#8230;there are many, many people of other faiths, and of no faith, that work tirelessly for good causes too.\u00a0 The world would be worse off without Islam, without humanism, and without people who love and serve just because they feel they should too. These people and groups should also be praised and respected.]<\/p>\n<p>But my PERSONAL experience of traditional church was that I spent more time doing things for the church than for the community.\u00a0 Most of the community work was done by the elders and ministers, or by people not holding down full-time jobs or running families who could volunteer.\u00a0 The need for people to serve on a Sunday meant that most of the people didn&#8217;t have much time to do stuff in the community &#8211; the stuff that Jesus did!<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;services&#8221; at the church we&#8217;re in now require very little planning and involvement from the &#8220;congregation&#8221;, and we are therefore free to use more of our spare time actually doing good stuff.<\/p>\n<p>And doing the good stuff in the community gives us reason to worship, and to pray.\u00a0 When we come together we give thanks for the positive things we see happen in the community, we pray for those in need, and we talk about how we can bless others &#8211; not because we want them to like us, or to become part of our group &#8211; just because we value each and every human life.<\/p>\n<p>There are said to be 4 stages of working together: forming, storming, norming and performing.\u00a0 We&#8217;re still probably in the storming phase.\u00a0 As our little gathering grows and changes we will need to &#8220;norm&#8221;.\u00a0 We will need more structure and direction in what we&#8217;re doing.\u00a0 One challenge will be finding a balance between structure and freedom.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m convinced that this is how the church &#8211; the followers of Jesus &#8211; should be.\u00a0 OK&#8230;I refine that&#8230;it&#8217;s how I think a growing proportion of the church should be.\u00a0 Not putting all their efforts into showing kindness to each other, but supporting each other and pooling resources as we show kindness to those outside of the church.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s exciting, it&#8217;s a little scary, it&#8217;s fun, it&#8217;s inspiring, and it&#8217;s great to be a part of.<\/p>\n",

Yeah, that&#8217;s right, no one should earn that much when people in the world are homeless, starving, without sanitation, lacking health facilities, dying from HIV and AIDS. \u00a0It&#8217;s obscene. \u00a0So come up with some creative ways to share the wealth around. \u00a0And stop those dishonest people tax-dodging too &#8211; they work and do business in this country so they should pay like everyone else. \u00a0 I do my bit &#8211; they need to do theirs. \u00a0And in case you&#8217;re wondering, I count myself as rich, so&#8230;as long as you&#8217;re going to do something good &#8211; I mean, ethical, generous, caring, clever, or just &#8211; with it, I don&#8217;t mind paying some extra.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Of course, any attempts you make to improve the cycling infrastructure, sort out our crappy, overcrowded and expensive trains, and get people out of their cars and using sustainable transport will help too&#8230;particularly the cycling infrastructure bits.<\/p>\n<p>So, it&#8217;s up to you. \u00a0The Honourable Michael Wills MP is going and you might be next. \u00a0Do you want me hassling you with pleading letters, or telling all my friends to vote for you because you&#8217;re fantastic?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>A general election is looming in the not too distant future. \u00a0I was highly disappointed with the commitments made and the messages sent out at the party conferences this summer, so, if any politicians are reading, here&#8217;s what you need to do to win my vote:<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Something radical on climate change<\/strong>. \u00a0Let&#8217;s stop messing around and take this seriously. \u00a0Creating a future UK \u00a0sustainable energy infrastructure is going to take time and we need to start investing in it now. \u00a0Not only will this reduce our carbon emissions, but it will give us energy security and, in the long term, cheap, electricity. \u00a0We can&#8217;t not do something about this. \u00a0We need emissions cuts, we need investment in sustainables, we need to provide aid to the developing world who are fighting the effects now, and we need to incentives for individuals and businesses to make changes too. \u00a0And yes, I am willing to pay for this out of my taxes (as long as you MP&#8217;s start taking your jobs, and the electorate seriously and stop blatently and flagrantly wasting our money on your own luxuries and then trying to defend yourselves).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stop bickering and tell me what you&#8217;re going to do<\/strong>. \u00a0In the run up to the last local elections, the leaflets that Labour and the Conservatives were sending us were just being nasty to each other. \u00a0I don&#8217;t want my MP to be nasty. \u00a0I want him to be positive, encouraging, honest and wholehearted. \u00a0I&#8217;d like the parties to work together for the common good, so if a policy of the other party is good, say so. \u00a0I don&#8217;t want to hear why everyone is rubbish &#8211; I end up with the impression that all politicians, regardless of party, are rubbish. \u00a0Tell me why you are good! \u00a0Oh, and if you&#8217;re a smaller party or an independant, please send me something or you won&#8217;t stand a chance either!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Be like Robin Hood<\/strong>. \u00a0Yeah, seriously, take from the rich and give to the poor. \u00a0The CEO of my employer earned something like 9 million quid this year. \u00a0HOW MUCH?! Yeah, that&#8217;s right, no one should earn that much when people in the world are homeless, starving, without sanitation, lacking health facilities, dying from HIV and AIDS. \u00a0It&#8217;s obscene. \u00a0So come up with some creative ways to share the wealth around. \u00a0And stop those dishonest people tax-dodging too &#8211; they work and do business in this country so they should pay like everyone else. \u00a0 I do my bit &#8211; they need to do theirs. \u00a0And in case you&#8217;re wondering, I count myself as rich, so&#8230;as long as you&#8217;re going to do something good &#8211; I mean, ethical, generous, caring, clever, or just &#8211; with it, I don&#8217;t mind paying some extra.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Of course, any attempts you make to improve the cycling infrastructure, sort out our crappy, overcrowded and expensive trains, and get people out of their cars and using sustainable transport will help too&#8230;particularly the cycling infrastructure bits.<\/p>\n<p>So, it&#8217;s up to you. \u00a0The Honourable Michael Wills MP is going and you might be next. \u00a0Do you want me hassling you with pleading letters, or telling all my friends to vote for you because you&#8217;re fantastic?<\/p>\n",

One unlit, one highly visible.<\/li>\n<li>One high-vis female cyclist cycling up the inside of a queue of traffic, then switching through a tiny gap onto the outside and zooming off.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I can almost understand the young lad on the BMX.  He&#8217;s just a kid: young and reckless.  In some ways it&#8217;s good that he&#8217;s on a bike.  But does he know how dangerous it is to be unseen?<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But what about the grown-ups in high-vis clothing and lycra doing dangerous and annoying stuff?  Yes, I confess, when I&#8217;m a driver lane splitting annoys me. And as a pedestrian, pavement-cycling annoys me.\u00a0 Perhaps they think that being hi-vis means they&#8217;re allowed to go wherever they like on the road because they&#8217;re safe, but being seen is complementary to being sensible, not a substitute for it.<\/p>\n<p>And what&#8217;s with the cycling on the pavement?  Do they think that because they can&#8217;t go on the road it&#8217;s OK to cycle on the pavement?<\/p>\n<p>Oooh, look, I&#8217;ve gone all <a title=\"The Lycra louts: MPs call for curbs on cyclists who put lives at risk\" href=\"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-1222067\/The-Lycra-louts-MPs-curbs-cyclists-lives-risk.html\" target=\"_blank\">Daily Mail<\/a>!!<\/p>\n<p>The point is that sometimes cyclists do themselves no favours at all.  They should remember that they&#8217;re small and hard to see.  They need to make their actions obvious and predictable to drivers, not behave erratically.  I work on the principle that if I want to be treated like a proper vehicle then I need to behave like one too.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Piracy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While we&#8217;re on the topic of otherwise-law-abiding-citizens exercising their &#8220;rights&#8221; regardless of whether or not it contravenes the law.  Why is it that pleasant, professional, grown-up people, think it&#8217;s OK and normal, if not highly amusing, to commit the crime of piracy?<\/p>\n<p>This week saw some people I know whingeing that their <a title=\"BBC NEWS | Technology | Microsoft disconnects Xbox gamers\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/8354166.stm\" target=\"_blank\">X-Boxes got locked out of X-Box live<\/a> because they&#8217;d hacked them to play pirated games.  Of course, piracy is theft and they should think themselves lucky they&#8217;re not in court and quit moaning about it.<\/p>\n<p>Plenty of people who pirate films, TV programmes, music, and software in this country  can actually afford to buy DVDs, CDs, MP3s, etc.  I&#8217;ve been offered stuff in the past and I&#8217;ve really wanted to tell the offere that I don&#8217;t want it because it&#8217;s illegal, but I feel like I&#8217;ll be laughed at, so I just make excuses about not wanting the content.<\/p>\n<p>Why do people do this?\u00a0 Just because you CAN file share, hack your console and pass around sound and video files everyone thinks it&#8217;s a perfectly acceptable thing to do.  Well, it&#8217;s not.\u00a0 They wouldn&#8217;t steal a media player from Currys so why do they steal the media that goes on it?<\/p>\n<p>I feel like the rebel for obeying the law.\u00a0 That&#8217;s not right is it?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bad Cyclist\/Good Cyclist Part 2<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Northern cities are cool places.  My train back was delayed, but it was kinda good to hang out in the station for a bit. In some ways the station environment is full of annoying, rapidly repeating stuff intended for the hurried traveller, but in other ways a busy station is a great place to observe human behaviour and fashion.<\/p>\n<p>There were lots of people on bikes in the city and a lot of them were using the station.  I was particularly eyeing up two customised fixed-wheel bikes.  Unbranded, black, sleek, simple city bikes.  They looked sharp, fast, elegant.  Bike envy?  I don&#8217;t know what you mean.<\/p>\n<p>There was also a short, fat guy in an orange suit.  I&#8217;m not sure that counted as fashion, but he seemed to be expressing the spirit and freedom that seems to be present in big northern cities.\u00a0 I was reminded recently that &#8220;Zeitgeist&#8221; means &#8220;Spirit of the Times&#8221; &#8211; literally &#8220;Time Ghost&#8221;.\u00a0 Perhaps the Germans would call my experience up North one of Platzgeist?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Had a trip to a big northern city this week which left me with some thoughts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bad Cyclist\/Good Cyclist Part 1<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On my walk to Swindon station I saw some pretty bad cycling:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>One kid in dark clothes weaving his way up a residential street unlit and showing no recognition of the three or four cars that were also on the road.<\/li>\n<li>Two cyclists committing the offence of riding on the pavement because the road was one-way and they wanted to go the other way.  One unlit, one highly visible.<\/li>\n<li>One high-vis female cyclist cycling up the inside of a queue of traffic, then switching through a tiny gap onto the outside and zooming off.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I can almost understand the young lad on the BMX.  He&#8217;s just a kid: young and reckless.  In some ways it&#8217;s good that he&#8217;s on a bike.  But does he know how dangerous it is to be unseen?<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But what about the grown-ups in high-vis clothing and lycra doing dangerous and annoying stuff?  Yes, I confess, when I&#8217;m a driver lane splitting annoys me. And as a pedestrian, pavement-cycling annoys me.\u00a0 Perhaps they think that being hi-vis means they&#8217;re allowed to go wherever they like on the road because they&#8217;re safe, but being seen is complementary to being sensible, not a substitute for it.<\/p>\n<p>And what&#8217;s with the cycling on the pavement?  Do they think that because they can&#8217;t go on the road it&#8217;s OK to cycle on the pavement?<\/p>\n<p>Oooh, look, I&#8217;ve gone all <a title=\"The Lycra louts: MPs call for curbs on cyclists who put lives at risk\" href=\"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-1222067\/The-Lycra-louts-MPs-curbs-cyclists-lives-risk.html\" target=\"_blank\">Daily Mail<\/a>!!<\/p>\n<p>The point is that sometimes cyclists do themselves no favours at all.  They should remember that they&#8217;re small and hard to see.  They need to make their actions obvious and predictable to drivers, not behave erratically.  I work on the principle that if I want to be treated like a proper vehicle then I need to behave like one too.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Piracy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While we&#8217;re on the topic of otherwise-law-abiding-citizens exercising their &#8220;rights&#8221; regardless of whether or not it contravenes the law.  Why is it that pleasant, professional, grown-up people, think it&#8217;s OK and normal, if not highly amusing, to commit the crime of piracy?<\/p>\n<p>This week saw some people I know whingeing that their <a title=\"BBC NEWS | Technology | Microsoft disconnects Xbox gamers\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/8354166.stm\" target=\"_blank\">X-Boxes got locked out of X-Box live<\/a> because they&#8217;d hacked them to play pirated games.  Of course, piracy is theft and they should think themselves lucky they&#8217;re not in court and quit moaning about it.<\/p>\n<p>Plenty of people who pirate films, TV programmes, music, and software in this country  can actually afford to buy DVDs, CDs, MP3s, etc.  I&#8217;ve been offered stuff in the past and I&#8217;ve really wanted to tell the offere that I don&#8217;t want it because it&#8217;s illegal, but I feel like I&#8217;ll be laughed at, so I just make excuses about not wanting the content.<\/p>\n<p>Why do people do this?\u00a0 Just because you CAN file share, hack your console and pass around sound and video files everyone thinks it&#8217;s a perfectly acceptable thing to do.  Well, it&#8217;s not.\u00a0 They wouldn&#8217;t steal a media player from Currys so why do they steal the media that goes on it?<\/p>\n<p>I feel like the rebel for obeying the law.\u00a0 That&#8217;s not right is it?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bad Cyclist\/Good Cyclist Part 2<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Northern cities are cool places.  My train back was delayed, but it was kinda good to hang out in the station for a bit. In some ways the station environment is full of annoying, rapidly repeating stuff intended for the hurried traveller, but in other ways a busy station is a great place to observe human behaviour and fashion.<\/p>\n<p>There were lots of people on bikes in the city and a lot of them were using the station.  I was particularly eyeing up two customised fixed-wheel bikes.  Unbranded, black, sleek, simple city bikes.  They looked sharp, fast, elegant.  Bike envy?  I don&#8217;t know what you mean.<\/p>\n<p>There was also a short, fat guy in an orange suit.  I&#8217;m not sure that counted as fashion, but he seemed to be expressing the spirit and freedom that seems to be present in big northern cities.\u00a0 I was reminded recently that &#8220;Zeitgeist&#8221; means &#8220;Spirit of the Times&#8221; &#8211; literally &#8220;Time Ghost&#8221;.\u00a0 Perhaps the Germans would call my experience up North one of Platzgeist?<\/p>\n",

I think it&#8217;s fine to tell off red light runners, lane splitters and pavement cyclists because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don&#8217;t do those things.<\/li>\n<li>They are dangerous and, in most cases, illegal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I think bad cycling causes people to dislike cyclists and makes cycling less safe.  Though I have no stats to back this up.<\/p>\n<p>However, cycling in general should be encouraged. Does this mean that bad cycling should be encouraged? Well, put it this way: I would rather encounter a bad cyclist than a bad driver on the road.  The former is always safer.<\/p>\n<p>Thursday evening&#8217;s activity, that prompted my tweet, was a talk by a man from Sustrans organised by a local group that are working to create a better Swindon.<\/p>\n<p>The talk was fascinating as the Sustrans man outlined the need for cycling, the benefits of cycling, and the obstacles to cycling.\u00a0 There was plenty of science and statistics, lots of photos demonstrating possible improvements to cycling infrastructure, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>There then followed a question and answer session.\u00a0 During which I slowly boiled.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been thinking that such a group of people would be excited by the possibilities of bettering people&#8217;s health, reducing congestion in the town and allowing people to see more of the place by encouraging them to get outdoors.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;no.\u00a0 The questions were mostly asking the Sustrans man why cyclists and cycling cause so much trouble.\u00a0 Why don&#8217;t people have lights, or bells?\u00a0 Why do people cycle on pavements?\u00a0 Why isn&#8217;t there a cycle path where the council have been promising one?\u00a0 I sensed that most of the group thought that cyclists were reckless and that the idea of getting more cyclists on bikes was a dream if not a bad idea in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>So my reason for being annoyed at bad cycling is somewhat validated.\u00a0 A lot of people don&#8217;t like cyclists because they break the law and aren&#8217;t courteous to other road users and pedestrians.\u00a0 Is this fair?\u00a0 Or is it a stereotype that&#8217;s applied too sweepingly?\u00a0 I suspect bits of both.\u00a0 In any case, it seems that we have work to do to convince people that, not only is cycling safe for the cyclist, but that it&#8217;s safe for everyone else too!<\/p>\n<p>I should add that at no point was it pointed out that cars break the rules too and that&#8217;s a LOT more dangerous.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s OK to criticise bad cycling, if you&#8217;re doing it from the point of view of wanting to change that and make the roads better, more friendly, safer places.\u00a0 The poor Sustrans man was asked about loads of things that aren&#8217;t his fault, and I was annoyed that the group didn&#8217;t take the opportunity to ask him what we can do to support Sustrans&#8217; work.<\/p>\n<p>After all, it seems they have a lot of work to do.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>It was interesting, after <a title=\"A Little Trip\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/11\/11\/a-little-trip\/\" target=\"_blank\">my rant at misbehaving cyclists<\/a>, to find myself angered by people who rant at misbehaving cyclists on Thursday.\u00a0 For the record I Tweeted: &#8220;Why why WHY invite a nice man from Sustrans to come and talk to you about the importance of cycling and then rant at him about bad cycling?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This may sound like hypocrisy, but let me explain.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>My frustrations with misbehaving cyclists stem from the fact the cyclists get a bad reputation. I think it&#8217;s fine to tell off red light runners, lane splitters and pavement cyclists because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don&#8217;t do those things.<\/li>\n<li>They are dangerous and, in most cases, illegal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I think bad cycling causes people to dislike cyclists and makes cycling less safe.  Though I have no stats to back this up.<\/p>\n<p>However, cycling in general should be encouraged. Does this mean that bad cycling should be encouraged? Well, put it this way: I would rather encounter a bad cyclist than a bad driver on the road.  The former is always safer.<\/p>\n<p>Thursday evening&#8217;s activity, that prompted my tweet, was a talk by a man from Sustrans organised by a local group that are working to create a better Swindon.<\/p>\n<p>The talk was fascinating as the Sustrans man outlined the need for cycling, the benefits of cycling, and the obstacles to cycling.\u00a0 There was plenty of science and statistics, lots of photos demonstrating possible improvements to cycling infrastructure, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>There then followed a question and answer session.\u00a0 During which I slowly boiled.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been thinking that such a group of people would be excited by the possibilities of bettering people&#8217;s health, reducing congestion in the town and allowing people to see more of the place by encouraging them to get outdoors.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;no.\u00a0 The questions were mostly asking the Sustrans man why cyclists and cycling cause so much trouble.\u00a0 Why don&#8217;t people have lights, or bells?\u00a0 Why do people cycle on pavements?\u00a0 Why isn&#8217;t there a cycle path where the council have been promising one?\u00a0 I sensed that most of the group thought that cyclists were reckless and that the idea of getting more cyclists on bikes was a dream if not a bad idea in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>So my reason for being annoyed at bad cycling is somewhat validated.\u00a0 A lot of people don&#8217;t like cyclists because they break the law and aren&#8217;t courteous to other road users and pedestrians.\u00a0 Is this fair?\u00a0 Or is it a stereotype that&#8217;s applied too sweepingly?\u00a0 I suspect bits of both.\u00a0 In any case, it seems that we have work to do to convince people that, not only is cycling safe for the cyclist, but that it&#8217;s safe for everyone else too!<\/p>\n<p>I should add that at no point was it pointed out that cars break the rules too and that&#8217;s a LOT more dangerous.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s OK to criticise bad cycling, if you&#8217;re doing it from the point of view of wanting to change that and make the roads better, more friendly, safer places.\u00a0 The poor Sustrans man was asked about loads of things that aren&#8217;t his fault, and I was annoyed that the group didn&#8217;t take the opportunity to ask him what we can do to support Sustrans&#8217; work.<\/p>\n<p>After all, it seems they have a lot of work to do.<\/p>\n",
