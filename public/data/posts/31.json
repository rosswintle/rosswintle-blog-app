So I spent some of my Christmas money on these. \u00a0There&#8217;s a pair of them, and a sub-woofer too.

I don&#8217;t feel like I can take all of the actions I get, and so I end up ignoring most of them, and probably missing something that I consider really important.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been thinking about making my own campaigning more focused: choosing one or two causes or charities, and making sure that I&#8217;m signed up and take action for those causes.  But&#8230;which ones to choose?<\/p>\n<p>I was reading the latest issue of Tearfund&#8217;s newsletter, &#8216;Tear Times\u2019 over Christmas, and an article on the issue of hunger really caught my eye.<\/p>\n<p>Hunger affects one in every seven people on the planet. 925 million people go to bed hungry tonight. It&#8217;s a massive issue that causes so much pain and suffering.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also constantly troubled by the issue of water and sanitation.<\/p>\n<p>Food and water are two things that I totally take for granted. I have vastly more than I need of both, and I can&#8217;t imagine what life is like without them.<\/p>\n<p>The causes of hunger include climate change, corruption, and greed.<\/p>\n<p>The impact of hunger, water and sanitation reaches into issues of health, education, crime, street children and general poverty.<\/p>\n<p>So to fix it, we need to tackle lots of other things. But fixing it helps improve lots of other things too.<\/p>\n<p>However, I also think it&#8217;s a fixable issue. With better trade and distribution, and with training, tools and technologies, we can feed everyone on the planet.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have stats and facts for all of those things, but that all seems pretty obvious to me.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, there are things wrong in our country: with energy and transport policy, with the tax system, with corporate greed, with banking, with privatisation.<\/p>\n<p>There are big global problems too: trade issues, climate change, debt, war, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>But these things just don&#8217;t seem important when you consider that there are people who don&#8217;t have food to eat or water to drink.<\/p>\n<p>From what I read, Tearfund and a group of other charities are putting together some new campaigning around hunger for 2013.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to focus my campaigning there. I&#8217;m going to write to my MP about hunger. I&#8217;m going to send whatever postcards or letters I get to whatever people in power seem important on the issue.<\/p>\n<p>I will pray, I will give, I will read and I will share.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps you&#8217;ll join me?<\/p>\n<p>The plans for 2013 don&#8217;t seem to be firm yet, but <a href=\u201dhttp:\/\/www.tearfund.org\/en\/get_involved\/campaign\/hunger\/\u201d>here&#8217;s an action you can start with<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m going to focus my support on Tearfund. As a Christian, I support the foundations and basis of their work and I like that its a charity I can connect with at a spiritual as well as practical level.  I know them well and I&#8217;m privileged to do some bits of  <\/p>\n<p>work for them. I think their approach to aid and development is effective and sustainable. I believe in what they&#8217;re doing and I trust them.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t care for or support other charities or campaigns. I just think that my campaigning energy is better if its focused rather than diluted.  Of course I&#8217;ll stay up to date with other organisations and campaigns, but hunger and water will be my focus, and Tearfund will be my charity if choice.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s to a great year of focused campaigning!  I&#8217;ll try and keep you updated.<\/p>\n",

But&#8230;which ones to choose?<\/p>\n<p>I was reading the latest issue of Tearfund&#8217;s newsletter, &#8216;Tear Times\u2019 over Christmas, and an article on the issue of hunger really caught my eye.<\/p>\n<p>Hunger affects one in every seven people on the planet. 925 million people go to bed hungry tonight. It&#8217;s a massive issue that causes so much pain and suffering.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also constantly troubled by the issue of water and sanitation.<\/p>\n<p>Food and water are two things that I totally take for granted. I have vastly more than I need of both, and I can&#8217;t imagine what life is like without them.<\/p>\n<p>The causes of hunger include climate change, corruption, and greed.<\/p>\n<p>The impact of hunger, water and sanitation reaches into issues of health, education, crime, street children and general poverty.<\/p>\n<p>So to fix it, we need to tackle lots of other things. But fixing it helps improve lots of other things too.<\/p>\n<p>However, I also think it&#8217;s a fixable issue. With better trade and distribution, and with training, tools and technologies, we can feed everyone on the planet.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have stats and facts for all of those things, but that all seems pretty obvious to me.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, there are things wrong in our country: with energy and transport policy, with the tax system, with corporate greed, with banking, with privatisation.<\/p>\n<p>There are big global problems too: trade issues, climate change, debt, war, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>But these things just don&#8217;t seem important when you consider that there are people who don&#8217;t have food to eat or water to drink.<\/p>\n<p>From what I read, Tearfund and a group of other charities are putting together some new campaigning around hunger for 2013.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to focus my campaigning there. I&#8217;m going to write to my MP about hunger. I&#8217;m going to send whatever postcards or letters I get to whatever people in power seem important on the issue.<\/p>\n<p>I will pray, I will give, I will read and I will share.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps you&#8217;ll join me?<\/p>\n<p>The plans for 2013 don&#8217;t seem to be firm yet, but <a href=\u201dhttp:\/\/www.tearfund.org\/en\/get_involved\/campaign\/hunger\/\u201d>here&#8217;s an action you can start with<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m going to focus my support on Tearfund. As a Christian, I support the foundations and basis of their work and I like that its a charity I can connect with at a spiritual as well as practical level.  I know them well and I&#8217;m privileged to do some bits of  <\/p>\n<p>work for them. I think their approach to aid and development is effective and sustainable. I believe in what they&#8217;re doing and I trust them.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t care for or support other charities or campaigns. I just think that my campaigning energy is better if its focused rather than diluted.  Of course I&#8217;ll stay up to date with other organisations and campaigns, but hunger and water will be my focus, and Tearfund will be my charity if choice.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s to a great year of focused campaigning!  I&#8217;ll try and keep you updated.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>After minimising my Facebook presence and deleting all my Instagram photos I wanted to explain a bit more why I&#8217;ve done those things. I&#8217;m finding it quite hard to articulate succinctly, but I&#8217;ll give it a go anyway.<\/p>\n<p>I know that Instagram have <a href=\u201dhttp:\/\/blog.instagram.com\/post\/38421250999\/updated-terms-of-service-based-on-your-feedback\u201d>backtracked on their new terms and conditions<\/a> around what they will do with user&#8217;s photos but the Instagram terms outrage was just the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back, and the truth is that winding down my Facebook presence has been on the cards for a while.<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s wrong with Facebook?<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s get one thing clear: I understand the free service model where I am the product, where my data and usage patterns are used to send me adverts, and I understand that online services need a royalty-free license to publish some of my data in order to work.  Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and Google, all work like this.  I accept these as things that need to be for social networks to exist.<\/p>\n<p>My objection is more about how the services operate. And I think this falls into two categories: usefulness, and trust.<\/p>\n<h2>Usefulness<\/h2>\n<p>The most obvious thing is that I just don&#8217;t find Facebook very useful. Or at least, its usefulness is obscured or hampered by clutter.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook does so much, you can like so many pages and be member of so many groups, and use so many apps that it just gets full of stuff. Notifications get out of control and get ignored as a result. And then they chuck in adverts and promoted posts which further obscure the content that you really want to see.<\/p>\n<p>And the content&#8230;the content! Facebook have algorithms that determine &#8216;importance&#8217; of posts. That &#8216;importance&#8217; is used to decide what I see. But the whole system is flawed.<\/p>\n<p>One reason importance is flawed is that people can pay Facebook to promote posts to me, which means I&#8217;m seeing what other people deem is important, not what I deem important.<\/p>\n<p>But also, it seems that Facebook prioritises content with images, media or links, popular content, and content from people that post a lot.  But what about the one, short, text-only post from a friend who only posts twice a year telling me that they&#8217;re engaged? That&#8217;s one of the most important things! And I fear it is lost.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook also continue to insist that I want to see things ordered by its own weird idea of importance, rather than chronologically. Which I don&#8217;t!<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t even see every post from every page that I follow, which kinda makes following pages, and posting as pages, a bit pointless.<\/p>\n<p>And then there&#8217;s all the information passed my way that I simply don&#8217;t want: the app requests; the suggested people and pages; the high volume of junk and low value content (you know &#8211; the things that used to be circular emails).<\/p>\n<p>Facebook can be used to communicate, but, as I&#8217;ve said before, it&#8217;s primarily an advertising tool, not a communications tool. (See <a href=\u201dhttp:\/\/mashable.com\/2012\/12\/21\/facebook-makes-money-off-you\/\u201d> this very recent article<\/a> for more on this)<\/p>\n<h2>Trust<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook has a bad reputation around privacy. They&#8217;ve changed the settings on numerous occasions and, to be honest, the privacy settings are so complicated that its hard to know who can see what.<\/p>\n<p>They <a href=\u201dhttp:\/\/blogs.which.co.uk\/technology\/computing\/facebooks-new-privacy-settings-what-you-need-to-know\/\u201d>recently decided that all profiles would be searchable<\/a> too.<\/p>\n<p>But also, I feel like Facebook takes advantage of me and, worse, of people who pay far less attention to their activities than I do.<\/p>\n<p>The Instagram outrage was a prime example of this. It&#8217;s not like they tried to sneak the new conditions through &#8211; they were very open about the changes. But I did feel like they hoped that people wouldn&#8217;t really read them and would accept them regardless.  Maybe there&#8217;s truth in that, or maybe that&#8217;s my own perception formed through my existing mistrust of them.<\/p>\n<p>I also feel like Facebook sneak lots of things past me: advertising and promoted posts, privacy and terms changes, user interface changes, collection and use of huge amounts of information about me as I browse the web.<\/p>\n<p>I even feel like the whole nature of Facebook carries a certain risk. Because you share with people you have &#8216;friended&#8217;, it feels like a closed, almost private system. And that lures you into this sense of security. And so you feel like you can post more personal things, without necessarily considering the consequences. It&#8217;s easy to forget who is your friend on Facebook: who&#8217;s going to see that photo, read that status, or spot that action you took in the \u2019ticker\u2019. <\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s easy to grant permissions to an app that it doesn&#8217;t really need. Spotify was a prime example when, for a time, it required a Facebook account. I just don&#8217;t want Facebook knowing my listening habits!<\/p>\n<p>I will write more about the privacy around photos specifically in another post, but photos, specifically, feel more personal. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve deleted them.<\/p>\n<h2>Alternatives<\/h2>\n<p>People will say: \u2019But you still use Twitter, your blog, Google+, aren&#8217;t they as bad?&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Possibly. But remember that I accept the terms of use. And, for the time being, their services are more useful (dare I say \u2019better\u2019?); their data collection and advertising isn&#8217;t as intrusive; and I feel I trust them more.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter, in particular, which I continue to use a lot, feels different. It&#8217;s open. Anyone can read what I post, so I think harder about what I post and am more careful.  Twitter has some issues too, which I\u2019ll also write about another time, but I just feel like I know what I&#8217;m getting with Twitter.<\/p>\n<h2>And so&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>So Facebook, that&#8217;s why I\u2019m cutting down on how I use you. I do fear that I&#8217;ll miss out. Man people I know use Facebook as their main communications tool. I could miss out on real world events, real messages, really interesting updates about people&#8217;s lives. But you&#8217;re just not a tool that&#8217;s suited to communicating with my friends.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not quite goodbye: I&#8217;ll still post sometimes, like, comment and converse. But it&#8217;s certainly a step away.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>After minimising my Facebook presence and deleting all my Instagram photos I wanted to explain a bit more why I&#8217;ve done those things. I&#8217;m finding it quite hard to articulate succinctly, but I&#8217;ll give it a go anyway.<\/p>\n<p>I know that Instagram have <a href=\u201dhttp:\/\/blog.instagram.com\/post\/38421250999\/updated-terms-of-service-based-on-your-feedback\u201d>backtracked on their new terms and conditions<\/a> around what they will do with user&#8217;s photos but the Instagram terms outrage was just the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back, and the truth is that winding down my Facebook presence has been on the cards for a while.<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s wrong with Facebook?<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s get one thing clear: I understand the free service model where I am the product, where my data and usage patterns are used to send me adverts, and I understand that online services need a royalty-free license to publish some of my data in order to work.  Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and Google, all work like this.  I accept these as things that need to be for social networks to exist.<\/p>\n<p>My objection is more about how the services operate. And I think this falls into two categories: usefulness, and trust.<\/p>\n<h2>Usefulness<\/h2>\n<p>The most obvious thing is that I just don&#8217;t find Facebook very useful. Or at least, its usefulness is obscured or hampered by clutter.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook does so much, you can like so many pages and be member of so many groups, and use so many apps that it just gets full of stuff. Notifications get out of control and get ignored as a result. And then they chuck in adverts and promoted posts which further obscure the content that you really want to see.<\/p>\n<p>And the content&#8230;the content! Facebook have algorithms that determine &#8216;importance&#8217; of posts. That &#8216;importance&#8217; is used to decide what I see. But the whole system is flawed.<\/p>\n<p>One reason importance is flawed is that people can pay Facebook to promote posts to me, which means I&#8217;m seeing what other people deem is important, not what I deem important.<\/p>\n<p>But also, it seems that Facebook prioritises content with images, media or links, popular content, and content from people that post a lot.  But what about the one, short, text-only post from a friend who only posts twice a year telling me that they&#8217;re engaged? That&#8217;s one of the most important things! And I fear it is lost.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook also continue to insist that I want to see things ordered by its own weird idea of importance, rather than chronologically. Which I don&#8217;t!<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t even see every post from every page that I follow, which kinda makes following pages, and posting as pages, a bit pointless.<\/p>\n<p>And then there&#8217;s all the information passed my way that I simply don&#8217;t want: the app requests; the suggested people and pages; the high volume of junk and low value content (you know &#8211; the things that used to be circular emails).<\/p>\n<p>Facebook can be used to communicate, but, as I&#8217;ve said before, it&#8217;s primarily an advertising tool, not a communications tool. (See <a href=\u201dhttp:\/\/mashable.com\/2012\/12\/21\/facebook-makes-money-off-you\/\u201d> this very recent article<\/a> for more on this)<\/p>\n<h2>Trust<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook has a bad reputation around privacy. They&#8217;ve changed the settings on numerous occasions and, to be honest, the privacy settings are so complicated that its hard to know who can see what.<\/p>\n<p>They <a href=\u201dhttp:\/\/blogs.which.co.uk\/technology\/computing\/facebooks-new-privacy-settings-what-you-need-to-know\/\u201d>recently decided that all profiles would be searchable<\/a> too.<\/p>\n<p>But also, I feel like Facebook takes advantage of me and, worse, of people who pay far less attention to their activities than I do.<\/p>\n<p>The Instagram outrage was a prime example of this. It&#8217;s not like they tried to sneak the new conditions through &#8211; they were very open about the changes. But I did feel like they hoped that people wouldn&#8217;t really read them and would accept them regardless.  Maybe there&#8217;s truth in that, or maybe that&#8217;s my own perception formed through my existing mistrust of them.<\/p>\n<p>I also feel like Facebook sneak lots of things past me: advertising and promoted posts, privacy and terms changes, user interface changes, collection and use of huge amounts of information about me as I browse the web.<\/p>\n<p>I even feel like the whole nature of Facebook carries a certain risk. Because you share with people you have &#8216;friended&#8217;, it feels like a closed, almost private system. And that lures you into this sense of security. And so you feel like you can post more personal things, without necessarily considering the consequences. It&#8217;s easy to forget who is your friend on Facebook: who&#8217;s going to see that photo, read that status, or spot that action you took in the \u2019ticker\u2019. <\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s easy to grant permissions to an app that it doesn&#8217;t really need. Spotify was a prime example when, for a time, it required a Facebook account. I just don&#8217;t want Facebook knowing my listening habits!<\/p>\n<p>I will write more about the privacy around photos specifically in another post, but photos, specifically, feel more personal. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve deleted them.<\/p>\n<h2>Alternatives<\/h2>\n<p>People will say: \u2019But you still use Twitter, your blog, Google+, aren&#8217;t they as bad?&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Possibly. But remember that I accept the terms of use. And, for the time being, their services are more useful (dare I say \u2019better\u2019?); their data collection and advertising isn&#8217;t as intrusive; and I feel I trust them more.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter, in particular, which I continue to use a lot, feels different. It&#8217;s open. Anyone can read what I post, so I think harder about what I post and am more careful.  Twitter has some issues too, which I\u2019ll also write about another time, but I just feel like I know what I&#8217;m getting with Twitter.<\/p>\n<h2>And so&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>So Facebook, that&#8217;s why I\u2019m cutting down on how I use you. I do fear that I&#8217;ll miss out. Man people I know use Facebook as their main communications tool. I could miss out on real world events, real messages, really interesting updates about people&#8217;s lives. But you&#8217;re just not a tool that&#8217;s suited to communicating with my friends.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not quite goodbye: I&#8217;ll still post sometimes, like, comment and converse. But it&#8217;s certainly a step away.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>Well. I broke my &#8216;no parenting advice&#8217; mantra by writing about cloth nappies. And it went down a treat, being published in the local NCT newsletter and retweeted by several people, including a big cloth nappy manufacturer, as a good article.<\/p>\n<p>So I figure I&#8217;m on a roll! And I kinda have a need to have a word with all you newbie dads and dads-to-be out there about the sometimes-controversial topic of breastfeeding.<\/p>\n<h2>Disclaimer<\/h2>\n<p>Yes&#8230;sometimes breastfeeding &#8211; or at least, people&#8217;s attitudes towards it &#8211; is controversial. So I need to put my firewall up.<\/p>\n<p>I am, quite firmly and unashamedly, a &#8216;breast-is-best&#8217; believer. And I guess I&#8217;ll assume that readers of this article are at least partly in agreement with that belief.<\/p>\n<p>However, I totally understand that there are really good reasons why some people can&#8217;t breastfeed, or choose not to breastfeed and I totally respect and support that choice.<\/p>\n<p>What I hope to do in this article is explain why I think breastfeeding is a good thing, and how you &#8211; dads &#8211; can embrace it and support your other half as they do it.<\/p>\n<p>I should also add that, while poo jokes and toilet humour are funny to us guys, we&#8217;re dads now &#8211; grown men &#8211; and poking fun at sensitive parts of your partner&#8217;s anatomy is not acceptable, so there shall be no boob gags or cheap innuendo. I&#8217;d only end up making a tit of myself.<\/p>\n<h2>Breastfeeding is Good<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ll start by saying why I think breastfeeding is good.  And, yes, I&#8217;ll cover some of the downsides here too.<\/p>\n<h3>Convenience<\/h3>\n<p>When our boy is hungry, milk is on tap. We don&#8217;t need to think about formula. We don&#8217;t need to sterilise bottles and warming things up. It&#8217;s just there ready to go. The hungry baby doesn&#8217;t need to wait for us to make things up, it&#8217;s just there.<\/p>\n<p>The downside of this is that there is a total dependence on mummy. We never got our boy to take a bottle, so that&#8217;s even more true. But Sally has come to accept this as part of her motherhood, and even enjoys feeding times with her son. It&#8217;s a time for cuddles, songs, putting feet up, reading a book (especially during the LONG feeds in the early days), and just admiring your amazing child.<\/p>\n<p>I should add that we&#8217;ve been blessed that Sally could take a long maternity leave and so is still feeding our boy at one-year. If the mother needs to get back to work, then maybe convenience lies elsewhere.<\/p>\n<h3>Quality<\/h3>\n<p>Breast milk is, frankly, amazing stuff. I&#8217;m not totally up on all the science, but it really is tailored to your babies needs. Foremilk comes out first and tempts the baby to get going, but is less rich. Hind milk comes later on in a feed and is richer and more filling. I&#8217;m told that the type of milk even varies by time of day to get exactly what your baby needs when (s)he needs it!<\/p>\n<h3>Price<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s FREE! In fact, not only is the milk free, you need to do less heating of things, less sterilising, and have less equipment as a result. All in all, if you can make it work, you can save a lot of money.<\/p>\n<h3>Weight Loss<\/h3>\n<p>Whether expressing or feeding direct, the milk a mother produces is highly calorific and this can really help lose the extra weight put on during pregnancy. Or, alternatively, you can just eat more chocolate.<\/p>\n<p>I can confirm that this does not apply to partners of breastfeeding mums for whom additional chocolate consumption shall result in increased weight.<\/p>\n<h3>Connection<\/h3>\n<p>Breastfeeding really does (in my experience at least) seem to create a really strong bond between mother and baby.  My wife, despite a difficult start with feeding, now enjoys the close time that she has with our son.<\/p>\n<p>For some fathers and fathers-to-be the &#8216;connection&#8217; issue is difficult as the bond with the mother can be so much stronger than with the father. I\u2019ve not found this at all though and I&#8217;ll relate my experiences later on.<\/p>\n<h2>Dispelling the Myths<\/h2>\n<p>There are some things about breastfeeding that I think are commonly mis-understood, and I&#8217;d like to give my take on them and my relate my experiences.<\/p>\n<p>Not all of these will be encouragements to breastfeed, but I think that if your partner is considering breastfeeding, knowing these things means you&#8217;ll be prepared.<\/p>\n<h3>It&#8217;s easy<\/h3>\n<p>Breastfeeding is a very natural thing to do, and it can be simple and easy, but there can be complications too.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve referred to our difficult start (as an aside, I seem to naturally talk about breastfeeding as something &#8216;we\u2019 do &#8211; I hope this reflects what a team effort it is) and the truth is that we &#8211; Sally in particular &#8211; went through a lot of pain in the early weeks of feeding Isaac.<\/p>\n<p>We were unfortunate to have some minor physical complications that made feeding very difficult, and we had to fight to get the medical help and support that we needed from the NHS.<\/p>\n<p>Things like this don&#8217;t happen to everyone and many people find feeding natural and easy, but be prepared for the fact that it might not be.<\/p>\n<h3>Dads can&#8217;t be involved<\/h3>\n<p>See the entire section below on this. I AM fortunate in that I work from home and very flexibly, so I was able to be more involved than the average dad. But I believe that dads can and should be involved and that&#8217;s the whole reason I&#8217;m writing this post.<\/p>\n<h2>What can dads do?<\/h2>\n<h3>Be interested<\/h3>\n<p>Of course, some mums may not want you interfering, but that wasn&#8217;t my experience. At least talk to your partner about whether and how she wants you to help.<\/p>\n<p>If she does want you to be involved, don&#8217;t just think that breastfeeding is something your partner does and you don&#8217;t need to know anything about it. If problems come then it will help you to understand some of the mechanics and what the mum is going through. Reading this post is certainly a good first step &#8211; it shows you&#8217;re interested already!<\/p>\n<p>We were able to do an NCT ante-natal class which was very helpful and had a session on breastfeeding, which involved balloons, lipstick and knitted breasts &#8211; but that&#8217;s another story. I also read some books on the subject that my wife bought, and &#8211; as we had &#8216;mechanical&#8217; problems, found out as much about the mechanics as I could.<\/p>\n<p>If you find the subject embarrassing, well, I say get over it.  That may not be the best or most friendly piece of advice you&#8217;ll get as a dad, but the fact is that your gonna have to get over the idea that boobs are funny or sexy.<\/p>\n<h3>Be supportive<\/h3>\n<p>First thing first: how you feed is a decision that you and your partner will make together, but bear in mind that the mother is (in the vast majority of cases) the primary feeder, and so your job is probably to support her decision rather then try and get things done your way.<\/p>\n<p>Once that decision is made &#8211; whatever it is &#8211; you should continue to support it, and to support any change of decision.<\/p>\n<p>My wife wanted to carry on breastfeeding despite the initial difficulties, and I helped that happen. Had she decided to quit and start using bottles, I would have supported that too.<\/p>\n<p>Breastfeeding, in particular, can raise a whole load of other issues about things like confidence and body image, and because feeding is more frequent, sleep deprivation can be worse.<\/p>\n<p>It may not be like this. But again, I would recommend being prepared for it. If these things do come up then you will need to be encouraging and loving your partner a lot to help her get through the issues, often when you are very much down on sleep yourself.<\/p>\n<h3>Help with latching<\/h3>\n<p>&#8216;Latching&#8217; is the process of getting the baby onto the boob. A good latch is key to successful and comfortable breastfeeding.<\/p>\n<p>Again, maybe just us, but we had a baby who struggled to latch properly, and who insisted on flailing his arms around until he was settled. It was therefore really helpful for me to hold him still when feeding was getting going.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously I couldn&#8217;t be there for every feed, but I could, if I was around, get physically involved in the process of feeding at times.<\/p>\n<h3>Wind<\/h3>\n<p>In the early months babies normally need winding to get air out of their stomachs that they take in whilst feeding. The problem is lessened with breastfeeding (I think they take in more air when using a bottle) but it still needs doing.<\/p>\n<p>And at the point at which it needs doing, your partner probably needs to clean up and make herself presentable again. So lose any idea that you might ever be able to wear a jumper that doesn&#8217;t have a baby-vomit stain on it again, sit baby on your lap, or over your shoulder, and get gently rubbing and patting.<\/p>\n<p>Those burps are quite satisfying when they come out!<\/p>\n<h3>Move things<\/h3>\n<p>This sounds trivial, but it&#8217;s one of the key ways you can support your partner. Once sat down feeding, she&#8217;s kinda stuck. So don&#8217;t consider it a break from the baby and go and play on you X-box &#8211; be prepared to help her.<\/p>\n<p>Bring her a drink, find the nipple cream, pass a cloth because the baby&#8217;s been sick, turn the light off, turn the music on, make some toast, go to the shop and buy some chocolate, get a blanket because it&#8217;s cold, find her something to put her feet on&#8230;the list of things you can do to help is seemingly endless, and most of them involve moving things.<\/p>\n<h3>Drive, shop, phone, Google, cook, clean, and everything that&#8217;s not feeding.<\/h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s another endless list of things that you can do to make your breastfeeding partner\u2019s life easier. Drive her to appointments with healthcare people, do the shopping at the supermarket, phone people up on her behalf to arrange things, use the Internet to help understand what she&#8217;s going through, or to order her a gift to lift her spirits, cook, clean, wash up. You do some of these things already right? Well do more of them!<\/p>\n<p>Feeding will, for the first few weeks, take up most of your partner&#8217;s life if she&#8217;s breastfeeding. Give her a break.<\/p>\n<h3>Accept help&#8230;and even ask for it<\/h3>\n<p>Oh, and if you don&#8217;t have time to do these things, make sure that you&#8217;re not afraid to ask for, or accept help. Men are notoriously bad at accepting help. Get over your pride and let others help with practical things whenever they offer.<\/p>\n<p>And if your partner is struggling with feeding but wants to continue, help her to find help. Look up breastfeeding support groups, peer supporters, and counsellors &#8211; various organisations have them: the NHS, the NCT and others. Ask your midwife or health visitor. And if you continue to struggle, try and find an infant feeding specialist. Specialist help does exist and can really help.<\/p>\n<p>We had to fight to get help with our issues, but with the help of our amazing midwife we did eventually get to see a specialist and it made the difference between continuing breastfeeding and giving up.<\/p>\n<h3>Change nappies<\/h3>\n<p>It should be apparent that I&#8217;m a nappy geek. I always knew that Sally would breastfeed and so I wouldn&#8217;t get the &#8216;connection&#8217; of feeding him myself, so I took on the role of nappy changer.<\/p>\n<p>I embraced this as &#8216;my job&#8217;. I made it fun. I tried to look forward to it. I took pride in being the primary nappy changer. I made sure the washing\/drying routine was sorted. And I used nappy changing as one of my ways of connecting with my boy.<\/p>\n<p>I would chat to him, sing to him (badly), stroke his head, and often just admire him. As he got older and more playful we&#8217;ve done \u2019zzzurbuts&#8217; (blowing raspberries on his tummy), bits of baby massage (Sally did a course and showed me the basics), tickling, peebo games, and all sorts of other things that have made nappy changing fun and a way for me to get physical time with my boy.<\/p>\n<p>Nappy changing isn&#8217;t always fun&#8230;and not just for the obvious reasons of handling another persons &#8216;outputs&#8217;. We have both done nappies and Sally is great at covering for me when I&#8217;m not enjoying it. But I did do all I could to get \u2019muck in\u2019 from the start and that has helped connect with my boy.<\/p>\n<h3>Bathtime<\/h3>\n<p>Bathtime &#8211; if your working hours permit &#8211; is another great time to connect with baby.<\/p>\n<p>This is also firmly my domain in our family, and &#8216;splish splash splosh&#8217; has a good routine of filling the bath, undressing, washing, playing, nappy changing, teeth-brushing, dressing and settling.<\/p>\n<p>When other people take over or observe I realise how many little routines-within-routines, \u2019in jokes\u2019 and games Isaac and I have. And it&#8217;s mostly our little secret! Things we get up to that no one else knows about.<\/p>\n<h3>Cuddles<\/h3>\n<p>We have a baby that doesn&#8217;t sleep well and we&#8217;ve often had to hold him until he enters deep sleep before putting him down.<\/p>\n<p>At times this has been a real chore and hugely frustrating, but I try to see this as quality time with my boy and it is possible to look forward to cuddles time and even to miss it when he&#8217;s going through a phase of settling by himself.<\/p>\n<h3>Snatch Baby Time<\/h3>\n<p>You won&#8217;t be spending hours every day with your baby snuggled up to your moobs (if you have them). So grab whatever other time you can with him\/her.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t just great for you and your baby, it&#8217;s great for mum too, because she gets some much-needed time off.<\/p>\n<p>Nappy changing and bathtime are ways of doing this. And, as previously mentioned, I&#8217;m hugely fortunate to work from home and so get to see Isaac during the day and be around both morning and evening when he&#8217;s awake.<\/p>\n<p>But the principle applies regardless of working hours.<\/p>\n<p>I currently do most of the morning shifts. Mum\u2019s been up several times in the night feeding, so she\u2019s more tired than me. I take Isaac down, make coffee, sit and play with him (\u2019play\u2019 here generally involves looking on in a dazed state while he has fun by himself) and sometimes get around to doing breakfast too.<\/p>\n<p>At weekends I&#8217;ve tried to take Isaac out to the park or to a local cafe that has some playthings outside.  Or sometimes just popping out to the shops with him is good time.<\/p>\n<p>The key is to treasure time with your little one rather than resent it.  Not always an easy task, but an honourable aim.<\/p>\n<h2>Summing Up<\/h2>\n<p>Establishing breastfeeding was hard for us, but it has, ultimately, been a hugely positive experience.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve worked hard as a team to make it happen, but that hard work has resulted in a great relationship between Sally and Isaac. I don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s impacted my relationship with the boy at all. And, if anything, it&#8217;s strengthened the bond that I have with my wife too.  It feels like its been good for all of us.<\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t comment on if things are better, or worse, than bottle\/formula feeding. I don&#8217;t have the experience to compare.  And I certainly won&#8217;t judge anyone for not breastfeeding or for giving up on it having tried it: every parent-baby combination is different, and we know how hard it can be.<\/p>\n<p>Breastfeeding is a beautiful, clever, natural, healthy, cheap and convenient thing, but it has emotional and physical challenges sometimes. I hope these thoughts and experiences will help some of you along the way.<\/p>\n<p>However you feed you baby, you, as a dad, can play a part. And I encourage you, with your partner&#8217;s permission and guidance, to get as involved as you can.<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Breastfeeding: A Guide for Dads and Dads-to-be",
        "content": "<p>Well. I broke my &#8216;no parenting advice&#8217; mantra by writing about cloth nappies. And it went down a treat, being published in the local NCT newsletter and retweeted by several people, including a big cloth nappy manufacturer, as a good article.<\/p>\n<p>So I figure I&#8217;m on a roll! And I kinda have a need to have a word with all you newbie dads and dads-to-be out there about the sometimes-controversial topic of breastfeeding.<\/p>\n<h2>Disclaimer<\/h2>\n<p>Yes&#8230;sometimes breastfeeding &#8211; or at least, people&#8217;s attitudes towards it &#8211; is controversial. So I need to put my firewall up.<\/p>\n<p>I am, quite firmly and unashamedly, a &#8216;breast-is-best&#8217; believer. And I guess I&#8217;ll assume that readers of this article are at least partly in agreement with that belief.<\/p>\n<p>However, I totally understand that there are really good reasons why some people can&#8217;t breastfeed, or choose not to breastfeed and I totally respect and support that choice.<\/p>\n<p>What I hope to do in this article is explain why I think breastfeeding is a good thing, and how you &#8211; dads &#8211; can embrace it and support your other half as they do it.<\/p>\n<p>I should also add that, while poo jokes and toilet humour are funny to us guys, we&#8217;re dads now &#8211; grown men &#8211; and poking fun at sensitive parts of your partner&#8217;s anatomy is not acceptable, so there shall be no boob gags or cheap innuendo. I&#8217;d only end up making a tit of myself.<\/p>\n<h2>Breastfeeding is Good<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ll start by saying why I think breastfeeding is good.  And, yes, I&#8217;ll cover some of the downsides here too.<\/p>\n<h3>Convenience<\/h3>\n<p>When our boy is hungry, milk is on tap. We don&#8217;t need to think about formula. We don&#8217;t need to sterilise bottles and warming things up. It&#8217;s just there ready to go. The hungry baby doesn&#8217;t need to wait for us to make things up, it&#8217;s just there.<\/p>\n<p>The downside of this is that there is a total dependence on mummy. We never got our boy to take a bottle, so that&#8217;s even more true. But Sally has come to accept this as part of her motherhood, and even enjoys feeding times with her son. It&#8217;s a time for cuddles, songs, putting feet up, reading a book (especially during the LONG feeds in the early days), and just admiring your amazing child.<\/p>\n<p>I should add that we&#8217;ve been blessed that Sally could take a long maternity leave and so is still feeding our boy at one-year. If the mother needs to get back to work, then maybe convenience lies elsewhere.<\/p>\n<h3>Quality<\/h3>\n<p>Breast milk is, frankly, amazing stuff. I&#8217;m not totally up on all the science, but it really is tailored to your babies needs. Foremilk comes out first and tempts the baby to get going, but is less rich. Hind milk comes later on in a feed and is richer and more filling. I&#8217;m told that the type of milk even varies by time of day to get exactly what your baby needs when (s)he needs it!<\/p>\n<h3>Price<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s FREE! In fact, not only is the milk free, you need to do less heating of things, less sterilising, and have less equipment as a result. All in all, if you can make it work, you can save a lot of money.<\/p>\n<h3>Weight Loss<\/h3>\n<p>Whether expressing or feeding direct, the milk a mother produces is highly calorific and this can really help lose the extra weight put on during pregnancy. Or, alternatively, you can just eat more chocolate.<\/p>\n<p>I can confirm that this does not apply to partners of breastfeeding mums for whom additional chocolate consumption shall result in increased weight.<\/p>\n<h3>Connection<\/h3>\n<p>Breastfeeding really does (in my experience at least) seem to create a really strong bond between mother and baby.  My wife, despite a difficult start with feeding, now enjoys the close time that she has with our son.<\/p>\n<p>For some fathers and fathers-to-be the &#8216;connection&#8217; issue is difficult as the bond with the mother can be so much stronger than with the father. I\u2019ve not found this at all though and I&#8217;ll relate my experiences later on.<\/p>\n<h2>Dispelling the Myths<\/h2>\n<p>There are some things about breastfeeding that I think are commonly mis-understood, and I&#8217;d like to give my take on them and my relate my experiences.<\/p>\n<p>Not all of these will be encouragements to breastfeed, but I think that if your partner is considering breastfeeding, knowing these things means you&#8217;ll be prepared.<\/p>\n<h3>It&#8217;s easy<\/h3>\n<p>Breastfeeding is a very natural thing to do, and it can be simple and easy, but there can be complications too.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve referred to our difficult start (as an aside, I seem to naturally talk about breastfeeding as something &#8216;we\u2019 do &#8211; I hope this reflects what a team effort it is) and the truth is that we &#8211; Sally in particular &#8211; went through a lot of pain in the early weeks of feeding Isaac.<\/p>\n<p>We were unfortunate to have some minor physical complications that made feeding very difficult, and we had to fight to get the medical help and support that we needed from the NHS.<\/p>\n<p>Things like this don&#8217;t happen to everyone and many people find feeding natural and easy, but be prepared for the fact that it might not be.<\/p>\n<h3>Dads can&#8217;t be involved<\/h3>\n<p>See the entire section below on this. I AM fortunate in that I work from home and very flexibly, so I was able to be more involved than the average dad. But I believe that dads can and should be involved and that&#8217;s the whole reason I&#8217;m writing this post.<\/p>\n<h2>What can dads do?<\/h2>\n<h3>Be interested<\/h3>\n<p>Of course, some mums may not want you interfering, but that wasn&#8217;t my experience. At least talk to your partner about whether and how she wants you to help.<\/p>\n<p>If she does want you to be involved, don&#8217;t just think that breastfeeding is something your partner does and you don&#8217;t need to know anything about it. If problems come then it will help you to understand some of the mechanics and what the mum is going through. Reading this post is certainly a good first step &#8211; it shows you&#8217;re interested already!<\/p>\n<p>We were able to do an NCT ante-natal class which was very helpful and had a session on breastfeeding, which involved balloons, lipstick and knitted breasts &#8211; but that&#8217;s another story. I also read some books on the subject that my wife bought, and &#8211; as we had &#8216;mechanical&#8217; problems, found out as much about the mechanics as I could.<\/p>\n<p>If you find the subject embarrassing, well, I say get over it.  That may not be the best or most friendly piece of advice you&#8217;ll get as a dad, but the fact is that your gonna have to get over the idea that boobs are funny or sexy.<\/p>\n<h3>Be supportive<\/h3>\n<p>First thing first: how you feed is a decision that you and your partner will make together, but bear in mind that the mother is (in the vast majority of cases) the primary feeder, and so your job is probably to support her decision rather then try and get things done your way.<\/p>\n<p>Once that decision is made &#8211; whatever it is &#8211; you should continue to support it, and to support any change of decision.<\/p>\n<p>My wife wanted to carry on breastfeeding despite the initial difficulties, and I helped that happen. Had she decided to quit and start using bottles, I would have supported that too.<\/p>\n<p>Breastfeeding, in particular, can raise a whole load of other issues about things like confidence and body image, and because feeding is more frequent, sleep deprivation can be worse.<\/p>\n<p>It may not be like this. But again, I would recommend being prepared for it. If these things do come up then you will need to be encouraging and loving your partner a lot to help her get through the issues, often when you are very much down on sleep yourself.<\/p>\n<h3>Help with latching<\/h3>\n<p>&#8216;Latching&#8217; is the process of getting the baby onto the boob. A good latch is key to successful and comfortable breastfeeding.<\/p>\n<p>Again, maybe just us, but we had a baby who struggled to latch properly, and who insisted on flailing his arms around until he was settled. It was therefore really helpful for me to hold him still when feeding was getting going.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously I couldn&#8217;t be there for every feed, but I could, if I was around, get physically involved in the process of feeding at times.<\/p>\n<h3>Wind<\/h3>\n<p>In the early months babies normally need winding to get air out of their stomachs that they take in whilst feeding. The problem is lessened with breastfeeding (I think they take in more air when using a bottle) but it still needs doing.<\/p>\n<p>And at the point at which it needs doing, your partner probably needs to clean up and make herself presentable again. So lose any idea that you might ever be able to wear a jumper that doesn&#8217;t have a baby-vomit stain on it again, sit baby on your lap, or over your shoulder, and get gently rubbing and patting.<\/p>\n<p>Those burps are quite satisfying when they come out!<\/p>\n<h3>Move things<\/h3>\n<p>This sounds trivial, but it&#8217;s one of the key ways you can support your partner. Once sat down feeding, she&#8217;s kinda stuck. So don&#8217;t consider it a break from the baby and go and play on you X-box &#8211; be prepared to help her.<\/p>\n<p>Bring her a drink, find the nipple cream, pass a cloth because the baby&#8217;s been sick, turn the light off, turn the music on, make some toast, go to the shop and buy some chocolate, get a blanket because it&#8217;s cold, find her something to put her feet on&#8230;the list of things you can do to help is seemingly endless, and most of them involve moving things.<\/p>\n<h3>Drive, shop, phone, Google, cook, clean, and everything that&#8217;s not feeding.<\/h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s another endless list of things that you can do to make your breastfeeding partner\u2019s life easier. Drive her to appointments with healthcare people, do the shopping at the supermarket, phone people up on her behalf to arrange things, use the Internet to help understand what she&#8217;s going through, or to order her a gift to lift her spirits, cook, clean, wash up. You do some of these things already right? Well do more of them!<\/p>\n<p>Feeding will, for the first few weeks, take up most of your partner&#8217;s life if she&#8217;s breastfeeding. Give her a break.<\/p>\n<h3>Accept help&#8230;and even ask for it<\/h3>\n<p>Oh, and if you don&#8217;t have time to do these things, make sure that you&#8217;re not afraid to ask for, or accept help. Men are notoriously bad at accepting help. Get over your pride and let others help with practical things whenever they offer.<\/p>\n<p>And if your partner is struggling with feeding but wants to continue, help her to find help. Look up breastfeeding support groups, peer supporters, and counsellors &#8211; various organisations have them: the NHS, the NCT and others. Ask your midwife or health visitor. And if you continue to struggle, try and find an infant feeding specialist. Specialist help does exist and can really help.<\/p>\n<p>We had to fight to get help with our issues, but with the help of our amazing midwife we did eventually get to see a specialist and it made the difference between continuing breastfeeding and giving up.<\/p>\n<h3>Change nappies<\/h3>\n<p>It should be apparent that I&#8217;m a nappy geek. I always knew that Sally would breastfeed and so I wouldn&#8217;t get the &#8216;connection&#8217; of feeding him myself, so I took on the role of nappy changer.<\/p>\n<p>I embraced this as &#8216;my job&#8217;. I made it fun. I tried to look forward to it. I took pride in being the primary nappy changer. I made sure the washing\/drying routine was sorted. And I used nappy changing as one of my ways of connecting with my boy.<\/p>\n<p>I would chat to him, sing to him (badly), stroke his head, and often just admire him. As he got older and more playful we&#8217;ve done \u2019zzzurbuts&#8217; (blowing raspberries on his tummy), bits of baby massage (Sally did a course and showed me the basics), tickling, peebo games, and all sorts of other things that have made nappy changing fun and a way for me to get physical time with my boy.<\/p>\n<p>Nappy changing isn&#8217;t always fun&#8230;and not just for the obvious reasons of handling another persons &#8216;outputs&#8217;. We have both done nappies and Sally is great at covering for me when I&#8217;m not enjoying it. But I did do all I could to get \u2019muck in\u2019 from the start and that has helped connect with my boy.<\/p>\n<h3>Bathtime<\/h3>\n<p>Bathtime &#8211; if your working hours permit &#8211; is another great time to connect with baby.<\/p>\n<p>This is also firmly my domain in our family, and &#8216;splish splash splosh&#8217; has a good routine of filling the bath, undressing, washing, playing, nappy changing, teeth-brushing, dressing and settling.<\/p>\n<p>When other people take over or observe I realise how many little routines-within-routines, \u2019in jokes\u2019 and games Isaac and I have. And it&#8217;s mostly our little secret! Things we get up to that no one else knows about.<\/p>\n<h3>Cuddles<\/h3>\n<p>We have a baby that doesn&#8217;t sleep well and we&#8217;ve often had to hold him until he enters deep sleep before putting him down.<\/p>\n<p>At times this has been a real chore and hugely frustrating, but I try to see this as quality time with my boy and it is possible to look forward to cuddles time and even to miss it when he&#8217;s going through a phase of settling by himself.<\/p>\n<h3>Snatch Baby Time<\/h3>\n<p>You won&#8217;t be spending hours every day with your baby snuggled up to your moobs (if you have them). So grab whatever other time you can with him\/her.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t just great for you and your baby, it&#8217;s great for mum too, because she gets some much-needed time off.<\/p>\n<p>Nappy changing and bathtime are ways of doing this. And, as previously mentioned, I&#8217;m hugely fortunate to work from home and so get to see Isaac during the day and be around both morning and evening when he&#8217;s awake.<\/p>\n<p>But the principle applies regardless of working hours.<\/p>\n<p>I currently do most of the morning shifts. Mum\u2019s been up several times in the night feeding, so she\u2019s more tired than me. I take Isaac down, make coffee, sit and play with him (\u2019play\u2019 here generally involves looking on in a dazed state while he has fun by himself) and sometimes get around to doing breakfast too.<\/p>\n<p>At weekends I&#8217;ve tried to take Isaac out to the park or to a local cafe that has some playthings outside.  Or sometimes just popping out to the shops with him is good time.<\/p>\n<p>The key is to treasure time with your little one rather than resent it.  Not always an easy task, but an honourable aim.<\/p>\n<h2>Summing Up<\/h2>\n<p>Establishing breastfeeding was hard for us, but it has, ultimately, been a hugely positive experience.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve worked hard as a team to make it happen, but that hard work has resulted in a great relationship between Sally and Isaac. I don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s impacted my relationship with the boy at all. And, if anything, it&#8217;s strengthened the bond that I have with my wife too.  It feels like its been good for all of us.<\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t comment on if things are better, or worse, than bottle\/formula feeding. I don&#8217;t have the experience to compare.  And I certainly won&#8217;t judge anyone for not breastfeeding or for giving up on it having tried it: every parent-baby combination is different, and we know how hard it can be.<\/p>\n<p>Breastfeeding is a beautiful, clever, natural, healthy, cheap and convenient thing, but it has emotional and physical challenges sometimes. I hope these thoughts and experiences will help some of you along the way.<\/p>\n<p>However you feed you baby, you, as a dad, can play a part. And I encourage you, with your partner&#8217;s permission and guidance, to get as involved as you can.<\/p>\n",
