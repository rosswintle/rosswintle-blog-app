And those early weeks are filled with text messages going back and forth like &#8220;You&#8217;re collecting kid 1 today at 3pm, right?&#8221;, or &#8220;You know kid 2 has after-school club today, right?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes time for the trust to build that the other person is checking the calendar, has set the right reminders, and knows the routine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a few weeks, these messages stop (until there is an exception to the routine!).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You have a relationship with your code!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You kinda have a relationship with code from your projects. You probably have feelings about it. It can delight you, and it can frustrate you. Like with a friendship or romantic relationship, you&#8217;ll get the most out of it if you invest in it, tend it, nurture it. If you neglect it it will slap you in the face the next time you demand something of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trust is also something you can have &#8211; or not have &#8211; in a code base.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I&#8217;ve been <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/03\/readable-code-tips-intro\/\">thinking about code style<\/a>, I&#8217;ve also been thinking about how it&#8217;s important to build up trust in a code base.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I have a project that I&#8217;ve been looking at where I don&#8217;t trust it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I maybe don&#8217;t trust it because I know it&#8217;s poorly typed, or not typed at all, and so I know edge cases can creep in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I maybe don&#8217;t trust it because it has no tests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s so complex and poorly documented that I&#8217;m not convinced the author know what the code did, let alone this newcomer to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or maybe it just seems muddled and badly structured.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, I might be reading some code like this and come across a function call like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nvalidateEmailParameter();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And a function definition like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n\/\/ Validate the email address.\nfunction validateEmailParameter()\n{\n   ...\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Without further information or context, I might have a lot of questions about what this does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Where is the parameter that&#8217;s being validated? This <em>might<\/em> be evident from the context, such as inside an HTTP request handler. But it might not.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What is a valid email in this case? Have they implemented this robustly?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Does it only accept a string? Does it handle other types or null? Does it handle an empty string?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What might this return? Does it return? Could it return an error code or exception?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In an untrustworthy codebase, I won&#8217;t make assumptions about a function like this. I will have to open it up, read through the code, and figure out what it does. This takes time, and for more complex situations this can <em>really<\/em> slow me down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT, if I trust the codebase, then the function definition will probably be something like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n\/**\n * Tests if the &quot;email&quot; parameter passed in the URL query string is present and is a\n * valid address. If it's not then a 400 HTTP status code will be returned and the\n * application will exit.\n *\n * If the address is present and valid, true is returned.\n * \n * @return boolean\n *\/\nfunction validateEmailParameter()\n{\n    ...\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>This is a contrived, awkward and simple case. But in a case like this I&#8217;m much more likely to believe the function&#8217;s description and not even read the code to see what it does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Earning my trust<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this trust isn&#8217;t a one-off thing. My trust in a code base is earned over time through repeated exposure to good practice, good documentation, attention to detail, and other factors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But once it has my trust, it&#8217;s so much easier to work with without having to go <a href=\"https:\/\/queue.acm.org\/detail.cfm?id=945136\">spelunking<\/a>. I can work with it faster because the mental overhead of reading it is so much lower.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This post sits as a sidebar to my series on readable code. They go hand in hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The readable code tips work best when a code base is trusted. But they are also one of the ways in which you can build trust in your code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So think about your work. Do you trust the code in your projects? If not why not? And what can you do to make your code more trustworthy?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The school run<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When we start a new school year, my wife and I have new routines for getting our kids to and from school. And those early weeks are filled with text messages going back and forth like &#8220;You&#8217;re collecting kid 1 today at 3pm, right?&#8221;, or &#8220;You know kid 2 has after-school club today, right?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes time for the trust to build that the other person is checking the calendar, has set the right reminders, and knows the routine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a few weeks, these messages stop (until there is an exception to the routine!).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You have a relationship with your code!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You kinda have a relationship with code from your projects. You probably have feelings about it. It can delight you, and it can frustrate you. Like with a friendship or romantic relationship, you&#8217;ll get the most out of it if you invest in it, tend it, nurture it. If you neglect it it will slap you in the face the next time you demand something of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trust is also something you can have &#8211; or not have &#8211; in a code base.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I&#8217;ve been <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/03\/readable-code-tips-intro\/\">thinking about code style<\/a>, I&#8217;ve also been thinking about how it&#8217;s important to build up trust in a code base.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I have a project that I&#8217;ve been looking at where I don&#8217;t trust it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I maybe don&#8217;t trust it because I know it&#8217;s poorly typed, or not typed at all, and so I know edge cases can creep in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I maybe don&#8217;t trust it because it has no tests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s so complex and poorly documented that I&#8217;m not convinced the author know what the code did, let alone this newcomer to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or maybe it just seems muddled and badly structured.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, I might be reading some code like this and come across a function call like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nvalidateEmailParameter();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And a function definition like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n\/\/ Validate the email address.\nfunction validateEmailParameter()\n{\n   ...\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Without further information or context, I might have a lot of questions about what this does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Where is the parameter that&#8217;s being validated? This <em>might<\/em> be evident from the context, such as inside an HTTP request handler. But it might not.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What is a valid email in this case? Have they implemented this robustly?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Does it only accept a string? Does it handle other types or null? Does it handle an empty string?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What might this return? Does it return? Could it return an error code or exception?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In an untrustworthy codebase, I won&#8217;t make assumptions about a function like this. I will have to open it up, read through the code, and figure out what it does. This takes time, and for more complex situations this can <em>really<\/em> slow me down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT, if I trust the codebase, then the function definition will probably be something like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n\/**\n * Tests if the &quot;email&quot; parameter passed in the URL query string is present and is a\n * valid address. If it's not then a 400 HTTP status code will be returned and the\n * application will exit.\n *\n * If the address is present and valid, true is returned.\n * \n * @return boolean\n *\/\nfunction validateEmailParameter()\n{\n    ...\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>This is a contrived, awkward and simple case. But in a case like this I&#8217;m much more likely to believe the function&#8217;s description and not even read the code to see what it does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Earning my trust<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this trust isn&#8217;t a one-off thing. My trust in a code base is earned over time through repeated exposure to good practice, good documentation, attention to detail, and other factors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But once it has my trust, it&#8217;s so much easier to work with without having to go <a href=\"https:\/\/queue.acm.org\/detail.cfm?id=945136\">spelunking<\/a>. I can work with it faster because the mental overhead of reading it is so much lower.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This post sits as a sidebar to my series on readable code. They go hand in hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The readable code tips work best when a code base is trusted. But they are also one of the ways in which you can build trust in your code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So think about your work. Do you trust the code in your projects? If not why not? And what can you do to make your code more trustworthy?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

But the pseudo-code idea can now be used to make this easier to read:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction isExistingTextFile($filename) {\n\treturn\n        pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION) === 'txt' &amp;&amp;\n        file_exists($filename) &amp;&amp;\n        filetype($filename) === 'file';\n}\n\nif (isExistingTextFile($filename)) {\n    ...\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>This has the additional benefit that the <code>isExistingTextFile<\/code> function here is also reusable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you can <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/03\/trusting-code\/\">build trust in your code base<\/a>, this is easier to read and faster to work with too.<\/p>\n",

But the pseudo-code idea can now be used to make this easier to read:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction isExistingTextFile($filename) {\n\treturn\n        pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION) === 'txt' &amp;&amp;\n        file_exists($filename) &amp;&amp;\n        filetype($filename) === 'file';\n}\n\nif (isExistingTextFile($filename)) {\n    ...\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>This has the additional benefit that the <code>isExistingTextFile<\/code> function here is also reusable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you can <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/03\/trusting-code\/\">build trust in your code base<\/a>, this is easier to read and faster to work with too.<\/p>\n",

But it&#8217;s like a wall of code that&#8217;s actually hard to read and surprisingly hard to reason about.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction isExistingTextFile($filename) {\n    $isEmptyFilename = ! is_empty($filename);\n    $isValidFilename =  strlen($filename) &gt; 5;\n    $isNonEmptyValidFilename = $isEmptyFilename &amp;&amp; $isValidFilename;\n    $filenameHasTextExtension = pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION) === 'txt';\n    $fileExists = file_exists($filename);\n    $isValidTextFilename = $isNonEmptyValidFilename &amp;&amp; $fileNameHasTextExtension;\n    $isTextFile = $isValidTextFilename &amp;&amp; $fileExists;\n    return $isTextFile;\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>One possible way to fix this is to say &#8220;Well, this is really just one condition. A single expression. Let&#8217;s just inline everything and return it:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction isExistingTextFile($filename) {\n    return ! is_empty($filename) &amp;&amp; strlen($filename) &gt; 5 &amp;&amp; pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION) === 'txt' &amp;&amp; file_exists($filename);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And on the face of it this is much nicer. But for me, this is the other extreme. It&#8217;s still actually kinda hard to read. I think that a good, well-named intermediate variable can actually help break down a multi-part expression like this.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction isExistingTextFile($filename) {\n\t$isValidFilename = ! is_empty($filename) &amp;&amp; strlen($filename) &gt; 5;\n\t$isTxtFile = $isValidFilename &amp;&amp; pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION) === 'txt';\n\treturn $isTxtFile &amp;&amp; file_exists($filename);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I think this is a nice middle ground with the final <code>return<\/code> being a readable statement of what we want to check for. And working our way back up the expressions we can see how each is also readable. In my opinion at least.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bonus: A quick primer on short-circuit evaluation!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now&#8230; to that &#8220;hard to reason about&#8221; piece. Why is this code hard to reason about? It seems pretty simple?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well if you&#8217;ve not heard of short-circuit evaluation, it&#8217;s worth finding out about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boolean expressions can be made more efficient using short-circuit evaluation. When this happens, the computer runs the minimum number of checks required to complete the evaluation of the expression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s some words in there. Maybe that means nothing to you. So let&#8217;s look at an example.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$result = complexFunction1() &amp;&amp; complexFunction2();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Because we&#8217;re using <code>&amp;&amp;<\/code>, we don&#8217;t always have to call both functions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the result of the first function is <code>false<\/code> then the whole thing is false. So <code>complexFunction2()<\/code> doesn&#8217;t <em>need<\/em> to be called to get the result. And in many programming languages, including PHP and JavaScript, it is <em>not<\/em> called.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wait? What?! You might be thinking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, this can be pretty powerful and we need to be careful with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine that these two complex function calls involve slow operations, say, database queries or API requests. It could be much quicker to only call the first function.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider this case:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$result = createPost() &amp;&amp; publishPost();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>In this case short-circuit evaluation helps us because if <code>createPost()<\/code> fails then <code>publishPost()<\/code> will also fail. But short-circuit evaluation means we don&#8217;t call <code>publishPost()<\/code>, which could save us time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now what if we extracted variables here?<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$isPostCreated = createPost();\n$isPostPublished = publishPost();\n$result = $isPostCreated &amp;&amp; $isPostPublished;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>This is slightly contrived, and probably not what you would do. But if we did do this then <code>publishPost()<\/code> is ALWAYS called on the second line, even if <code>createPost()<\/code>fails and returns false.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that short-circuit evaluation also works for <code>||<\/code> conditions, but backwards:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$result = complexFunction1() || complexFunction2();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Here if <code>complexFunction1()<\/code> is <code>true<\/code> then the whole expression will always be <code>true<\/code> and we don&#8217;t need to call <code>complexFunction2()<\/code> to determine that, and so it&#8217;s not called.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there might be a benefit to our fully-inlined version:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction isExistingTextFile($filename) {\n    return ! is_empty($filename) &amp;&amp; strlen($filename) &gt; 5 &amp;&amp; pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION) === 'txt' &amp;&amp; file_exists($filename);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>because if we fail any step, the subsequent steps are not executed at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I shall leave it up to the reader to look at the example code at the top of this post and try to figure out what is called and when. Did the code work differently as we inlined and then un-inlined the parts of the expression?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>Previous Tip: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/03\/readable-code-tips-extract-complex-conditions\/\">Extract complex conditionals<\/a><\/em><br><em>Next Tip: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/07\/readable-code-tips-use-is-or-has-for-boolean-variables-functions\/\">Use \u201cis\u201d or \u201chas\u201d for Boolean variables\/functions<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a balance to be found between &#8220;inlining&#8221; multiple expressions, and using temporary variables.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This example uses lots of nicely named variables. But it&#8217;s like a wall of code that&#8217;s actually hard to read and surprisingly hard to reason about.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction isExistingTextFile($filename) {\n    $isEmptyFilename = ! is_empty($filename);\n    $isValidFilename =  strlen($filename) &gt; 5;\n    $isNonEmptyValidFilename = $isEmptyFilename &amp;&amp; $isValidFilename;\n    $filenameHasTextExtension = pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION) === 'txt';\n    $fileExists = file_exists($filename);\n    $isValidTextFilename = $isNonEmptyValidFilename &amp;&amp; $fileNameHasTextExtension;\n    $isTextFile = $isValidTextFilename &amp;&amp; $fileExists;\n    return $isTextFile;\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>One possible way to fix this is to say &#8220;Well, this is really just one condition. A single expression. Let&#8217;s just inline everything and return it:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction isExistingTextFile($filename) {\n    return ! is_empty($filename) &amp;&amp; strlen($filename) &gt; 5 &amp;&amp; pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION) === 'txt' &amp;&amp; file_exists($filename);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And on the face of it this is much nicer. But for me, this is the other extreme. It&#8217;s still actually kinda hard to read. I think that a good, well-named intermediate variable can actually help break down a multi-part expression like this.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction isExistingTextFile($filename) {\n\t$isValidFilename = ! is_empty($filename) &amp;&amp; strlen($filename) &gt; 5;\n\t$isTxtFile = $isValidFilename &amp;&amp; pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION) === 'txt';\n\treturn $isTxtFile &amp;&amp; file_exists($filename);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I think this is a nice middle ground with the final <code>return<\/code> being a readable statement of what we want to check for. And working our way back up the expressions we can see how each is also readable. In my opinion at least.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bonus: A quick primer on short-circuit evaluation!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now&#8230; to that &#8220;hard to reason about&#8221; piece. Why is this code hard to reason about? It seems pretty simple?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well if you&#8217;ve not heard of short-circuit evaluation, it&#8217;s worth finding out about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boolean expressions can be made more efficient using short-circuit evaluation. When this happens, the computer runs the minimum number of checks required to complete the evaluation of the expression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s some words in there. Maybe that means nothing to you. So let&#8217;s look at an example.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$result = complexFunction1() &amp;&amp; complexFunction2();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Because we&#8217;re using <code>&amp;&amp;<\/code>, we don&#8217;t always have to call both functions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the result of the first function is <code>false<\/code> then the whole thing is false. So <code>complexFunction2()<\/code> doesn&#8217;t <em>need<\/em> to be called to get the result. And in many programming languages, including PHP and JavaScript, it is <em>not<\/em> called.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wait? What?! You might be thinking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, this can be pretty powerful and we need to be careful with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine that these two complex function calls involve slow operations, say, database queries or API requests. It could be much quicker to only call the first function.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider this case:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$result = createPost() &amp;&amp; publishPost();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>In this case short-circuit evaluation helps us because if <code>createPost()<\/code> fails then <code>publishPost()<\/code> will also fail. But short-circuit evaluation means we don&#8217;t call <code>publishPost()<\/code>, which could save us time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now what if we extracted variables here?<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$isPostCreated = createPost();\n$isPostPublished = publishPost();\n$result = $isPostCreated &amp;&amp; $isPostPublished;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>This is slightly contrived, and probably not what you would do. But if we did do this then <code>publishPost()<\/code> is ALWAYS called on the second line, even if <code>createPost()<\/code>fails and returns false.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that short-circuit evaluation also works for <code>||<\/code> conditions, but backwards:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$result = complexFunction1() || complexFunction2();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Here if <code>complexFunction1()<\/code> is <code>true<\/code> then the whole expression will always be <code>true<\/code> and we don&#8217;t need to call <code>complexFunction2()<\/code> to determine that, and so it&#8217;s not called.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there might be a benefit to our fully-inlined version:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction isExistingTextFile($filename) {\n    return ! is_empty($filename) &amp;&amp; strlen($filename) &gt; 5 &amp;&amp; pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION) === 'txt' &amp;&amp; file_exists($filename);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>because if we fail any step, the subsequent steps are not executed at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I shall leave it up to the reader to look at the example code at the top of this post and try to figure out what is called and when. Did the code work differently as we inlined and then un-inlined the parts of the expression?<\/p>\n",

I hate all this. I just want to play games without all the crud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I make <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/02\/a-manifesto-for-small-static-web-apps\/\">simple web apps<\/a>. So why can&#8217;t I make a Scrabble clone?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I did! It&#8217;s still early days. Things don&#8217;t work or are broken. There are things it doesn&#8217;t do right. But this is kinda playable right now. Before you let me know things are broken please see if <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/static-word-game\/issues\">I already know about it<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/words.pico.games\/\">https:\/\/words.pico.games\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, this is not the BEST Scrabble clone. But it&#8217;s free, needs no sign up, has no ads. There are no catches. I just use <a href=\"https:\/\/usefathom.com\/ref\/SVE71E\">Fathom Analytics<\/a> to collect minimal, anonymised usage stats. That&#8217;s it! You can just play!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s something about it that the computer nerds will find interesting. I think. Read on if you want to know how this works because a static-file, multiplayer game without a login or database&#8230; how does that work?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How DOES it work? <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ages ago I heard a thing on a podcast, and I can&#8217;t even remember what it was, that made me wonder if you could have an online, multi-player, turn-based game where the game state is encoded in URLs and you just swap URLs with other people using messaging to take turns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could prove this with something very simple like tic-tac-toe. But that seemed TOO simple. And I love word games. So Scrabble seemed to be a reasonable step up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you are about to read is a technical deep-dive on encoding Scrabble games in URLs. This is kinda computer-sciencey stuff including binary representations of data, bitwise operations, and JavaScript &#8220;BigInts&#8221;. I hope it&#8217;s interesting to someone!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Aside: Scrabble(TM) is owned by Mattel and Hasbro and they have enforced their copyright over some aspects of the game in the past, so I&#8217;m cautious about naming it and using anything of the game that may be copyrighted.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Computer Science &#8211; a quick primer on binary representations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t talk a lot about &#8220;bits&#8221; in web development. The high-level languages we use, the speed of processing, and the memory we have available in computers nowadays means we don&#8217;t have to think about it much. But I want to do something <em>super<\/em> efficient here, so I&#8217;m turning to binary encoding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the hood, our computers use binary &#8211; 0&#8217;s and 1&#8217;s to represent data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whole numbers usually translate pretty directly. Zero is <code>0<\/code> in binary. Eight is <code>1000<\/code>. Thirteen is <code>1101<\/code>. I won&#8217;t go into why here. But bigger numbers take up more bits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boolean &#8220;true\/false&#8221; values can be represented in just a single bit!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Letters and characters? Well, they are also converted to numbers. Numbers are really all that we&#8217;ve got. And computers use standardised codes for this. Major standards for encoding text are ASCII and Unicode (sometimes known as UTF).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ASCII is pretty simple. Each character is given a number that fits into, say, 7 bits. 7 bits gives you numbers up to 128. That lets you have lower case and upper case Latin alphabet that we use for English, digits 0-9 and still have 66 slots for punctuation and other stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Aside: This is fine for English, but in the global world there&#8217;s a huge number of other characters we might want to use, and Unicode includes all sorts of non-Latin characters and all the emoji!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if you don&#8217;t need punctuation? In Scrabble you only need single-case letters (and blanks) on your tiles. That&#8217;s 27 options. And 27 options fit into just 5 bits. So can we just do that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course you can!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, if you know what the &#8220;shape&#8221; of your data is, you can really efficiently &#8220;encode&#8221; it in Binary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to propose, below, that data for a &#8220;player&#8221; in Scrabble is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A score that is a number between 0 and 1000<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A &#8220;rack&#8221; of tiles, that is a list of 7 letters<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We know this data &#8220;shape&#8221;. So if we can somehow manipulate individual bits we can store a player as a single string of bits. 10 bits for the score. And 5 bits for each letter. 45 bits in total.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This then raises questions though. Like, what if a player is at the end of the game and only has 4 tiles? Well, we can either use one of the spare (not-a-letter) 5-bit values to mean &#8220;empty&#8221;. OR&#8230; we could add another bit of data that says how many letters there are and only store those letters. The number 7 can be represented in 3 bits (<code>111<\/code>) so a player could be:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A score that is a number between 0 and 1000 (10 bits)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A count of the number of tiles in the rack (3 bits)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A &#8220;rack&#8221; of tiles, that is a list of <em>up to<\/em> 7 letters (5 bits each)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a trade off here. If we have 7 letters then we&#8217;re adding 3 bits for the count.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if we have less than 7 letters, we <em>save<\/em> at least 2 bits (5 fewer bits for a letter, but 3 added for the count). A player with just one tile saves 27 bits!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all super-nerdy stuff. But hopefully you see what I&#8217;m trying to do here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an issue though, and that&#8217;s that the languages we use on the web don&#8217;t necessarily make it easy to work with individual bits. I&#8217;ll come back to this later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, given we know we can use bits in this way, how can we represent a Scrabble game?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think this is all very interesting then I can highly recommend Julia Evan&#8217;s &#8220;Zine&#8221; (small-comic-book format) called &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/wizardzines.com\/zines\/integers-floats\/\">How Integers and Floats Work<\/a>&#8220;, and you can tinker with binary codes and numbers using her simple <a href=\"https:\/\/integer.exposed\/\">integer.exposed<\/a> tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Minimal Scrabble game representations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I started by wondering what the smallest way to represent a Scrabble-like game was. I don&#8217;t want URLs to get too long as I pass the game state around. So how can I do this efficiently?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things you COULD store are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The board.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a 15&#215;15 square grid where each square can be empty or contain a letter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A letter can be one of 26 things, or a blank (which is different to empty!). If we do a minimal binary representation, this fits into 5 bits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Representing the whole board would take up up to 1,125 bits. That 161, 7-bit ASCII characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could you compress this? Maybe by encoding multiple empty spaces somehow? Maybe. But that gets complicated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What else do we need?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Players<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Players have a tile rack &#8211; that&#8217;s up to 7 lots of 5-bits-per-tile. So 35 bits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Players also have a score. That could be up to 1000, so let&#8217;s give that 10 bits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll ignore names for now. I think we can do without that. Is that it? I think it is, as moves will be separate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a player can be up to 45 bits each. That&#8217;s 7, 7-bit ASCII characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Tile Bag<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You could choose to store the tile bag. There are 100 tiles, so this would be 100 * 5 = 500 bits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s another 72, 7-bit ASCII characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Summing up, if you were to store data in this way: board state, player state and tile bag, that&#8217;s a total of 1,715 bits, or 245 characters. Not bad I suppose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be some efficiencies to be gained somewhere. But it would either:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Be very minimal on average; or<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add complexity to the encoding<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But it feels like there&#8217;s some data duplication here. Perhaps we can do better?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Alternative: Store the Moves<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than storing the board and the player scores, we could just store a list of moves. This may be more efficient. But it may also be hard to tell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A list of moves can be &#8220;played back&#8221; onto the board to get player scores and the board state.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also don&#8217;t need to maintain a tile bag. The &#8220;full bag&#8221; minus all the used tiles (in players hands or on the board) gives you the tiles remaining. You can shuffle them whenever you like. You don&#8217;t have to keep the original shuffled order &#8211; that doesn&#8217;t affect the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what does a move look like? It can be tricky because a move can &#8220;wrap&#8221; around other letters or words on the board.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s three options:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Combine a starting point co-ordinate on the board with the entire word played. Oh, you&#8217;ll need a flag to say if it&#8217;s across or down too. For a 5-letter word, this would be 2 * 4-bit co-ordinates, a 1-bit flag, and 5 * 5-bit tiles. That&#8217;s 34 bits in total for a 5-letter word.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Same as 1, but you only store the played tiles, and you skip existing tiles when you replay moves onto the board. That might reduce the storage from option 1 by a bit (for some moves, by a LOT!)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have a list of played tiles, each with their coordinates. This would be 2 * 4-bit co-ordinates and a 5-bit tile per letter played. So 13 bits per letter, or 65 bits for a 5-letter word.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Option 3 seems inefficient, especially for longer words.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Option 2, in hindsight seems best. But I didn&#8217;t consider it at the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I went with option 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The internet says that the average number of words played in a game seems to be between 16 and 22 per player. It feels like a low-move game would have longer words. There&#8217;s 100 tiles. A 34-move game averages very close to 3 tiles per move. So that&#8217;s 8 + 1 + (3 * 5) = 24 bits per move, and 34 * 24 = 816 bits for an average-looking game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is better than storing a 1,125-bit board. It will vary per game, but we&#8217;ve reduced the ASCII character representation to 117 characters from 161. That&#8217;s pretty good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A conclusion on game storage<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So a minimal data set is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Array of moves at 5<em>n<\/em> + 9 bits per move and an average-looking game using around 816 bits.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Player tile &#8220;racks&#8221; at 5 * 7 = 35 bits each. 70 bits total.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it. Everything else &#8211; the board, the tile bag, the scores, can all be derived from this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this the most efficient way? I wouldn&#8217;t really know without some experimentation or writing some complicated formulae. There may be games where another encoding works better. But this seems good to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Working with bits in JavaScript<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said before, it&#8217;s not entirely easy working with individual bits in modern web development languages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m making a Scrabble-like web app, so JavaScript is the language I have to hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>JavaScript <em>does<\/em> provide operators for working with bits. But the difficulty is that its types are more abstract\/high level. And the JavaScript <code>Number<\/code> type doesn&#8217;t directly map whole numbers into Binary. All numbers in JavaScript are actually &#8220;floating point&#8221;, which means <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/JavaScript\/Reference\/Global_Objects\/Number#number_encoding\">they are stored in a complicated format<\/a> that&#8217;s suitable for both whole numbers (&#8220;integers&#8221;) and decimal numbers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HOWEVER&#8230; while I was thinking about this I remembered that JavaScript has a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/JavaScript\/Reference\/Global_Objects\/BigInt\">BigInt<\/a>&#8221; type for storing &#8220;Big Integers&#8221;. This sounds good. We need integers really.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And BigInt&#8217;s support <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/JavaScript\/Reference\/Operators#bitwise_shift_operators\">binary (&#8220;bitwise&#8221;) operators<\/a> like shifts (which move binary numbers left and right) and logical AND \/ OR. These are exactly what we need, and it seems that a BigInt is almost unlimited in size, and so a single BigInt can represent a Player, a Move, or an entire game!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is exactly what I need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>And just to note again, if you think this is all very interesting then I can highly recommend Julia Evan&#8217;s &#8220;Zine&#8221; (small-comic-book format) called &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/wizardzines.com\/zines\/integers-floats\/\">How Integers and Floats Work<\/a>&#8220;, and you can tinker with binary codes and numbers using her simple <a href=\"https:\/\/integer.exposed\/\">integer.exposed<\/a> tool.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A small library class for bitwise manipulation of BigInts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The BigInt&#8217;s worked out GREAT!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I found myself doing a lot of what I called &#8220;push&#8221; and &#8220;pop&#8221;, of bits like with Arrays. Like, &#8220;Here&#8217;s a number that&#8217;s less than 15. It&#8217;s 3 bits long. Please &#8220;push&#8221; it onto the right-hand side of my BigInt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(A push &#8220;left shifts&#8221; the bits of the BigInt to the left and then does a logical OR to add the new bits on. A pull does a logical &#8220;AND&#8221; of the BigInt with a mask like <code>1111111<\/code> to get the popped value, and then &#8220;right shifts&#8221; the BigInt to move everything along.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abstracting this made my encoding and decoding work much easier. And I included functions\/methods to convert the BigInt to and from both ASCII (7 bits at a time!) and then also into Base64, which can be sent in a URL! YAY!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see that little helper class in <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/94f7778a2cad77eb4520490ed61d99e1\">this Gist<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Making the game work<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With all that binary data representation done, I could get on with building the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that complex game UI and logic can be a bit tricky. I&#8217;ve got the game to a state where it works in it&#8217;s basic form. It&#8217;s playable. And that&#8217;s great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could write a whole other post about all the user interface concerns and algorithms for doing stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, it&#8217;s not <strong>hard<\/strong> hard. It&#8217;s not Tears of the Kingdom or Call of Duty. But for a little web-based side-project? There&#8217;s been a lot to think about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now I&#8217;m doing some simple play testing of the mechanic of sending links back and forth. Interestingly, most of the feedback I&#8217;ve had has either been about Scrabble stuff that I&#8217;ve not implemented yet, or about the UI. No one has really complained that sending links back and forth over messenger is annoying. So that&#8217;s good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why not give it a go? It&#8217;s at <a href=\"https:\/\/words.pico.games\/\">https:\/\/words.pico.games\/<\/a>, and it&#8217;s totally free. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me know what you think, but be sure to check GitHub issues before you report anything to see if I already know about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enjoy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><\/ol>\n",

        "content": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I made a completely free Scrabble-like game!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty much all the online Scrabble games I&#8217;ve played are bloated, ad-ridden, gamified things that need sign-ups and stuff to play. I hate all this. I just want to play games without all the crud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I make <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/02\/a-manifesto-for-small-static-web-apps\/\">simple web apps<\/a>. So why can&#8217;t I make a Scrabble clone?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I did! It&#8217;s still early days. Things don&#8217;t work or are broken. There are things it doesn&#8217;t do right. But this is kinda playable right now. Before you let me know things are broken please see if <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/static-word-game\/issues\">I already know about it<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/words.pico.games\/\">https:\/\/words.pico.games\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, this is not the BEST Scrabble clone. But it&#8217;s free, needs no sign up, has no ads. There are no catches. I just use <a href=\"https:\/\/usefathom.com\/ref\/SVE71E\">Fathom Analytics<\/a> to collect minimal, anonymised usage stats. That&#8217;s it! You can just play!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s something about it that the computer nerds will find interesting. I think. Read on if you want to know how this works because a static-file, multiplayer game without a login or database&#8230; how does that work?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How DOES it work? <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ages ago I heard a thing on a podcast, and I can&#8217;t even remember what it was, that made me wonder if you could have an online, multi-player, turn-based game where the game state is encoded in URLs and you just swap URLs with other people using messaging to take turns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could prove this with something very simple like tic-tac-toe. But that seemed TOO simple. And I love word games. So Scrabble seemed to be a reasonable step up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you are about to read is a technical deep-dive on encoding Scrabble games in URLs. This is kinda computer-sciencey stuff including binary representations of data, bitwise operations, and JavaScript &#8220;BigInts&#8221;. I hope it&#8217;s interesting to someone!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Aside: Scrabble(TM) is owned by Mattel and Hasbro and they have enforced their copyright over some aspects of the game in the past, so I&#8217;m cautious about naming it and using anything of the game that may be copyrighted.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Computer Science &#8211; a quick primer on binary representations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t talk a lot about &#8220;bits&#8221; in web development. The high-level languages we use, the speed of processing, and the memory we have available in computers nowadays means we don&#8217;t have to think about it much. But I want to do something <em>super<\/em> efficient here, so I&#8217;m turning to binary encoding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the hood, our computers use binary &#8211; 0&#8217;s and 1&#8217;s to represent data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whole numbers usually translate pretty directly. Zero is <code>0<\/code> in binary. Eight is <code>1000<\/code>. Thirteen is <code>1101<\/code>. I won&#8217;t go into why here. But bigger numbers take up more bits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boolean &#8220;true\/false&#8221; values can be represented in just a single bit!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Letters and characters? Well, they are also converted to numbers. Numbers are really all that we&#8217;ve got. And computers use standardised codes for this. Major standards for encoding text are ASCII and Unicode (sometimes known as UTF).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ASCII is pretty simple. Each character is given a number that fits into, say, 7 bits. 7 bits gives you numbers up to 128. That lets you have lower case and upper case Latin alphabet that we use for English, digits 0-9 and still have 66 slots for punctuation and other stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Aside: This is fine for English, but in the global world there&#8217;s a huge number of other characters we might want to use, and Unicode includes all sorts of non-Latin characters and all the emoji!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if you don&#8217;t need punctuation? In Scrabble you only need single-case letters (and blanks) on your tiles. That&#8217;s 27 options. And 27 options fit into just 5 bits. So can we just do that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course you can!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, if you know what the &#8220;shape&#8221; of your data is, you can really efficiently &#8220;encode&#8221; it in Binary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to propose, below, that data for a &#8220;player&#8221; in Scrabble is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A score that is a number between 0 and 1000<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A &#8220;rack&#8221; of tiles, that is a list of 7 letters<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We know this data &#8220;shape&#8221;. So if we can somehow manipulate individual bits we can store a player as a single string of bits. 10 bits for the score. And 5 bits for each letter. 45 bits in total.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This then raises questions though. Like, what if a player is at the end of the game and only has 4 tiles? Well, we can either use one of the spare (not-a-letter) 5-bit values to mean &#8220;empty&#8221;. OR&#8230; we could add another bit of data that says how many letters there are and only store those letters. The number 7 can be represented in 3 bits (<code>111<\/code>) so a player could be:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A score that is a number between 0 and 1000 (10 bits)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A count of the number of tiles in the rack (3 bits)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A &#8220;rack&#8221; of tiles, that is a list of <em>up to<\/em> 7 letters (5 bits each)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a trade off here. If we have 7 letters then we&#8217;re adding 3 bits for the count.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if we have less than 7 letters, we <em>save<\/em> at least 2 bits (5 fewer bits for a letter, but 3 added for the count). A player with just one tile saves 27 bits!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all super-nerdy stuff. But hopefully you see what I&#8217;m trying to do here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an issue though, and that&#8217;s that the languages we use on the web don&#8217;t necessarily make it easy to work with individual bits. I&#8217;ll come back to this later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, given we know we can use bits in this way, how can we represent a Scrabble game?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think this is all very interesting then I can highly recommend Julia Evan&#8217;s &#8220;Zine&#8221; (small-comic-book format) called &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/wizardzines.com\/zines\/integers-floats\/\">How Integers and Floats Work<\/a>&#8220;, and you can tinker with binary codes and numbers using her simple <a href=\"https:\/\/integer.exposed\/\">integer.exposed<\/a> tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Minimal Scrabble game representations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I started by wondering what the smallest way to represent a Scrabble-like game was. I don&#8217;t want URLs to get too long as I pass the game state around. So how can I do this efficiently?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things you COULD store are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The board.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a 15&#215;15 square grid where each square can be empty or contain a letter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A letter can be one of 26 things, or a blank (which is different to empty!). If we do a minimal binary representation, this fits into 5 bits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Representing the whole board would take up up to 1,125 bits. That 161, 7-bit ASCII characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could you compress this? Maybe by encoding multiple empty spaces somehow? Maybe. But that gets complicated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What else do we need?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Players<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Players have a tile rack &#8211; that&#8217;s up to 7 lots of 5-bits-per-tile. So 35 bits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Players also have a score. That could be up to 1000, so let&#8217;s give that 10 bits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll ignore names for now. I think we can do without that. Is that it? I think it is, as moves will be separate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a player can be up to 45 bits each. That&#8217;s 7, 7-bit ASCII characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Tile Bag<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You could choose to store the tile bag. There are 100 tiles, so this would be 100 * 5 = 500 bits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s another 72, 7-bit ASCII characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Summing up, if you were to store data in this way: board state, player state and tile bag, that&#8217;s a total of 1,715 bits, or 245 characters. Not bad I suppose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be some efficiencies to be gained somewhere. But it would either:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Be very minimal on average; or<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add complexity to the encoding<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But it feels like there&#8217;s some data duplication here. Perhaps we can do better?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Alternative: Store the Moves<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than storing the board and the player scores, we could just store a list of moves. This may be more efficient. But it may also be hard to tell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A list of moves can be &#8220;played back&#8221; onto the board to get player scores and the board state.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also don&#8217;t need to maintain a tile bag. The &#8220;full bag&#8221; minus all the used tiles (in players hands or on the board) gives you the tiles remaining. You can shuffle them whenever you like. You don&#8217;t have to keep the original shuffled order &#8211; that doesn&#8217;t affect the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what does a move look like? It can be tricky because a move can &#8220;wrap&#8221; around other letters or words on the board.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s three options:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Combine a starting point co-ordinate on the board with the entire word played. Oh, you&#8217;ll need a flag to say if it&#8217;s across or down too. For a 5-letter word, this would be 2 * 4-bit co-ordinates, a 1-bit flag, and 5 * 5-bit tiles. That&#8217;s 34 bits in total for a 5-letter word.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Same as 1, but you only store the played tiles, and you skip existing tiles when you replay moves onto the board. That might reduce the storage from option 1 by a bit (for some moves, by a LOT!)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have a list of played tiles, each with their coordinates. This would be 2 * 4-bit co-ordinates and a 5-bit tile per letter played. So 13 bits per letter, or 65 bits for a 5-letter word.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Option 3 seems inefficient, especially for longer words.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Option 2, in hindsight seems best. But I didn&#8217;t consider it at the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I went with option 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The internet says that the average number of words played in a game seems to be between 16 and 22 per player. It feels like a low-move game would have longer words. There&#8217;s 100 tiles. A 34-move game averages very close to 3 tiles per move. So that&#8217;s 8 + 1 + (3 * 5) = 24 bits per move, and 34 * 24 = 816 bits for an average-looking game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is better than storing a 1,125-bit board. It will vary per game, but we&#8217;ve reduced the ASCII character representation to 117 characters from 161. That&#8217;s pretty good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A conclusion on game storage<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So a minimal data set is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Array of moves at 5<em>n<\/em> + 9 bits per move and an average-looking game using around 816 bits.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Player tile &#8220;racks&#8221; at 5 * 7 = 35 bits each. 70 bits total.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it. Everything else &#8211; the board, the tile bag, the scores, can all be derived from this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this the most efficient way? I wouldn&#8217;t really know without some experimentation or writing some complicated formulae. There may be games where another encoding works better. But this seems good to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Working with bits in JavaScript<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said before, it&#8217;s not entirely easy working with individual bits in modern web development languages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m making a Scrabble-like web app, so JavaScript is the language I have to hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>JavaScript <em>does<\/em> provide operators for working with bits. But the difficulty is that its types are more abstract\/high level. And the JavaScript <code>Number<\/code> type doesn&#8217;t directly map whole numbers into Binary. All numbers in JavaScript are actually &#8220;floating point&#8221;, which means <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/JavaScript\/Reference\/Global_Objects\/Number#number_encoding\">they are stored in a complicated format<\/a> that&#8217;s suitable for both whole numbers (&#8220;integers&#8221;) and decimal numbers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HOWEVER&#8230; while I was thinking about this I remembered that JavaScript has a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/JavaScript\/Reference\/Global_Objects\/BigInt\">BigInt<\/a>&#8221; type for storing &#8220;Big Integers&#8221;. This sounds good. We need integers really.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And BigInt&#8217;s support <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/JavaScript\/Reference\/Operators#bitwise_shift_operators\">binary (&#8220;bitwise&#8221;) operators<\/a> like shifts (which move binary numbers left and right) and logical AND \/ OR. These are exactly what we need, and it seems that a BigInt is almost unlimited in size, and so a single BigInt can represent a Player, a Move, or an entire game!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is exactly what I need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>And just to note again, if you think this is all very interesting then I can highly recommend Julia Evan&#8217;s &#8220;Zine&#8221; (small-comic-book format) called &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/wizardzines.com\/zines\/integers-floats\/\">How Integers and Floats Work<\/a>&#8220;, and you can tinker with binary codes and numbers using her simple <a href=\"https:\/\/integer.exposed\/\">integer.exposed<\/a> tool.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A small library class for bitwise manipulation of BigInts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The BigInt&#8217;s worked out GREAT!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I found myself doing a lot of what I called &#8220;push&#8221; and &#8220;pop&#8221;, of bits like with Arrays. Like, &#8220;Here&#8217;s a number that&#8217;s less than 15. It&#8217;s 3 bits long. Please &#8220;push&#8221; it onto the right-hand side of my BigInt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(A push &#8220;left shifts&#8221; the bits of the BigInt to the left and then does a logical OR to add the new bits on. A pull does a logical &#8220;AND&#8221; of the BigInt with a mask like <code>1111111<\/code> to get the popped value, and then &#8220;right shifts&#8221; the BigInt to move everything along.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abstracting this made my encoding and decoding work much easier. And I included functions\/methods to convert the BigInt to and from both ASCII (7 bits at a time!) and then also into Base64, which can be sent in a URL! YAY!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see that little helper class in <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/94f7778a2cad77eb4520490ed61d99e1\">this Gist<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Making the game work<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With all that binary data representation done, I could get on with building the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that complex game UI and logic can be a bit tricky. I&#8217;ve got the game to a state where it works in it&#8217;s basic form. It&#8217;s playable. And that&#8217;s great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could write a whole other post about all the user interface concerns and algorithms for doing stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, it&#8217;s not <strong>hard<\/strong> hard. It&#8217;s not Tears of the Kingdom or Call of Duty. But for a little web-based side-project? There&#8217;s been a lot to think about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now I&#8217;m doing some simple play testing of the mechanic of sending links back and forth. Interestingly, most of the feedback I&#8217;ve had has either been about Scrabble stuff that I&#8217;ve not implemented yet, or about the UI. No one has really complained that sending links back and forth over messenger is annoying. So that&#8217;s good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why not give it a go? It&#8217;s at <a href=\"https:\/\/words.pico.games\/\">https:\/\/words.pico.games\/<\/a>, and it&#8217;s totally free. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me know what you think, but be sure to check GitHub issues before you report anything to see if I already know about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enjoy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><\/ol>\n",

We do, and few years back several of our neighbours all had timber garden rooms installed.We thought about it at the time, but the Actual Office space worked better.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1863-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-255374\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1863-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1863-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1863-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1863.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>We DO have a big enough garden!<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/DSC00244-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"A photo of our garden including two large sheds.\" class=\"wp-image-255362\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/DSC00244-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/DSC00244-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/DSC00244-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/DSC00244.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Our garden &#8211; in times when we had time to tend it &#8211; showing the old sheds.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Then two years ago, my dad had a garden office installed as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so this was our post-Actual-Office plan: get a garden room to work from!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choosing a room<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My dad was really happy with his garden office. He got it from a company called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boothsgardenstudios.co.uk\/\">Booths Garden Studios<\/a> and they have this system which I&#8217;ve not seen anywhere else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They build from pre-fabricated panels. Which means they can assemble most studios in a day and they can build them right up to a fence or wall (they claim to within 2 inches!!). They are also &#8220;portable&#8221;, which means you can take them with you to a new home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The studios sit on legs which don&#8217;t need full concrete foundations, and which can be extended in case you are on sloped or uneven ground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their studios, while timber-framed, are steel-clad, which means you don&#8217;t need to do maintenance\/timber treatment to keep them in good condition, and they have a 25 year guarantee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they are short enough that you don&#8217;t normally need planning permission as it falls within &#8220;permitted development&#8221; in most cases. Hooray!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We liked all of this, and they&#8217;re pretty good value too (in fact it was hard to find something that came in cheaper). So we decided to follow in my father&#8217;s footsteps and order from Booths.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Booths were just brilliant with their service. Because the studios are so flecible, they don&#8217;t need to do a site visit. But I emailed their sales team a LOT and requested multiple design tweaks and lots of information from them. They were always so happy to help and quick to respond. They even &#8220;down-sold&#8221; me, suggesting I remove options that I probably didn&#8217;t need. They really want the right thing for their customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clearing space<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see in the photo above our existing two sheds. One is steel, and happens to be on a concrete base (albeit not a very flat one!). The other is wood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s worth saying that the people that owned our house before we did it did substantial renovations, and it turns out a lot of it was done in the cheapest possible way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That wooden shed though&#8230; flippin&#8217; solid that is! Took me ages to take it apart! And there was a LOT of wood in various conditions to get rid of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it was that I spent many weekends disassembling and dismantling the two sheds and getting rid of a lot of their contents. There was a LOT of moving stuff around, and we chose to just do multiple trips to the tip (waste and recycling centre) rather than hire a skip.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It literally took weeks! And we&#8217;re still not quite finished with getting rid of stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1885.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-id=\"255368\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1885-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-255368\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1885-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1885-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1885-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1885.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Dismantling the wooden shed<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1902.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-id=\"255364\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1902-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-255364\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1902-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1902-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1902-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1902.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The steel shed full of stuff<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1981.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-id=\"255365\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1981-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-255365\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1981-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1981-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1981-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1981.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Clearing and dismantling the roof<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1995.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-id=\"255371\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1995-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-255371\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1995-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1995-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1995-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1995.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Tin shed part-disassembled<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2013.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-id=\"255369\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2013-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-255369\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2013-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2013-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2013-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2013.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">IT&#8217;S DONE!

Unlike a room in a house it is exposed on all sides. So it may be a bit chilly. But we can live with that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2144.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-id=\"255384\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2144-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-255384\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2144-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2144-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2144-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2144.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2145.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-id=\"255385\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2145-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-255385\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2145-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2145-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2145-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2145.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2146.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-id=\"255386\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2146-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-255386\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2146-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2146-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2146-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_2146.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Moving in &#8211; and out!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The was then just the matter of the old office.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turns out you accumulate a lot of stuff in ten years.

        "content": "\n<p><em>I have just moved out of my old &#8220;proper office&#8221; and into a new garden studio. Here&#8217;s why and how!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a few years&#8230; wait, what&#8217;s that you say&#8230; ten?! TEN years? No way! Wow. I&#8217;d never have thought it was that long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For TEN whole years, I&#8217;ve been sharing an office with another guy who&#8217;s a lot like me. It&#8217;s a <em>really<\/em> good value office, especially when you&#8217;re only paying for half of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the other guy got into a good routine of working from home over the pandemic lockdowns and has hardly been in for the last couple of years. For him it&#8217;s mostly been an expensive store room!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our lease was up in June and so we had to decide&#8230; should we take on another two years? And the answer was &#8220;no&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I found myself needing to move out at relatively short notice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get a room!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Garden rooms are all the rage &#8211; if you&#8217;re fortunate enough to have a big enough garden. We do, and few years back several of our neighbours all had timber garden rooms installed.We thought about it at the time, but the Actual Office space worked better.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1863-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-255374\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1863-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1863-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1863-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_1863.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>We DO have a big enough garden!<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/DSC00244-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"A photo of our garden including two large sheds.\" class=\"wp-image-255362\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/DSC00244-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/DSC00244-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/DSC00244-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/DSC00244.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Our garden &#8211; in times when we had time to tend it &#8211; showing the old sheds.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Then two years ago, my dad had a garden office installed as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so this was our post-Actual-Office plan: get a garden room to work from!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choosing a room<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My dad was really happy with his garden office. He got it from a company called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boothsgardenstudios.co.uk\/\">Booths Garden Studios<\/a> and they have this system which I&#8217;ve not seen anywhere else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They build from pre-fabricated panels. Which means they can assemble most studios in a day and they can build them right up to a fence or wall (they claim to within 2 inches!!). They are also &#8220;portable&#8221;, which means you can take them with you to a new home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The studios sit on legs which don&#8217;t need full concrete foundations, and which can be extended in case you are on sloped or uneven ground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their studios, while timber-framed, are steel-clad, which means you don&#8217;t need to do maintenance\/timber treatment to keep them in good condition, and they have a 25 year guarantee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they are short enough that you don&#8217;t normally need planning permission as it falls within &#8220;permitted development&#8221; in most cases. Hooray!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We liked all of this, and they&#8217;re pretty good value too (in fact it was hard to find something that came in cheaper). So we decided to follow in my father&#8217;s footsteps and order from Booths.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Booths were just brilliant with their service. Because the studios are so flecible, they don&#8217;t need to do a site visit. But I emailed their sales team a LOT and requested multiple design tweaks and lots of information from them. They were always so happy to help and quick to respond. They even &#8220;down-sold&#8221; me, suggesting I remove options that I probably didn&#8217;t need. They really want the right thing for their customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clearing space<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see in the photo above our existing two sheds. One is steel, and happens to be on a concrete base (albeit not a very flat one!). The other is wood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s worth saying that the people that owned our house before we did it did substantial renovations, and it turns out a lot of it was done in the cheapest possible way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That wooden shed though&#8230; flippin&#8217; solid that is! Took me ages to take it apart! And there was a LOT of wood in various conditions to get rid of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it was that I spent many weekends disassembling and dismantling the two sheds and getting rid of a lot of their contents.

Almost. I not-very-secretly hoped that at some point I would move from developing the Delicious Brains websites to developing the Delicious Brains products that the websites were selling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, Delicious Brains was bought by WP Engine. And because I was in the web development team, I moved into the equivalent team. Which happened to be in the marketing department.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ve inhabited this strange role of being a highly technical engineer working in a department of not-engineers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My team has been completely wonderful. My boss is awesome, and my colleagues are some of the best engineers I&#8217;ve ever worked with. They work hard, but they have fun too. They are a friendly and smart bunch of people who care a lot about their work and the team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the direction of the team is very much marketing and front-end. That&#8217;s not really a direction that suits me, and therefore I&#8217;m not really a person that suits the direction. Someone else will be better suited to this team&#8217;s future than I am.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you&#8217;re a senior level developer who is experienced in WordPress and React, has experience of making custom blocks, and is looking for a remote role in a busy marketing team, you could <a href=\"https:\/\/wpeng.in\/webdev\/\">backfill my role<\/a>!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when an engineering role came up in one of the Delicious Brains product teams, all these historic and future things combined into an obvious application. I apparently made a good impression. I got the job and started today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a bittersweet decision to leave marketing and web dev &#8211; I&#8217;m sad to leave my friends and colleagues in the old team. But I know it&#8217;s the right thing for me to try this new thing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Day one was good. I&#8217;m hoping to have made my first PRs on day two. And I&#8217;m looking forward to working on a set of products I&#8217;ve been a user of for over 10 years!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(My first WP Migrate DB Pro order was an order number less than 1800. My latest order number was over 111,100! I was an early customer, for sure!)<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I have a new job!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, after ten years of freelance web development, I applied for a web developer job at Delicious Brains. It was a dream job. Almost. I not-very-secretly hoped that at some point I would move from developing the Delicious Brains websites to developing the Delicious Brains products that the websites were selling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, Delicious Brains was bought by WP Engine. And because I was in the web development team, I moved into the equivalent team. Which happened to be in the marketing department.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ve inhabited this strange role of being a highly technical engineer working in a department of not-engineers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My team has been completely wonderful. My boss is awesome, and my colleagues are some of the best engineers I&#8217;ve ever worked with. They work hard, but they have fun too. They are a friendly and smart bunch of people who care a lot about their work and the team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the direction of the team is very much marketing and front-end. That&#8217;s not really a direction that suits me, and therefore I&#8217;m not really a person that suits the direction. Someone else will be better suited to this team&#8217;s future than I am.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you&#8217;re a senior level developer who is experienced in WordPress and React, has experience of making custom blocks, and is looking for a remote role in a busy marketing team, you could <a href=\"https:\/\/wpeng.in\/webdev\/\">backfill my role<\/a>!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when an engineering role came up in one of the Delicious Brains product teams, all these historic and future things combined into an obvious application. I apparently made a good impression. I got the job and started today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a bittersweet decision to leave marketing and web dev &#8211; I&#8217;m sad to leave my friends and colleagues in the old team. But I know it&#8217;s the right thing for me to try this new thing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Day one was good. I&#8217;m hoping to have made my first PRs on day two. And I&#8217;m looking forward to working on a set of products I&#8217;ve been a user of for over 10 years!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(My first WP Migrate DB Pro order was an order number less than 1800. My latest order number was over 111,100! I was an early customer, for sure!)<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>This is really turning into a blog about coding. Apologies to less nerdy followers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to talk (<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/03\/readable-code-tips-intro\/\">again<\/a>) about friction. Things that slow us down. How some friction is good, and some is bad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Deterring thieves<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My classic example of &#8220;friction&#8221; is the lock on the door of your house. There is some ideal world in which you don&#8217;t need a lock on your door. Everyone can be trusted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes life easier for you. You don&#8217;t need to carry keys. You don&#8217;t risk losing keys. You can easily get into your house while carrying 6 bags of shopping. Your children can come and go as they please. That would be a nice world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the lock is a necessary piece of friction. It slows you down, but it has the benefit of keeping unwanted people out of your house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equally, there might be a world in which you need more than one lock. Perhaps a locked bar across the door. Perhaps an additional electronic lock with biometrics.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/edna-mode-typing.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-255394\" style=\"width:459px;height:auto\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>This might be necessary &#8220;good friction&#8221; in some crazy world. But it might be &#8220;bad friction&#8221; too &#8211; you&#8217;ve overdone it and caused yourself a ton of cost and frequent inconvenience for no real benefit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You can do this with code too<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m a staunch advocate of static analysis. I used to wonder why people cluttered up their code with docblocks, but now I have tooling that uses typehints in them, I can really see the benefit and I encourage them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Docblocks and typehints <em>can <\/em>be good friction. Yes, they can slow you down a bit, but used wisely they can detect some errors early, ensure you handle edge cases, speed up code review, and give you more confidence in your code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230; despite being a static analysis advocate, I know that it can be used badly, and so I&#8217;m an advocate of cautious and incremental adoption. Use types and static analysis where they help you. Don&#8217;t use them when they are in the way and <em>not<\/em> helping. That&#8217;s silly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bad use of TypeScript seems to be particularly common. On <a href=\"https:\/\/shoptalkshow.com\/623\/#t=36:10\">Shop Talk Show this week<\/a> Dave and Chris were discussing using AI coding tools like Co-Pilot and they said this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;Part of it&#8217;s like TypeScript&#8217;s mad and I don&#8217;t know how to make it un-mad. It&#8217;s like &#8216;Just tell me what to do&#8230; make it shut up.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I love hovering over a red TypeScript thing, scrolling down to the bottom of the tool tip and saying &#8216;Fix with Co-Pilot&#8217;&#8230; and if it fixes it, I don&#8217;t care&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is just really sad. This is bad friction. If types aren&#8217;t helping you, get them the hell outta the way! Stop using them. They&#8217;re not bringing you value (the &#8220;I don&#8217;t care&#8221; bit) and they&#8217;re slowing you down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, like Chris and Dave, find TypeScript is too demanding. BUT I can get a lot of value out of using <a href=\"https:\/\/jsdoc.app\/\">JSDoc<\/a> &#8211; it can get you as much of TypeScript as you want without even needing any build process. You can get the benefit of adding in some simple type information without going overboard and tying yourself in knots just because your editor showed some red lines and you fixed them with AI without really understanding what was going on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@trukrs\/type-safe-javascript-with-jsdoc-7a2a63209b76\">This excellent post<\/a> was what inspired me and got me going on this JSDoc journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because JSDoc can just be sprinkled in when you need it, it can be adopted incrementally in an additive way. It can be done as &#8220;good friction&#8221;!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Yes, there is probably some way to do this with TypeScript as well, but I&#8217;ve not seen it done in practice.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nico Verbruggen <a href=\"https:\/\/phpc.social\/@nicoverbruggen\/112756665388007959\">said today<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Friction is always the bottleneck.<br><br>When APIs don&#8217;t work as expected.<br>When things break in obtuse ways.<br>When tests are flakey.<br>When clients change their mind.<br><br>It&#8217;s almost always friction that slows software development down.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I totally agree. But these are all examples of bad friction. And I also think that friction <em>can<\/em> speed us up, and make us better developers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you need just enough of it, and not too much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the difficult wisdom is knowing how much friction is good.<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Friction",
        "content": "\n<p>This is really turning into a blog about coding. Apologies to less nerdy followers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to talk (<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/03\/readable-code-tips-intro\/\">again<\/a>) about friction. Things that slow us down. How some friction is good, and some is bad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Deterring thieves<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My classic example of &#8220;friction&#8221; is the lock on the door of your house. There is some ideal world in which you don&#8217;t need a lock on your door. Everyone can be trusted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes life easier for you. You don&#8217;t need to carry keys. You don&#8217;t risk losing keys. You can easily get into your house while carrying 6 bags of shopping. Your children can come and go as they please. That would be a nice world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the lock is a necessary piece of friction. It slows you down, but it has the benefit of keeping unwanted people out of your house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equally, there might be a world in which you need more than one lock. Perhaps a locked bar across the door. Perhaps an additional electronic lock with biometrics.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/edna-mode-typing.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-255394\" style=\"width:459px;height:auto\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>This might be necessary &#8220;good friction&#8221; in some crazy world. But it might be &#8220;bad friction&#8221; too &#8211; you&#8217;ve overdone it and caused yourself a ton of cost and frequent inconvenience for no real benefit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You can do this with code too<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m a staunch advocate of static analysis. I used to wonder why people cluttered up their code with docblocks, but now I have tooling that uses typehints in them, I can really see the benefit and I encourage them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Docblocks and typehints <em>can <\/em>be good friction. Yes, they can slow you down a bit, but used wisely they can detect some errors early, ensure you handle edge cases, speed up code review, and give you more confidence in your code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230; despite being a static analysis advocate, I know that it can be used badly, and so I&#8217;m an advocate of cautious and incremental adoption. Use types and static analysis where they help you. Don&#8217;t use them when they are in the way and <em>not<\/em> helping. That&#8217;s silly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bad use of TypeScript seems to be particularly common. On <a href=\"https:\/\/shoptalkshow.com\/623\/#t=36:10\">Shop Talk Show this week<\/a> Dave and Chris were discussing using AI coding tools like Co-Pilot and they said this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;Part of it&#8217;s like TypeScript&#8217;s mad and I don&#8217;t know how to make it un-mad. It&#8217;s like &#8216;Just tell me what to do&#8230; make it shut up.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I love hovering over a red TypeScript thing, scrolling down to the bottom of the tool tip and saying &#8216;Fix with Co-Pilot&#8217;&#8230; and if it fixes it, I don&#8217;t care&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is just really sad. This is bad friction. If types aren&#8217;t helping you, get them the hell outta the way! Stop using them. They&#8217;re not bringing you value (the &#8220;I don&#8217;t care&#8221; bit) and they&#8217;re slowing you down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, like Chris and Dave, find TypeScript is too demanding. BUT I can get a lot of value out of using <a href=\"https:\/\/jsdoc.app\/\">JSDoc<\/a> &#8211; it can get you as much of TypeScript as you want without even needing any build process. You can get the benefit of adding in some simple type information without going overboard and tying yourself in knots just because your editor showed some red lines and you fixed them with AI without really understanding what was going on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@trukrs\/type-safe-javascript-with-jsdoc-7a2a63209b76\">This excellent post<\/a> was what inspired me and got me going on this JSDoc journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because JSDoc can just be sprinkled in when you need it, it can be adopted incrementally in an additive way. It can be done as &#8220;good friction&#8221;!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Yes, there is probably some way to do this with TypeScript as well, but I&#8217;ve not seen it done in practice.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nico Verbruggen <a href=\"https:\/\/phpc.social\/@nicoverbruggen\/112756665388007959\">said today<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Friction is always the bottleneck.<br><br>When APIs don&#8217;t work as expected.<br>When things break in obtuse ways.<br>When tests are flakey.<br>When clients change their mind.<br><br>It&#8217;s almost always friction that slows software development down.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I totally agree. But these are all examples of bad friction. And I also think that friction <em>can<\/em> speed us up, and make us better developers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you need just enough of it, and not too much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the difficult wisdom is knowing how much friction is good.<\/p>\n",

Because in many cases, not doing this can be confusing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s see some examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a variable that tells us if a file has a .txt extension.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$txtExtension = pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION) === 'txt'\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>But&#8230; with that name, it could mean &#8220;here is the string that is used for a text file extension&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This variable tells us if a file has a txt extension. So let&#8217;s name it appropriately:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$fileHasTxtExtension = pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION) === 'txt'\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I see this <em>a lot<\/em>! And it&#8217;s a really simple improvement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a Boolean function\/method:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction textFile(string $filename) : bool {\n    ...\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I mean, the name is just really confusing. It could do anything. But if the intention is to test if the filename is that of a text file, then say so!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction isTextFile($filename) {\n    ...\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bonus related weird programming fact<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the first languages I learned properly was the functional language &#8220;Scheme&#8221;, which was like Lisp with training wheels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was <a href=\"https:\/\/lisp-lang.org\/style-guide\/#predicates\">a convention in Lisp<\/a> that a &#8220;predicate&#8221; (a function that returned <code>t<\/code> or <code>nil<\/code>, which are equivalent to <code>true<\/code> and <code>false<\/code>) would be named with a <code>p<\/code> or <code>-p<\/code> suffix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I still think of this sometimes. Can I ask my wife if she wants a cup of tea by asking &#8220;Tea-P?&#8221; (No, I don&#8217;t. Never. Ever.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think <code>function textFileP( $filename )<\/code>isn&#8217;t quite as clear, but know that naming conventions like this are proper old!<\/p>\n",

Because in many cases, not doing this can be confusing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s see some examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a variable that tells us if a file has a .txt extension.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$txtExtension = pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION) === 'txt'\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>But&#8230; with that name, it could mean &#8220;here is the string that is used for a text file extension&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This variable tells us if a file has a txt extension. So let&#8217;s name it appropriately:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$fileHasTxtExtension = pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION) === 'txt'\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I see this <em>a lot<\/em>! And it&#8217;s a really simple improvement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a Boolean function\/method:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction textFile(string $filename) : bool {\n    ...\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I mean, the name is just really confusing. It could do anything. But if the intention is to test if the filename is that of a text file, then say so!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction isTextFile($filename) {\n    ...\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bonus related weird programming fact<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the first languages I learned properly was the functional language &#8220;Scheme&#8221;, which was like Lisp with training wheels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was <a href=\"https:\/\/lisp-lang.org\/style-guide\/#predicates\">a convention in Lisp<\/a> that a &#8220;predicate&#8221; (a function that returned <code>t<\/code> or <code>nil<\/code>, which are equivalent to <code>true<\/code> and <code>false<\/code>) would be named with a <code>p<\/code> or <code>-p<\/code> suffix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I still think of this sometimes. Can I ask my wife if she wants a cup of tea by asking &#8220;Tea-P?&#8221; (No, I don&#8217;t. Never. Ever.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think <code>function textFileP( $filename )<\/code>isn&#8217;t quite as clear, but know that naming conventions like this are proper old!<\/p>\n",

It looks like Jon is still using this model 2 years later for <a href=\"https:\/\/organizewp.com\/checkout\/\">OrganizeWP<\/a>. So maybe it worked? Or maybe he&#8217;s just not worked on the product much.

This is now dead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interesting because this week I have seen people asking why WordPress companies don&#8217;t use WordPress for other things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. StellarWP Releases Open-Source Libraries for Advanced WordPress Development<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/stellarwp.com\/stellarwp-releases-open-source-libraries-for-advanced-wordpress-development\/\">https:\/\/stellarwp.com\/stellarwp-releases-open-source-libraries-for-advanced-wordpress-development\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>StellarWP is a brand with some big WP plugin properties. This introduces us to <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/stellarwp\">their open source libraries<\/a> and explains why they see it as a positive thing to share their work. Nice!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Web Scraping With PHP by darshankhandelwal12<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/serpdog.io\/blog\/web-scraping-with-php\/\">https:\/\/serpdog.io\/blog\/web-scraping-with-php\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a from-scratch tutorial (like, it starts with how to set up PHP!) on web scraping. I probably bookmarked it because it references <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FriendsOfPHP\/Goutte\">Goutte<\/a> &#8211; a now archived screen scraping and web crawling library for PHP. Seems to have been replaced by <a href=\"https:\/\/symfony.com\/doc\/current\/components\/browser_kit.html#making-external-http-requests\">Symfony&#8217;s HttpBrowser<\/a> component. So I&#8217;ll bookmark that!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. No Sponsors ??<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>https:\/\/git.joinfirefish.org\/<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This seems defunct. It says &#8220;No Sponsors &#8211; git.joinfirefish.org currently does not have any sponsors for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Open feedback as a gift<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/werd.io\/2023\/a-tool-for-open-feedback-as-a-gift\">https:\/\/werd.io\/2023\/a-tool-for-open-feedback-as-a-gift<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oooh, I like this. We need feedback to thrive. We can&#8217;t get better if we don&#8217;t know what we are doing wrong. But giving and receiving feedback is hard. So frameworks can be helpful for ensuring we all get better together! Yay!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. \u201cI want to communicate and be understood, but it\u2019s a struggle\u201d &#8211; apolitical<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/apolitical.co\/solution-articles\/en\/i-want-to-communicate-and-be-understood-but-its-a-struggle\">https:\/\/apolitical.co\/solution-articles\/en\/i-want-to-communicate-and-be-understood-but-its-a-struggle<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember reading this. It&#8217;s about what it&#8217;s like for an autistic person to communicate with a neurotypical person: It&#8217;s exhausting! And enlightening to read about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Using Custom Templates with Rewrite Rules in WordPress Plugins &#8211; Tom Mcfarlin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My thoughts on this, in order, were:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/tommcfarlin.com\/custom-templates-with-rewrite-rules\/\">https:\/\/tommcfarlin.com\/custom-templates-with-rewrite-rules\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>How does Tom capitalise his surname? It&#8217;s all caps on the site so I can&#8217;t tell.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wow, he&#8217;s still using the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/themes\/hemingway\/\">Hemingway theme<\/a>! That&#8217;s 10 years old. I used that for a while. It&#8217;s stood the test of time. I like it!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What on earth is this about? One of those sadly-necessary, word-soup WordPress things.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wait, I was fighting rewrite rules today. This might be useful. Bookmarked!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10.

So I&#8217;m going to set myself the challenge of blogging them as I close them down. 10 a day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am <em>terrible<\/em> at keeping up streaks like this but let&#8217;s get started and see what happens. I&#8217;m going oldest to newest. Let&#8217;s see what I was looking at a LONG time ago&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Rethinking WordPress Product Pricing Models by Jon Christopher<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jonchristopher.us\/blog\/rethinking-wordpress-product-pricing-models\/\">https:\/\/jonchristopher.us\/blog\/rethinking-wordpress-product-pricing-models\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t even know this person&#8217;s name but this sounds interesting. It&#8217;s from 2022. Has it been open THAT LONG\u203d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I skim-read this. It&#8217;s a look at how you could use paying for major software updates as a source of recurring revenue. It looks like Jon is still using this model 2 years later for <a href=\"https:\/\/organizewp.com\/checkout\/\">OrganizeWP<\/a>. So maybe it worked? Or maybe he&#8217;s just not worked on the product much. Hard to tell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside: I use this model for <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. What is a WordPress developer? &#8211; Post Status<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/poststatus.com\/what-is-a-wordpress-developer\">https:\/\/poststatus.com\/what-is-a-wordpress-developer<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a link to a podcast episode that I think I listened too. I probably had opinions. Not bookmarked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Finding a new home for the WordPress community &#8211; Mike McAlister<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/olliewp.com\/finding-a-new-home-for-the-wordpress-community\/\">https:\/\/olliewp.com\/finding-a-new-home-for-the-wordpress-community\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back at the end of 2022, while Elon&#8217;s Twitter acquisition was new, Mike was asking how we might use WordPress to power the WordPress community, rather than a proprietary social network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time there was lots of interest and he spun up <code>openpress.social<\/code>. This is now dead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interesting because this week I have seen people asking why WordPress companies don&#8217;t use WordPress for other things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. StellarWP Releases Open-Source Libraries for Advanced WordPress Development<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/stellarwp.com\/stellarwp-releases-open-source-libraries-for-advanced-wordpress-development\/\">https:\/\/stellarwp.com\/stellarwp-releases-open-source-libraries-for-advanced-wordpress-development\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>StellarWP is a brand with some big WP plugin properties. This introduces us to <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/stellarwp\">their open source libraries<\/a> and explains why they see it as a positive thing to share their work. Nice!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Web Scraping With PHP by darshankhandelwal12<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/serpdog.io\/blog\/web-scraping-with-php\/\">https:\/\/serpdog.io\/blog\/web-scraping-with-php\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a from-scratch tutorial (like, it starts with how to set up PHP!) on web scraping. I probably bookmarked it because it references <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FriendsOfPHP\/Goutte\">Goutte<\/a> &#8211; a now archived screen scraping and web crawling library for PHP. Seems to have been replaced by <a href=\"https:\/\/symfony.com\/doc\/current\/components\/browser_kit.html#making-external-http-requests\">Symfony&#8217;s HttpBrowser<\/a> component. So I&#8217;ll bookmark that!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. No Sponsors ??<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>https:\/\/git.joinfirefish.org\/<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This seems defunct. It says &#8220;No Sponsors &#8211; git.joinfirefish.org currently does not have any sponsors for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Open feedback as a gift<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/werd.io\/2023\/a-tool-for-open-feedback-as-a-gift\">https:\/\/werd.io\/2023\/a-tool-for-open-feedback-as-a-gift<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oooh, I like this. We need feedback to thrive. We can&#8217;t get better if we don&#8217;t know what we are doing wrong. But giving and receiving feedback is hard. So frameworks can be helpful for ensuring we all get better together! Yay!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. \u201cI want to communicate and be understood, but it\u2019s a struggle\u201d &#8211; apolitical<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/apolitical.co\/solution-articles\/en\/i-want-to-communicate-and-be-understood-but-its-a-struggle\">https:\/\/apolitical.co\/solution-articles\/en\/i-want-to-communicate-and-be-understood-but-its-a-struggle<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember reading this. It&#8217;s about what it&#8217;s like for an autistic person to communicate with a neurotypical person: It&#8217;s exhausting! And enlightening to read about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Using Custom Templates with Rewrite Rules in WordPress Plugins &#8211; Tom Mcfarlin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My thoughts on this, in order, were:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/tommcfarlin.com\/custom-templates-with-rewrite-rules\/\">https:\/\/tommcfarlin.com\/custom-templates-with-rewrite-rules\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>How does Tom capitalise his surname? It&#8217;s all caps on the site so I can&#8217;t tell.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wow, he&#8217;s still using the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/themes\/hemingway\/\">Hemingway theme<\/a>! That&#8217;s 10 years old. I used that for a while. It&#8217;s stood the test of time. I like it!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What on earth is this about? One of those sadly-necessary, word-soup WordPress things.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wait, I was fighting rewrite rules today. This might be useful. Bookmarked!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. At last, marshmallows from a spray can &#8211; Axios<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2023\/06\/26\/marshmallows-whipped-cream-aerosol-spray-can\">https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2023\/06\/26\/marshmallows-whipped-cream-aerosol-spray-can<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Might just leave this one open, tbh. \ud83e\udd23<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><\/ol>\n",
