I work in IT and I have a degree in Software Engineering.\u00a0 But I like to think that I break the mould slightly.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t fit the stereotype of\u00a0 software developer or IT operations, and part of that that is that I claim no real close affinity with any particular technology.\u00a0 I use what works for me and that&#8217;s not always the thing that the stereotypical &#8220;techie&#8221; would use.<\/p>\n<p>And so, you might ask, what sort of mobile device does a person like me have?<\/p>\n<h2><!--more-->A bit of history<\/h2>\n<p>Well. I loved, I dearly loved, my little Sony Ericsson mobile that I used up until about January.\u00a0 I&#8217;d had several and they&#8217;d always been good phones: quick, reliable, easy to use.\u00a0 I confess that I hold a bit of a grudge against Nokia because, though they were at the heart of the cheap mobile phone revolution 10 or 12 years ago, their user interfaces became shockingly bad at one point, and I&#8217;ve not gone back.<\/p>\n<p>But times have changed.\u00a0 Technology relentlessly advances.\u00a0 I (sort of) <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/pods-and-parcels\/\">won an iPod Touch in a competition<\/a>.\u00a0 I <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/10\/on-having-the-touch\/\">thought it was pretty good<\/a>, but being tethered to WiFi, and not having a camera or microphone or GPS\u00a0 limited its capability.\u00a0 And as a social media user, blogger, and now fledgling part-time freelancer, a smart phone was looking more and more like the thing that I needed.<\/p>\n<p>A friend of mine told me at the time that &#8220;An iPod Touch is just training wheels for an iPhone&#8221;.\u00a0 But I&#8217;ve always been put off by the cost of iPhones.\u00a0 Yes, the iPod Touch is BRILLIANT, but I can buy a decent laptop for the cost of an iPhone.\u00a0 The value &#8211; the ratio of usefulness and quality to cost &#8211; of an iPhone has always been too low.<\/p>\n<h2>Taking the Pulse<\/h2>\n<p>I then saw <a title=\"Reg Hardware T-Mobile Pulse Review\" href=\"http:\/\/www.reghardware.com\/2009\/11\/03\/review_smartphone_t_mobile_pulse\/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">this review<\/a> of a T-Mobile&#8217;s first pay-as-you-go Android phone, the Pulse.\u00a0 Coming in at around \u00a3150 it looked like good value and after my lovely wife&#8217;s not-so-lovely experience of a semi-smart phone with a resistive touchscreen, and my very good experience of the iPod, one of the key things I was looking for was a capacitive screen<sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-859-1' id='fnref-859-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(859)'>1<\/a><\/sup>, which the Pulse had!<\/p>\n<p>At the time (January this year), Pulse&#8217;s were like hotcakes and the cheapest way to buy one was on eBay, and I got a good deal on a hardly-used second-hand one.<\/p>\n<p>And, to be honest, it was a little disappointing.\u00a0 It ran an older version of Android (v1.5) and was slow and unresponsive at times.\u00a0 The phone had a very small amount of built-in memory and Android, without hacking it, doesn&#8217;t let you store applications on the memory card, so I was limited in how much useful stuff I could do with it.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, this device was one third of the cost of an iPhone, but has 3G, WiFi, a camera, GPS, an electronic compass, a capacitive screen, all the things I wanted, and is incredibly useful.\u00a0 But the hardware just doesn&#8217;t have the power to cope with all it can do.\u00a0 The usefulness and quality to cost ratio is kept low by the quality and, specifically, it&#8217;s a nightmare using it as a phone!<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really want to hack or &#8220;Jailbreak&#8221; my phone, for fear of breaking something that&#8217;s incredibly useful to me, but T-Mobile did eventually release an Android update to version 2.1.\u00a0 This has vastly improved the Pulse, but it&#8217;s still slow, and the upgrade took up MORE space in the phone&#8217;s memory so I have even LESS space for applications and data.<\/p>\n<h2>T-Mobile or Not T-Mobile<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to write a separate blog post, just so I can use this title, but never got around to it.<\/p>\n<p>There was a bit of faffing with the phone being locked, no one being able to unlock it apart from T-Mobile and T-Mobile refusing to do it for me, which resulted in me switching to a pay-as-you-go T-Mobile tariff.\u00a0 This was actually a really good move as I get unlimited texts and internet for topping up \u00a310\/month.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t make many voice calls so this is incredible value and, OK, T-Mobile&#8217;s coverage isn&#8217;t great, but it&#8217;s good enough for me!<\/p>\n<h2>So what to do&#8230;?<\/h2>\n<p>So I ended up with two &#8220;smart&#8221; devices.\u00a0 The iPod touch, which was dependant on WiFi for many things and never realised its full potential by not having things like a camera and GPS.\u00a0 And the Pulse, which is a good device, but poor enough quality to be frustrating to use.<\/p>\n<p>And I had the double frustration of spending most of the time charging, carrying around, and interchangeably using two different devices &#8211; a situation which reached maximum annoying-ness at Greenbelt Festival, and while on holiday earlier this month.<\/p>\n<h2>The techie bit<\/h2>\n<p>In the meantime, my lovely wife got an HTC Desire on a very good tariff (also from T-Mobile).\u00a0 This is a top-spec Android phone that works, and works really very nicely.\u00a0 As a techie I should love the open-source nature of Android, the ease with which you can develop for it, the openness of the Android Application Market, and, well, the fact that it&#8217;s nothing to do with Microsoft or Apple.<\/p>\n<p>But you know what.\u00a0 Android just doesn&#8217;t cut it for me.\u00a0 I see my lovely wife using a task killer and, well, you shouldn&#8217;t need to use a task killer to save battery on a consumer electronics device.\u00a0 You should have reliable performance.\u00a0 You shouldn&#8217;t have to think about &#8220;mounting&#8221; an SD memory card, what processes are running, using apps that seem to permanently be in &#8220;Beta&#8221;, or which launcher app to use.\u00a0 Applications should have consistent interfaces and be easy to use.\u00a0 And poor-quality, slow Android devices shouldn&#8217;t exist &#8211; the user experience should be dependable, and it&#8217;s not!\u00a0 Experience varies wildly between hardware platforms.\u00a0 I even think multi-tasking is over-rated &#8211; the speed with which I can switch apps on my iPod means I don&#8217;t need multi-tasking!!<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m not going to say that iPhones and iPods do all of that, but I am going to defend Apple&#8217;s policies because I think they are good!\u00a0 Apple deliver a known OS on a known hardware specification and release vetted apps that meet certain requirements for usability and usefulness and that use a given set of API&#8217;s.\u00a0 I know why people don&#8217;t like this, but the fact is that these are the things that enable the experience of using an iPod Touch or an iPhone to be so good and so consistent.<\/p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s smart devices aren&#8217;t perfect, but I&#8217;ve actually come to the conclusion that the sum of their usefulness and quality is pretty high.<\/p>\n<p>But does that make the value of an iPhone higher than that of a good Android device &#8211; especially given the cost?<\/p>\n<h2>Well&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>I confess that a certain something (a good thing) has happened that has meant that I have a little more money than I had before, to the extent that I can &#8220;subsidise&#8221; the cost of a new smart phone.\u00a0 Yes, actually, I do still think that iPhones are overpriced and that they&#8217;re not good value, but &#8211; heck &#8211; I&#8217;ve ordered one anyway.\u00a0 It&#8217;s a BIG treat and I feel slightly bad about it, but when I got back from holiday and got WiFi connectivity for my iPod Touch again I realised how much better the experience of the Apple device is.\u00a0 It&#8217;s intangible&#8230;I can&#8217;t pin it down.\u00a0 I want a device that I use every day to just work, to do what I need it to do, and to be good quality.\u00a0 And I desperately hope that that&#8217;s what will be winging its way to my postbox in a couple of weeks.<\/p>\n<div class='footnotes' id='footnotes-859'>\n<div class='footnotedivider'><\/div>\n<ol>\n<li id='fn-859-1'> Read about touchscreen technologies <a title=\"Touchscreen technologies on Wikipedia\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Touchscreen#Technologies\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">over on Wikipedia<\/a> <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-859-1'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n",

I work in IT and I have a degree in Software Engineering.\u00a0 But I like to think that I break the mould slightly.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t fit the stereotype of\u00a0 software developer or IT operations, and part of that that is that I claim no real close affinity with any particular technology.\u00a0 I use what works for me and that&#8217;s not always the thing that the stereotypical &#8220;techie&#8221; would use.<\/p>\n<p>And so, you might ask, what sort of mobile device does a person like me have?<\/p>\n<h2><!--more-->A bit of history<\/h2>\n<p>Well. I loved, I dearly loved, my little Sony Ericsson mobile that I used up until about January.\u00a0 I&#8217;d had several and they&#8217;d always been good phones: quick, reliable, easy to use.\u00a0 I confess that I hold a bit of a grudge against Nokia because, though they were at the heart of the cheap mobile phone revolution 10 or 12 years ago, their user interfaces became shockingly bad at one point, and I&#8217;ve not gone back.<\/p>\n<p>But times have changed.\u00a0 Technology relentlessly advances.\u00a0 I (sort of) <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/pods-and-parcels\/\">won an iPod Touch in a competition<\/a>.\u00a0 I <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/10\/on-having-the-touch\/\">thought it was pretty good<\/a>, but being tethered to WiFi, and not having a camera or microphone or GPS\u00a0 limited its capability.\u00a0 And as a social media user, blogger, and now fledgling part-time freelancer, a smart phone was looking more and more like the thing that I needed.<\/p>\n<p>A friend of mine told me at the time that &#8220;An iPod Touch is just training wheels for an iPhone&#8221;.\u00a0 But I&#8217;ve always been put off by the cost of iPhones.\u00a0 Yes, the iPod Touch is BRILLIANT, but I can buy a decent laptop for the cost of an iPhone.\u00a0 The value &#8211; the ratio of usefulness and quality to cost &#8211; of an iPhone has always been too low.<\/p>\n<h2>Taking the Pulse<\/h2>\n<p>I then saw <a title=\"Reg Hardware T-Mobile Pulse Review\" href=\"http:\/\/www.reghardware.com\/2009\/11\/03\/review_smartphone_t_mobile_pulse\/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">this review<\/a> of a T-Mobile&#8217;s first pay-as-you-go Android phone, the Pulse.\u00a0 Coming in at around \u00a3150 it looked like good value and after my lovely wife&#8217;s not-so-lovely experience of a semi-smart phone with a resistive touchscreen, and my very good experience of the iPod, one of the key things I was looking for was a capacitive screen<sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-859-1' id='fnref-859-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(859)'>1<\/a><\/sup>, which the Pulse had!<\/p>\n<p>At the time (January this year), Pulse&#8217;s were like hotcakes and the cheapest way to buy one was on eBay, and I got a good deal on a hardly-used second-hand one.<\/p>\n<p>And, to be honest, it was a little disappointing.\u00a0 It ran an older version of Android (v1.5) and was slow and unresponsive at times.\u00a0 The phone had a very small amount of built-in memory and Android, without hacking it, doesn&#8217;t let you store applications on the memory card, so I was limited in how much useful stuff I could do with it.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, this device was one third of the cost of an iPhone, but has 3G, WiFi, a camera, GPS, an electronic compass, a capacitive screen, all the things I wanted, and is incredibly useful.\u00a0 But the hardware just doesn&#8217;t have the power to cope with all it can do.\u00a0 The usefulness and quality to cost ratio is kept low by the quality and, specifically, it&#8217;s a nightmare using it as a phone!<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really want to hack or &#8220;Jailbreak&#8221; my phone, for fear of breaking something that&#8217;s incredibly useful to me, but T-Mobile did eventually release an Android update to version 2.1.\u00a0 This has vastly improved the Pulse, but it&#8217;s still slow, and the upgrade took up MORE space in the phone&#8217;s memory so I have even LESS space for applications and data.<\/p>\n<h2>T-Mobile or Not T-Mobile<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to write a separate blog post, just so I can use this title, but never got around to it.<\/p>\n<p>There was a bit of faffing with the phone being locked, no one being able to unlock it apart from T-Mobile and T-Mobile refusing to do it for me, which resulted in me switching to a pay-as-you-go T-Mobile tariff.\u00a0 This was actually a really good move as I get unlimited texts and internet for topping up \u00a310\/month.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t make many voice calls so this is incredible value and, OK, T-Mobile&#8217;s coverage isn&#8217;t great, but it&#8217;s good enough for me!<\/p>\n<h2>So what to do&#8230;?<\/h2>\n<p>So I ended up with two &#8220;smart&#8221; devices.\u00a0 The iPod touch, which was dependant on WiFi for many things and never realised its full potential by not having things like a camera and GPS.\u00a0 And the Pulse, which is a good device, but poor enough quality to be frustrating to use.<\/p>\n<p>And I had the double frustration of spending most of the time charging, carrying around, and interchangeably using two different devices &#8211; a situation which reached maximum annoying-ness at Greenbelt Festival, and while on holiday earlier this month.<\/p>\n<h2>The techie bit<\/h2>\n<p>In the meantime, my lovely wife got an HTC Desire on a very good tariff (also from T-Mobile).\u00a0 This is a top-spec Android phone that works, and works really very nicely.\u00a0 As a techie I should love the open-source nature of Android, the ease with which you can develop for it, the openness of the Android Application Market, and, well, the fact that it&#8217;s nothing to do with Microsoft or Apple.<\/p>\n<p>But you know what.\u00a0 Android just doesn&#8217;t cut it for me.\u00a0 I see my lovely wife using a task killer and, well, you shouldn&#8217;t need to use a task killer to save battery on a consumer electronics device.\u00a0 You should have reliable performance.\u00a0 You shouldn&#8217;t have to think about &#8220;mounting&#8221; an SD memory card, what processes are running, using apps that seem to permanently be in &#8220;Beta&#8221;, or which launcher app to use.\u00a0 Applications should have consistent interfaces and be easy to use.\u00a0 And poor-quality, slow Android devices shouldn&#8217;t exist &#8211; the user experience should be dependable, and it&#8217;s not!\u00a0 Experience varies wildly between hardware platforms.\u00a0 I even think multi-tasking is over-rated &#8211; the speed with which I can switch apps on my iPod means I don&#8217;t need multi-tasking!!<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m not going to say that iPhones and iPods do all of that, but I am going to defend Apple&#8217;s policies because I think they are good!\u00a0 Apple deliver a known OS on a known hardware specification and release vetted apps that meet certain requirements for usability and usefulness and that use a given set of API&#8217;s.\u00a0 I know why people don&#8217;t like this, but the fact is that these are the things that enable the experience of using an iPod Touch or an iPhone to be so good and so consistent.<\/p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s smart devices aren&#8217;t perfect, but I&#8217;ve actually come to the conclusion that the sum of their usefulness and quality is pretty high.<\/p>\n<p>But does that make the value of an iPhone higher than that of a good Android device &#8211; especially given the cost?<\/p>\n<h2>Well&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>I confess that a certain something (a good thing) has happened that has meant that I have a little more money than I had before, to the extent that I can &#8220;subsidise&#8221; the cost of a new smart phone.\u00a0 Yes, actually, I do still think that iPhones are overpriced and that they&#8217;re not good value, but &#8211; heck &#8211; I&#8217;ve ordered one anyway.\u00a0 It&#8217;s a BIG treat and I feel slightly bad about it, but when I got back from holiday and got WiFi connectivity for my iPod Touch again I realised how much better the experience of the Apple device is.\u00a0 It&#8217;s intangible&#8230;I can&#8217;t pin it down.\u00a0 I want a device that I use every day to just work, to do what I need it to do, and to be good quality.\u00a0 And I desperately hope that that&#8217;s what will be winging its way to my postbox in a couple of weeks.<\/p>\n<div class='footnotes' id='footnotes-859'>\n<div class='footnotedivider'><\/div>\n<ol>\n<li id='fn-859-1'> Read about touchscreen technologies <a title=\"Touchscreen technologies on Wikipedia\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Touchscreen#Technologies\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">over on Wikipedia<\/a> <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-859-1'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n",

        "content": "<p>Apologies (again) for lack of blogging commitment of late.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve been VERY busy building websites for people, but that&#8217;s another story.<\/p>\n<p>The first real sub-zero cold snap has come and we&#8217;ve had icy roads, so the gritting lorries have been out.<\/p>\n<p>The gritting lorries, however, don&#8217;t grit the cycle or pedestrian paths!\u00a0 And part of my cycle path has been frozen, slippery leaf mulch for the last few days.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve seen and stopped to chat to one guy who&#8217;d come off and was sat next to his bike, clearly shaken and with a minor injury.\u00a0 The cycle\/pedestrian paths aren&#8217;t safe!!<\/p>\n<p>Towards the end of last year&#8217;s long snowy season they DID grit some of the paths, and I took photos and <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/03\/snow-and-cycle-paths\/\">wrote about it<\/a> as it was melting.<\/p>\n<p>That grit in the photos was put down as the snow was clearing and lasted for several weeks after the snow had gone.\u00a0 Where&#8217;s the logic in that?\u00a0 If it&#8217;s going to last for weeks then surely better to put it out early and let it hang around to keep the paths safe during winter?<\/p>\n<p>So I put that idea to the council yesterday, and today a nice lady from the council got back to me with a very thorough response.\u00a0 Apparently she can&#8217;t help because it&#8217;s not the council&#8217;s policy to treat cycle routes.\u00a0 This is not a purely financial decision, there is a technical explanation:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>Salt only assists in reducing the freezing point of water when it is in solution and the best way to get the salt into a solution, within snow or standing water, is by the action of traffic.\u00a0 [Because] the routes are lightly trafficked [&#8230;] any applied salt could be almost entirely ineffectual, wasting resources and damaging the environment.<\/div>\n<div>Application of grit sand,\u00a0 may assist in snow for a short while, but in the longer term would prove to be a hazard in itself as it could cause skidding accidents, this therefore is not an option either.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<div>As a technical person who likes a bit of science, I genuinely appreciate and mostly understand this explanation.\u00a0 However, it leaves me with questions:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>If that&#8217;s the case, what was with the gritting of this path last year?\u00a0 Perhaps as the snow melted and became solution the grit would help keep it from re-freezing?<\/li>\n<li>If that&#8217;s the case why are there gritting boxes for gritting pavements on steep hills around Swindon?\u00a0 And why does the business park I work on grit the pedestrian paths around the park &#8211; with seemingly excellent ice-reducing effects?<\/li>\n<li>Surely, in the days of iPhones, man-made Satellites, and <a title=\"Graphene\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Graphene\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Graphene<\/a> someone has invented a substance they can put on cycle paths and pavements to make them safe in winter?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, I appeal to my blog&#8217;s cycling audience&#8230;do your cycle paths get gritted?\u00a0 How is this done in places like Copenhagen and Amsterdam where cycling is a major form of transport?\u00a0 Perhaps someone even know if my council lady is right?\u00a0 Or if there&#8217;s a new kind of grit or salt that I can recommend?<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>Thanks in advance folks!!<\/div>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>I will try to be brief<sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-950-1' id='fnref-950-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(950)'>1<\/a><\/sup>.<\/p>\n<p>Today was the closing date for the consultation on Swindon&#8217;s Local Transport Plan 3 &#8211; I must correct my previously calling it the local &#8220;travel&#8221; plan, this is incorrect. \u00a0I&#8217;ve written about this plan before <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2010\/03\/local-travel-plan-3\/\">here<\/a> and, more recently, <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2010\/12\/local-travel-plans-again\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I started to read the full LTP3 documentation a few weeks back but gave up as it&#8217;s a very long document and not particularly interesting reading &#8211; even for a budding local transport bore like me! \u00a0But today, in order to put some kind of response together, I read the consultation paper (hopefully still online <a title=\"Swindon LTP3 Consultation Paper\" href=\"http:\/\/swindon.gov.uk\/ltp3_public_briefing.pdf\">here<\/a>) to get an overview &#8211; this is a much more readable document of just 6 pages that sums things up nicely.<\/p>\n<p>I know that I am&#8230;I really really am turning into a transport nerd, but I DID reply and I wanted to say a little here about what I said.<!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>A Note on My Perspective<\/h3>\n<p>Before we begin, I&#8217;m a cyclist, cycle campaigner and someone who begins this process in support of sustainable transport in general. \u00a0I wish I could see this consultation through impartial eyes, but I don&#8217;t have impartial eyes. \u00a0My views are biased, but I think (hope?) that they&#8217;re biased in favour of common sense.<\/p>\n<h3>A Summary of my Thoughts<\/h3>\n<p>In summary, I feel that Swindon&#8217;s LTP3 is a poor response to the transport challenges that Swindon faces. \u00a0The policies put forward do not seem to be natural solutions to the problems posed &#8211; more, they seem to be solutions to other problems.<\/p>\n<p>It feels like a safe travel plan that keeps the status quo and tries to please eveyrone.<\/p>\n<p>It feels like a standard travel plan. \u00a0There&#8217;s nothing of surprise in there. If there was a random travel plan generator on the internet then this is the kind of thing that it would churn out.<\/p>\n<p>It feels like a plan that lacks any clear leadership on any of the issues presented. \u00a0It&#8217;s not challenging or controversial or forward thinking.<\/p>\n<p>And given that this is a FIFTEEN-YEAR plan to carry us to 2026, I&#8217;m highly disappointed.<\/p>\n<h3>The Mission<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to write much about The Mission. \u00a0It&#8217;s impossible to sum up the next fifteen-years&#8217; travel needs of \u00a0a large and growing town in a single paragraph. \u00a0Any attempt to do so will only ever result in a paragraph of management speak that doesn&#8217;t mean very much. \u00a0Suffice to say, this is what we got. \u00a0I guess it does well as a summary of the plan &#8211; it&#8217;s everything you&#8217;d expect.<\/p>\n<p>I wonder what sort of mission statement would have pleased me? \u00a0Perhaps something like:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Swindon needs a sustainable, secure, reliable and fast transport system that serves its businesses, visitors and residents; supports the local economy; and contributes to quality of life. This can only be achieved by striving to become the UK&#8217;s leading town for sustainable transport. While Swindon will continue to need infrastructure for motor vehicles, this plan will prioritise and invest in public and sustainable transport for local journeys and envisages economic, health, social and business benefits as a result.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, now THAT&#8217;s a mission statement!<\/p>\n<h3>Transport Challenges<\/h3>\n<p>So, what are the &#8220;challenges&#8221; Swindon faces. \u00a0In short:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Swindon is congested<\/li>\n<li>Swindon needs to grow &#8220;in an environmentally sustainable manner&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Swindon needs to contribute to carbon reduction targets<\/li>\n<li>There are barriers that prevent traffic moving around easily<\/li>\n<li>Swindon needs to support the town centre regeneration by making town easy to get to<\/li>\n<li>Swindon&#8217;s travel needs to be &#8220;sympathetic to the local environment&#8221; and &#8220;not adversely affect quality of life&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Swindon needs to improve road safety.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>OK. \u00a0Cool. \u00a0This is good stuff. \u00a0I like it. \u00a0I&#8217;d would rather have travel that &#8220;actively contributes to quality of life&#8221; but I&#8217;ll settle for not adversely affecting it.<\/p>\n<p>So I agree with these challenges. \u00a0Good so far!<\/p>\n<h3>Desired Outcomes<\/h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the things they&#8217;re going to measure, then, to show that the challenges have been met:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Journey time<\/li>\n<li>Road Safety<\/li>\n<li>Mode share for public and sustainable transport<\/li>\n<li>Reduced need to travel and reduced dependance on private cars<\/li>\n<li>Accessibility<\/li>\n<li>Local environment and quality of life<\/li>\n<li>Access to town centre<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>OK, these are good too.I think we should be measuring those things and looking for improvement in them. \u00a0Hey, this is looking like a good plan right. \u00a0Lots of sustainability in there. \u00a0Sounds like the council wants to get people out of motor vehicles and into town in the cleanest greenest, healthiest way.<\/p>\n<p>So what are we going to do to make all this happen? \u00a0Increase investment in buses and cycle\/pedestrian infrastructure? Make it inconvenient to drive a car for short trips?<\/p>\n<p>Well&#8230;err&#8230;a little bit yes.<\/p>\n<h3>The Policies<\/h3>\n<p>But first, here&#8217;s Policy A (I&#8217;m assuming there&#8217;s no order as such, but it&#8217;s interesting that this stuff is listed first).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Optimise the capacity of the highway network and improve journey time reliability for all modes.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Hmm. \u00a0OK. \u00a0Well, that doesn&#8217;t sound much like it&#8217;s going to achieve too much of your measures. \u00a0Why are we doing that?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Increasing levels of congestion affect both the efficient operation of the main road network and journey time reliability.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The &#8220;main road network&#8221;? \u00a0I thought this was about ALL modes?<\/p>\n<p>OK, so there&#8217;s congestion. \u00a0Options must be to either expand the road network or encourage people out of cars, right? \u00a0And the former doesn&#8217;t meet any of the environmental, quality-of-life-type measures does it? \u00a0So what you gonna do?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>use the latest traffic signal control technology and\u00a0other traffic management techniques&#8230;provide of up to date and accurate information to allow people to make informed decisions about their travel choices<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>You&#8217;re going to spend a fortune on new traffic lights and websites. \u00a0Seriously? \u00a0Let me see, you&#8217;ve got a load of engineers who go to the &#8220;Transport Management Show&#8221; at Earls Court each year and they&#8217;ve got some fancy new toys they want to buy?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It must also include measures to improve the attractiveness of alternatives to driving alone, particularly at peak periods.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Ah&#8230;you NEARLY forgot, but you got in there with a little &#8220;it must also&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Gosh, I&#8217;m turning into Freewheeler <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-950-2' id='fnref-950-2' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(950)'>2<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>Basically they&#8217;re going to invest loads in making traffic get around the existing roads more easily. \u00a0The double whammy of solving congestion without actually building any new roads! \u00a0I, personally, don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s possible.<\/p>\n<p>Policy B, the road safety section, is pretty non-descript. \u00a0I note that it contains no acknowledgement that a key way to improve safety is actually to reduce the number of vehicles on the road and reclaim road space back to pedestrians. \u00a0It also seems to reinforce the notion that cyclists and pedestrians should get all the training about how they can be made safer, while not educating drivers about the danger that they pose to more vulnerable road users.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d also like to see a more specific policy on 20mph speed limits in residential areas.<\/p>\n<p>Policy C is about maintenance. \u00a0 Maintenance of the&#8230;err&#8230;major roads, minor roads, rural roads, &#8220;the network&#8221;, lighting, highway structures and drainage. \u00a0So&#8230;do pavements and cycle paths get any maintenence then? \u00a0Seems not. \u00a0That&#8217;ll get people out of their cars and onto their feet and bikes then won&#8217;t it?<\/p>\n<p>Policy D is about new developments and contains a particular favourite of mine: &#8220;higher density housing developments&#8221;. \u00a0Yes, cram as many people into as small an area as possible, creating huge traffic and parking issues, removing gardens and green spaces that are safe for children to play in. \u00a0Have kids play football on jam-packed roads. \u00a0That&#8217;ll improve transport, safety and quality of life!<\/p>\n<p>This policy does include a nod to &#8220;design of developments to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport&#8221;, but the Wichelstowe development was supposed to do all that and the reality is that there&#8217;s one bus service that doesn&#8217;t run on Sundays and not a single bicycle parking space in sight. \u00a0I believe this policy when I see it!<\/p>\n<p>Policy E is Public Transport. \u00a0It basically says &#8220;we ought to do something about the buses&#8221;. \u00a0The ideas are good, but don&#8217;t go nearly far enough and certainly don&#8217;t include any notion of prioritising public transport. \u00a0In Leeds, there&#8217;s a free&#8230;a FREE bus that circles the city centre and connects with the train station. \u00a0Something like that would be on a decent public transport policy!<\/p>\n<p>Finally&#8230;again, I&#8217;m assuming no order and that the fact that this is the last policy has no bearing on its importance&#8230;Policy F:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Encourage behavioural change in transport by promoting alternatives to driving alone, and develop supporting infrastructure where appropriate<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Now we&#8217;re talking. \u00a0This kind of stuff will help you meet outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 all in one go. \u00a0The plan even acknowledges this&#8230;look:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Encouraging and making it easier for people to choose to walk, cycle or use public transport for everyday journeys offers a range of benefits for individuals and the transport network generally. By building increased physical activity, such as walking and cycling, into daily routines there are significant health benefits. An increased share of journeys undertaken by walking, cycling and public transport will reduce congestion and pollution on the road network, improving air quality and reducing accidents.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Yes, they have, indeed, seen the light!<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;.I&#8217;m excited now. \u00a0What amazing things are they going to do:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lift sharing schemes<\/li>\n<li>Improved cycle parking<\/li>\n<li>More off-road cycle routes<\/li>\n<li>Marekting and promotion of travel choices<\/li>\n<li>Better signs<\/li>\n<li>Improved routes in rural areas<\/li>\n<li>Improved public transport<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Oh.<\/p>\n<p>How dull.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, a lot of what I&#8217;d like to see is in here, but, well, I was just expecting it to be something more. \u00a0More prioritisation of alternative transport. \u00a0More on-road cycle routes too, or a promise that the off-road routes would be world-class. \u00a0A policy of taking space from motorists and giving it to cyclists.<\/p>\n<p>It was looking like an exciting end, but it left me wanting.<\/p>\n<h3>Another Summary<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s lame isn&#8217;t it? \u00a0This plan is signing up to fifteen years of more-of-the-same. \u00a0Are these the best solutions our planners could come up with? \u00a0Do they really meet the goals? \u00a0Or are they just a ticket to keep doing what we&#8217;re doing now? \u00a0I see lots of words but very little substance or leadership. \u00a0Heck, there&#8217;s not even anything about electric car infrastructure in there, and our government think that electric cars are the way to beat congestion.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe I&#8217;m being harsh. \u00a0Traffic planners have a hard job and you can&#8217;t please everyone. \u00a0But that&#8217;s kind-of the point. \u00a0Doing the right thing isn&#8217;t the same as doing the popular thing, or doing the easy thing.<\/p>\n<p>I wanted people in 2036 to be able to say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hey, Swindon, isn&#8217;t that like the cycling capital of the UK? \u00a0Didn&#8217;t they build some amazing segregated infrastructure, put a really awkward one way system in for cars and take all the road-building money and make their buses cheaper? \u00a0Don&#8217;t they see 50% of journeys under two miles being made on foot or by bike? \u00a0Is that the place where only 1% of primary school kids are driven to school and where child obesity and accident rates have fallen? \u00a0That place is a model for how to do transport. \u00a0We should learn from them!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Instead they&#8217;ll say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Oh, look, another magic roundabout&#8230;with integrated traffic lights.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div class='footnotes' id='footnotes-950'>\n<div class='footnotedivider'><\/div>\n<ol>\n<li id='fn-950-1'> This is standard blog speak, and it roughly translates as &#8220;this could be a long post!&#8221; <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-950-1'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li id='fn-950-2'> Don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t know who Freewheeler is <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-950-2'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n",

        "content": "<p>I will try to be brief<sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-950-1' id='fnref-950-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(950)'>1<\/a><\/sup>.<\/p>\n<p>Today was the closing date for the consultation on Swindon&#8217;s Local Transport Plan 3 &#8211; I must correct my previously calling it the local &#8220;travel&#8221; plan, this is incorrect. \u00a0I&#8217;ve written about this plan before <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2010\/03\/local-travel-plan-3\/\">here<\/a> and, more recently, <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2010\/12\/local-travel-plans-again\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I started to read the full LTP3 documentation a few weeks back but gave up as it&#8217;s a very long document and not particularly interesting reading &#8211; even for a budding local transport bore like me! \u00a0But today, in order to put some kind of response together, I read the consultation paper (hopefully still online <a title=\"Swindon LTP3 Consultation Paper\" href=\"http:\/\/swindon.gov.uk\/ltp3_public_briefing.pdf\">here<\/a>) to get an overview &#8211; this is a much more readable document of just 6 pages that sums things up nicely.<\/p>\n<p>I know that I am&#8230;I really really am turning into a transport nerd, but I DID reply and I wanted to say a little here about what I said.<!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>A Note on My Perspective<\/h3>\n<p>Before we begin, I&#8217;m a cyclist, cycle campaigner and someone who begins this process in support of sustainable transport in general. \u00a0I wish I could see this consultation through impartial eyes, but I don&#8217;t have impartial eyes. \u00a0My views are biased, but I think (hope?) that they&#8217;re biased in favour of common sense.<\/p>\n<h3>A Summary of my Thoughts<\/h3>\n<p>In summary, I feel that Swindon&#8217;s LTP3 is a poor response to the transport challenges that Swindon faces. \u00a0The policies put forward do not seem to be natural solutions to the problems posed &#8211; more, they seem to be solutions to other problems.<\/p>\n<p>It feels like a safe travel plan that keeps the status quo and tries to please eveyrone.<\/p>\n<p>It feels like a standard travel plan. \u00a0There&#8217;s nothing of surprise in there. If there was a random travel plan generator on the internet then this is the kind of thing that it would churn out.<\/p>\n<p>It feels like a plan that lacks any clear leadership on any of the issues presented. \u00a0It&#8217;s not challenging or controversial or forward thinking.<\/p>\n<p>And given that this is a FIFTEEN-YEAR plan to carry us to 2026, I&#8217;m highly disappointed.<\/p>\n<h3>The Mission<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to write much about The Mission. \u00a0It&#8217;s impossible to sum up the next fifteen-years&#8217; travel needs of \u00a0a large and growing town in a single paragraph. \u00a0Any attempt to do so will only ever result in a paragraph of management speak that doesn&#8217;t mean very much. \u00a0Suffice to say, this is what we got. \u00a0I guess it does well as a summary of the plan &#8211; it&#8217;s everything you&#8217;d expect.<\/p>\n<p>I wonder what sort of mission statement would have pleased me? \u00a0Perhaps something like:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Swindon needs a sustainable, secure, reliable and fast transport system that serves its businesses, visitors and residents; supports the local economy; and contributes to quality of life. This can only be achieved by striving to become the UK&#8217;s leading town for sustainable transport. While Swindon will continue to need infrastructure for motor vehicles, this plan will prioritise and invest in public and sustainable transport for local journeys and envisages economic, health, social and business benefits as a result.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, now THAT&#8217;s a mission statement!<\/p>\n<h3>Transport Challenges<\/h3>\n<p>So, what are the &#8220;challenges&#8221; Swindon faces. \u00a0In short:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Swindon is congested<\/li>\n<li>Swindon needs to grow &#8220;in an environmentally sustainable manner&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Swindon needs to contribute to carbon reduction targets<\/li>\n<li>There are barriers that prevent traffic moving around easily<\/li>\n<li>Swindon needs to support the town centre regeneration by making town easy to get to<\/li>\n<li>Swindon&#8217;s travel needs to be &#8220;sympathetic to the local environment&#8221; and &#8220;not adversely affect quality of life&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Swindon needs to improve road safety.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>OK. \u00a0Cool. \u00a0This is good stuff. \u00a0I like it. \u00a0I&#8217;d would rather have travel that &#8220;actively contributes to quality of life&#8221; but I&#8217;ll settle for not adversely affecting it.<\/p>\n<p>So I agree with these challenges. \u00a0Good so far!<\/p>\n<h3>Desired Outcomes<\/h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the things they&#8217;re going to measure, then, to show that the challenges have been met:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Journey time<\/li>\n<li>Road Safety<\/li>\n<li>Mode share for public and sustainable transport<\/li>\n<li>Reduced need to travel and reduced dependance on private cars<\/li>\n<li>Accessibility<\/li>\n<li>Local environment and quality of life<\/li>\n<li>Access to town centre<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>OK, these are good too.I think we should be measuring those things and looking for improvement in them. \u00a0Hey, this is looking like a good plan right. \u00a0Lots of sustainability in there. \u00a0Sounds like the council wants to get people out of motor vehicles and into town in the cleanest greenest, healthiest way.<\/p>\n<p>So what are we going to do to make all this happen? \u00a0Increase investment in buses and cycle\/pedestrian infrastructure? Make it inconvenient to drive a car for short trips?<\/p>\n<p>Well&#8230;err&#8230;a little bit yes.<\/p>\n<h3>The Policies<\/h3>\n<p>But first, here&#8217;s Policy A (I&#8217;m assuming there&#8217;s no order as such, but it&#8217;s interesting that this stuff is listed first).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Optimise the capacity of the highway network and improve journey time reliability for all modes.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Hmm. \u00a0OK. \u00a0Well, that doesn&#8217;t sound much like it&#8217;s going to achieve too much of your measures. \u00a0Why are we doing that?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Increasing levels of congestion affect both the efficient operation of the main road network and journey time reliability.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The &#8220;main road network&#8221;? \u00a0I thought this was about ALL modes?<\/p>\n<p>OK, so there&#8217;s congestion. \u00a0Options must be to either expand the road network or encourage people out of cars, right? \u00a0And the former doesn&#8217;t meet any of the environmental, quality-of-life-type measures does it? \u00a0So what you gonna do?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>use the latest traffic signal control technology and\u00a0other traffic management techniques&#8230;provide of up to date and accurate information to allow people to make informed decisions about their travel choices<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>You&#8217;re going to spend a fortune on new traffic lights and websites. \u00a0Seriously? \u00a0Let me see, you&#8217;ve got a load of engineers who go to the &#8220;Transport Management Show&#8221; at Earls Court each year and they&#8217;ve got some fancy new toys they want to buy?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It must also include measures to improve the attractiveness of alternatives to driving alone, particularly at peak periods.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Ah&#8230;you NEARLY forgot, but you got in there with a little &#8220;it must also&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Gosh, I&#8217;m turning into Freewheeler <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-950-2' id='fnref-950-2' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(950)'>2<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>Basically they&#8217;re going to invest loads in making traffic get around the existing roads more easily. \u00a0The double whammy of solving congestion without actually building any new roads! \u00a0I, personally, don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s possible.<\/p>\n<p>Policy B, the road safety section, is pretty non-descript. \u00a0I note that it contains no acknowledgement that a key way to improve safety is actually to reduce the number of vehicles on the road and reclaim road space back to pedestrians. \u00a0It also seems to reinforce the notion that cyclists and pedestrians should get all the training about how they can be made safer, while not educating drivers about the danger that they pose to more vulnerable road users.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d also like to see a more specific policy on 20mph speed limits in residential areas.<\/p>\n<p>Policy C is about maintenance. \u00a0 Maintenance of the&#8230;err&#8230;major roads, minor roads, rural roads, &#8220;the network&#8221;, lighting, highway structures and drainage. \u00a0So&#8230;do pavements and cycle paths get any maintenence then? \u00a0Seems not. \u00a0That&#8217;ll get people out of their cars and onto their feet and bikes then won&#8217;t it?<\/p>\n<p>Policy D is about new developments and contains a particular favourite of mine: &#8220;higher density housing developments&#8221;. \u00a0Yes, cram as many people into as small an area as possible, creating huge traffic and parking issues, removing gardens and green spaces that are safe for children to play in. \u00a0Have kids play football on jam-packed roads. \u00a0That&#8217;ll improve transport, safety and quality of life!<\/p>\n<p>This policy does include a nod to &#8220;design of developments to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport&#8221;, but the Wichelstowe development was supposed to do all that and the reality is that there&#8217;s one bus service that doesn&#8217;t run on Sundays and not a single bicycle parking space in sight. \u00a0I believe this policy when I see it!<\/p>\n<p>Policy E is Public Transport. \u00a0It basically says &#8220;we ought to do something about the buses&#8221;. \u00a0The ideas are good, but don&#8217;t go nearly far enough and certainly don&#8217;t include any notion of prioritising public transport. \u00a0In Leeds, there&#8217;s a free&#8230;a FREE bus that circles the city centre and connects with the train station. \u00a0Something like that would be on a decent public transport policy!<\/p>\n<p>Finally&#8230;again, I&#8217;m assuming no order and that the fact that this is the last policy has no bearing on its importance&#8230;Policy F:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Encourage behavioural change in transport by promoting alternatives to driving alone, and develop supporting infrastructure where appropriate<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Now we&#8217;re talking. \u00a0This kind of stuff will help you meet outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 all in one go. \u00a0The plan even acknowledges this&#8230;look:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Encouraging and making it easier for people to choose to walk, cycle or use public transport for everyday journeys offers a range of benefits for individuals and the transport network generally. By building increased physical activity, such as walking and cycling, into daily routines there are significant health benefits. An increased share of journeys undertaken by walking, cycling and public transport will reduce congestion and pollution on the road network, improving air quality and reducing accidents.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Yes, they have, indeed, seen the light!<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;.I&#8217;m excited now. \u00a0What amazing things are they going to do:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lift sharing schemes<\/li>\n<li>Improved cycle parking<\/li>\n<li>More off-road cycle routes<\/li>\n<li>Marekting and promotion of travel choices<\/li>\n<li>Better signs<\/li>\n<li>Improved routes in rural areas<\/li>\n<li>Improved public transport<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Oh.<\/p>\n<p>How dull.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, a lot of what I&#8217;d like to see is in here, but, well, I was just expecting it to be something more. \u00a0More prioritisation of alternative transport. \u00a0More on-road cycle routes too, or a promise that the off-road routes would be world-class. \u00a0A policy of taking space from motorists and giving it to cyclists.<\/p>\n<p>It was looking like an exciting end, but it left me wanting.<\/p>\n<h3>Another Summary<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s lame isn&#8217;t it? \u00a0This plan is signing up to fifteen years of more-of-the-same. \u00a0Are these the best solutions our planners could come up with? \u00a0Do they really meet the goals? \u00a0Or are they just a ticket to keep doing what we&#8217;re doing now? \u00a0I see lots of words but very little substance or leadership. \u00a0Heck, there&#8217;s not even anything about electric car infrastructure in there, and our government think that electric cars are the way to beat congestion.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe I&#8217;m being harsh. \u00a0Traffic planners have a hard job and you can&#8217;t please everyone. \u00a0But that&#8217;s kind-of the point. \u00a0Doing the right thing isn&#8217;t the same as doing the popular thing, or doing the easy thing.<\/p>\n<p>I wanted people in 2036 to be able to say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hey, Swindon, isn&#8217;t that like the cycling capital of the UK? \u00a0Didn&#8217;t they build some amazing segregated infrastructure, put a really awkward one way system in for cars and take all the road-building money and make their buses cheaper? \u00a0Don&#8217;t they see 50% of journeys under two miles being made on foot or by bike? \u00a0Is that the place where only 1% of primary school kids are driven to school and where child obesity and accident rates have fallen? \u00a0That place is a model for how to do transport. \u00a0We should learn from them!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Instead they&#8217;ll say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Oh, look, another magic roundabout&#8230;with integrated traffic lights.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div class='footnotes' id='footnotes-950'>\n<div class='footnotedivider'><\/div>\n<ol>\n<li id='fn-950-1'> This is standard blog speak, and it roughly translates as &#8220;this could be a long post!&#8221; <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-950-1'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li id='fn-950-2'> Don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t know who Freewheeler is <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-950-2'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n",
