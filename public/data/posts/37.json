I&#8217;m even finding the process of working out what&#8217;s next a creative one too. \u00a0I&#8217;m not just making &#8220;stuff&#8221;, I&#8217;m making the rest of my life!<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m even finding the process of working out what&#8217;s next a creative one too. \u00a0I&#8217;m not just making &#8220;stuff&#8221;, I&#8217;m making the rest of my life!<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m not sure if God is talking louder in this uncertain time or if I&#8217;m listening better.<\/p>\n<p>Last night we did a bit of TV catchup and saw the jungle episode of the BBC&#8217;s brilliant &#8216;Human Planet&#8217;. And while the programme as a whole was extraordinary what got me was the little &#8216;the making of&#8217; documentary at the end.<\/p>\n<p>For those that missed it they&#8217;d done a section on a tribe of people who, with primitive tools, had built a tree house&#8230;in a 35m-high tree!!  The tribesmen climbed to the treetops using  no more than sticks and vines and strength and stamina. Yet, in the making-of we see the BBC crew all safety-harnessed up with lines and backup lines, helmets, etc.<\/p>\n<p>At the end they interviewed one of the crew. What had he learned from his visit?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I judge my own inadequacies against their expertise and knowledge. You come here and you&#8217;ve got boots in case of snake bites, we&#8217;ve got sun cream on because of the sun, you know, you&#8217;ve got twin safety ropes to make sure if one fails you get caught by the other one. And these guys, OK maybe they have a higher mortality rate but they&#8217;re much freer in their lifestyle. You know they&#8217;ll shimmy up and down these trees. I think I&#8217;d much rather live a shorter, fuller life like they do out here.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes rules and safety measures give you freedom. Other times they take it away. Perhaps not having a safety rope stops us climbing the tree!<\/p>\n<p>Leaving my stable, secure job to pursue something more interesting has been like that. I still wonder what the heck I&#8217;ve done sometimes and check if my safety ropes are ok. But I also have days when I&#8217;ve shimmied higher than ever and can see the view unfolding.<\/p>\n",

The tribesmen climbed to the treetops using  no more than sticks and vines and strength and stamina. Yet, in the making-of we see the BBC crew all safety-harnessed up with lines and backup lines, helmets, etc.<\/p>\n<p>At the end they interviewed one of the crew. What had he learned from his visit?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I judge my own inadequacies against their expertise and knowledge. You come here and you&#8217;ve got boots in case of snake bites, we&#8217;ve got sun cream on because of the sun, you know, you&#8217;ve got twin safety ropes to make sure if one fails you get caught by the other one. And these guys, OK maybe they have a higher mortality rate but they&#8217;re much freer in their lifestyle. You know they&#8217;ll shimmy up and down these trees. I think I&#8217;d much rather live a shorter, fuller life like they do out here.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes rules and safety measures give you freedom. Other times they take it away. Perhaps not having a safety rope stops us climbing the tree!<\/p>\n<p>Leaving my stable, secure job to pursue something more interesting has been like that. I still wonder what the heck I&#8217;ve done sometimes and check if my safety ropes are ok. But I also have days when I&#8217;ve shimmied higher than ever and can see the view unfolding.<\/p>\n",

I understand that some of these vehicles are needed for work purposes, but we&#8217;re talking about 3, sometimes 4 large vehicles per household. Not in every case, but in some cases.<\/p>\n<p>These all take up lots of room and sometimes mean that we have park our one, single, small car, that fits nicely outside our house, a short walk away.<\/p>\n<p>The image on the right shows what I mean.\u00a0 Normally there are more vehicles around.\u00a0 Note the pavement parking which is &#8220;normal&#8221;, and that we&#8217;re fortunate to have houses on just one side of the road.\u00a0 Imagine if there were houses on both sides &#8211; that&#8217;s what the rest of our area is really like.<\/p>\n<p>Oooh, look at me, getting all &#8220;inconvenienced driver&#8221; and &#8220;war on the motorist&#8221;.\u00a0 Not my usual form at all!<\/p>\n<p>And I realised this recently.\u00a0 That&#8217;s right.\u00a0 That&#8217;s not my usual form.<\/p>\n<p>Hold that thought (or, park that idea, if you like).<\/p>\n<h2>My Street Design Idea<\/h2>\n<p>So thinking about how could we plan our streets better&#8230;I&#8217;m not a town planner but\u00a0 I reckon we need:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some main trunk roads to allow traffic to get between the motorway and the town, and connecting the main suburban areas of the town, and to enable public transport to get around.<\/li>\n<li>Safer residential areas, clear of parked cars and with low speed limits.\u00a0 Areas where people can meet and kids can safely play and move around outside, and where people of all ages can walk and cycle easily.<\/li>\n<li>Parking &#8211; I acknowledge the need for cars, we must give people somewhere to put them.<\/li>\n<li>Access to properties.\u00a0 People need to load\/unload, pick people up, drop them off.\u00a0 Shopping and courier deliveries need to be made.<\/li>\n<li>A decent cycle and pedestrian network that somehow mirrors the inter-suburban routes, connecting up the main areas of the town and the suburbs to the town centre.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;ll happily take comments on this list.\u00a0 Cycle campaigner friends, am I pandering to the motorist too much?<\/p>\n<p>Retro fitting such a scheme to an existing town would be almost impossible, but we can think about how this might affect a new housing development.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s my image of how this might look:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<figure id=\"attachment_974\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-974\" style=\"width: 454px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/street-design-1.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-974 \" title=\"My Street Design\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/street-design-1.gif\" alt=\"Idea for shared, off-street parking street design\" width=\"454\" height=\"340\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/street-design-1.gif 454w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/street-design-1-300x224.gif 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/street-design-1-150x112.gif 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-974\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Idea for shared, off-street parking street design<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Yeah&#8230;no expense spared on the design, I know!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In this scheme, the trunk road on the left feeds an area of housing.\u00a0 On the entrance to the area there&#8217;s a car park.\u00a0 People can leave cars here and walk to their homes.\u00a0 If they need to access their property, say, if they&#8217;ve been to Ikea and are unloading a load of flat packs, there is a semi-pedestrianised, one-way route through (the hatched area).\u00a0 Note that gardens are important too, and green spaces have to fit somewhere as these are important, and I&#8217;ve not shown how the cycle\/pedestrian network fits in.\u00a0 Hey, it&#8217;s a primitive concept right now &#8211; please bear with me.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The benefits of this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Safe, mostly-vehicle-free areas connecting houses.<\/li>\n<li>No pavement parking.<\/li>\n<li>Easy access to the trunk road.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Disadvantages:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have to walk a short way to get to your car.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Under my Nose Part 1<\/h3>\n<p>As this idea formulated, it got very frosty (can you tell from the pictures?) and I started taking the bus to work instead of cycling on the black ice.\u00a0 This means walking through my residential area.<\/p>\n<p>And I was suddenly struck by something.\u00a0 Just down a short alleyway is this place:<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_975\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-975\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Nearby-Car-Park-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-975\" title=\"Nearby Car Park 2\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Nearby-Car-Park-2-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"Nearby Car Park\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Nearby-Car-Park-2-300x224.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Nearby-Car-Park-2-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Nearby-Car-Park-2-150x112.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-975\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nearby Car Parking Area<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>That, my friends, is&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Well, I don&#8217;t actually know what it is or who owns it.\u00a0 There&#8217;s no signs saying what you can and can&#8217;t do in this area.\u00a0 But it looks like a jolly great big car park.<\/p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t quite have easy access to a trunk road, but I reckon if it was better used we could clear a lot of cars off the streets around where I live and make them a whole load nicer.<\/p>\n<p>Now, remember my little parking disgruntlement?\u00a0 Well I have, in the past, occasionally used this car park.\u00a0 But, much like if you&#8217;re in a car you ARE the traffic jam, I realised recently that by parking in the street I AM the parking problem.\u00a0 So I&#8217;ve taken to parking here out of principle now, even if there&#8217;s a space right outside my house.<\/p>\n<h3>Under my Nose Part 2<\/h3>\n<p>But better than that.\u00a0 As I continued to wander along roads that I&#8217;d wandered many times before, my eyes were opened to this place:<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_978\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-978\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Pedestrianised.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-978\" title=\"Pedestrianised\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Pedestrianised-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"Pedestrianised Area\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Pedestrianised-300x224.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Pedestrianised-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Pedestrianised-150x112.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-978\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A local area that has a shared, off-street car park and pedestrianised area<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Yes I&#8217;ve walked up and down this street hundreds of times, and the planning here is fantastic.\u00a0 They&#8217;ve inconvenienced the driver and pedestriansed the road.\u00a0 It could use some greenery, but there are no cars allowed at all and there are often groups of people talking and kids playing along here.\u00a0 Just what we need.\u00a0 There&#8217;s even access to properties via the alleyways or &#8220;backsies&#8221;

these are clever, but the roads around the courtyards are still very much places for cars &#8211; they lack the street furniture to encourage people out of their homes on foot on bicycle, to travel or to socialise.<\/p>\n<p>And I see lots of talk about encouraging sustainable transport but combined with buses that don&#8217;t run on Sundays, unhelpful cycle and pedestrian infrastructure and a shocking lack of facilities (bike parking in those courtyards anyone?)<\/p>\n<p>Yes, I&#8217;m not a town planner.\u00a0 But there must be better ways.\u00a0 It looks like they&#8217;ve been trying it right under my nose.\u00a0 But where&#8217;s the innovation in the rest of town.\u00a0 We can&#8217;t rip everything up and start again, but why are new developments allowed to get away with being so car-centric?<\/p>\n<p>My eyes have been opened &#8211;

I understand that some of these vehicles are needed for work purposes, but we&#8217;re talking about 3, sometimes 4 large vehicles per household. Not in every case, but in some cases.<\/p>\n<p>These all take up lots of room and sometimes mean that we have park our one, single, small car, that fits nicely outside our house, a short walk away.<\/p>\n<p>The image on the right shows what I mean.\u00a0 Normally there are more vehicles around.\u00a0 Note the pavement parking which is &#8220;normal&#8221;, and that we&#8217;re fortunate to have houses on just one side of the road.\u00a0 Imagine if there were houses on both sides &#8211; that&#8217;s what the rest of our area is really like.<\/p>\n<p>Oooh, look at me, getting all &#8220;inconvenienced driver&#8221; and &#8220;war on the motorist&#8221;.\u00a0 Not my usual form at all!<\/p>\n<p>And I realised this recently.\u00a0 That&#8217;s right.\u00a0 That&#8217;s not my usual form.<\/p>\n<p>Hold that thought (or, park that idea, if you like).<\/p>\n<h2>My Street Design Idea<\/h2>\n<p>So thinking about how could we plan our streets better&#8230;I&#8217;m not a town planner but\u00a0 I reckon we need:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some main trunk roads to allow traffic to get between the motorway and the town, and connecting the main suburban areas of the town, and to enable public transport to get around.<\/li>\n<li>Safer residential areas, clear of parked cars and with low speed limits.\u00a0 Areas where people can meet and kids can safely play and move around outside, and where people of all ages can walk and cycle easily.<\/li>\n<li>Parking &#8211; I acknowledge the need for cars, we must give people somewhere to put them.<\/li>\n<li>Access to properties.\u00a0 People need to load\/unload, pick people up, drop them off.\u00a0 Shopping and courier deliveries need to be made.<\/li>\n<li>A decent cycle and pedestrian network that somehow mirrors the inter-suburban routes, connecting up the main areas of the town and the suburbs to the town centre.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;ll happily take comments on this list.\u00a0 Cycle campaigner friends, am I pandering to the motorist too much?<\/p>\n<p>Retro fitting such a scheme to an existing town would be almost impossible, but we can think about how this might affect a new housing development.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s my image of how this might look:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<figure id=\"attachment_974\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-974\" style=\"width: 454px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/street-design-1.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-974 \" title=\"My Street Design\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/street-design-1.gif\" alt=\"Idea for shared, off-street parking street design\" width=\"454\" height=\"340\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/street-design-1.gif 454w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/street-design-1-300x224.gif 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/street-design-1-150x112.gif 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-974\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Idea for shared, off-street parking street design<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Yeah&#8230;no expense spared on the design, I know!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In this scheme, the trunk road on the left feeds an area of housing.\u00a0 On the entrance to the area there&#8217;s a car park.\u00a0 People can leave cars here and walk to their homes.\u00a0 If they need to access their property, say, if they&#8217;ve been to Ikea and are unloading a load of flat packs, there is a semi-pedestrianised, one-way route through (the hatched area).\u00a0 Note that gardens are important too, and green spaces have to fit somewhere as these are important, and I&#8217;ve not shown how the cycle\/pedestrian network fits in.\u00a0 Hey, it&#8217;s a primitive concept right now &#8211; please bear with me.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The benefits of this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Safe, mostly-vehicle-free areas connecting houses.<\/li>\n<li>No pavement parking.<\/li>\n<li>Easy access to the trunk road.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Disadvantages:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have to walk a short way to get to your car.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Under my Nose Part 1<\/h3>\n<p>As this idea formulated, it got very frosty (can you tell from the pictures?) and I started taking the bus to work instead of cycling on the black ice.\u00a0 This means walking through my residential area.<\/p>\n<p>And I was suddenly struck by something.\u00a0 Just down a short alleyway is this place:<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_975\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-975\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Nearby-Car-Park-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-975\" title=\"Nearby Car Park 2\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Nearby-Car-Park-2-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"Nearby Car Park\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Nearby-Car-Park-2-300x224.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Nearby-Car-Park-2-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Nearby-Car-Park-2-150x112.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-975\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nearby Car Parking Area<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>That, my friends, is&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Well, I don&#8217;t actually know what it is or who owns it.\u00a0 There&#8217;s no signs saying what you can and can&#8217;t do in this area.\u00a0 But it looks like a jolly great big car park.<\/p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t quite have easy access to a trunk road, but I reckon if it was better used we could clear a lot of cars off the streets around where I live and make them a whole load nicer.<\/p>\n<p>Now, remember my little parking disgruntlement?\u00a0 Well I have, in the past, occasionally used this car park.\u00a0 But, much like if you&#8217;re in a car you ARE the traffic jam, I realised recently that by parking in the street I AM the parking problem.\u00a0 So I&#8217;ve taken to parking here out of principle now, even if there&#8217;s a space right outside my house.<\/p>\n<h3>Under my Nose Part 2<\/h3>\n<p>But better than that.\u00a0 As I continued to wander along roads that I&#8217;d wandered many times before, my eyes were opened to this place:<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_978\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-978\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Pedestrianised.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-978\" title=\"Pedestrianised\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Pedestrianised-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"Pedestrianised Area\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Pedestrianised-300x224.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Pedestrianised-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/Pedestrianised-150x112.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-978\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A local area that has a shared, off-street car park and pedestrianised area<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Yes I&#8217;ve walked up and down this street hundreds of times, and the planning here is fantastic.\u00a0 They&#8217;ve inconvenienced the driver and pedestriansed the road.\u00a0 It could use some greenery, but there are no cars allowed at all and there are often groups of people talking and kids playing along here.\u00a0 Just what we need.\u00a0 There&#8217;s even access to properties via the alleyways or &#8220;backsies&#8221;

                "rendered": "<p>I&#8217;m married. \u00a0Which means I had a wedding. \u00a0And it&#8217;s traditional to do a &#8220;first dance&#8221; at a wedding. \u00a0And, being a middle-class white guy, I&#8217;m not so good at dancing. \u00a0So I agreed to go along to some dance classes in the run up to my wedding.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>I honestly don&#8217;t remember my initial reaction to the idea. \u00a0I was probably a bit sceptical and needed a bit of convincing. \u00a0But I was madly in love and would have done pretty much anything for my fiancee at the time (for the record, I still am and I probably still would!).<\/p>\n<p>So, living in trendy West London, as we did at the time, we started going along to trendy West London Salsa classes.<\/p>\n<p>It was great fun, and I quickly became a dance-class evangleist (if not a particularly great dancer), telling lots of people that they should go because it was great fun.<\/p>\n<p>Salsa classes were very social: held in trendy, West London bars or large town hall buildings, partners moved around during the class so you got to know, and dance with, lots of people.<\/p>\n<p>It quickly became an important part of our weekly diary. \u00a0And, yes, we did manage to dance a little bit of salsa at our wedding reception without looking like complete dorks. \u00a0Mission accomplished.<\/p>\n<h2>Go West<\/h2>\n<p>Then we left trendy West London and moved to Swindon. We tried to keep the dancing up and found a Salsa class in GW&#8217;s, but it wasn&#8217;t as good, I didn&#8217;t get on with the teaching, and they soon stopped that class because the function room in the pub was refurbished.<\/p>\n<p>We tried a Tango class in a Hotel in Old Town, and that was OK, but, for some reason I can&#8217;t remember, we didn&#8217;t go back.<\/p>\n<p>Then Sally spotted a poster in her office for a Latin and Ballroom class in Lambourne. \u00a0That&#8217;s not too far from Swindon, so I agreed to go along and try it out.<\/p>\n<p>(Aside: Lambourne turned out to be much further from Swindon than I thought, and trekking backwards and forwards on Tuesday nights has certainly had its moments..including probably the most dangerous car journey of my life through the West Berkshire hills in heavy snow!)<\/p>\n<p>The class was very different, but very good. \u00a0The teacher was fantastic and the class far more personal. \u00a0You go as a couple and stick with your partner for the whole class, which has been really nice. \u00a0And we learned a whole load of different dances from the suave, slick, and very difficult Foxtrot, through the giggle-inducing &#8220;dance of luuuuurve&#8221; called the Rhumba, to our favourite: the strong, passionate Tango.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had great fun doing it, but it&#8217;s not been without frustrations. \u00a0We&#8217;re younger and much quicker learners than others in the group, we&#8217;re much more open to learning new things, plus we, and we alone, really enjoy modern music (El Tango de Roxanne, Gotan Project, and Paolo Nutini amongst others). \u00a0In short, it feels like we&#8217;ve staganted a little and the long trek to Lambourne has become a bit of a chore.<\/p>\n<h2>Something New<\/h2>\n<p>So, today, we thought we&#8217;d try something different. \u00a0Various friends of ours have been doing Lindyhop (a form of Jive) for a while, and we found our about a class here in Swindon. \u00a0So we went along.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s really good! \u00a0It&#8217;s stage led, so it&#8217;s less personal, and we&#8217;re back to moving partners every few minutes&#8230;but that&#8217;s a good thing. \u00a0It&#8217;s a well taught class and it&#8217;s nice to have a challenge again. \u00a0Plus it&#8217;s a BIG group in a big venue that seems to have a nice sociable feel to it, so maybe a chance to make new friends too.<\/p>\n<p>Our Rock-and-Roll experience, and the one or two Jive\/Lindyhop lessons we&#8217;ve had will make picking the basics up pretty quick, plus over the years we&#8217;ve learned to learn how to dance, so I&#8217;m hoping we&#8217;ll quickly progress to intermediate level.<\/p>\n<p>We won&#8217;t be recreating Hellzapoppin anytime soon, but it&#8217;s nice to be doing something new.<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R0BHxhUnokU<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;m married. \u00a0Which means I had a wedding. \u00a0And it&#8217;s traditional to do a &#8220;first dance&#8221; at a wedding. \u00a0And, being a middle-class white guy, I&#8217;m not so good at dancing. \u00a0So I agreed to go along to some dance classes in the run up to my wedding.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>I honestly don&#8217;t remember my initial reaction to the idea. \u00a0I was probably a bit sceptical and needed a bit of convincing. \u00a0But I was madly in love and would have done pretty much anything for my fiancee at the time (for the record, I still am and I probably still would!).<\/p>\n<p>So, living in trendy West London, as we did at the time, we started going along to trendy West London Salsa classes.<\/p>\n<p>It was great fun, and I quickly became a dance-class evangleist (if not a particularly great dancer), telling lots of people that they should go because it was great fun.<\/p>\n<p>Salsa classes were very social: held in trendy, West London bars or large town hall buildings, partners moved around during the class so you got to know, and dance with, lots of people.<\/p>\n<p>It quickly became an important part of our weekly diary. \u00a0And, yes, we did manage to dance a little bit of salsa at our wedding reception without looking like complete dorks. \u00a0Mission accomplished.<\/p>\n<h2>Go West<\/h2>\n<p>Then we left trendy West London and moved to Swindon. We tried to keep the dancing up and found a Salsa class in GW&#8217;s, but it wasn&#8217;t as good, I didn&#8217;t get on with the teaching, and they soon stopped that class because the function room in the pub was refurbished.<\/p>\n<p>We tried a Tango class in a Hotel in Old Town, and that was OK, but, for some reason I can&#8217;t remember, we didn&#8217;t go back.<\/p>\n<p>Then Sally spotted a poster in her office for a Latin and Ballroom class in Lambourne. \u00a0That&#8217;s not too far from Swindon, so I agreed to go along and try it out.<\/p>\n<p>(Aside: Lambourne turned out to be much further from Swindon than I thought, and trekking backwards and forwards on Tuesday nights has certainly had its moments..including probably the most dangerous car journey of my life through the West Berkshire hills in heavy snow!)<\/p>\n<p>The class was very different, but very good. \u00a0The teacher was fantastic and the class far more personal. \u00a0You go as a couple and stick with your partner for the whole class, which has been really nice. \u00a0And we learned a whole load of different dances from the suave, slick, and very difficult Foxtrot, through the giggle-inducing &#8220;dance of luuuuurve&#8221; called the Rhumba, to our favourite: the strong, passionate Tango.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had great fun doing it, but it&#8217;s not been without frustrations. \u00a0We&#8217;re younger and much quicker learners than others in the group, we&#8217;re much more open to learning new things, plus we, and we alone, really enjoy modern music (El Tango de Roxanne, Gotan Project, and Paolo Nutini amongst others). \u00a0In short, it feels like we&#8217;ve staganted a little and the long trek to Lambourne has become a bit of a chore.<\/p>\n<h2>Something New<\/h2>\n<p>So, today, we thought we&#8217;d try something different. \u00a0Various friends of ours have been doing Lindyhop (a form of Jive) for a while, and we found our about a class here in Swindon. \u00a0So we went along.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s really good! \u00a0It&#8217;s stage led, so it&#8217;s less personal, and we&#8217;re back to moving partners every few minutes&#8230;but that&#8217;s a good thing. \u00a0It&#8217;s a well taught class and it&#8217;s nice to have a challenge again. \u00a0Plus it&#8217;s a BIG group in a big venue that seems to have a nice sociable feel to it, so maybe a chance to make new friends too.<\/p>\n<p>Our Rock-and-Roll experience, and the one or two Jive\/Lindyhop lessons we&#8217;ve had will make picking the basics up pretty quick, plus over the years we&#8217;ve learned to learn how to dance, so I&#8217;m hoping we&#8217;ll quickly progress to intermediate level.<\/p>\n<p>We won&#8217;t be recreating Hellzapoppin anytime soon, but it&#8217;s nice to be doing something new.<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R0BHxhUnokU<\/p>\n",

If there was a random travel plan generator on the internet then this is the kind of thing that it would churn out.<\/p>\n<p>It feels like a plan that lacks any clear leadership on any of the issues presented. \u00a0It&#8217;s not challenging or controversial or forward thinking.<\/p>\n<p>And given that this is a FIFTEEN-YEAR plan to carry us to 2026, I&#8217;m highly disappointed.<\/p>\n<h3>The Mission<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to write much about The Mission. \u00a0It&#8217;s impossible to sum up the next fifteen-years&#8217; travel needs of \u00a0a large and growing town in a single paragraph. \u00a0Any attempt to do so will only ever result in a paragraph of management speak that doesn&#8217;t mean very much. \u00a0Suffice to say, this is what we got. \u00a0I guess it does well as a summary of the plan &#8211; it&#8217;s everything you&#8217;d expect.<\/p>\n<p>I wonder what sort of mission statement would have pleased me? \u00a0Perhaps something like:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Swindon needs a sustainable, secure, reliable and fast transport system that serves its businesses, visitors and residents; supports the local economy; and contributes to quality of life. This can only be achieved by striving to become the UK&#8217;s leading town for sustainable transport. While Swindon will continue to need infrastructure for motor vehicles, this plan will prioritise and invest in public and sustainable transport for local journeys and envisages economic, health, social and business benefits as a result.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, now THAT&#8217;s a mission statement!<\/p>\n<h3>Transport Challenges<\/h3>\n<p>So, what are the &#8220;challenges&#8221; Swindon faces. \u00a0In short:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Swindon is congested<\/li>\n<li>Swindon needs to grow &#8220;in an environmentally sustainable manner&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Swindon needs to contribute to carbon reduction targets<\/li>\n<li>There are barriers that prevent traffic moving around easily<\/li>\n<li>Swindon needs to support the town centre regeneration by making town easy to get to<\/li>\n<li>Swindon&#8217;s travel needs to be &#8220;sympathetic to the local environment&#8221; and &#8220;not adversely affect quality of life&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Swindon needs to improve road safety.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>OK. \u00a0Cool. \u00a0This is good stuff. \u00a0I like it. \u00a0I&#8217;d would rather have travel that &#8220;actively contributes to quality of life&#8221; but I&#8217;ll settle for not adversely affecting it.<\/p>\n<p>So I agree with these challenges. \u00a0Good so far!<\/p>\n<h3>Desired Outcomes<\/h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the things they&#8217;re going to measure, then, to show that the challenges have been met:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Journey time<\/li>\n<li>Road Safety<\/li>\n<li>Mode share for public and sustainable transport<\/li>\n<li>Reduced need to travel and reduced dependance on private cars<\/li>\n<li>Accessibility<\/li>\n<li>Local environment and quality of life<\/li>\n<li>Access to town centre<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>OK, these are good too.I think we should be measuring those things and looking for improvement in them. \u00a0Hey, this is looking like a good plan right. \u00a0Lots of sustainability in there. \u00a0Sounds like the council wants to get people out of motor vehicles and into town in the cleanest greenest, healthiest way.<\/p>\n<p>So what are we going to do to make all this happen? \u00a0Increase investment in buses and cycle\/pedestrian infrastructure? Make it inconvenient to drive a car for short trips?<\/p>\n<p>Well&#8230;err&#8230;a little bit yes.<\/p>\n<h3>The Policies<\/h3>\n<p>But first, here&#8217;s Policy A (I&#8217;m assuming there&#8217;s no order as such, but it&#8217;s interesting that this stuff is listed first).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Optimise the capacity of the highway network and improve journey time reliability for all modes.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Hmm. \u00a0OK. \u00a0Well, that doesn&#8217;t sound much like it&#8217;s going to achieve too much of your measures. \u00a0Why are we doing that?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Increasing levels of congestion affect both the efficient operation of the main road network and journey time reliability.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The &#8220;main road network&#8221;? \u00a0I thought this was about ALL modes?<\/p>\n<p>OK, so there&#8217;s congestion. \u00a0Options must be to either expand the road network or encourage people out of cars, right? \u00a0And the former doesn&#8217;t meet any of the environmental, quality-of-life-type measures does it? \u00a0So what you gonna do?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>use the latest traffic signal control technology and\u00a0other traffic management techniques&#8230;provide of up to date and accurate information to allow people to make informed decisions about their travel choices<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>You&#8217;re going to spend a fortune on new traffic lights and websites. \u00a0Seriously? \u00a0Let me see, you&#8217;ve got a load of engineers who go to the &#8220;Transport Management Show&#8221; at Earls Court each year and they&#8217;ve got some fancy new toys they want to buy?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It must also include measures to improve the attractiveness of alternatives to driving alone, particularly at peak periods.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Ah&#8230;you NEARLY forgot, but you got in there with a little &#8220;it must also&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Gosh, I&#8217;m turning into Freewheeler <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-950-2' id='fnref-950-2' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(950)'>2<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>Basically they&#8217;re going to invest loads in making traffic get around the existing roads more easily. \u00a0The double whammy of solving congestion without actually building any new roads! \u00a0I, personally, don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s possible.<\/p>\n<p>Policy B, the road safety section, is pretty non-descript. \u00a0I note that it contains no acknowledgement that a key way to improve safety is actually to reduce the number of vehicles on the road and reclaim road space back to pedestrians. \u00a0It also seems to reinforce the notion that cyclists and pedestrians should get all the training about how they can be made safer, while not educating drivers about the danger that they pose to more vulnerable road users.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d also like to see a more specific policy on 20mph speed limits in residential areas.<\/p>\n<p>Policy C is about maintenance. \u00a0 Maintenance of the&#8230;err&#8230;major roads, minor roads, rural roads, &#8220;the network&#8221;, lighting, highway structures and drainage. \u00a0So&#8230;do pavements and cycle paths get any maintenence then? \u00a0Seems not. \u00a0That&#8217;ll get people out of their cars and onto their feet and bikes then won&#8217;t it?<\/p>\n<p>Policy D is about new developments and contains a particular favourite of mine: &#8220;higher density housing developments&#8221;. \u00a0Yes, cram as many people into as small an area as possible, creating huge traffic and parking issues, removing gardens and green spaces that are safe for children to play in. \u00a0Have kids play football on jam-packed roads. \u00a0That&#8217;ll improve transport, safety and quality of life!<\/p>\n<p>This policy does include a nod to &#8220;design of developments to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport&#8221;, but the Wichelstowe development was supposed to do all that and the reality is that there&#8217;s one bus service that doesn&#8217;t run on Sundays and not a single bicycle parking space in sight. \u00a0I believe this policy when I see it!<\/p>\n<p>Policy E is Public Transport. \u00a0It basically says &#8220;we ought to do something about the buses&#8221;. \u00a0The ideas are good, but don&#8217;t go nearly far enough and certainly don&#8217;t include any notion of prioritising public transport. \u00a0In Leeds, there&#8217;s a free&#8230;a FREE bus that circles the city centre and connects with the train station. \u00a0Something like that would be on a decent public transport policy!<\/p>\n<p>Finally&#8230;again, I&#8217;m assuming no order and that the fact that this is the last policy has no bearing on its importance&#8230;Policy F:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Encourage behavioural change in transport by promoting alternatives to driving alone, and develop supporting infrastructure where appropriate<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Now we&#8217;re talking. \u00a0This kind of stuff will help you meet outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 all in one go. \u00a0The plan even acknowledges this&#8230;look:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Encouraging and making it easier for people to choose to walk, cycle or use public transport for everyday journeys offers a range of benefits for individuals and the transport network generally. By building increased physical activity, such as walking and cycling, into daily routines there are significant health benefits. An increased share of journeys undertaken by walking, cycling and public transport will reduce congestion and pollution on the road network, improving air quality and reducing accidents.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Yes, they have, indeed, seen the light!<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;.I&#8217;m excited now. \u00a0What amazing things are they going to do:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lift sharing schemes<\/li>\n<li>Improved cycle parking<\/li>\n<li>More off-road cycle routes<\/li>\n<li>Marekting and promotion of travel choices<\/li>\n<li>Better signs<\/li>\n<li>Improved routes in rural areas<\/li>\n<li>Improved public transport<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Oh.<\/p>\n<p>How dull.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, a lot of what I&#8217;d like to see is in here, but, well, I was just expecting it to be something more. \u00a0More prioritisation of alternative transport. \u00a0More on-road cycle routes too, or a promise that the off-road routes would be world-class. \u00a0A policy of taking space from motorists and giving it to cyclists.<\/p>\n<p>It was looking like an exciting end, but it left me wanting.<\/p>\n<h3>Another Summary<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s lame isn&#8217;t it? \u00a0This plan is signing up to fifteen years of more-of-the-same. \u00a0Are these the best solutions our planners could come up with? \u00a0Do they really meet the goals? \u00a0Or are they just a ticket to keep doing what we&#8217;re doing now? \u00a0I see lots of words but very little substance or leadership. \u00a0Heck, there&#8217;s not even anything about electric car infrastructure in there, and our government think that electric cars are the way to beat congestion.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe I&#8217;m being harsh. \u00a0Traffic planners have a hard job and you can&#8217;t please everyone. \u00a0But that&#8217;s kind-of the point. \u00a0Doing the right thing isn&#8217;t the same as doing the popular thing, or doing the easy thing.<\/p>\n<p>I wanted people in 2036 to be able to say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hey, Swindon, isn&#8217;t that like the cycling capital of the UK? \u00a0Didn&#8217;t they build some amazing segregated infrastructure, put a really awkward one way system in for cars and take all the road-building money and make their buses cheaper? \u00a0Don&#8217;t they see 50% of journeys under two miles being made on foot or by bike? \u00a0Is that the place where only 1% of primary school kids are driven to school and where child obesity and accident rates have fallen? \u00a0That place is a model for how to do transport. \u00a0We should learn from them!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Instead they&#8217;ll say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Oh, look, another magic roundabout&#8230;with integrated traffic lights.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div class='footnotes' id='footnotes-950'>\n<div class='footnotedivider'><\/div>\n<ol>\n<li id='fn-950-1'> This is standard blog speak, and it roughly translates as &#8220;this could be a long post!&#8221; <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-950-1'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li id='fn-950-2'> Don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t know who Freewheeler is <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-950-2'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n",

        "content": "<p>I will try to be brief<sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-950-1' id='fnref-950-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(950)'>1<\/a><\/sup>.<\/p>\n<p>Today was the closing date for the consultation on Swindon&#8217;s Local Transport Plan 3 &#8211; I must correct my previously calling it the local &#8220;travel&#8221; plan, this is incorrect. \u00a0I&#8217;ve written about this plan before <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2010\/03\/local-travel-plan-3\/\">here<\/a> and, more recently, <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2010\/12\/local-travel-plans-again\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I started to read the full LTP3 documentation a few weeks back but gave up as it&#8217;s a very long document and not particularly interesting reading &#8211; even for a budding local transport bore like me! \u00a0But today, in order to put some kind of response together, I read the consultation paper (hopefully still online <a title=\"Swindon LTP3 Consultation Paper\" href=\"http:\/\/swindon.gov.uk\/ltp3_public_briefing.pdf\">here<\/a>) to get an overview &#8211; this is a much more readable document of just 6 pages that sums things up nicely.<\/p>\n<p>I know that I am&#8230;I really really am turning into a transport nerd, but I DID reply and I wanted to say a little here about what I said.<!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>A Note on My Perspective<\/h3>\n<p>Before we begin, I&#8217;m a cyclist, cycle campaigner and someone who begins this process in support of sustainable transport in general. \u00a0I wish I could see this consultation through impartial eyes, but I don&#8217;t have impartial eyes. \u00a0My views are biased, but I think (hope?) that they&#8217;re biased in favour of common sense.<\/p>\n<h3>A Summary of my Thoughts<\/h3>\n<p>In summary, I feel that Swindon&#8217;s LTP3 is a poor response to the transport challenges that Swindon faces. \u00a0The policies put forward do not seem to be natural solutions to the problems posed &#8211; more, they seem to be solutions to other problems.<\/p>\n<p>It feels like a safe travel plan that keeps the status quo and tries to please eveyrone.<\/p>\n<p>It feels like a standard travel plan. \u00a0There&#8217;s nothing of surprise in there. If there was a random travel plan generator on the internet then this is the kind of thing that it would churn out.<\/p>\n<p>It feels like a plan that lacks any clear leadership on any of the issues presented. \u00a0It&#8217;s not challenging or controversial or forward thinking.<\/p>\n<p>And given that this is a FIFTEEN-YEAR plan to carry us to 2026, I&#8217;m highly disappointed.<\/p>\n<h3>The Mission<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to write much about The Mission. \u00a0It&#8217;s impossible to sum up the next fifteen-years&#8217; travel needs of \u00a0a large and growing town in a single paragraph. \u00a0Any attempt to do so will only ever result in a paragraph of management speak that doesn&#8217;t mean very much. \u00a0Suffice to say, this is what we got. \u00a0I guess it does well as a summary of the plan &#8211; it&#8217;s everything you&#8217;d expect.<\/p>\n<p>I wonder what sort of mission statement would have pleased me? \u00a0Perhaps something like:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Swindon needs a sustainable, secure, reliable and fast transport system that serves its businesses, visitors and residents; supports the local economy; and contributes to quality of life. This can only be achieved by striving to become the UK&#8217;s leading town for sustainable transport. While Swindon will continue to need infrastructure for motor vehicles, this plan will prioritise and invest in public and sustainable transport for local journeys and envisages economic, health, social and business benefits as a result.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, now THAT&#8217;s a mission statement!<\/p>\n<h3>Transport Challenges<\/h3>\n<p>So, what are the &#8220;challenges&#8221; Swindon faces. \u00a0In short:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Swindon is congested<\/li>\n<li>Swindon needs to grow &#8220;in an environmentally sustainable manner&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Swindon needs to contribute to carbon reduction targets<\/li>\n<li>There are barriers that prevent traffic moving around easily<\/li>\n<li>Swindon needs to support the town centre regeneration by making town easy to get to<\/li>\n<li>Swindon&#8217;s travel needs to be &#8220;sympathetic to the local environment&#8221; and &#8220;not adversely affect quality of life&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Swindon needs to improve road safety.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>OK. \u00a0Cool. \u00a0This is good stuff. \u00a0I like it. \u00a0I&#8217;d would rather have travel that &#8220;actively contributes to quality of life&#8221; but I&#8217;ll settle for not adversely affecting it.<\/p>\n<p>So I agree with these challenges. \u00a0Good so far!<\/p>\n<h3>Desired Outcomes<\/h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the things they&#8217;re going to measure, then, to show that the challenges have been met:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Journey time<\/li>\n<li>Road Safety<\/li>\n<li>Mode share for public and sustainable transport<\/li>\n<li>Reduced need to travel and reduced dependance on private cars<\/li>\n<li>Accessibility<\/li>\n<li>Local environment and quality of life<\/li>\n<li>Access to town centre<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>OK, these are good too.I think we should be measuring those things and looking for improvement in them. \u00a0Hey, this is looking like a good plan right. \u00a0Lots of sustainability in there. \u00a0Sounds like the council wants to get people out of motor vehicles and into town in the cleanest greenest, healthiest way.<\/p>\n<p>So what are we going to do to make all this happen? \u00a0Increase investment in buses and cycle\/pedestrian infrastructure? Make it inconvenient to drive a car for short trips?<\/p>\n<p>Well&#8230;err&#8230;a little bit yes.<\/p>\n<h3>The Policies<\/h3>\n<p>But first, here&#8217;s Policy A (I&#8217;m assuming there&#8217;s no order as such, but it&#8217;s interesting that this stuff is listed first).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Optimise the capacity of the highway network and improve journey time reliability for all modes.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Hmm. \u00a0OK. \u00a0Well, that doesn&#8217;t sound much like it&#8217;s going to achieve too much of your measures. \u00a0Why are we doing that?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Increasing levels of congestion affect both the efficient operation of the main road network and journey time reliability.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The &#8220;main road network&#8221;? \u00a0I thought this was about ALL modes?<\/p>\n<p>OK, so there&#8217;s congestion. \u00a0Options must be to either expand the road network or encourage people out of cars, right? \u00a0And the former doesn&#8217;t meet any of the environmental, quality-of-life-type measures does it? \u00a0So what you gonna do?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>use the latest traffic signal control technology and\u00a0other traffic management techniques&#8230;provide of up to date and accurate information to allow people to make informed decisions about their travel choices<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>You&#8217;re going to spend a fortune on new traffic lights and websites. \u00a0Seriously? \u00a0Let me see, you&#8217;ve got a load of engineers who go to the &#8220;Transport Management Show&#8221; at Earls Court each year and they&#8217;ve got some fancy new toys they want to buy?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It must also include measures to improve the attractiveness of alternatives to driving alone, particularly at peak periods.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Ah&#8230;you NEARLY forgot, but you got in there with a little &#8220;it must also&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Gosh, I&#8217;m turning into Freewheeler <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-950-2' id='fnref-950-2' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(950)'>2<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>Basically they&#8217;re going to invest loads in making traffic get around the existing roads more easily. \u00a0The double whammy of solving congestion without actually building any new roads! \u00a0I, personally, don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s possible.<\/p>\n<p>Policy B, the road safety section, is pretty non-descript. \u00a0I note that it contains no acknowledgement that a key way to improve safety is actually to reduce the number of vehicles on the road and reclaim road space back to pedestrians. \u00a0It also seems to reinforce the notion that cyclists and pedestrians should get all the training about how they can be made safer, while not educating drivers about the danger that they pose to more vulnerable road users.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d also like to see a more specific policy on 20mph speed limits in residential areas.<\/p>\n<p>Policy C is about maintenance. \u00a0 Maintenance of the&#8230;err&#8230;major roads, minor roads, rural roads, &#8220;the network&#8221;, lighting, highway structures and drainage. \u00a0So&#8230;do pavements and cycle paths get any maintenence then? \u00a0Seems not. \u00a0That&#8217;ll get people out of their cars and onto their feet and bikes then won&#8217;t it?<\/p>\n<p>Policy D is about new developments and contains a particular favourite of mine: &#8220;higher density housing developments&#8221;. \u00a0Yes, cram as many people into as small an area as possible, creating huge traffic and parking issues, removing gardens and green spaces that are safe for children to play in. \u00a0Have kids play football on jam-packed roads. \u00a0That&#8217;ll improve transport, safety and quality of life!<\/p>\n<p>This policy does include a nod to &#8220;design of developments to encourage walking, cycling, and public transport&#8221;, but the Wichelstowe development was supposed to do all that and the reality is that there&#8217;s one bus service that doesn&#8217;t run on Sundays and not a single bicycle parking space in sight. \u00a0I believe this policy when I see it!<\/p>\n<p>Policy E is Public Transport. \u00a0It basically says &#8220;we ought to do something about the buses&#8221;. \u00a0The ideas are good, but don&#8217;t go nearly far enough and certainly don&#8217;t include any notion of prioritising public transport. \u00a0In Leeds, there&#8217;s a free&#8230;a FREE bus that circles the city centre and connects with the train station. \u00a0Something like that would be on a decent public transport policy!<\/p>\n<p>Finally&#8230;again, I&#8217;m assuming no order and that the fact that this is the last policy has no bearing on its importance&#8230;Policy F:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Encourage behavioural change in transport by promoting alternatives to driving alone, and develop supporting infrastructure where appropriate<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Now we&#8217;re talking. \u00a0This kind of stuff will help you meet outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 all in one go. \u00a0The plan even acknowledges this&#8230;look:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Encouraging and making it easier for people to choose to walk, cycle or use public transport for everyday journeys offers a range of benefits for individuals and the transport network generally. By building increased physical activity, such as walking and cycling, into daily routines there are significant health benefits. An increased share of journeys undertaken by walking, cycling and public transport will reduce congestion and pollution on the road network, improving air quality and reducing accidents.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Yes, they have, indeed, seen the light!<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;.I&#8217;m excited now. \u00a0What amazing things are they going to do:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lift sharing schemes<\/li>\n<li>Improved cycle parking<\/li>\n<li>More off-road cycle routes<\/li>\n<li>Marekting and promotion of travel choices<\/li>\n<li>Better signs<\/li>\n<li>Improved routes in rural areas<\/li>\n<li>Improved public transport<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Oh.<\/p>\n<p>How dull.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, a lot of what I&#8217;d like to see is in here, but, well, I was just expecting it to be something more. \u00a0More prioritisation of alternative transport. \u00a0More on-road cycle routes too, or a promise that the off-road routes would be world-class. \u00a0A policy of taking space from motorists and giving it to cyclists.<\/p>\n<p>It was looking like an exciting end, but it left me wanting.<\/p>\n<h3>Another Summary<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s lame isn&#8217;t it? \u00a0This plan is signing up to fifteen years of more-of-the-same. \u00a0Are these the best solutions our planners could come up with? \u00a0Do they really meet the goals? \u00a0Or are they just a ticket to keep doing what we&#8217;re doing now? \u00a0I see lots of words but very little substance or leadership. \u00a0Heck, there&#8217;s not even anything about electric car infrastructure in there, and our government think that electric cars are the way to beat congestion.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe I&#8217;m being harsh. \u00a0Traffic planners have a hard job and you can&#8217;t please everyone. \u00a0But that&#8217;s kind-of the point. \u00a0Doing the right thing isn&#8217;t the same as doing the popular thing, or doing the easy thing.<\/p>\n<p>I wanted people in 2036 to be able to say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hey, Swindon, isn&#8217;t that like the cycling capital of the UK? \u00a0Didn&#8217;t they build some amazing segregated infrastructure, put a really awkward one way system in for cars and take all the road-building money and make their buses cheaper? \u00a0Don&#8217;t they see 50% of journeys under two miles being made on foot or by bike? \u00a0Is that the place where only 1% of primary school kids are driven to school and where child obesity and accident rates have fallen? \u00a0That place is a model for how to do transport. \u00a0We should learn from them!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Instead they&#8217;ll say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Oh, look, another magic roundabout&#8230;with integrated traffic lights.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div class='footnotes' id='footnotes-950'>\n<div class='footnotedivider'><\/div>\n<ol>\n<li id='fn-950-1'> This is standard blog speak, and it roughly translates as &#8220;this could be a long post!&#8221; <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-950-1'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li id='fn-950-2'> Don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t know who Freewheeler is <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-950-2'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n",

Here&#8217;s a sample for you.<\/p>\n<p>I hope you had a very happy Christmas and that you have a blessed, happy, and joyful year in 2011!!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/DSC_0086.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-942\" title=\"Playing with Light 1\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/DSC_0086-e1293992370964-680x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Playing with Light\" width=\"500\" height=\"752\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/DSC_0086-e1293992370964-680x1024.jpg 680w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/DSC_0086-e1293992370964-199x300.jpg 199w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/DSC_0085-e1293993032667.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-943\" title=\"Playing with Light 2\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/DSC_0085-e1293993032667-680x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Playing with Light\" width=\"500\" height=\"752\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/DSC_0085-e1293993032667-680x1024.jpg 680w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/DSC_0085-e1293993032667-199x300.jpg 199w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n",
