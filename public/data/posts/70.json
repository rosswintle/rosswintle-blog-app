                "rendered": "<p>As a bit of a techie I like my gadgets.  I&#8217;m not over the top in this respect, but I like it when technology can improve my life or do something useful.  So when I buy new &#8220;toys&#8221;, I&#8217;ve generally thought quite hard about it.<\/p>\n<p>I really don&#8217;t intend to start making this a &#8220;Gadget Review Blog&#8221;, but when I buy new &#8220;toys&#8221; I&#8217;ll try and say why I bought them and what I think about them in the hope that my thoughts benefit someone else &#8211; or myself at a later date.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Why buy a little MP3 player?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The background to this is that, after much deliberation, I bought a big-proper 30GB Apple iPod about a year ago.  I&#8217;m very pleased with this and it&#8217;s good for long journeys, by train or car, or to give me a day&#8217;s tunes at work.  But, despite being almost miraculously small for what it does, it&#8217;s too big and too fragile to be used when walking, cycling (on quiet roads only of course), or when at the gym.<\/p>\n<p>So, for a while I&#8217;ve been thinking about a cheap, ultra-small, solid-state music player to go alongside it.  For the less-technical, solid-state means that it has no moving parts.  Given that I like iTunes (for reasons I won&#8217;t go into here), an iPod Shuffle seems like the obvious choice &#8211; as it will easily sync to an iTunes playlist (or smart playlist).  It took a while to come around to the idea of a player without a screen, but I can see how it fulfills the need to just shove something in your pocket full of your favourite tunes, and go.  So a Shuffle has been on my shopping list for a while.<\/p>\n<p>THEN, I discovered <a href=\"http:\/\/ita.sourceforge.net\/\">iTunes Agent<\/a>, which is a far-from perfect piece of software, but one which allows you to sync non-Apple devices with iTunes.  This opens up the possibilities a bit more.<\/p>\n<p>Originally I sync&#8217;ed my Sony Ericsson Walkman mobile phone with it, and took that to the gym a few times.  However, the controls on the walkman phone aren&#8217;t great (they get locked out by the phone&#8217;s &#8220;auto-lock&#8221; feature) but then I found the Creative &#8220;Stone&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Stone&#8221; is Creative&#8217;s equivalent of the iPod Shuffle.  It&#8217;s got 1GB capacity, no display, simple controls and ~8 hours battery life.  At around \u00a323, it&#8217;s about half the price of an iPod Shuffle!  Bargain.<\/p>\n<p>So I got one.  Here it is with headphones, close up, and next to some chewing gum for scale!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwonQOpJI\/AAAAAAAAAWo\/nxhCu3eECII\/s1600-h\/DSC00024.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"cursor:pointer;width:177px;height:132px;margin:5px auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwonQOpJI\/AAAAAAAAAWo\/nxhCu3eECII\/s400\/DSC00024.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>     <a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwwnQOpKI\/AAAAAAAAAWw\/SNRXPb07y1k\/s1600-h\/DSC00025.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"cursor:pointer;width:177px;height:133px;margin:5px auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwwnQOpKI\/AAAAAAAAAWw\/SNRXPb07y1k\/s400\/DSC00025.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>     <a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqxnHQOpMI\/AAAAAAAAAXA\/1F_7TcnEjB0\/s1600-h\/DSC00026.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"cursor:pointer;width:178px;height:133px;margin:5px auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqxnHQOpMI\/AAAAAAAAAXA\/1F_7TcnEjB0\/s400\/DSC00026.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Looks pretty.  Looks TINY!!! But does it do the job?<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m happy to say that yes, it does.  It&#8217;s easy to use, sounds good and does everything that it says it does.  I&#8217;ve not had the battery run out on me yet.  It feels sturdy and has survived many hours in my pocket already without much damage.<\/p>\n<p>I could only pick out three odd things, though these are more observations than annoyances.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It can only be charged from a USB port<\/span>.  It comes with a short mini-USB cable to do this, but other charging options would be nice. Having said that, charging is quick and the battery lasts a good while, particularly as it&#8217;s not a device I&#8217;ll use for LONG periods of time.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It takes a while to start up<\/span>.  When you turns it on there&#8217;s about 20 seconds of silence before it does anything.  My guess is that it&#8217;s scanning the files that you&#8217;ve loaded onto it. Fortunately it only does this after a total shutdown.  You can happily pause and restart music and it will only turn completely off if you leave it paused for a long time.<\/li>\n<li>Unlike the iPod Shuffle, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">it doesn&#8217;t have a &#8220;hold&#8221; switch<\/span> &#8211; used to &#8220;lock&#8221; the controls so that you don&#8217;t make accidental <a href=\"void(0)\"><span><\/span><\/a>button presses when the thing is in your pocket.  However, this isn&#8217;t a problem as the buttons are very nicely set up so that they need too much force to press accidentally, but not so much that you can&#8217;t easily use the controls.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Overall, I like my &#8220;Stone&#8221; and I&#8217;m glad I bought it.  It serves a simple purpose and will make many a trip to the gym with me.  I&#8217;d recommend it to someone that wants a simple, cheap, micro-sized media player, and with iTA, you can sync with iTunes and have a &#8220;Shuffle&#8221; equivalent for half the price.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>As a bit of a techie I like my gadgets.  I&#8217;m not over the top in this respect, but I like it when technology can improve my life or do something useful.  So when I buy new &#8220;toys&#8221;, I&#8217;ve generally thought quite hard about it.<\/p>\n<p>I really don&#8217;t intend to start making this a &#8220;Gadget Review Blog&#8221;, but when I buy new &#8220;toys&#8221; I&#8217;ll try and say why I bought them and what I think about them in the hope that my thoughts benefit someone else &#8211; or myself at a later date.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Why buy a little MP3 player?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The background to this is that, after much deliberation, I bought a big-proper 30GB Apple iPod about a year ago.  I&#8217;m very pleased with this and it&#8217;s good for long journeys, by train or car, or to give me a day&#8217;s tunes at work.  But, despite being almost miraculously small for what it does, it&#8217;s too big and too fragile to be used when walking, cycling (on quiet roads only of course), or when at the gym.<\/p>\n<p>So, for a while I&#8217;ve been thinking about a cheap, ultra-small, solid-state music player to go alongside it.  For the less-technical, solid-state means that it has no moving parts.  Given that I like iTunes (for reasons I won&#8217;t go into here), an iPod Shuffle seems like the obvious choice &#8211; as it will easily sync to an iTunes playlist (or smart playlist).  It took a while to come around to the idea of a player without a screen, but I can see how it fulfills the need to just shove something in your pocket full of your favourite tunes, and go.  So a Shuffle has been on my shopping list for a while.<\/p>\n<p>THEN, I discovered <a href=\"http:\/\/ita.sourceforge.net\/\">iTunes Agent<\/a>, which is a far-from perfect piece of software, but one which allows you to sync non-Apple devices with iTunes.  This opens up the possibilities a bit more.<\/p>\n<p>Originally I sync&#8217;ed my Sony Ericsson Walkman mobile phone with it, and took that to the gym a few times.  However, the controls on the walkman phone aren&#8217;t great (they get locked out by the phone&#8217;s &#8220;auto-lock&#8221; feature) but then I found the Creative &#8220;Stone&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Stone&#8221; is Creative&#8217;s equivalent of the iPod Shuffle.  It&#8217;s got 1GB capacity, no display, simple controls and ~8 hours battery life.  At around \u00a323, it&#8217;s about half the price of an iPod Shuffle!  Bargain.<\/p>\n<p>So I got one.  Here it is with headphones, close up, and next to some chewing gum for scale!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwonQOpJI\/AAAAAAAAAWo\/nxhCu3eECII\/s1600-h\/DSC00024.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"cursor:pointer;width:177px;height:132px;margin:5px auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwonQOpJI\/AAAAAAAAAWo\/nxhCu3eECII\/s400\/DSC00024.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>     <a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwwnQOpKI\/AAAAAAAAAWw\/SNRXPb07y1k\/s1600-h\/DSC00025.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"cursor:pointer;width:177px;height:133px;margin:5px auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwwnQOpKI\/AAAAAAAAAWw\/SNRXPb07y1k\/s400\/DSC00025.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>     <a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqxnHQOpMI\/AAAAAAAAAXA\/1F_7TcnEjB0\/s1600-h\/DSC00026.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"cursor:pointer;width:178px;height:133px;margin:5px auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqxnHQOpMI\/AAAAAAAAAXA\/1F_7TcnEjB0\/s400\/DSC00026.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Looks pretty.  Looks TINY!!! But does it do the job?<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m happy to say that yes, it does.  It&#8217;s easy to use, sounds good and does everything that it says it does.  I&#8217;ve not had the battery run out on me yet.  It feels sturdy and has survived many hours in my pocket already without much damage.<\/p>\n<p>I could only pick out three odd things, though these are more observations than annoyances.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It can only be charged from a USB port<\/span>.  It comes with a short mini-USB cable to do this, but other charging options would be nice. Having said that, charging is quick and the battery lasts a good while, particularly as it&#8217;s not a device I&#8217;ll use for LONG periods of time.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It takes a while to start up<\/span>.  When you turns it on there&#8217;s about 20 seconds of silence before it does anything.  My guess is that it&#8217;s scanning the files that you&#8217;ve loaded onto it. Fortunately it only does this after a total shutdown.  You can happily pause and restart music and it will only turn completely off if you leave it paused for a long time.<\/li>\n<li>Unlike the iPod Shuffle, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">it doesn&#8217;t have a &#8220;hold&#8221; switch<\/span> &#8211; used to &#8220;lock&#8221; the controls so that you don&#8217;t make accidental <a href=\"void(0)\"><span><\/span><\/a>button presses when the thing is in your pocket.  However, this isn&#8217;t a problem as the buttons are very nicely set up so that they need too much force to press accidentally, but not so much that you can&#8217;t easily use the controls.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Overall, I like my &#8220;Stone&#8221; and I&#8217;m glad I bought it.  It serves a simple purpose and will make many a trip to the gym with me.  I&#8217;d recommend it to someone that wants a simple, cheap, micro-sized media player, and with iTA, you can sync with iTunes and have a &#8220;Shuffle&#8221; equivalent for half the price.<\/p>\n",

Once the main upgrade was complete it was supposed to automatically go round and upgrade some components on some remote systems.  Because I don&#8217;t trust this process I was logged on to the remote server and watched it happen.  And I watched it fail.  The process just stopped without doing what it was supposed to do.  I then tried to do the upgrade on the remote system manually and that failed too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">I logged the fault with my software supplier and today they came back to me to say that it had initially failed because a disk was full, and that when I manually tried to re-run it, it failed again because a file was locked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">So, we pay thousands of pounds for this software and they people that develop it can&#8217;t even write:<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">$SUCCESS=open($FILE)<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">if (not $SUCCESS)<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">then<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">  log_error(&#8220;An error occurred while opening $FILE&#8221;)<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">end if<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Admittedly an error like this was written to a (very large and mostly indecipherable) log file, but did it not occur to them that this might be something that the user might like to know about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">I despair sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n",

There, it&#8217;s out, you can all start jeering me and calling me a spod and asking where my sandals are, or, at the very least, call me up asking why your screen has turned a nice shade of purple.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">This therefore might not make complete sense to all of you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">The other day at work I did a software upgrade on a test system.  Once the main upgrade was complete it was supposed to automatically go round and upgrade some components on some remote systems.  Because I don&#8217;t trust this process I was logged on to the remote server and watched it happen.  And I watched it fail.  The process just stopped without doing what it was supposed to do.  I then tried to do the upgrade on the remote system manually and that failed too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">I logged the fault with my software supplier and today they came back to me to say that it had initially failed because a disk was full, and that when I manually tried to re-run it, it failed again because a file was locked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">So, we pay thousands of pounds for this software and they people that develop it can&#8217;t even write:<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">$SUCCESS=open($FILE)<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">if (not $SUCCESS)<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">then<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">  log_error(&#8220;An error occurred while opening $FILE&#8221;)<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">end if<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Admittedly an error like this was written to a (very large and mostly indecipherable) log file, but did it not occur to them that this might be something that the user might like to know about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">I despair sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n",

Genius.  I&#8217;m forever switching the kettle on, walking off and then forgetting about it (repeat three times before ACTUALLY making a cup of coffee).  It&#8217;s expensive but I reckon it&#8217;d pay for itself quickly (the manufacturer says 2 years) and save loads of energy too!<\/p>\n<p>I also discovered <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikely.com\">Bikely.com<\/a> further to my post about <a href=\"http:\/\/wintle.blogspot.com\/2007\/06\/route-planning-news.html\">route planning<\/a>, Bikely is now my favourite way of doing cycle routes.  It gives gradient profiles, allows you to share routes, downloads routes so that you can do fly-throughs in Google Earth.  The only thing it doesn&#8217;t really do is give you a decent map of a long route.  You can get a crib sheet with vague directions but I would want to do a long ride on roads that I don&#8217;t know with just that.  Recommended!<\/p>\n",

It gives gradient profiles, allows you to share routes, downloads routes so that you can do fly-throughs in Google Earth.  The only thing it doesn&#8217;t really do is give you a decent map of a long route.  You can get a crib sheet with vague directions but I would want to do a long ride on roads that I don&#8217;t know with just that.  Recommended!<\/p>\n",

It was a bit nerve racking at first but it&#8217;s very secure!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been such a busy holiday that we only actually did 2 rides.  On Tuesday to Helford (see the post from that day and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikely.com\/maps\/bike-path\/Ruan-Minor-Cadgwith-to-Helford-Passenger-Ferry\">route on Bikely<\/a>), and today, in the afternoon, I did a faster ride by myself on the same route we did to Helford, but only as far as Newtown.<\/p>\n<p>These have been good rides.  Slightly hilly but quiet roads.  A bit disappointing that some roads were very narrow so you didn&#8217;t want to get too much speed up in case anything came the other way.<\/div>\n<div> <\/div>\n<p>Fitness-wise, I&#8217;ve got a new strain in the form of an aching wrist, but I had this on the way to Cornwall in the car and so it&#8217;s probably related to driving!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d definitely take the bikes away on holiday again!<\/p>\n",

On Tuesday to Helford (see the post from that day and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikely.com\/maps\/bike-path\/Ruan-Minor-Cadgwith-to-Helford-Passenger-Ferry\">route on Bikely<\/a>), and today, in the afternoon, I did a faster ride by myself on the same route we did to Helford, but only as far as Newtown.<\/p>\n<p>These have been good rides.  Slightly hilly but quiet roads.  A bit disappointing that some roads were very narrow so you didn&#8217;t want to get too much speed up in case anything came the other way.<\/div>\n<div> <\/div>\n<p>Fitness-wise, I&#8217;ve got a new strain in the form of an aching wrist, but I had this on the way to Cornwall in the car and so it&#8217;s probably related to driving!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d definitely take the bikes away on holiday again!<\/p>\n",

You mostly hear good things about it but occasionally you meet someone that thought it was rubbish.  I can see why people might not like it but I thought it was fascinating, beautiful, educational and inspiring.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div>A visit to the Eden Project raises lots of questions about our planet.  I&#8217;d probably fall into the category of very-nearly-green-hippy.  Partly driven by my faith &#8211; my belief in a creator and in our duty to look after His creation &#8211; and partly driven by science and common sense, I believe we should reduce, recycle and reuse as much as possible.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been having a lot of conversations at work about being green.  Mostly with people who slightly mock the concept of being overtly, or overly, environmentally friendly.  Mostly with people who think I&#8217;m silly for cycling in the rain (but that&#8217;s another issue altogether).  I feel in a minority there.<\/p>\n<p>But most of the discussions aren&#8217;t actually about the concepts of waste, wastefulness, packaging, reuse of materials and consumerism.  Most of the discussions are about &#8220;Carbon Footprints&#8221;, which I don&#8217;t really understand myself and which, to me, seem to be just marketing to make us feel good about buying a product or service.  But I don&#8217;t actually get what it means to put a tonne of carbon dioxide into the air!  In contrast, I DO get what it means to put a plastic bag in a landfill.  It means that I&#8217;ve wasted some oil &#8211; a precious natural resource that will, one day pretty soon now, run out &#8211; in order to produce something that I&#8217;ve then discarded on a big heap and which will sit there being a plastic bag in the way, for a VERY long time.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div>I&#8217;m all for being carbon neutral.  But I&#8217;m more for thinking about how much stuff we use and throw away.  And by &#8220;use&#8221; I include &#8220;burn to make energy&#8221;, which means that my concept of &#8220;reducing&#8221; includes lowering emissions, but, so I think, seems to be a more holistic approach.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div>What&#8217;s this got to do with my holiday and the Eden Project?<\/p>\n<p>Well, there aren&#8217;t many things that I don&#8217;t like about the lovely cottage that we&#8217;re staying in, but one thing that bugs me is that we can&#8217;t recycle.  Everything is thrown in the bin (well, we&#8217;re going to take some stuff home with us too).  This means that in 5 days we&#8217;ve produced about 2 times as much waste as we&#8217;d normally produce at home.  It&#8217;s shocking how, without compost and recycling, it mounts up so quickly.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div>In contrast, the Eden Project was keen to talk about how it was trying to be &#8220;waste neutral&#8221;.  Reducing the amount of waste that they produce, reusing items where it is possible, recycling what&#8217;s left, and buying recycled goods (and thus creating demand for recycled products).<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s expensive, and it sounds like hard work and lots of thinking.  They declare it to be &#8220;a philosophy for life&#8221;.  It&#8217;s a challenge to all of us.  It&#8217;s a challenge to me!  How much do I think about the waste that will be produced by an item that I buy?  How often do I get lazy and throw something away because to take it home and recycle it would be too much hard work?  Am I willing to pay a bit extra for something that&#8217;s locally sourced, recycled, or in &#8220;green&#8221; packaging?<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>One other thing that I wondered was, are we doing enough?  That is are we DOING enough?<\/p>\n<p>The Eden Project sells lots of books.  Mostly books about being green and ethical.  It&#8217;s good to read (or write!) an article or book about this kind of thing.  It&#8217;s good to be inspired by the wonders of nature on display at the Eden Project and feel protective of our amazing planet.  It&#8217;s good to read about how others are adopting this philosophy for life.  It&#8217;s good to think and ask the questions.<\/p>\n<p>But when we get to the supermarket, or need to travel somewhere nearby, or book a holiday, or are throwing something in the bin&#8230;when we have a choice to make a difference&#8230;what are we actually going to choose to do?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<div>Wednesday of our holiday in Cornwall, and a visit to the Eden Project!  You mostly hear good things about it but occasionally you meet someone that thought it was rubbish.  I can see why people might not like it but I thought it was fascinating, beautiful, educational and inspiring.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div>A visit to the Eden Project raises lots of questions about our planet.  I&#8217;d probably fall into the category of very-nearly-green-hippy.  Partly driven by my faith &#8211; my belief in a creator and in our duty to look after His creation &#8211; and partly driven by science and common sense, I believe we should reduce, recycle and reuse as much as possible.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been having a lot of conversations at work about being green.  Mostly with people who slightly mock the concept of being overtly, or overly, environmentally friendly.  Mostly with people who think I&#8217;m silly for cycling in the rain (but that&#8217;s another issue altogether).  I feel in a minority there.<\/p>\n<p>But most of the discussions aren&#8217;t actually about the concepts of waste, wastefulness, packaging, reuse of materials and consumerism.  Most of the discussions are about &#8220;Carbon Footprints&#8221;, which I don&#8217;t really understand myself and which, to me, seem to be just marketing to make us feel good about buying a product or service.  But I don&#8217;t actually get what it means to put a tonne of carbon dioxide into the air!  In contrast, I DO get what it means to put a plastic bag in a landfill.  It means that I&#8217;ve wasted some oil &#8211; a precious natural resource that will, one day pretty soon now, run out &#8211; in order to produce something that I&#8217;ve then discarded on a big heap and which will sit there being a plastic bag in the way, for a VERY long time.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div>I&#8217;m all for being carbon neutral.  But I&#8217;m more for thinking about how much stuff we use and throw away.  And by &#8220;use&#8221; I include &#8220;burn to make energy&#8221;, which means that my concept of &#8220;reducing&#8221; includes lowering emissions, but, so I think, seems to be a more holistic approach.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div>What&#8217;s this got to do with my holiday and the Eden Project?<\/p>\n<p>Well, there aren&#8217;t many things that I don&#8217;t like about the lovely cottage that we&#8217;re staying in, but one thing that bugs me is that we can&#8217;t recycle.  Everything is thrown in the bin (well, we&#8217;re going to take some stuff home with us too).  This means that in 5 days we&#8217;ve produced about 2 times as much waste as we&#8217;d normally produce at home.  It&#8217;s shocking how, without compost and recycling, it mounts up so quickly.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div>In contrast, the Eden Project was keen to talk about how it was trying to be &#8220;waste neutral&#8221;.  Reducing the amount of waste that they produce, reusing items where it is possible, recycling what&#8217;s left, and buying recycled goods (and thus creating demand for recycled products).<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s expensive, and it sounds like hard work and lots of thinking.  They declare it to be &#8220;a philosophy for life&#8221;.  It&#8217;s a challenge to all of us.  It&#8217;s a challenge to me!  How much do I think about the waste that will be produced by an item that I buy?  How often do I get lazy and throw something away because to take it home and recycle it would be too much hard work?  Am I willing to pay a bit extra for something that&#8217;s locally sourced, recycled, or in &#8220;green&#8221; packaging?<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>One other thing that I wondered was, are we doing enough?  That is are we DOING enough?<\/p>\n<p>The Eden Project sells lots of books.  Mostly books about being green and ethical.  It&#8217;s good to read (or write!) an article or book about this kind of thing.  It&#8217;s good to be inspired by the wonders of nature on display at the Eden Project and feel protective of our amazing planet.  It&#8217;s good to read about how others are adopting this philosophy for life.  It&#8217;s good to think and ask the questions.<\/p>\n<p>But when we get to the supermarket, or need to travel somewhere nearby, or book a holiday, or are throwing something in the bin&#8230;when we have a choice to make a difference&#8230;what are we actually going to choose to do?<\/p>\n",
