                "rendered": "\n<p>Someone asked me today if and how I had had any success marketing Turbo Admin, as they were developing a software product of their own and wanted to hear some experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the truth is that I have no idea what I&#8217;m doing. I hate marketing. I&#8217;m a total newbie. And <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a> &#8211; a browser extension that improves your WordPress Dashboard experience on ALL your sites&#8230; WHAT? &#8211; is a pretty unconventional product too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have no &#8220;tips&#8221; or &#8220;advice&#8221;. But I do have stories and experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to build in the open a bit and be transparent. So sharing a bit about what I&#8217;m doing and why and how seems like a good thing to do. If nothing else, to set the expectations of other people who may be in a similar position to myself. So this seemed like a good time to do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s what I wrote back to this person, tidied up a bit, and presented for your own enjoyment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I made Turbo Admin for me&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;and the initial prototype took about 2 days of my spare time to make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then realised it could totally be something that other people would love, and that it could easily be packaged up with a price tag and sold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seemed like an ideal first product to launch. So off I went!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u201cEasily\u201d was a bad assumption<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the difficulty was related specifically to the process of selling browser extensions. But there\u2019s also just the huge hassle of bundling releases, shipping stuff, marketing it, maintaining docs, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Documentation and automation are key here. I have a documented release process and some shell scripts that do some of the work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pricing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t want to be bothered with subscriptions. I didn\u2019t think there was THAT much value in it anyway. So I put a reasonable (in my opinion) price tag on it, and was sure to offer no guaranteed support (after all, it should \u201cjust work\u201d) and updates for the life of v1. But all without <em>promising<\/em> anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives me the option of making a v2 with a different pricing model if I want to. But doesn\u2019t commit me to doing ANYTHING. Though, in reality, v1 has grown a LOT and I&#8217;ve been supporting people when needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Marketing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve mostly marketed by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TurboAdmn\/status\/1501598332002738182\">\u201cteasing\u201d features on Twitter<\/a>. I have a reasonable following with a good number of WordPress developer \u201cinfluencers\u201d on the list. And announcing releases too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve taken the approach that every new feature or release is an excuse to talk about it, to the extent that I\u2019m quite worried my followers are getting bored\/annoyed (sorry!). I\u2019ve also used self-promotion channels in places like Slack groups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>More marketing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My product is HARD to market, because people aren\u2019t necessarily searching for it. But people that do find it love it (see <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/03\/turbo-admin-wordpress-command-palette-free-trial\/\">the testimonials on this post!<\/a>). So I\u2019ve relied a lot on word of mouth, recommendations, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is HARD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve done a bit of SEO work, and have been featured by Chris Coyier (on Twitter), on the WP Builds podcast\/stream (Nathan Wrigley) and a few other places.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s helped. But I need more of it and don&#8217;t know how to get it. I&#8217;ve done NO paid ads or anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Free trial\/more pricing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I only recently <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/03\/turbo-admin-wordpress-command-palette-free-trial\/\">implemented a free trial<\/a>. Initially I didn\u2019t want the support burden of a heap of free users. And I used <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/turbo-admin\/\">the plugin version<\/a> as the gateway\/trial of the main features. But arguably you don\u2019t see the full benefit of my product from that. So the price tag was a kinda deliberate barrier to entry. You had to want it!<br><br>Plus, at first, I only thought about time-limited trials. But I didn\u2019t want to do that for various reasons. But then I realised I could do a site-limited trial and that would work better. So I implemented that. (And have had ZERO sales since doing so! ( ? \/ ? ) )<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Riding media waves<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my features is notice hiding, so I tried to take advantage of the <a href=\"https:\/\/wptavern.com\/clarity-ad-blocker-for-wordpress-announced-receives-mixed-reactions\">recent debate around notice hiding\/ad blocking<\/a> and plug that feature a lot. There was a small bump in sales from this, but the impact wasn&#8217;t huge (other than this is how Nathan Wrigley picked it up).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sales and Software Licensing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, doing software licensing is HARD. I evaluated <a href=\"https:\/\/paddle.com\/\">Paddle<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/freemius.com\/\">Freemius<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/gumroad.com\/\">Gumroad<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/payhip.com\/\">PayHip<\/a>, and even started building my own solution, before settling on the very new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lemonsqueezy.com\/\">Lemon Squeezy<\/a> platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been great, but if I was new to it their pricing model wouldn\u2019t work for my kind of sales volumes (I\u2019m locked into a good deal as I was a beta tester).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DO use a \u201cmerchant of record\u201d to avoid all the tax faffing though. It\u2019s worth every penny of the fees you pay. And test out the licensing APIs thoroughly. They may look the same, but they are not!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>SHIP IT!<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I maybe have an advantage here in that my product won\u2019t do anything bad on your site. Really: It injects some JavaScript to scrape and manipulate the DOM. That\u2019s it. It handles no data or anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I\u2019ve very much taken the approach of \u201cit\u2019s good enough &#8211; ship it!\u201c to keep the releases and features coming and to keep it interesting. I actually do a lot of testing myself, and I can always fix things up later. I&#8217;ve aimed for &#8220;done&#8221; not &#8220;perfect&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Have fun. Don\u2019t burn out<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a day job with the wonderful <a href=\"https:\/\/deliciousbrains.com\/\">Delicious Brains<\/a>. So I&#8217;ve been doing this all in my &#8220;spare&#8221; time. I\u2019ve had \u201csprints\u201d on this where I barely talk to my family in the evenings to get stuff done. It\u2019s fun. But it\u2019s also not sustainable. Keep tabs on that. Don\u2019t burn yourself out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Deals and Freebies<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve avoided sales because I think people should pay what it\u2019s worth, I think the price is fair, and because I hate scarcity marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I\u2019ve done this I\u2019ve tried to have fun and do something a bit different (putting discount codes on the website as \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1465411502723248131\">easter eggs<\/a>\u201d for people to find, for example).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\u2019ve given out free licenses to some influential people with big followings in the hope that they will like it and promote it. This hasn&#8217;t done a huge amount (some people haven&#8217;t even used their coupons) but it seems like a good tactic that will maybe one day pay off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Social media is fickle<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Algorithms suck. I had a really good suggestion from someone to use more links to the product website in my Tweets about it. But honestly, Tweets with links seem to tank in the algorithm. Tweets with images and videos seem to do well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. Someone out there knows this better than I do. But try, learn, fail, try again, and figure it out as you go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Aim low. Be prepared for failure<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My basic goal was VERY low: I wanted 10 sales to be happy. If I had a stretch goal, it was 100 sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to know how it&#8217;s done? Really?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, here&#8217;s some numbers so you can get a feel for how it\u2019s done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>v1 released: 28th June 2021<\/li><li>Active plugin installs: 100+<\/li><li>Total paid browser extension sales: 65<\/li><li>Total revenue: nearly $2,500 (before fees)<\/li><li>Chrome extension installs: 111<\/li><li>5-star reviews: 7 &#8211; and there are ONLY 5-star reviews!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty chuffed with that. It&#8217;s not taken the world by storm. That&#8217;s OK. But people use it and love it. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s important. I\u2019m still hopeful I\u2019ll hit my stretch goal within the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m convinced I&#8217;m onto something that&#8217;s clever, unique and useful. But I&#8217;ve also had moments where I&#8217;ve done a big release and there&#8217;s been crickets. It feels futile sometimes. If it wasn&#8217;t enjoyable and interesting I&#8217;d have given up a long time ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But sales are great. Sometimes I\u2019m out and about and I get a sale notification on my phone and I smile because it paid for a meal out or a day trip with the kids. I work hard at it. But it is occasional passive income.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And writing posts like this? Yes. That&#8217;s totally part of the strategy. So <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">find out more<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/try.html\">try it for free<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/#the-deal\">buy a license to support me<\/a>. You could be buying my family dinner tonight!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Someone asked me today if and how I had had any success marketing Turbo Admin, as they were developing a software product of their own and wanted to hear some experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the truth is that I have no idea what I&#8217;m doing. I hate marketing. I&#8217;m a total newbie. And <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a> &#8211; a browser extension that improves your WordPress Dashboard experience on ALL your sites&#8230; WHAT? &#8211; is a pretty unconventional product too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have no &#8220;tips&#8221; or &#8220;advice&#8221;. But I do have stories and experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to build in the open a bit and be transparent. So sharing a bit about what I&#8217;m doing and why and how seems like a good thing to do. If nothing else, to set the expectations of other people who may be in a similar position to myself. So this seemed like a good time to do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s what I wrote back to this person, tidied up a bit, and presented for your own enjoyment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I made Turbo Admin for me&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;and the initial prototype took about 2 days of my spare time to make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then realised it could totally be something that other people would love, and that it could easily be packaged up with a price tag and sold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seemed like an ideal first product to launch. So off I went!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u201cEasily\u201d was a bad assumption<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the difficulty was related specifically to the process of selling browser extensions. But there\u2019s also just the huge hassle of bundling releases, shipping stuff, marketing it, maintaining docs, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Documentation and automation are key here. I have a documented release process and some shell scripts that do some of the work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pricing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t want to be bothered with subscriptions. I didn\u2019t think there was THAT much value in it anyway. So I put a reasonable (in my opinion) price tag on it, and was sure to offer no guaranteed support (after all, it should \u201cjust work\u201d) and updates for the life of v1. But all without <em>promising<\/em> anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives me the option of making a v2 with a different pricing model if I want to. But doesn\u2019t commit me to doing ANYTHING. Though, in reality, v1 has grown a LOT and I&#8217;ve been supporting people when needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Marketing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve mostly marketed by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TurboAdmn\/status\/1501598332002738182\">\u201cteasing\u201d features on Twitter<\/a>. I have a reasonable following with a good number of WordPress developer \u201cinfluencers\u201d on the list. And announcing releases too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve taken the approach that every new feature or release is an excuse to talk about it, to the extent that I\u2019m quite worried my followers are getting bored\/annoyed (sorry!). I\u2019ve also used self-promotion channels in places like Slack groups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>More marketing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My product is HARD to market, because people aren\u2019t necessarily searching for it. But people that do find it love it (see <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/03\/turbo-admin-wordpress-command-palette-free-trial\/\">the testimonials on this post!<\/a>). So I\u2019ve relied a lot on word of mouth, recommendations, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is HARD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve done a bit of SEO work, and have been featured by Chris Coyier (on Twitter), on the WP Builds podcast\/stream (Nathan Wrigley) and a few other places.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s helped. But I need more of it and don&#8217;t know how to get it. I&#8217;ve done NO paid ads or anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Free trial\/more pricing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I only recently <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/03\/turbo-admin-wordpress-command-palette-free-trial\/\">implemented a free trial<\/a>. Initially I didn\u2019t want the support burden of a heap of free users. And I used <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/turbo-admin\/\">the plugin version<\/a> as the gateway\/trial of the main features. But arguably you don\u2019t see the full benefit of my product from that. So the price tag was a kinda deliberate barrier to entry. You had to want it!<br><br>Plus, at first, I only thought about time-limited trials. But I didn\u2019t want to do that for various reasons. But then I realised I could do a site-limited trial and that would work better. So I implemented that. (And have had ZERO sales since doing so! ( ? \/ ? ) )<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Riding media waves<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my features is notice hiding, so I tried to take advantage of the <a href=\"https:\/\/wptavern.com\/clarity-ad-blocker-for-wordpress-announced-receives-mixed-reactions\">recent debate around notice hiding\/ad blocking<\/a> and plug that feature a lot. There was a small bump in sales from this, but the impact wasn&#8217;t huge (other than this is how Nathan Wrigley picked it up).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sales and Software Licensing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, doing software licensing is HARD. I evaluated <a href=\"https:\/\/paddle.com\/\">Paddle<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/freemius.com\/\">Freemius<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/gumroad.com\/\">Gumroad<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/payhip.com\/\">PayHip<\/a>, and even started building my own solution, before settling on the very new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lemonsqueezy.com\/\">Lemon Squeezy<\/a> platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been great, but if I was new to it their pricing model wouldn\u2019t work for my kind of sales volumes (I\u2019m locked into a good deal as I was a beta tester).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DO use a \u201cmerchant of record\u201d to avoid all the tax faffing though. It\u2019s worth every penny of the fees you pay. And test out the licensing APIs thoroughly. They may look the same, but they are not!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>SHIP IT!<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I maybe have an advantage here in that my product won\u2019t do anything bad on your site. Really: It injects some JavaScript to scrape and manipulate the DOM. That\u2019s it. It handles no data or anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I\u2019ve very much taken the approach of \u201cit\u2019s good enough &#8211; ship it!\u201c to keep the releases and features coming and to keep it interesting. I actually do a lot of testing myself, and I can always fix things up later. I&#8217;ve aimed for &#8220;done&#8221; not &#8220;perfect&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Have fun. Don\u2019t burn out<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a day job with the wonderful <a href=\"https:\/\/deliciousbrains.com\/\">Delicious Brains<\/a>. So I&#8217;ve been doing this all in my &#8220;spare&#8221; time. I\u2019ve had \u201csprints\u201d on this where I barely talk to my family in the evenings to get stuff done. It\u2019s fun. But it\u2019s also not sustainable. Keep tabs on that. Don\u2019t burn yourself out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Deals and Freebies<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve avoided sales because I think people should pay what it\u2019s worth, I think the price is fair, and because I hate scarcity marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I\u2019ve done this I\u2019ve tried to have fun and do something a bit different (putting discount codes on the website as \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1465411502723248131\">easter eggs<\/a>\u201d for people to find, for example).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\u2019ve given out free licenses to some influential people with big followings in the hope that they will like it and promote it. This hasn&#8217;t done a huge amount (some people haven&#8217;t even used their coupons) but it seems like a good tactic that will maybe one day pay off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Social media is fickle<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Algorithms suck. I had a really good suggestion from someone to use more links to the product website in my Tweets about it. But honestly, Tweets with links seem to tank in the algorithm. Tweets with images and videos seem to do well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. Someone out there knows this better than I do. But try, learn, fail, try again, and figure it out as you go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Aim low. Be prepared for failure<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My basic goal was VERY low: I wanted 10 sales to be happy. If I had a stretch goal, it was 100 sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to know how it&#8217;s done? Really?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, here&#8217;s some numbers so you can get a feel for how it\u2019s done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>v1 released: 28th June 2021<\/li><li>Active plugin installs: 100+<\/li><li>Total paid browser extension sales: 65<\/li><li>Total revenue: nearly $2,500 (before fees)<\/li><li>Chrome extension installs: 111<\/li><li>5-star reviews: 7 &#8211; and there are ONLY 5-star reviews!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty chuffed with that. It&#8217;s not taken the world by storm. That&#8217;s OK. But people use it and love it. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s important. I\u2019m still hopeful I\u2019ll hit my stretch goal within the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m convinced I&#8217;m onto something that&#8217;s clever, unique and useful. But I&#8217;ve also had moments where I&#8217;ve done a big release and there&#8217;s been crickets. It feels futile sometimes. If it wasn&#8217;t enjoyable and interesting I&#8217;d have given up a long time ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But sales are great. Sometimes I\u2019m out and about and I get a sale notification on my phone and I smile because it paid for a meal out or a day trip with the kids. I work hard at it. But it is occasional passive income.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And writing posts like this? Yes. That&#8217;s totally part of the strategy.

                "rendered": "\n<p>Given all the &#8220;Wordle&#8221; hype these days, I think I was one of the first (of many) people to wonder about what &#8220;WordlePress&#8221; might look like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1478999708228108293\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Not long after, Taco Verdo did buy the domain, with the aim of preserving it for the good of the WordPress community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I have <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/oNmgelSNll\">https:\/\/t.co\/oNmgelSNll<\/a>, but no time to turn it into a game.<\/p>&mdash; Taco Verdo (@TacoVerdo) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TacoVerdo\/status\/1490612545484378112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 7, 2022<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, one bored weekend, I came up with the idea of making <a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/\">a Wordle-style game<\/a> where you had to guess a WordPress core function name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prototype took a couple of hours to make. And it&#8217;s fine as a game in principle. But it&#8217;s REALLY hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can play at <a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/\">https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/<\/a> &#8211; I but I warn you, you need to be a proper back-end WordPress geek to be anything like any good!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Behind the scenes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to write some notes about the behind the scenes, how I made this work stuff. And, because I&#8217;m a geek, I got all curious about WordPress function names: how long they are; how common the different name parts are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s dig in!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding all the function names<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The game is based on 4-part function names. &#8220;Parts&#8221; are separated by underscores. So <code>get_attachment_image_url<\/code> is a good example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I needed to find all the global function names, count their &#8220;parts&#8221;, and filter them. So I needed to do some pre-processing of the WordPress code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got all the function names from the <code><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/php-stubs\/wordpress-stubs\">wordpress-stubs<\/a><\/code> package. This is a package used for static analysis that contains all the class, and function signatures throughout WordPress core, but without the actual function\/class code. All the function\/method bodies are empty. And they are all concatenated into <a href=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/php-stubs\/wordpress-stubs\/master\/wordpress-stubs.php\">one file<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used a combination of <code>grep<\/code> and <code>cut<\/code> commands to get all the function names from this file. Because the regex filtered out any functions with <code>public<\/code>\/<code>protected<\/code>\/<code>private<\/code> visibility specified, this should have ignored most class methods, and only given my globally available functions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the command I used:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\negrep '^\\s+function\\s+(&#x5B;^ \\(]+)' wordpress-stubs.php | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f6 | cut -d &quot;(&quot; -f 1 &gt; wpfuncs.txt\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I then opened <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2020\/01\/tinkerwell-for-wordpress-developers\/\">Tinkerwell<\/a> to mess about with the data I had using my PHP skills. This just seemed like the quickest way to get to some interesting answers about the function names.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing I really wanted to know was how many function names had 3, 4 or 5 parts, as this would influence the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t clean, well-engineered code, but it does the job. I&#8217;m gonna use it once and throw it away so I&#8217;m not thinking too hard.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n\/\/ Read in all the function names.\n$funcs = file_get_contents('wpfuncs.txt');\n\n\/\/ Keep counts of number of function name parts\n$lengths = &#x5B;];\n\nforeach (explode(&quot;\\n&quot;, $funcs) as $func) {\n  if (! empty(trim($func))) {\n    \/\/ Split the function name at _'s\n    $parts = explode ('_', $func);\n    \/\/ Discard empty parts\n    $parts = array_filter( $parts, function ($a) { return ! empty($a); } );\n    $parts = count($parts);\n\n    \/\/ Update the count in the array\n    if (isset($lengths&#x5B;$parts])) {\n      $lengths&#x5B;$parts]++;\n    } else {\n      $lengths&#x5B;$parts] = 1;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\/\/ Sort the array by number of function parts\nksort($lengths);\n\nvar_dump($lengths);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>At the time of writing, this gives us:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&#x5B;\n     0 =&gt; 1, \n     1 =&gt; 42,\n     2 =&gt; 576,\n     3 =&gt; 1196,\n     4 =&gt; 1004,\n     5 =&gt; 420,\n     6 =&gt; 182,\n     7 =&gt; 62,\n     8 =&gt; 18,\n     9 =&gt; 4,\n     10 =&gt; 2,\n     11 =&gt; 1,\n   ]\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>From the point of view of making the game, we see that 3-part functions give us the greatest number of functions with 1196 function names. This isn&#8217;t necessarily good though as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Guessing more parts means we more quickly rule words in or out of the function name<\/li><li>So guessing fewer parts each time AND having more functions to guess makes the game harder.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The 420 5-part functions seemed too small though. So I decided to go with the 1004 4-part functions for the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out this is STILL a very hard game!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stats, functions and &#8220;fun&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This section has no real value at all. But I was curious about some of the numbers and functions here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How many global functions are there?<\/li><li>What are the shortest and longest function names?<\/li><li>What are the most common &#8220;parts&#8221;\/&#8221;words&#8221; in function names (apart from <code>wp_<\/code>)?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s dig in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Total global functions<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to this analysis there are 3508 global functions in WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s quite a lot!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Longest and shortest function names<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of function name parts\/words, we can easily see:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>There&#8217;s a function with ZERO WORDS? Bear in mind that underscores themselves don&#8217;t count. Maybe you can guess it? If not, head to <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/__\/\">the docs<\/a>.<\/li><li>There are thirty-four 1-word functions. Perhaps you&#8217;ve used <code>dbdelta<\/code>, <code>trailingslashit<\/code>, <code>mysql2date<\/code>, <code>absint<\/code>, <code>bloginfo<\/code>, <code>selected<\/code> or <code>checked<\/code>? But what about <code><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/saveDomDocument\/\">saveDomDocument<\/a><\/code>, <code><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/zeroise\/\">zeroise<\/a><\/code> (curious in its non-US English spelling), or <code><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/antispambot\/\">antispambot<\/a><\/code>?<\/li><li>There are 2 10-part function. Hands up if you&#8217;ve used <code><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/wp_add_trashed_suffix_to_post_name_for_trashed_posts\/\">wp_add_trashed_suffix_to_post_name_for_trashed_posts<\/a><\/code> or the undocumented <code>_delete_site_logo_on_remove_custom_logo_on_setup_theme<\/code>?<\/li><li>And there is just one 11-part function. Bonus points if you&#8217;ve ever called <code>block_core_calendar_update_has_published_post_on_transition_post_status<\/code> for some reason (it&#8217;s also undocumented).<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Most common words\/parts<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll need to add some new code to analyse this. Here we go:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$funcs = file_get_contents('wpfuncs.txt');\n\n$wordUses = &#x5B;];\n\nforeach (explode(&quot;\\n&quot;, $funcs) as $func) {\n  if (! empty(trim($func))) {\n    $parts = explode('_', $func);\n    $parts = array_filter( $parts, function ($a) { return ! empty($a); } );\n  \tforeach($parts as $part) {\n      $wordUses&#x5B;$part] = isset($wordUses&#x5B;$part]) ? $wordUses&#x5B;$part] + 1 : 1;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nasort($wordUses);\nvar_dump($wordUses);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Sorting this way around (ascending order of use) isn&#8217;t particularly revealing. We just get all the words\/parts that are only used in one function. Of which there are a LOT!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, there are 1434 distinct words used in WordPress core global functions. And 563 (nearly 40%) of those words are only used in one function name! No wonder WordlePress is so hard! Perhaps we can analyse just the 4-part functions in a moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick <code>array_reverse()<\/code> gives us the most-used words\/parts. And it&#8217;s no surprise that <code>wp<\/code> leads the way, appearing in 1245 functions. More than a third of all functions have <code>wp<\/code> in!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re playing WordlePress you&#8217;ll want the top-ten for starter words. So these are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>wp<\/code> (1245 instances)<\/li><li><code>get<\/code> (firmly second with a massive 762 instances!)<\/li><li><code>post<\/code> (third with 308 instances)<\/li><li><code>block<\/code> (fast upcoming in 4th place with 217 instances)<\/li><li><code>link<\/code> (166 instances)<\/li><li><code>is<\/code> (156 instances)<\/li><li><code>core<\/code> (144 instances)<\/li><li><code>update<\/code> (138 instances)<\/li><li><code>the<\/code> (133 instances)<\/li><li><code>add<\/code> (124 instances)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordlePress words\/parts<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So is <code>wp_get_post_block<\/code> the best opener for WordlePress?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember we&#8217;re only using 4-part functions. Is the analysis any different?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s a little different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best WordlePress opening guess is <code>wp_get_post_link<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>wp<\/code> remains strongest by far. It&#8217;s in 482 of the 1004 4-part function names. Close to 50%!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>core<\/code> and <code>block<\/code> get demoted a bit. <code>update<\/code> drops down the rankings. And <code>ajax<\/code>, <code>image<\/code> and <code>register<\/code> climb into the top ten:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>wp<\/code> (482 instances)<\/li><li><code>get<\/code> (300 instances)<\/li><li><code>post<\/code> (115 instances)<\/li><li><code>link<\/code> (62 instances)<\/li><li><code>ajax<\/code> (54 instances)<\/li><li><code>block<\/code> (52 instances)<\/li><li><code>is<\/code> (45 instances)<\/li><li><code>the<\/code> (43 instances)<\/li><li><code>image<\/code> (41 instances)<\/li><li><code>register<\/code> (36 instances)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s still 763 words to choose from! Which is one of the reasons WordlePress is so hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully this new knowledge will help you play. Or maybe I&#8217;ll use it to refine the game to make it easier in future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, this was kinda fun weekend tinkering. I hope you learned something!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Given all the &#8220;Wordle&#8221; hype these days, I think I was one of the first (of many) people to wonder about what &#8220;WordlePress&#8221; might look like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1478999708228108293\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Not long after, Taco Verdo did buy the domain, with the aim of preserving it for the good of the WordPress community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I have <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/oNmgelSNll\">https:\/\/t.co\/oNmgelSNll<\/a>, but no time to turn it into a game.<\/p>&mdash; Taco Verdo (@TacoVerdo) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TacoVerdo\/status\/1490612545484378112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 7, 2022<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, one bored weekend, I came up with the idea of making <a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/\">a Wordle-style game<\/a> where you had to guess a WordPress core function name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prototype took a couple of hours to make. And it&#8217;s fine as a game in principle. But it&#8217;s REALLY hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can play at <a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/\">https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/<\/a> &#8211; I but I warn you, you need to be a proper back-end WordPress geek to be anything like any good!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Behind the scenes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to write some notes about the behind the scenes, how I made this work stuff. And, because I&#8217;m a geek, I got all curious about WordPress function names: how long they are; how common the different name parts are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s dig in!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding all the function names<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The game is based on 4-part function names. &#8220;Parts&#8221; are separated by underscores. So <code>get_attachment_image_url<\/code> is a good example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I needed to find all the global function names, count their &#8220;parts&#8221;, and filter them. So I needed to do some pre-processing of the WordPress code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got all the function names from the <code><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/php-stubs\/wordpress-stubs\">wordpress-stubs<\/a><\/code> package. This is a package used for static analysis that contains all the class, and function signatures throughout WordPress core, but without the actual function\/class code. All the function\/method bodies are empty. And they are all concatenated into <a href=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/php-stubs\/wordpress-stubs\/master\/wordpress-stubs.php\">one file<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used a combination of <code>grep<\/code> and <code>cut<\/code> commands to get all the function names from this file. Because the regex filtered out any functions with <code>public<\/code>\/<code>protected<\/code>\/<code>private<\/code> visibility specified, this should have ignored most class methods, and only given my globally available functions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the command I used:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\negrep '^\\s+function\\s+(&#x5B;^ \\(]+)' wordpress-stubs.php | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f6 | cut -d &quot;(&quot; -f 1 &gt; wpfuncs.txt\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I then opened <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2020\/01\/tinkerwell-for-wordpress-developers\/\">Tinkerwell<\/a> to mess about with the data I had using my PHP skills. This just seemed like the quickest way to get to some interesting answers about the function names.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing I really wanted to know was how many function names had 3, 4 or 5 parts, as this would influence the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t clean, well-engineered code, but it does the job. I&#8217;m gonna use it once and throw it away so I&#8217;m not thinking too hard.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n\/\/ Read in all the function names.\n$funcs = file_get_contents('wpfuncs.txt');\n\n\/\/ Keep counts of number of function name parts\n$lengths = &#x5B;];\n\nforeach (explode(&quot;\\n&quot;, $funcs) as $func) {\n  if (! empty(trim($func))) {\n    \/\/ Split the function name at _'s\n    $parts = explode ('_', $func);\n    \/\/ Discard empty parts\n    $parts = array_filter( $parts, function ($a) { return ! empty($a); } );\n    $parts = count($parts);\n\n    \/\/ Update the count in the array\n    if (isset($lengths&#x5B;$parts])) {\n      $lengths&#x5B;$parts]++;\n    } else {\n      $lengths&#x5B;$parts] = 1;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\/\/ Sort the array by number of function parts\nksort($lengths);\n\nvar_dump($lengths);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>At the time of writing, this gives us:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&#x5B;\n     0 =&gt; 1, \n     1 =&gt; 42,\n     2 =&gt; 576,\n     3 =&gt; 1196,\n     4 =&gt; 1004,\n     5 =&gt; 420,\n     6 =&gt; 182,\n     7 =&gt; 62,\n     8 =&gt; 18,\n     9 =&gt; 4,\n     10 =&gt; 2,\n     11 =&gt; 1,\n   ]\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>From the point of view of making the game, we see that 3-part functions give us the greatest number of functions with 1196 function names. This isn&#8217;t necessarily good though as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Guessing more parts means we more quickly rule words in or out of the function name<\/li><li>So guessing fewer parts each time AND having more functions to guess makes the game harder.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The 420 5-part functions seemed too small though. So I decided to go with the 1004 4-part functions for the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out this is STILL a very hard game!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stats, functions and &#8220;fun&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This section has no real value at all. But I was curious about some of the numbers and functions here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How many global functions are there?<\/li><li>What are the shortest and longest function names?<\/li><li>What are the most common &#8220;parts&#8221;\/&#8221;words&#8221; in function names (apart from <code>wp_<\/code>)?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s dig in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Total global functions<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to this analysis there are 3508 global functions in WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s quite a lot!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Longest and shortest function names<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of function name parts\/words, we can easily see:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>There&#8217;s a function with ZERO WORDS? Bear in mind that underscores themselves don&#8217;t count. Maybe you can guess it? If not, head to <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/__\/\">the docs<\/a>.<\/li><li>There are thirty-four 1-word functions. Perhaps you&#8217;ve used <code>dbdelta<\/code>, <code>trailingslashit<\/code>, <code>mysql2date<\/code>, <code>absint<\/code>, <code>bloginfo<\/code>, <code>selected<\/code> or <code>checked<\/code>? But what about <code><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/saveDomDocument\/\">saveDomDocument<\/a><\/code>, <code><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/zeroise\/\">zeroise<\/a><\/code> (curious in its non-US English spelling), or <code><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/antispambot\/\">antispambot<\/a><\/code>?<\/li><li>There are 2 10-part function. Hands up if you&#8217;ve used <code><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/wp_add_trashed_suffix_to_post_name_for_trashed_posts\/\">wp_add_trashed_suffix_to_post_name_for_trashed_posts<\/a><\/code> or the undocumented <code>_delete_site_logo_on_remove_custom_logo_on_setup_theme<\/code>?<\/li><li>And there is just one 11-part function. Bonus points if you&#8217;ve ever called <code>block_core_calendar_update_has_published_post_on_transition_post_status<\/code> for some reason (it&#8217;s also undocumented).<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Most common words\/parts<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll need to add some new code to analyse this. Here we go:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$funcs = file_get_contents('wpfuncs.txt');\n\n$wordUses = &#x5B;];\n\nforeach (explode(&quot;\\n&quot;, $funcs) as $func) {\n  if (! empty(trim($func))) {\n    $parts = explode('_', $func);\n    $parts = array_filter( $parts, function ($a) { return ! empty($a); } );\n  \tforeach($parts as $part) {\n      $wordUses&#x5B;$part] = isset($wordUses&#x5B;$part]) ? $wordUses&#x5B;$part] + 1 : 1;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nasort($wordUses);\nvar_dump($wordUses);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Sorting this way around (ascending order of use) isn&#8217;t particularly revealing. We just get all the words\/parts that are only used in one function. Of which there are a LOT!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, there are 1434 distinct words used in WordPress core global functions. And 563 (nearly 40%) of those words are only used in one function name! No wonder WordlePress is so hard! Perhaps we can analyse just the 4-part functions in a moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick <code>array_reverse()<\/code> gives us the most-used words\/parts. And it&#8217;s no surprise that <code>wp<\/code> leads the way, appearing in 1245 functions. More than a third of all functions have <code>wp<\/code> in!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re playing WordlePress you&#8217;ll want the top-ten for starter words. So these are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>wp<\/code> (1245 instances)<\/li><li><code>get<\/code> (firmly second with a massive 762 instances!)<\/li><li><code>post<\/code> (third with 308 instances)<\/li><li><code>block<\/code> (fast upcoming in 4th place with 217 instances)<\/li><li><code>link<\/code> (166 instances)<\/li><li><code>is<\/code> (156 instances)<\/li><li><code>core<\/code> (144 instances)<\/li><li><code>update<\/code> (138 instances)<\/li><li><code>the<\/code> (133 instances)<\/li><li><code>add<\/code> (124 instances)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordlePress words\/parts<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So is <code>wp_get_post_block<\/code> the best opener for WordlePress?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember we&#8217;re only using 4-part functions. Is the analysis any different?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s a little different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best WordlePress opening guess is <code>wp_get_post_link<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>wp<\/code> remains strongest by far. It&#8217;s in 482 of the 1004 4-part function names. Close to 50%!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>core<\/code> and <code>block<\/code> get demoted a bit. <code>update<\/code> drops down the rankings. And <code>ajax<\/code>, <code>image<\/code> and <code>register<\/code> climb into the top ten:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>wp<\/code> (482 instances)<\/li><li><code>get<\/code> (300 instances)<\/li><li><code>post<\/code> (115 instances)<\/li><li><code>link<\/code> (62 instances)<\/li><li><code>ajax<\/code> (54 instances)<\/li><li><code>block<\/code> (52 instances)<\/li><li><code>is<\/code> (45 instances)<\/li><li><code>the<\/code> (43 instances)<\/li><li><code>image<\/code> (41 instances)<\/li><li><code>register<\/code> (36 instances)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s still 763 words to choose from! Which is one of the reasons WordlePress is so hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully this new knowledge will help you play. Or maybe I&#8217;ll use it to refine the game to make it easier in future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, this was kinda fun weekend tinkering. I hope you learned something!<\/p>\n",

All the applications I mentioned above have command palettes, but there&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alfredapp.com\/\">Alfred App<\/a> for MacOS, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.raycast.com\/\">Raycast<\/a>, MacOS&#8217;s own Spotlight. Plus <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\/components\/application-ui\/navigation\/command-palettes\">TailwindUI<\/a> added some command palette designs so that other people can add them to their web apps, and <a href=\"https:\/\/kbar.vercel.app\/\">kbar<\/a> is a JS library to help you add them too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This trend is one that I claim I was ahead of the curve on as I made my own <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">command palette tool for WordPress<\/a>, and then played with making that same tool work on other web applications, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1401983433296039943\">Laravel Forge<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1419748068564639749\">Github<\/a> months before they added their own command palettes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"550\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-1024x550.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10982\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-1024x550.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-300x161.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-768x412.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-1536x825.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-2048x1099.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a> is my attempt to bring a command palette to the WordPress Dashboard.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s a problem &#8211; especially with web applications such as Forge, GitHub and Netlify: Each command palette is different! The keyboard shortcut to trigger the palette may be different. The presentation of the commands may be different. The way that search and sub-menus work may be different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There must be a better way! And I think that there could be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Config-driven Turbo Admin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s go back a bit to the inception of my &#8220;Turbo Admin&#8221; command palette for WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had seen &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/philo.dev\/getting-started-with-laravel-spotlight\/\">Laravel Spotlight<\/a>&#8220;, and the moment I saw it my first thought was &#8220;That&#8217;s genius &#8211; why don&#8217;t all web apps have command palettes?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My second thought was &#8220;WordPress should have a command palette!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I set to it, and the easiest way I could come up with to gather up the menu items and commands was, surprisingly, not to hook into the back-end somehow, but to use JavaScript to scrape the menu items and their URLs from the WordPress dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This worked fine as a basic first implementation. But it quickly hit limitations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially I just wanted to add some of my own hard-coded extra commands for things like &#8220;Logout&#8221;, but then I realised that the Logout link was in the admin bar at the top of the WordPress dashboard. So I added the ability to grab that too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I wanted to grab more and more links from throughout the Dashboard I realised I needed some kind of array of things to grab. And this idea eventually evolved into a configuration-based system for injecting items into the Turbo Admin palette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This configuration lets you specify:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The &#8220;type&#8221; of link to discover &#8211; it can be a hard-coded title and URL, or dynamically discovered links using a DOM\/CSS selector<\/li><li>The selector to use (for selector-based links)<\/li><li>Either the title to use, or a function for generating a title from a discovered element<\/li><li>Either the URL to use, or a function for generating a URL from a discovered element<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This probably makes sense with a simple example. This config entry discovers all of the &#8220;New &lt;post type&gt;&#8221; links in the WordPress admin bar, such as &#8220;New Post&#8221;, &#8220;New Page&#8221; and so on:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n{\n  'detectType': 'dom',\n  'detectSelector': '#wp-admin-bar-new-content .ab-submenu a',\n  'itemTitleFunction': (item) =&gt; 'New ' + item.textContent,\n  'itemUrlFunction': (item) =&gt; item.href\n},\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>With this config-driven approach I can specify DOM selectors for non-WordPress applications too &#8211; and this is exactly how my simple palettes for GitHub and Forge came about. (I note that these were just demos, and never made it into public in any way other than teaser videos).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An API for command palettes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With this config driven approach in place, I can seemingly inject a command palette into any* web-based application!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>* &#8211; Not quite any, some use dynamically generated items or randomly generated IDs. What can you do?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I&#8217;ve made here is an API or protocol for defining command palette items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next obvious step is something like: &#8220;What if an application can provide these configurations itself?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if not &#8220;What if standard-format configurations could be user\/community-generated, like <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Userscript\">user scripts<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stylus_(browser_extension)\">user styles<\/a>?&#8221; (Note: use these at your own risk!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there could be any number of command palette browser extensions that sucked in these configs and made the menus for you. Or maybe the browsers could have them built in themselves?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;d have the same interface and the same keyboard shortcut for all your web applications. It would be amazing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An API for menu items in general?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A note to designers and people who love fancy websites with intricate designs: you&#8217;re gonna hate me! I make no apology for that. UI conventions are a thing that can be useful, and I&#8217;m just exploring ideas. Bear with me.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if we have a system for a website or web application to specify command palette items&#8230; well&#8230; aren&#8217;t these just the menu items? So&#8230; umm&#8230; can&#8217;t we also use this API\/protocol for defining the menu items for a website rather than scraping them from the DOM. Use the configuration to ADD them to the DOM? Or just let the browser handle all this for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Items wouldn&#8217;t have to be links. They could be callbacks\/functions that &#8220;do stuff&#8221;. This doesn&#8217;t have to be a restriction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I know it would be really boring if every website had the same menus. We&#8217;d have to figure that out. Perhaps there is some compromise with design?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But look at how applications on your desktop\/laptop work&#8230; the menus are in the same place for most apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-1024x640.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10985\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-768x480.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-1536x961.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-2048x1281.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And those that do things their own way are SUPER annoying (I&#8217;m looking at YOU Warp terminal&#8230;)<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-1024x696.png\" alt=\"Screengrab of Warp terminal app showing their menu on the top-right-hand corner.\" class=\"wp-image-10979\" width=\"604\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-1024x696.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-300x204.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-768x522.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-1536x1045.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-2048x1393.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px\" \/><figcaption>Warp terminal is cool and fast and smart, but I can NEVER find the settings!<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And look at how the MS Office suite and Apple&#8217;s work applications have consistently placed user interface components. Once you have learned one tool, you can easily learn others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>User interface conventions can be helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AND&#8230; as the developer&#8230; building nav menus is flippin hard, and we so often don&#8217;t get interactions and accessibility right. What if this was all handled for us? We just provide the data, and the browser takes care of it, and we get the possibility of command palettes &#8211; and maybe other kinds of interface &#8211; for free?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And why stop at menus? You could define keyboard shortcuts too, thus removing a zillion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How would this work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If this was a thing then we would need a way to get the configuration to the browser or browser extension. It would probably be JSON. I guess. But how would it be delivered\/discovered?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve not thought about this a lot, but there seem to be a few obvious ways to me:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>A file in the root of a site, like robots.txt, or the old standardised favicon location, with a standard name. Maybe &#8220;commands.json&#8221; or something.<\/li><li>Like the above, but with a meta tag in the HTML to specify the file&#8217;s location.<\/li><li>A standardised &#8211; or meta-tag specified &#8211; API route. This would work like the above but could allow options to be passed and deliver dynamic configurations.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So, Ross, this sounds great. Why do you say you &#8220;know nothing&#8221;?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>(<em>This probably is not the question you were asking, but if you were<\/em>&#8230;)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply because it seems so obvious that many people MUST have thought of it before and dismissed it for a hundred and one good reasons that I&#8217;m too stupid to have thought of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they just want to maintain the ability to design menus. In which case, let&#8217;s find that compromise because a standardised, easy-to-develop, accessible-by-default, machine-readable website navigation seems to have a lot of benefits!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve really tried to think of some downsides. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s insecure or open to abuse (though I&#8217;m sure people will tell me I&#8217;m wrong). I&#8217;m sure it can handle translations, sub-menus, mega-menus and some elements of design. You wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about responsive design or RTL languages &#8211; it would all be taken care of for you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could even help Google discover <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/advanced\/appearance\/sitelinks\">site links<\/a> and improve search results!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve had the thought that &#8220;We don&#8217;t have other APIs like this that send config to the browser?&#8221;, but we clearly do! Especially in modern browsers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have all manner of meta headers we can add to control languages and browser features and icons that get displayed and color schemes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/Manifest\">web app manifests<\/a> that specify all sorts of options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have all sorts of APIs for interacting with things like the clipboard, bluetooth devices, browser history, scroll behaviour and standard sharing options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The browser is doing so much for us these days&#8230; why do we continue to handle navigation manually?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why would we not do this? Am I really the first to have thought of it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a browser engineer, or involved in any way at all with the committees that define browser APIs. This just seems like a good idea to me. Perhaps there&#8217;s already an RFC? I really don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said&#8230; I know nothing. So tell me what you know. Why shouldn&#8217;t this happen?<\/p>\n",

They take all the things you can do in the application and make them available with a few keystrokes. And some include more advanced features like searching content or files too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"613\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.52.38@2x-1024x613.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10981\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.52.38@2x-1024x613.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.52.38@2x-300x180.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.52.38@2x-768x460.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.52.38@2x-1536x920.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.52.38@2x-2048x1226.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>GitHub&#8217;s command palette &#8211; press Ctrl\/Cmd-K to access!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who love to use their keyboard to navigate their computer, they are valuable tools, allowing keyboard access to application features that goes way beyond keyboard shortcuts, and removing the need to memorise a large number of keyboard shortcuts to be efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And command palettes seem to be a growing trend. All the applications I mentioned above have command palettes, but there&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alfredapp.com\/\">Alfred App<\/a> for MacOS, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.raycast.com\/\">Raycast<\/a>, MacOS&#8217;s own Spotlight. Plus <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\/components\/application-ui\/navigation\/command-palettes\">TailwindUI<\/a> added some command palette designs so that other people can add them to their web apps, and <a href=\"https:\/\/kbar.vercel.app\/\">kbar<\/a> is a JS library to help you add them too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This trend is one that I claim I was ahead of the curve on as I made my own <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">command palette tool for WordPress<\/a>, and then played with making that same tool work on other web applications, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1401983433296039943\">Laravel Forge<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1419748068564639749\">Github<\/a> months before they added their own command palettes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"550\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-1024x550.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10982\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-1024x550.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-300x161.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-768x412.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-1536x825.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-2048x1099.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a> is my attempt to bring a command palette to the WordPress Dashboard.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s a problem &#8211; especially with web applications such as Forge, GitHub and Netlify: Each command palette is different! The keyboard shortcut to trigger the palette may be different. The presentation of the commands may be different. The way that search and sub-menus work may be different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There must be a better way! And I think that there could be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Config-driven Turbo Admin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s go back a bit to the inception of my &#8220;Turbo Admin&#8221; command palette for WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had seen &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/philo.dev\/getting-started-with-laravel-spotlight\/\">Laravel Spotlight<\/a>&#8220;, and the moment I saw it my first thought was &#8220;That&#8217;s genius &#8211; why don&#8217;t all web apps have command palettes?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My second thought was &#8220;WordPress should have a command palette!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I set to it, and the easiest way I could come up with to gather up the menu items and commands was, surprisingly, not to hook into the back-end somehow, but to use JavaScript to scrape the menu items and their URLs from the WordPress dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This worked fine as a basic first implementation. But it quickly hit limitations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially I just wanted to add some of my own hard-coded extra commands for things like &#8220;Logout&#8221;, but then I realised that the Logout link was in the admin bar at the top of the WordPress dashboard. So I added the ability to grab that too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I wanted to grab more and more links from throughout the Dashboard I realised I needed some kind of array of things to grab. And this idea eventually evolved into a configuration-based system for injecting items into the Turbo Admin palette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This configuration lets you specify:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The &#8220;type&#8221; of link to discover &#8211; it can be a hard-coded title and URL, or dynamically discovered links using a DOM\/CSS selector<\/li><li>The selector to use (for selector-based links)<\/li><li>Either the title to use, or a function for generating a title from a discovered element<\/li><li>Either the URL to use, or a function for generating a URL from a discovered element<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This probably makes sense with a simple example. This config entry discovers all of the &#8220;New &lt;post type&gt;&#8221; links in the WordPress admin bar, such as &#8220;New Post&#8221;, &#8220;New Page&#8221; and so on:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n{\n  'detectType': 'dom',\n  'detectSelector': '#wp-admin-bar-new-content .ab-submenu a',\n  'itemTitleFunction': (item) =&gt; 'New ' + item.textContent,\n  'itemUrlFunction': (item) =&gt; item.href\n},\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>With this config-driven approach I can specify DOM selectors for non-WordPress applications too &#8211; and this is exactly how my simple palettes for GitHub and Forge came about. (I note that these were just demos, and never made it into public in any way other than teaser videos).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An API for command palettes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With this config driven approach in place, I can seemingly inject a command palette into any* web-based application!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>* &#8211; Not quite any, some use dynamically generated items or randomly generated IDs. What can you do?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I&#8217;ve made here is an API or protocol for defining command palette items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next obvious step is something like: &#8220;What if an application can provide these configurations itself?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if not &#8220;What if standard-format configurations could be user\/community-generated, like <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Userscript\">user scripts<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stylus_(browser_extension)\">user styles<\/a>?&#8221; (Note: use these at your own risk!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there could be any number of command palette browser extensions that sucked in these configs and made the menus for you. Or maybe the browsers could have them built in themselves?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;d have the same interface and the same keyboard shortcut for all your web applications. It would be amazing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An API for menu items in general?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A note to designers and people who love fancy websites with intricate designs: you&#8217;re gonna hate me! I make no apology for that. UI conventions are a thing that can be useful, and I&#8217;m just exploring ideas. Bear with me.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if we have a system for a website or web application to specify command palette items&#8230; well&#8230; aren&#8217;t these just the menu items? So&#8230; umm&#8230; can&#8217;t we also use this API\/protocol for defining the menu items for a website rather than scraping them from the DOM. Use the configuration to ADD them to the DOM? Or just let the browser handle all this for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Items wouldn&#8217;t have to be links. They could be callbacks\/functions that &#8220;do stuff&#8221;. This doesn&#8217;t have to be a restriction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I know it would be really boring if every website had the same menus. We&#8217;d have to figure that out. Perhaps there is some compromise with design?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But look at how applications on your desktop\/laptop work&#8230; the menus are in the same place for most apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-1024x640.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10985\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-768x480.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-1536x961.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-2048x1281.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And those that do things their own way are SUPER annoying (I&#8217;m looking at YOU Warp terminal&#8230;)<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-1024x696.png\" alt=\"Screengrab of Warp terminal app showing their menu on the top-right-hand corner.\" class=\"wp-image-10979\" width=\"604\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-1024x696.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-300x204.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-768x522.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-1536x1045.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-2048x1393.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px\" \/><figcaption>Warp terminal is cool and fast and smart, but I can NEVER find the settings!<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And look at how the MS Office suite and Apple&#8217;s work applications have consistently placed user interface components. Once you have learned one tool, you can easily learn others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>User interface conventions can be helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AND&#8230; as the developer&#8230; building nav menus is flippin hard, and we so often don&#8217;t get interactions and accessibility right. What if this was all handled for us? We just provide the data, and the browser takes care of it, and we get the possibility of command palettes &#8211; and maybe other kinds of interface &#8211; for free?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And why stop at menus? You could define keyboard shortcuts too, thus removing a zillion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How would this work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If this was a thing then we would need a way to get the configuration to the browser or browser extension. It would probably be JSON. I guess. But how would it be delivered\/discovered?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve not thought about this a lot, but there seem to be a few obvious ways to me:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>A file in the root of a site, like robots.txt, or the old standardised favicon location, with a standard name. Maybe &#8220;commands.json&#8221; or something.<\/li><li>Like the above, but with a meta tag in the HTML to specify the file&#8217;s location.<\/li><li>A standardised &#8211; or meta-tag specified &#8211; API route. This would work like the above but could allow options to be passed and deliver dynamic configurations.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So, Ross, this sounds great. Why do you say you &#8220;know nothing&#8221;?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>(<em>This probably is not the question you were asking, but if you were<\/em>&#8230;)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply because it seems so obvious that many people MUST have thought of it before and dismissed it for a hundred and one good reasons that I&#8217;m too stupid to have thought of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they just want to maintain the ability to design menus. In which case, let&#8217;s find that compromise because a standardised, easy-to-develop, accessible-by-default, machine-readable website navigation seems to have a lot of benefits!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve really tried to think of some downsides. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s insecure or open to abuse (though I&#8217;m sure people will tell me I&#8217;m wrong). I&#8217;m sure it can handle translations, sub-menus, mega-menus and some elements of design. You wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about responsive design or RTL languages &#8211; it would all be taken care of for you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could even help Google discover <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/advanced\/appearance\/sitelinks\">site links<\/a> and improve search results!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve had the thought that &#8220;We don&#8217;t have other APIs like this that send config to the browser?&#8221;, but we clearly do! Especially in modern browsers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have all manner of meta headers we can add to control languages and browser features and icons that get displayed and color schemes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/Manifest\">web app manifests<\/a> that specify all sorts of options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have all sorts of APIs for interacting with things like the clipboard, bluetooth devices, browser history, scroll behaviour and standard sharing options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The browser is doing so much for us these days&#8230; why do we continue to handle navigation manually?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why would we not do this? Am I really the first to have thought of it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a browser engineer, or involved in any way at all with the committees that define browser APIs. This just seems like a good idea to me. Perhaps there&#8217;s already an RFC? I really don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said&#8230; I know nothing. So tell me what you know. Why shouldn&#8217;t this happen?<\/p>\n",

And then, one day, you turn a little note you have lying around into <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">a midly-interactive single web page<\/a> and it takes off like nothing else before!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve not had a new project posted to Reddit or Hacker News before and I found the interactions and analytics data pretty fascinating. I&#8217;m aware that this post could be considered vanity, but I think I learned from it and I&#8217;m posting it because there are interesting lessons and data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s a few notes on and lessons from how the early days of caniphp.com have been.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The making of <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">caniphp.com<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In my 10+ years of WordPress and Laravel work I&#8217;ve worked on projects that use different versions of PHP. From WordPress plugins that cater for stupidly-old versions of PHP, just in case someone hasn&#8217;t updated their hosting, through to Laravel apps that are 100% under my control and can run the latest-and-greatest version of PHP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP has been evolving in amazingly positive ways. And this is awesome. But it does mean that I&#8217;m sometimes confused about what PHP features are available to me on any given project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And sometimes, because I&#8217;m not regularly using a particular piece of PHP syntax or language feature, I forget what it is or does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been particularly true for the <a href=\"https:\/\/stitcher.io\/blog\/why-we-need-multi-line-short-closures-in-php\">various different flavours of closure<\/a> \/ <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/?s=arrow+functions\">arrow functions<\/a> and all of the new coalescing-type <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/?s=operator\">operators<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/?s=spaceship\">spaceship<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/?s=nullsafe+operator\">nullsafe<\/a> operators which all use various combinations of <code>=<\/code> and <code>?<\/code>. I just never quite got them all into my medium-term memory!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I started keeping <a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\">a Bear note<\/a> with a list of the things that I keep forgetting which version they are in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"902\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-1024x902.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11012\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-1024x902.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-300x264.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-768x676.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-1536x1353.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-2048x1803.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It was always my intention to share this at some point. But it was messy and incomplete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then one day I saw <a href=\"https:\/\/www.caniemail.com\/\">caniemail.com<\/a> being shared. I liked the name and realised that a <a href=\"https:\/\/caniuse.com\/\">caniuse.com<\/a>-like site for PHP versions was what I wanted to make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">caniphp.com<\/a> domain was free, so I leapt on it, and spent a few hours (yeah, that&#8217;s all!) putting together an initial version.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1517409134135717888\">tweeted it to the world<\/a> on the morning of April 22nd. I thought a few people might be interested and find it useful, but what happened next was far beyond my expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My privacy-friendly <a href=\"https:\/\/usefathom.com\/ref\/SVE71E\">Fathom Analytics<\/a> has let me see that there have been three big spikes of traffic so far:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>22nd April: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1517409134135717888\">Twitter<\/a><\/li><li>29th April: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PHP\/comments\/uek2id\/can_i_php_caniusecom_but_for_php_features\/\">Reddit&#8217;s \/r\/php<\/a><\/li><li>5th May: <a href=\"https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=31269686\">Hacker News<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see the traffic chart below. And, as this is my first time having something posted to Reddit and Hacker News, I have thoughts about each of these bits of publicity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"580\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-1024x580.png\" alt=\"Analytics chart of two weeks traffic to caniphp.com\" class=\"wp-image-11013\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-1024x580.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-300x170.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-768x435.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-1536x870.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-2048x1160.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Analytics chart of two weeks traffic to caniphp.com<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Day 1: Twitter<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial Twitter response was pretty amazing. I don&#8217;t know for sure but I think this was probably my best performing Tweet of all time clocking up, to date, over 30,000 impressions and 3,000 engagements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not bad for little old me.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x-958x1024.png\" alt=\"Tweet analytics for the launch tweet\" class=\"wp-image-11014\" width=\"472\" height=\"504\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x-958x1024.png 958w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x-281x300.png 281w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x-768x821.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x.png 1193w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px\" \/><figcaption>Tweet analytics for the launch tweet<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Twitter was overwhelming positive. Sure, lots of people shared and retweeted without comment, and I can&#8217;t read into that. Perhaps people were mocking me? But I don&#8217;t think I see that. And there was not one bit of not-positive feedback.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People say Twitter is a &#8220;hell site&#8221;, but that really wasn&#8217;t the case here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what was Reddit like&#8230;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Day 8: Reddit<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not much of a Reddit user. So this was mostly a new experience for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I first noticed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PHP\/comments\/uek2id\/can_i_php_caniusecom_but_for_php_features\/\">the Reddit post<\/a> when analytics traffic showed a spike and I checked the referrers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PHP\/comments\/uek2id\/can_i_php_caniusecom_but_for_php_features\/\">The post itself<\/a> was totally impartial &#8211; just a link to the site. And I should say that I&#8217;m grateful to the person that shared it! Thank you!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the responses were mixed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually took some constructive stuff away from this. My MVP didn&#8217;t explain itself very well. In describing it as &#8220;caniuse.com for PHP&#8221; people thought it was going to be a much more complete list of PHP functions and features, as caniuse.com is for JavaScript and CSS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I addressed this as quickly as I could, adding explanatory text, and encouraging open source contributions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I did feel some of the comments were overly snarky. And I was somewhat baffled by people saying that it was useless, what was the point?, an IDE can do this, it doesn&#8217;t have any use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s fine if you think that. But it&#8217;s just your opinion. Don&#8217;t write if off as totally useless just because you use a different tool to do the same thing. I made it for me and I think it&#8217;s useful. So there&#8217;s that. No one&#8217;s making you use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Aside: I generally dislike opinions stated as fact. Adding &#8220;I think&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;In my opinion&#8230;&#8221; to a statement of opinion softens it and makes it less aggressive. I OFTEN ask myself if I can add &#8220;in my opinion&#8221; to a Tweet. But I guess some people are looking for a response. <code>\u00af_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af<\/code> )<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I responded with kindness and curiosity, I hope! And over time, the comments on Reddit turned into positivity. But of the three places that caniphp.com was discussed I felt it was the most hostile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Reddit traffic had a fairly sustained spike with most of the nearly 2,000 views happening in around 8 hours after the post. That traffic gradually faded after a couple of days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the one-day chart for the Reddit day:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-1024x340.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11017\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-1024x340.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-300x100.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-768x255.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-1536x510.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-2048x681.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The post got 136 upvotes and 45 comments. Pretty good. And nice to see that the post itself got WAY more upvotes than any of the comments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Day 14: Hacker News<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all the bad things you sometime hear about it, I have to say, I was pretty impressed with <a href=\"https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=31269686\">Hacker News<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/newsguidelines.html\">Their guidelines<\/a> are good &#8211; summed up as &#8220;be kind&#8221;, &#8220;assume good faith&#8221;, &#8220;avoid tangents&#8221; and &#8220;don&#8217;t post shallow dismissals&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with some very useful specifics like &#8220;Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive&#8221; and &#8220;Please don&#8217;t pick the most provocative thing in an article or post to complain about&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The guidelines seem to be enforced, too. An early snarky comment was quickly flagged and disappeared. I don&#8217;t know if this was by the community or mods or what. But I appreciated it and I Was left feeling safe from harm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hacker News algorithm is interesting. When I first started seeng traffic, the post was on page 2. I saw 20 users on the caniphp site, then 30, then 40 and it just kept going up until about 200 were on the site at once. (I know, these are small numbers in the grand scheme of things, but big numbers for anything I&#8217;ve ever made!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure many have written about how the Hacker News algorithm works, but it seems that the rate of upvoting is important and shifts you up the rankings. I maxed out at 6th position on page one. BUT&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My Hacker News traffic was short lived. The algorithm moves you up the ranks quickly, but&#8230; of course&#8230; it moves others up the ranks quickly too. So you can fall fast as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the one-day chart for the Hacker News day. You&#8217;ll see traffic spiked higher (the Hacker News effect is real!) but then tailed off much quicker as the algorithm demoted me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fascinating stuff!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got my 15 minutes of fame (if that!) on the front page of Hacker News. I can tick that off the nerd&#8217;s bucket list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-1024x340.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11018\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-1024x340.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-300x100.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-768x255.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-1536x510.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-2048x681.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The one thing I have totally LOVED about this project is opening it up to contributions on GitHub.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s simple, which makes it an ideal open source project for me. It has a low-burden for me as the maintainer. And the simplicity means contributing is easy too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The PHP feature list is far from complete, and (for reasons I won&#8217;t go into here) is being manually curated. So people coming along and adding features, correcting typos, and even introducing coding standards tools, has been really appreciated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been 10 other contributors so far, and 22 pull requests. I&#8217;m grateful for every one of them. Thank you folks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Looking forward<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">caniphp.com<\/a> is intended to be a resource people bookmark and revisit over time when they need it. So these one-off traffic spikes do not, for me, represent success for this little project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is properly useful then there will be a sustained level of traffic as people come back to it for the information they need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll see if that happens. If not, it&#8217;s a single page of HTML, hosted on CloudFlare pages. It can sit and live there without any input from me (except data updates for new PHP releases).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a really interesting little site launch for me. The data has had me curious. And I&#8217;m grateful to everyone that has tried to make it better.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Isn&#8217;t it ridiculous? You spend years trying to make something that takes off in a big kinda way. You try all sorts of complicated things. And then, one day, you turn a little note you have lying around into <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">a midly-interactive single web page<\/a> and it takes off like nothing else before!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve not had a new project posted to Reddit or Hacker News before and I found the interactions and analytics data pretty fascinating. I&#8217;m aware that this post could be considered vanity, but I think I learned from it and I&#8217;m posting it because there are interesting lessons and data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s a few notes on and lessons from how the early days of caniphp.com have been.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The making of <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">caniphp.com<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In my 10+ years of WordPress and Laravel work I&#8217;ve worked on projects that use different versions of PHP. From WordPress plugins that cater for stupidly-old versions of PHP, just in case someone hasn&#8217;t updated their hosting, through to Laravel apps that are 100% under my control and can run the latest-and-greatest version of PHP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP has been evolving in amazingly positive ways. And this is awesome. But it does mean that I&#8217;m sometimes confused about what PHP features are available to me on any given project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And sometimes, because I&#8217;m not regularly using a particular piece of PHP syntax or language feature, I forget what it is or does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been particularly true for the <a href=\"https:\/\/stitcher.io\/blog\/why-we-need-multi-line-short-closures-in-php\">various different flavours of closure<\/a> \/ <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/?s=arrow+functions\">arrow functions<\/a> and all of the new coalescing-type <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/?s=operator\">operators<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/?s=spaceship\">spaceship<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/?s=nullsafe+operator\">nullsafe<\/a> operators which all use various combinations of <code>=<\/code> and <code>?<\/code>. I just never quite got them all into my medium-term memory!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I started keeping <a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\">a Bear note<\/a> with a list of the things that I keep forgetting which version they are in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"902\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-1024x902.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11012\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-1024x902.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-300x264.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-768x676.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-1536x1353.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-2048x1803.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It was always my intention to share this at some point. But it was messy and incomplete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then one day I saw <a href=\"https:\/\/www.caniemail.com\/\">caniemail.com<\/a> being shared. I liked the name and realised that a <a href=\"https:\/\/caniuse.com\/\">caniuse.com<\/a>-like site for PHP versions was what I wanted to make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">caniphp.com<\/a> domain was free, so I leapt on it, and spent a few hours (yeah, that&#8217;s all!) putting together an initial version.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1517409134135717888\">tweeted it to the world<\/a> on the morning of April 22nd. I thought a few people might be interested and find it useful, but what happened next was far beyond my expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My privacy-friendly <a href=\"https:\/\/usefathom.com\/ref\/SVE71E\">Fathom Analytics<\/a> has let me see that there have been three big spikes of traffic so far:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>22nd April: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1517409134135717888\">Twitter<\/a><\/li><li>29th April: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PHP\/comments\/uek2id\/can_i_php_caniusecom_but_for_php_features\/\">Reddit&#8217;s \/r\/php<\/a><\/li><li>5th May: <a href=\"https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=31269686\">Hacker News<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see the traffic chart below. And, as this is my first time having something posted to Reddit and Hacker News, I have thoughts about each of these bits of publicity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"580\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-1024x580.png\" alt=\"Analytics chart of two weeks traffic to caniphp.com\" class=\"wp-image-11013\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-1024x580.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-300x170.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-768x435.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-1536x870.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-2048x1160.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Analytics chart of two weeks traffic to caniphp.com<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Day 1: Twitter<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial Twitter response was pretty amazing. I don&#8217;t know for sure but I think this was probably my best performing Tweet of all time clocking up, to date, over 30,000 impressions and 3,000 engagements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not bad for little old me.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x-958x1024.png\" alt=\"Tweet analytics for the launch tweet\" class=\"wp-image-11014\" width=\"472\" height=\"504\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x-958x1024.png 958w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x-281x300.png 281w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x-768x821.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x.png 1193w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px\" \/><figcaption>Tweet analytics for the launch tweet<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Twitter was overwhelming positive. Sure, lots of people shared and retweeted without comment, and I can&#8217;t read into that. Perhaps people were mocking me? But I don&#8217;t think I see that. And there was not one bit of not-positive feedback.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People say Twitter is a &#8220;hell site&#8221;, but that really wasn&#8217;t the case here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what was Reddit like&#8230;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Day 8: Reddit<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not much of a Reddit user. So this was mostly a new experience for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I first noticed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PHP\/comments\/uek2id\/can_i_php_caniusecom_but_for_php_features\/\">the Reddit post<\/a> when analytics traffic showed a spike and I checked the referrers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PHP\/comments\/uek2id\/can_i_php_caniusecom_but_for_php_features\/\">The post itself<\/a> was totally impartial &#8211; just a link to the site. And I should say that I&#8217;m grateful to the person that shared it! Thank you!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the responses were mixed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually took some constructive stuff away from this. My MVP didn&#8217;t explain itself very well. In describing it as &#8220;caniuse.com for PHP&#8221; people thought it was going to be a much more complete list of PHP functions and features, as caniuse.com is for JavaScript and CSS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I addressed this as quickly as I could, adding explanatory text, and encouraging open source contributions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I did feel some of the comments were overly snarky. And I was somewhat baffled by people saying that it was useless, what was the point?, an IDE can do this, it doesn&#8217;t have any use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s fine if you think that. But it&#8217;s just your opinion. Don&#8217;t write if off as totally useless just because you use a different tool to do the same thing. I made it for me and I think it&#8217;s useful. So there&#8217;s that. No one&#8217;s making you use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Aside: I generally dislike opinions stated as fact. Adding &#8220;I think&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;In my opinion&#8230;&#8221; to a statement of opinion softens it and makes it less aggressive. I OFTEN ask myself if I can add &#8220;in my opinion&#8221; to a Tweet. But I guess some people are looking for a response. <code>\u00af_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af<\/code> )<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I responded with kindness and curiosity, I hope! And over time, the comments on Reddit turned into positivity. But of the three places that caniphp.com was discussed I felt it was the most hostile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Reddit traffic had a fairly sustained spike with most of the nearly 2,000 views happening in around 8 hours after the post. That traffic gradually faded after a couple of days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the one-day chart for the Reddit day:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-1024x340.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11017\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-1024x340.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-300x100.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-768x255.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-1536x510.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-2048x681.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The post got 136 upvotes and 45 comments. Pretty good. And nice to see that the post itself got WAY more upvotes than any of the comments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Day 14: Hacker News<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all the bad things you sometime hear about it, I have to say, I was pretty impressed with <a href=\"https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=31269686\">Hacker News<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/newsguidelines.html\">Their guidelines<\/a> are good &#8211; summed up as &#8220;be kind&#8221;, &#8220;assume good faith&#8221;, &#8220;avoid tangents&#8221; and &#8220;don&#8217;t post shallow dismissals&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with some very useful specifics like &#8220;Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive&#8221; and &#8220;Please don&#8217;t pick the most provocative thing in an article or post to complain about&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The guidelines seem to be enforced, too. An early snarky comment was quickly flagged and disappeared. I don&#8217;t know if this was by the community or mods or what. But I appreciated it and I Was left feeling safe from harm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hacker News algorithm is interesting. When I first started seeng traffic, the post was on page 2. I saw 20 users on the caniphp site, then 30, then 40 and it just kept going up until about 200 were on the site at once. (I know, these are small numbers in the grand scheme of things, but big numbers for anything I&#8217;ve ever made!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure many have written about how the Hacker News algorithm works, but it seems that the rate of upvoting is important and shifts you up the rankings. I maxed out at 6th position on page one. BUT&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My Hacker News traffic was short lived. The algorithm moves you up the ranks quickly, but&#8230; of course&#8230; it moves others up the ranks quickly too. So you can fall fast as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the one-day chart for the Hacker News day. You&#8217;ll see traffic spiked higher (the Hacker News effect is real!) but then tailed off much quicker as the algorithm demoted me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fascinating stuff!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got my 15 minutes of fame (if that!) on the front page of Hacker News. I can tick that off the nerd&#8217;s bucket list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-1024x340.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11018\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-1024x340.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-300x100.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-768x255.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-1536x510.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-2048x681.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The one thing I have totally LOVED about this project is opening it up to contributions on GitHub.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s simple, which makes it an ideal open source project for me. It has a low-burden for me as the maintainer. And the simplicity means contributing is easy too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The PHP feature list is far from complete, and (for reasons I won&#8217;t go into here) is being manually curated. So people coming along and adding features, correcting typos, and even introducing coding standards tools, has been really appreciated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been 10 other contributors so far, and 22 pull requests. I&#8217;m grateful for every one of them. Thank you folks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Looking forward<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">caniphp.com<\/a> is intended to be a resource people bookmark and revisit over time when they need it. So these one-off traffic spikes do not, for me, represent success for this little project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is properly useful then there will be a sustained level of traffic as people come back to it for the information they need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll see if that happens. If not, it&#8217;s a single page of HTML, hosted on CloudFlare pages. It can sit and live there without any input from me (except data updates for new PHP releases).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a really interesting little site launch for me. The data has had me curious. And I&#8217;m grateful to everyone that has tried to make it better.<\/p>\n",

Then you could control WordPress (to some extent) with your voice!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cue visions of the Minority Report computer:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/tom-cruise-steven-spielberg-minority-report-BLVqLi1p4Pt7i\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media0.giphy.com\/media\/BLVqLi1p4Pt7i\/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Tom Cruise GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"500\" height=\"249\" \/><\/a>\n<\/div><figcaption>Tom Cruise works with the new block editor in WordPress 9.3<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Or &#8220;Alexa for WordPress&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/sandwich-skill-alexa-l0Iy7Y2y0RuckTwLm\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media0.giphy.com\/media\/l0Iy7Y2y0RuckTwLm\/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Peanut Butter Sandwich GIF by Doctor Popular - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" \/><\/a>\n<\/div><figcaption>Voice control FTW!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So I set to work and, about 90 minutes of hacking later, I had a working prototype&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/709816581?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is pretty amazing. I mean, I know it doesn&#8217;t really SEEM all that amazing. It&#8217;s a bit clunky in this first attempt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if we compare what we have here to where we started &#8211; the standard WordPress admin dashboard &#8211; a lot of cool stuff has happened, and it&#8217;s the combining of all these things together that has made this voice navigation possible:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Turning the WordPress menus into a command palette<\/li><li>Adding &#8220;fuzzy&#8221; search to the palette to allow direct access to commands and content<\/li><li>Adding on top of that, the speech recognition to &#8220;type&#8221; with your voice.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think about it, each of these things in itself is no mean feat. Although the <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/API\/Web_Speech_API\/Using_the_Web_Speech_API\">web speech API<\/a> does a LOT of the heavy lifting for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was really fun combining these existing technologies to bring something new to life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a bit more work I got here, which is a bit more &#8220;hands-free&#8221;&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Voice Controlled WordPress part 2\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/709816673?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"389\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Limitations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This technology is not without limitations. Primarily, it only works in some browsers. There is no Firefox support; Chrome works (this is what my tests were in); Safari works in theory but I&#8217;ve not tested it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should also be noted that Chrome does its speech recognition in the cloud, so there are privacy concerns over that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>Note: On some browsers, like Chrome, using Speech Recognition on a web page involves a server-based recognition engine. Your audio is sent to a web service for recognition processing, so it won&#8217;t work offline.<\/p><cite><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/API\/SpeechRecognition\">Speech recognition API docs (mozilla.org)<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It accepts all of the limitations of Turbo Admin. It just lets you do navigation. It&#8217;s not intelligent in any way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the prototype is English only. Though I believe you could pass your browser&#8217;s language setting to the speech recognition easily enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Implementation and challenges<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In theory there isn&#8217;t really anything very special going on here. The basic steps are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Initialize the speech recognition API.<\/li><li>When the command palette is shown, start recognition.<\/li><li>The speech recognition API sends events when text has been generated from speech. It basically says &#8220;I recognized some text. Here it is!&#8221;<\/li><li>Listen for the events, and when they are triggered, grab the text, shove it into the input field, and trigger a palette update.<\/li><li>When the command palette is closed, stop recognition.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The format of the data given to you by the events takes a bit of figuring out, but that&#8217;s not too hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real difficulty for me was that I was writing this into the browser extension. This works by injecting a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Mozilla\/Add-ons\/WebExtensions\/Content_scripts\">content script<\/a>&#8221; that runs the whole show.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This content script is &#8220;sandboxed&#8221;, which means it has access to the content of the page, and can change that. But it doesn&#8217;t have access to other JavaScript on the page. And, sadly, this means it doesn&#8217;t have access to the speech recognition API, as tihs is a property of the <code>window<\/code> object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The workaround for this is to inject a <code>&lt;script&gt;<\/code> tag into the page with the code that needs to use the voice recognition. BUT&#8230; this is now in a different sandbox to the command palette code. So some communication is needed between the palette and the speech recognition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This needed some custom JavaScript events to be triggered and listened for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing too taxing, but the architecture is a bit weird.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I added this to <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/turbo-admin\/\">the plugin version<\/a> of Turbo Admin this wouldn&#8217;t be a problem. BUT&#8230; fun fact&#8230; the plugin version of Turbo Admin uses (almost) identical JavaScript &#8211; the only real difference is how it&#8217;s added to the page and initialized. So it should be trivial to port this to the plugin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So&#8230; err&#8230; what now?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, I made this as a toy. A developer plaything. Just because I could. I didn&#8217;t think it had any real practical value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I shared it on Twitter, the initial reactions backed up my self-amusement and internal amazement at what modern tech can do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\ude02 love it!

That is, things you can get code to do in a browser, like locate where you are and play sounds and&#8230; do speech recognition&#8230;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That sounds fun&#8221;, went my train of thought, &#8220;I&#8217;d love to tinker with that and see how it can be used.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; wait&#8230; I could hook up speech input to <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a> &#8211; my command palette plugin and browser extension for WordPress. Then you could control WordPress (to some extent) with your voice!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cue visions of the Minority Report computer:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/tom-cruise-steven-spielberg-minority-report-BLVqLi1p4Pt7i\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media0.giphy.com\/media\/BLVqLi1p4Pt7i\/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Tom Cruise GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"500\" height=\"249\" \/><\/a>\n<\/div><figcaption>Tom Cruise works with the new block editor in WordPress 9.3<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Or &#8220;Alexa for WordPress&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/sandwich-skill-alexa-l0Iy7Y2y0RuckTwLm\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media0.giphy.com\/media\/l0Iy7Y2y0RuckTwLm\/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Peanut Butter Sandwich GIF by Doctor Popular - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" \/><\/a>\n<\/div><figcaption>Voice control FTW!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So I set to work and, about 90 minutes of hacking later, I had a working prototype&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/709816581?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is pretty amazing. I mean, I know it doesn&#8217;t really SEEM all that amazing. It&#8217;s a bit clunky in this first attempt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if we compare what we have here to where we started &#8211; the standard WordPress admin dashboard &#8211; a lot of cool stuff has happened, and it&#8217;s the combining of all these things together that has made this voice navigation possible:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Turning the WordPress menus into a command palette<\/li><li>Adding &#8220;fuzzy&#8221; search to the palette to allow direct access to commands and content<\/li><li>Adding on top of that, the speech recognition to &#8220;type&#8221; with your voice.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think about it, each of these things in itself is no mean feat. Although the <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/API\/Web_Speech_API\/Using_the_Web_Speech_API\">web speech API<\/a> does a LOT of the heavy lifting for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was really fun combining these existing technologies to bring something new to life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a bit more work I got here, which is a bit more &#8220;hands-free&#8221;&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Voice Controlled WordPress part 2\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/709816673?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"389\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Limitations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This technology is not without limitations. Primarily, it only works in some browsers. There is no Firefox support; Chrome works (this is what my tests were in); Safari works in theory but I&#8217;ve not tested it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should also be noted that Chrome does its speech recognition in the cloud, so there are privacy concerns over that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>Note: On some browsers, like Chrome, using Speech Recognition on a web page involves a server-based recognition engine. Your audio is sent to a web service for recognition processing, so it won&#8217;t work offline.<\/p><cite><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/API\/SpeechRecognition\">Speech recognition API docs (mozilla.org)<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It accepts all of the limitations of Turbo Admin. It just lets you do navigation. It&#8217;s not intelligent in any way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the prototype is English only. Though I believe you could pass your browser&#8217;s language setting to the speech recognition easily enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Implementation and challenges<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In theory there isn&#8217;t really anything very special going on here. The basic steps are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Initialize the speech recognition API.<\/li><li>When the command palette is shown, start recognition.<\/li><li>The speech recognition API sends events when text has been generated from speech. It basically says &#8220;I recognized some text. Here it is!&#8221;<\/li><li>Listen for the events, and when they are triggered, grab the text, shove it into the input field, and trigger a palette update.<\/li><li>When the command palette is closed, stop recognition.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The format of the data given to you by the events takes a bit of figuring out, but that&#8217;s not too hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real difficulty for me was that I was writing this into the browser extension. This works by injecting a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Mozilla\/Add-ons\/WebExtensions\/Content_scripts\">content script<\/a>&#8221; that runs the whole show.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This content script is &#8220;sandboxed&#8221;, which means it has access to the content of the page, and can change that. But it doesn&#8217;t have access to other JavaScript on the page. And, sadly, this means it doesn&#8217;t have access to the speech recognition API, as tihs is a property of the <code>window<\/code> object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The workaround for this is to inject a <code>&lt;script&gt;<\/code> tag into the page with the code that needs to use the voice recognition. BUT&#8230; this is now in a different sandbox to the command palette code. So some communication is needed between the palette and the speech recognition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This needed some custom JavaScript events to be triggered and listened for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing too taxing, but the architecture is a bit weird.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I added this to <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/turbo-admin\/\">the plugin version<\/a> of Turbo Admin this wouldn&#8217;t be a problem. BUT&#8230; fun fact&#8230; the plugin version of Turbo Admin uses (almost) identical JavaScript &#8211; the only real difference is how it&#8217;s added to the page and initialized. So it should be trivial to port this to the plugin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So&#8230; err&#8230; what now?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, I made this as a toy. A developer plaything. Just because I could. I didn&#8217;t think it had any real practical value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I shared it on Twitter, the initial reactions backed up my self-amusement and internal amazement at what modern tech can do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\ude02 love it!

I loved this article and though the examples in it were more visually playful than technologically playful (and yes, HTML and CSS are technological &#8211; I just couldn&#8217;t find a better way to distinguish between the two things so, you know what I mean!) I still related to it strongly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the main point of the article is, in my opinion, both important and true:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>Being playful with your code and what might seem like \u201clateral\u201d learning can be a huge driving factor in evolving your skills. It might not be noticeable at once, but every time you make some new whimsical thing, you\u2019re leveling up!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why I take stupid ideas for things like &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/\">WordlePress<\/a>&#8220;, <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/swindon-quiz\/\">The Swindon Quiz<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/peekobot.github.io\/peekobot\/\">Peekobot<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hey_schoolbot\">SchoolBot<\/a>, and bring them to reality. There&#8217;s even a fake command line interface on <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/\">the homepage of this site<\/a> written in vanilla JavaScript!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\">Turbo Admin<\/a> was also in this category of &#8220;fun things I&#8217;m going to make just because I can&#8221; (some of its story is <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/03\/turbo-admin-the-story-of-a-first-software-product\/\">here<\/a>), it just happened to be so useful that I thought others might pay for it (and, to my surprise and with my thankfullness, many of you did!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Turbo Admin is a base from which I can try all sorts of other things. I have experimental branches in Git for <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1522249456091119623\">pretty admin URLs<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1496485286636920836\">pulling your favourite plugins into a dashboard widget<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1496246301113135106\">hiding dashboard widgets<\/a> (remember this is a browser extension, so these settings would be saved across all sites).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve put <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1465411502723248131\">easter eggs<\/a> on the marketing site. I&#8217;ve built my own licensing server (that I&#8217;m not using, but it&#8217;s there if I need it). And the other day I figured out that I could let people try it out using a bookmarklet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, last night, I found a way to add <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/05\/raise-your-hands-its-voice-controlled-wordpress\/\">voice recognition<\/a> to it to make WordPress voice-controlled. Watch the first video and you&#8217;ll see how much fun this was and how exciting it was to get it working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And through all these things I&#8217;ve learned a TON, and I&#8217;ve had fun while doing it, and even made a bit of money too &#8211; let alone the reputation-building and networking I&#8217;ve done as a result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s true, we need other hobbies. We need to get away from screens and apps. We need to move our bodies, and exercise our minds in other ways. We should not be defined by our coding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And NOT having silly side projects or being &#8211; the term I&#8217;ve come to love &#8211; a &#8220;recreational coder&#8221; is fine too. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily make you a worse software developer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are benefits to tinkering in SOME of your spare time. And if you&#8217;re having fun as well, as I clearly am, then go for it!<\/p>\n",

I loved this article and though the examples in it were more visually playful than technologically playful (and yes, HTML and CSS are technological &#8211; I just couldn&#8217;t find a better way to distinguish between the two things so, you know what I mean!) I still related to it strongly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the main point of the article is, in my opinion, both important and true:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>Being playful with your code and what might seem like \u201clateral\u201d learning can be a huge driving factor in evolving your skills. It might not be noticeable at once, but every time you make some new whimsical thing, you\u2019re leveling up!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why I take stupid ideas for things like &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/\">WordlePress<\/a>&#8220;, <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/swindon-quiz\/\">The Swindon Quiz<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/peekobot.github.io\/peekobot\/\">Peekobot<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hey_schoolbot\">SchoolBot<\/a>, and bring them to reality. There&#8217;s even a fake command line interface on <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/\">the homepage of this site<\/a> written in vanilla JavaScript!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\">Turbo Admin<\/a> was also in this category of &#8220;fun things I&#8217;m going to make just because I can&#8221; (some of its story is <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/03\/turbo-admin-the-story-of-a-first-software-product\/\">here<\/a>), it just happened to be so useful that I thought others might pay for it (and, to my surprise and with my thankfullness, many of you did!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Turbo Admin is a base from which I can try all sorts of other things. I have experimental branches in Git for <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1522249456091119623\">pretty admin URLs<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1496485286636920836\">pulling your favourite plugins into a dashboard widget<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1496246301113135106\">hiding dashboard widgets<\/a> (remember this is a browser extension, so these settings would be saved across all sites).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve put <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1465411502723248131\">easter eggs<\/a> on the marketing site. I&#8217;ve built my own licensing server (that I&#8217;m not using, but it&#8217;s there if I need it). And the other day I figured out that I could let people try it out using a bookmarklet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, last night, I found a way to add <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/05\/raise-your-hands-its-voice-controlled-wordpress\/\">voice recognition<\/a> to it to make WordPress voice-controlled. Watch the first video and you&#8217;ll see how much fun this was and how exciting it was to get it working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And through all these things I&#8217;ve learned a TON, and I&#8217;ve had fun while doing it, and even made a bit of money too &#8211; let alone the reputation-building and networking I&#8217;ve done as a result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s true, we need other hobbies. We need to get away from screens and apps. We need to move our bodies, and exercise our minds in other ways. We should not be defined by our coding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And NOT having silly side projects or being &#8211; the term I&#8217;ve come to love &#8211; a &#8220;recreational coder&#8221; is fine too. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily make you a worse software developer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are benefits to tinkering in SOME of your spare time. And if you&#8217;re having fun as well, as I clearly am, then go for it!<\/p>\n",

I made a lot of &#8220;YAGNI&#8221; (You Ain&#8217;t Gonna Need It) calls, for example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here&#8217;s the kicker: it&#8217;s recursive!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function verses( $start, $end ) {\n    if ($start === $end) {\n        return $this-&gt;verse($start);\n    }\n\n    return $this-&gt;verse($start) . &quot;\\n&quot; . $this-&gt;verses($start - 1, $end);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that this is not optimal in many ways.

I made a lot of &#8220;YAGNI&#8221; (You Ain&#8217;t Gonna Need It) calls, for example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here&#8217;s the kicker: it&#8217;s recursive!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function verses( $start, $end ) {\n    if ($start === $end) {\n        return $this-&gt;verse($start);\n    }\n\n    return $this-&gt;verse($start) . &quot;\\n&quot; . $this-&gt;verses($start - 1, $end);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that this is not optimal in many ways. But the fact that, while working in a hurry, this solution came to mind tells you something about how I was taught computing. I&#8217;m very curious about where this book goes and what I learn from it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on we go&#8230;with an open mind!<\/p>\n",

Lemme hear that thing go. Write some words at a URL.<\/p><cite>Chris Coyier<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I tweeted this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1541483647005589505\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I posed it as a question. But it wasn&#8217;t really. It was a comment on how hard freelancing can be (for some types of work) hard to get closed down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I strived for a while to get my business into a place where I could more easily wind it down if I got a job (which I now have). But the nature of my work is that I often helped small organisations work with technology that they really didn&#8217;t understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of that technology is now changing (I&#8217;m looking at you Google Workspace!) and I find myself feeling heavily obliged to helping people through the transition. I was the one who set them up and I&#8217;m really the only admin left on most of the accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, some freelancers can just complete a job and wrap it all up and be done. But I seem to have dug myself a bit of a hole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I was starting again, I wouldn&#8217;t offer hosting, and any ongoing services that my clients depend upon would be well and truly owned by them so that they could more easily be handed over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lo, another of my values starting with the letter &#8216;C&#8217; is evident (they all start with &#8216;C&#8217;!): Conscientious!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-1\/\">10 things I learned about freelancing in ten years (with ten days to go) \u2013 Part 1<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-2\/\">10 things I learned about freelancing in ten years (with ten days to go) \u2013 Part 2<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/10\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-part-3\/\">10 things I learned about freelancing in ten years \u2013 Part 3<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n",

Lemme hear that thing go. Write some words at a URL.<\/p><cite>Chris Coyier<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I tweeted this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1541483647005589505\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I posed it as a question. But it wasn&#8217;t really. It was a comment on how hard freelancing can be (for some types of work) hard to get closed down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I strived for a while to get my business into a place where I could more easily wind it down if I got a job (which I now have). But the nature of my work is that I often helped small organisations work with technology that they really didn&#8217;t understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of that technology is now changing (I&#8217;m looking at you Google Workspace!) and I find myself feeling heavily obliged to helping people through the transition. I was the one who set them up and I&#8217;m really the only admin left on most of the accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, some freelancers can just complete a job and wrap it all up and be done. But I seem to have dug myself a bit of a hole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I was starting again, I wouldn&#8217;t offer hosting, and any ongoing services that my clients depend upon would be well and truly owned by them so that they could more easily be handed over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lo, another of my values starting with the letter &#8216;C&#8217; is evident (they all start with &#8216;C&#8217;!): Conscientious!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-1\/\">10 things I learned about freelancing in ten years (with ten days to go) \u2013 Part 1<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-2\/\">10 things I learned about freelancing in ten years (with ten days to go) \u2013 Part 2<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/10\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-part-3\/\">10 things I learned about freelancing in ten years \u2013 Part 3<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n",

I&#8217;ve always resisted on the basis that the world really doesn&#8217;t need another white tech dude mouth-blogging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve often wondered what would it look like for me to have a podcast or be on a podcast on a regular basis. And recently I&#8217;ve had reason to think about this properly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s my thoughts:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It would be short, with a hard-limit of 20 minutes, a goal of 15 minutes, and a stretch-goal of 10.<\/li><li>It would be at least weekly (to keep cadence) but with bonus episodes as and when I have stuff to talk about.<\/li><li>It would not just be me and it would ideally feature another person that is not a white man. And I would love to use it to promote the work of others who fly under the radar.<\/li><li>It would not be sponsored. It would be for the joy of sharing what I know and what I do with others.<\/li><li>It would be primarily, not only about tech. My world is richer than that and I love learning about all sorts of things.<\/li><li>Related to 5, it would be carefully named so as to not limit the topic or audience. And who cares about the SEO anyway?!<\/li><li>I would be allowed to be critical, but it would never be personal. HOWEVER any critique would always be balanced with positivity. I would expect any co-host and the audience to hold me to this.<\/li><li>It would be fun and have energy. Perhaps modelled on the XKCD concept of &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/xkcd.com\/1053\/\">you&#8217;re one of todays lucky 10,000<\/a>&#8220;.<\/li><li>I would love the format to be different or original in some way, to inject some kind of creativity into people&#8217;s feeds. There would have to be something about it that is unlike all the other podcasts I listen to.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>What would your imaginary podcast look like?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I&#8217;ve often felt the peer pressure of the podcasting bandwagon. I&#8217;ve always resisted on the basis that the world really doesn&#8217;t need another white tech dude mouth-blogging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve often wondered what would it look like for me to have a podcast or be on a podcast on a regular basis. And recently I&#8217;ve had reason to think about this properly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s my thoughts:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It would be short, with a hard-limit of 20 minutes, a goal of 15 minutes, and a stretch-goal of 10.<\/li><li>It would be at least weekly (to keep cadence) but with bonus episodes as and when I have stuff to talk about.<\/li><li>It would not just be me and it would ideally feature another person that is not a white man. And I would love to use it to promote the work of others who fly under the radar.<\/li><li>It would not be sponsored. It would be for the joy of sharing what I know and what I do with others.<\/li><li>It would be primarily, not only about tech. My world is richer than that and I love learning about all sorts of things.<\/li><li>Related to 5, it would be carefully named so as to not limit the topic or audience. And who cares about the SEO anyway?!<\/li><li>I would be allowed to be critical, but it would never be personal. HOWEVER any critique would always be balanced with positivity. I would expect any co-host and the audience to hold me to this.<\/li><li>It would be fun and have energy. Perhaps modelled on the XKCD concept of &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/xkcd.com\/1053\/\">you&#8217;re one of todays lucky 10,000<\/a>&#8220;.<\/li><li>I would love the format to be different or original in some way, to inject some kind of creativity into people&#8217;s feeds. There would have to be something about it that is unlike all the other podcasts I listen to.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>What would your imaginary podcast look like?<\/p>\n",

But nowadays it&#8217;s very different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1524669696355844099\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Partly <a href=\"https:\/\/delicious-brains.castos.com\/podcasts\/12445\/episodes\/episode-12-javascript-for-backend-developers\">my skills have developed<\/a> &#8211; and in all of what I&#8217;m about to describe, I appreciate that this is not the kind of thing that an average person can do. And partly there have been some technology shifts that have enabled different ways of achieveing the &#8220;simple landing page&#8221; goal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But lets dig in to what&#8217;s changed, and what I would do now instead of using WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s changed?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you rewind even a relatively small number of years, building a simple several-page website with some interactivity was painful. HTML lacked some advanced things like date\/time inputs, and media elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CSS was lacking in simple things like animated transitions, flexbox, grid, image\/object fit\/cover, custom properties, and calc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might need PNG icon sprite sheets. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>JavaScript was so clunky you kinda had to have jQuery to make it usable. There was no good way to make it modular (other than conflicting standards jostling to be The True Way). And anything more than the simplest code quickly became a spaghetti of functions and nested callbacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So much stuff required importing libraries of code to achieve what is now basic and built-in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hosting was on shared servers with SFTP and SSH if you were lucky. CDN&#8217;s were for advanced projects. HTTPS certificates cost money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LOOK AT US NOW!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HTML5 semantic markup; programmable video and audio elements; date\/time inputs; built-in input validation and errors; CSS transitions and animations; flexbox, grid, calc, fancy units; CSS custom properties; background-size and object-fit options; ES6+ JavaScript with all sorts of niceties that make coding in vanilla JS so much easier; the fetch API; promises and async\/await; simple reactive JS libraries like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alpinejs.dev\/\">Alpine<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/vuejs\/petite-vue\">Petite Vue<\/a>; a multitude of browser APIs for things like geolocation, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, cameras, video, orientation, bluetooth and stuff; <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/JavaScript\/Guide\/Modules\">native ES modules<\/a>; fast and simple JavaScript tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/esbuild.github.io\/\">ESBuild<\/a>; SVG&#8217;s; and super-easy deployment of static pages to free or super-cheap, serverless hosts like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.netlify.com\/\">Netlify<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/pages.github.com\/\">GitHub Pages<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/pages.cloudflare.com\/\">Cloudflare pages<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phew! I can barely handle the power. And there IS power here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How I&#8217;d build and host a single page website now<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With all this power, let&#8217;s explore what a difference this has made. First off &#8211; how would I build and deploy a single page site?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the caveat that I&#8217;m not a designer, so I very much stand on the shoulders of giants when it comes to design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days that&#8217;s usually <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\/\">TailwindUI<\/a>, or something I can throw together in <a href=\"https:\/\/shuffle.dev\/\">Shuffle<\/a> (probably using TailwindCSS as well). Though there are some <a href=\"https:\/\/tailblocks.cc\/\">free<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hyperui.dev\/\">alternatives<\/a> as well for this kind of thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pick some components, chuck them together, tweak them as necessary (which I find much easier to do in this kind of small site with TailwindCSS than in regular CSS) and away you go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I need some simple JavaScript-driven interactivity I&#8217;ll add <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alpinejs.dev\/\">AlpineJS<\/a> (a small, reactive JS library) alongside vanilla JavaScript if needed. This needs no build process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;d put the whole thing in GitHub and deploy it to a static hosting service like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.netlify.com\/\">Netlify<\/a> (which has a generous free tier) or <a href=\"https:\/\/pages.cloudflare.com\/\">Cloudflare Pages<\/a> (which is 100% free). No FTP; a quick push to Git and you&#8217;re done! This is the modern way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Wait? What? Tailwind?!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But wait&#8230;&#8221;, I hear you say, &#8220;aren&#8217;t we aiming for minimal tech here? A no-build-process type thing?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, there are some exceptions. And let me justify Tailwind as a build tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have NEVER had a big problem with Tailwind&#8217;s CLI tool. It&#8217;s well maintained by some very smart people who have a decent business model. I just don&#8217;t get the kind of npm-error-vomit from Tailwind that I have got from other build tools. It&#8217;s stable, robust, well-documented, and the nature of what it does means that backwards-compatibility rarely seems to break.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I <em>enjoy<\/em> using Tailwind as a build tool and so I&#8217;m happy to have it in my simple toolchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PLUS, for me, one of the big benefits of Tailwind is it&#8217;s easy to come back to a project to tweak its styling. These projects are often build-deploy-and-forget-for-ages type things. So simple re-visiting of them is really helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s one more thing to mention about about Tailwind: to get the best from it you really need to have HTML components, possibly with parameters. And this might also need a build tool such as a static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is starting to sound complicated. But wait!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How I&#8217;d build and host a multi-page website<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the site has multiple pages, then to get the benefit of push-to-deploy to a static file host but also using some kind of templating, we&#8217;re going to need a static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I went surveying the environment for this, everything was just WAY too complicated. Sure, <a href=\"https:\/\/jigsaw.tighten.co\/\">Jigsaw<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.11ty.dev\/\">Eleventy<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/mozilla.github.io\/nunjucks\/\">Nunjucks<\/a> and the many others are useful. But I didn&#8217;t want this big a dependency for these small sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I realised that the popular back-end PHP language <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/12\/hang-on-php-is-a-static-site-generator\/\">does this job already<\/a>. It&#8217;s original purpose was as a templating language. So why don&#8217;t I just use that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I wrote <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d\">a super-simple static site generator in about 160 lines of PHP<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This not only lets me use templating, but also lets me have partials\/components with parameters. Perfect for Tailwind!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pulling it all together<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have all the building blocks:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript<\/li><li>TailwindCSS &#8211; my only real dependency<\/li><li>AlpineJS &#8211; which is a dependency if you want it, but it just gets included from a CDN so there&#8217;s no build process<\/li><li>My simple PHP static site generator &#8211; which isn&#8217;t a dependency as such, but does have a build step<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To pull this all together I just use a couple of bash scripts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>build.sh<\/code> does a development build<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>prod.sh<\/code> does a production build (if this needs to be different)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t quite a perfect process. It needs a little more refinement. But I wanted to share it with you. I have kinda hastily thrown together a Git repository with all this ready to go:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/small-site-template\">https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/small-site-template<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick <code>npm install<\/code> on a fork or clone of the repo, followed by a <code>.\/build.sh<\/code> should deliver you a working site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim is NOT that you include this as a dependency of your project. But you fork it and make it your own. This is a template for you to take off in whatever direction you choose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Examples<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to see this in action? Sure thing. Here&#8217;s some examples of where I&#8217;ve used some or all of this tech stack to make real things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">caniphp.com<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/can-i-php\">GitHub<\/a>)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">turbo-admin.com<\/a> (this is a private repo &#8211; sorry)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/wp-composer-generator.veryuseful.app\/\">wp-composer-generator.veryuseful.app<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/wp-composer-generator\/\">GitHub<\/a>)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/bingo.doingitforthekids.net\/\">bingo.doingitforthekids.net<\/a> (Not in GitHub)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/\">wordlepress.netlify.app<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/wordlepress\">GitHub<\/a>)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/tweet-finder.veryuseful.app\/\">tweet-finder.veryuseful.app<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/tweet-finder\">GitHub<\/a>)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Go forth, and build uncomplicated websites<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The web doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated. My process here is, if anything, still over-complicated. But I&#8217;ve stripped down the tech to the minimum that I need to be productive building small sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t use WordPress unless I need to. I don&#8217;t need databases and logins and servers to host on. And I&#8217;m free to build and experiment quickly with these tools, which generate sites which will last and where I hope the tooling is sustainable and the projects easy to return to at a later date if I need to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was inspired to finally finish and publish this post by various sentiments I&#8217;ve seen on Twitter in the last week or so. At one end are people saying &#8220;web dev is never finished because it&#8217;s constantly evolving&#8221;. And at the other end are people saying it&#8217;s taboo that &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/traversymedia\/status\/1554443140479782914\">you don&#8217;t need a frameworks<\/a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jon_bossenger\/status\/1555119369646219265\">this is how we USED to build the web<\/a>&#8221; (emphasis mine).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But HTML, CSS and JS are stable technologies. They are evolving, but they will always have great backwards compatibility. These things won&#8217;t break!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we don&#8217;t need to be ashamed of this approach &#8211; you should develop simple sites with pride! &#8211; and it can be how we build the web now!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go and do so. And let me know how you get on.<\/p>\n",

But nowadays it&#8217;s very different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1524669696355844099\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Partly <a href=\"https:\/\/delicious-brains.castos.com\/podcasts\/12445\/episodes\/episode-12-javascript-for-backend-developers\">my skills have developed<\/a> &#8211; and in all of what I&#8217;m about to describe, I appreciate that this is not the kind of thing that an average person can do. And partly there have been some technology shifts that have enabled different ways of achieveing the &#8220;simple landing page&#8221; goal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But lets dig in to what&#8217;s changed, and what I would do now instead of using WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s changed?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you rewind even a relatively small number of years, building a simple several-page website with some interactivity was painful. HTML lacked some advanced things like date\/time inputs, and media elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CSS was lacking in simple things like animated transitions, flexbox, grid, image\/object fit\/cover, custom properties, and calc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might need PNG icon sprite sheets. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>JavaScript was so clunky you kinda had to have jQuery to make it usable. There was no good way to make it modular (other than conflicting standards jostling to be The True Way). And anything more than the simplest code quickly became a spaghetti of functions and nested callbacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So much stuff required importing libraries of code to achieve what is now basic and built-in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hosting was on shared servers with SFTP and SSH if you were lucky. CDN&#8217;s were for advanced projects. HTTPS certificates cost money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LOOK AT US NOW!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HTML5 semantic markup; programmable video and audio elements; date\/time inputs; built-in input validation and errors; CSS transitions and animations; flexbox, grid, calc, fancy units; CSS custom properties; background-size and object-fit options; ES6+ JavaScript with all sorts of niceties that make coding in vanilla JS so much easier; the fetch API; promises and async\/await; simple reactive JS libraries like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alpinejs.dev\/\">Alpine<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/vuejs\/petite-vue\">Petite Vue<\/a>; a multitude of browser APIs for things like geolocation, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, cameras, video, orientation, bluetooth and stuff; <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/JavaScript\/Guide\/Modules\">native ES modules<\/a>; fast and simple JavaScript tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/esbuild.github.io\/\">ESBuild<\/a>; SVG&#8217;s; and super-easy deployment of static pages to free or super-cheap, serverless hosts like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.netlify.com\/\">Netlify<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/pages.github.com\/\">GitHub Pages<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/pages.cloudflare.com\/\">Cloudflare pages<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phew! I can barely handle the power. And there IS power here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How I&#8217;d build and host a single page website now<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With all this power, let&#8217;s explore what a difference this has made. First off &#8211; how would I build and deploy a single page site?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the caveat that I&#8217;m not a designer, so I very much stand on the shoulders of giants when it comes to design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days that&#8217;s usually <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\/\">TailwindUI<\/a>, or something I can throw together in <a href=\"https:\/\/shuffle.dev\/\">Shuffle<\/a> (probably using TailwindCSS as well). Though there are some <a href=\"https:\/\/tailblocks.cc\/\">free<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hyperui.dev\/\">alternatives<\/a> as well for this kind of thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pick some components, chuck them together, tweak them as necessary (which I find much easier to do in this kind of small site with TailwindCSS than in regular CSS) and away you go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I need some simple JavaScript-driven interactivity I&#8217;ll add <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alpinejs.dev\/\">AlpineJS<\/a> (a small, reactive JS library) alongside vanilla JavaScript if needed. This needs no build process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;d put the whole thing in GitHub and deploy it to a static hosting service like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.netlify.com\/\">Netlify<\/a> (which has a generous free tier) or <a href=\"https:\/\/pages.cloudflare.com\/\">Cloudflare Pages<\/a> (which is 100% free). No FTP; a quick push to Git and you&#8217;re done! This is the modern way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Wait? What? Tailwind?!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But wait&#8230;&#8221;, I hear you say, &#8220;aren&#8217;t we aiming for minimal tech here? A no-build-process type thing?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, there are some exceptions. And let me justify Tailwind as a build tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have NEVER had a big problem with Tailwind&#8217;s CLI tool. It&#8217;s well maintained by some very smart people who have a decent business model. I just don&#8217;t get the kind of npm-error-vomit from Tailwind that I have got from other build tools. It&#8217;s stable, robust, well-documented, and the nature of what it does means that backwards-compatibility rarely seems to break.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I <em>enjoy<\/em> using Tailwind as a build tool and so I&#8217;m happy to have it in my simple toolchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PLUS, for me, one of the big benefits of Tailwind is it&#8217;s easy to come back to a project to tweak its styling. These projects are often build-deploy-and-forget-for-ages type things. So simple re-visiting of them is really helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s one more thing to mention about about Tailwind: to get the best from it you really need to have HTML components, possibly with parameters. And this might also need a build tool such as a static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is starting to sound complicated. But wait!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How I&#8217;d build and host a multi-page website<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the site has multiple pages, then to get the benefit of push-to-deploy to a static file host but also using some kind of templating, we&#8217;re going to need a static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I went surveying the environment for this, everything was just WAY too complicated. Sure, <a href=\"https:\/\/jigsaw.tighten.co\/\">Jigsaw<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.11ty.dev\/\">Eleventy<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/mozilla.github.io\/nunjucks\/\">Nunjucks<\/a> and the many others are useful. But I didn&#8217;t want this big a dependency for these small sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I realised that the popular back-end PHP language <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/12\/hang-on-php-is-a-static-site-generator\/\">does this job already<\/a>. It&#8217;s original purpose was as a templating language. So why don&#8217;t I just use that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I wrote <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d\">a super-simple static site generator in about 160 lines of PHP<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This not only lets me use templating, but also lets me have partials\/components with parameters. Perfect for Tailwind!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pulling it all together<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have all the building blocks:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript<\/li><li>TailwindCSS &#8211; my only real dependency<\/li><li>AlpineJS &#8211; which is a dependency if you want it, but it just gets included from a CDN so there&#8217;s no build process<\/li><li>My simple PHP static site generator &#8211; which isn&#8217;t a dependency as such, but does have a build step<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To pull this all together I just use a couple of bash scripts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>build.sh<\/code> does a development build<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>prod.sh<\/code> does a production build (if this needs to be different)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t quite a perfect process. It needs a little more refinement. But I wanted to share it with you. I have kinda hastily thrown together a Git repository with all this ready to go:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/small-site-template\">https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/small-site-template<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick <code>npm install<\/code> on a fork or clone of the repo, followed by a <code>.\/build.sh<\/code> should deliver you a working site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim is NOT that you include this as a dependency of your project. But you fork it and make it your own. This is a template for you to take off in whatever direction you choose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Examples<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to see this in action? Sure thing. Here&#8217;s some examples of where I&#8217;ve used some or all of this tech stack to make real things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">caniphp.com<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/can-i-php\">GitHub<\/a>)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">turbo-admin.com<\/a> (this is a private repo &#8211; sorry)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/wp-composer-generator.veryuseful.app\/\">wp-composer-generator.veryuseful.app<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/wp-composer-generator\/\">GitHub<\/a>)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/bingo.doingitforthekids.net\/\">bingo.doingitforthekids.net<\/a> (Not in GitHub)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/\">wordlepress.netlify.app<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/wordlepress\">GitHub<\/a>)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/tweet-finder.veryuseful.app\/\">tweet-finder.veryuseful.app<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/tweet-finder\">GitHub<\/a>)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Go forth, and build uncomplicated websites<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The web doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated. My process here is, if anything, still over-complicated. But I&#8217;ve stripped down the tech to the minimum that I need to be productive building small sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t use WordPress unless I need to. I don&#8217;t need databases and logins and servers to host on. And I&#8217;m free to build and experiment quickly with these tools, which generate sites which will last and where I hope the tooling is sustainable and the projects easy to return to at a later date if I need to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was inspired to finally finish and publish this post by various sentiments I&#8217;ve seen on Twitter in the last week or so. At one end are people saying &#8220;web dev is never finished because it&#8217;s constantly evolving&#8221;. And at the other end are people saying it&#8217;s taboo that &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/traversymedia\/status\/1554443140479782914\">you don&#8217;t need a frameworks<\/a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jon_bossenger\/status\/1555119369646219265\">this is how we USED to build the web<\/a>&#8221; (emphasis mine).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But HTML, CSS and JS are stable technologies. They are evolving, but they will always have great backwards compatibility. These things won&#8217;t break!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we don&#8217;t need to be ashamed of this approach &#8211; you should develop simple sites with pride! &#8211; and it can be how we build the web now!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go and do so. And let me know how you get on.<\/p>\n",
