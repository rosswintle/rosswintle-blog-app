Is it possible?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My one, guilty, I-have-so-many-of-these-things thing is: audio equipment. OK, and bags. I like expensive, strong, functional rucksacks. But I have SO many headphones and several microphones, and recently have been working out out what the best mic setup is for me. But it&#8217;s not easy&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My audio environment<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My situation is that I rent a small office. And it&#8217;s a noisy office. Paper-thin walls you can almost hear conversations through. Single glazed windows with lorries passing by outside. A hissing 50-year-old (estimated) radiator that seems to make the perfect frequency for all microphones to pick up as strong background noise. Oh, and a mechanical keyboard. But that&#8217;s self-inflicted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have Zoom calls. Several most days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m NOT an audiophile, but for some reason I strive for good audio, but without spending LOADS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, while listening to a playback of a meeting I was in, I realised how bad my audio was. Tinny. Echoey. Distant. I wanted it better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if I&#8217;m not in the office, my home office setup isn&#8217;t ideal. I sometimes have kids moving around behind me, a washing machine on not far away, the stuff of life happens around me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I&#8217;ve tried<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried a Blue Yeti. It&#8217;s a USB condenser mic. It&#8217;s REALLY fricking sensitive. If I put it on a mic arm with a strong shock mount, turn the gain right down, and get really close, the sound is GREAT. But it&#8217;s not for my room. And it&#8217;s not portable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried a Rode Podcaster. This is a great USB dynamic mic. But the gain is really low and so I need to get close. Not as close as the Yeti-with-the-gain-down. But it&#8217;s still a big, in-yer-face piece of equipment. I still have this for when I want to record decent audio. But I don&#8217;t want it in my face on calls and, again, it&#8217;s not portable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-audio\"><audio controls src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/podcaster.mp3\"><\/audio><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve tried my headphones. Many of my headphones have mics in. They are all crap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got a Sennheiser headset. This is actually really good for sound. But it&#8217;s uncomfortable to wear for a long time and it&#8217;s clumsy and looks dorky.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got a mic built into my Macbook, but it&#8217;s too far away when docked to be useful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got a mic built into my webcam (Logitech C920) and it&#8217;s the current solution. It kinda works good, but I want it to be better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-audio\"><audio controls src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/webcam.mp3\"><\/audio><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve tried condenser mics, dynamic mics, headsets, earbuds. The only things I&#8217;ve not really tried are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Highly directional shotgun mics. These are supposedly good. I could get one of these in front of me and mostly out of picture, but it would still be too in-the-way for calls. And most of the mics I can find are either twice as much as I want to pay, OR they&#8217;re hot-shoe, camera-mounted. Oh, and they&#8217;re not portable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A clip-on\/lavalier mic. Why does no one talk about these for calls? Loads of YouTubers use them when out and about, but no one seems to suggest using them for calls. Why not? They use them for broadcast audio all the time, so they must be good quality. They&#8217;re not too expensive. They get the mic close without too much visual clutter. Hmm&#8230;.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I was curious about lavalier mics and so set out to research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Research<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I put a call out for help and got some really helpful feedback. But a lot of it didn&#8217;t quite fit with what I wanted:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Use a big fancy mic with compression and gain. This would be either a) more equipment and not be portable; or b) need software that I&#8217;m not allowed to install.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use software that I&#8217;m not allowed to install due to corporate IT restrictions<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use a miniature audio booth, like an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaoticaeyeball.com\/\">Eyeball<\/a> &#8211; this would look even worse on calls than what I have!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hide under a duvet &#8211; sounds fun, but&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I then went looking up lavalier mics. They vary in price and quality. A cheap wired one is a few pounds. Expensive wired ones are \u00a340-60. A cheap wireless one is \u00a340-100, and more expensive wireless kits can be \u00a3100-400.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially I bought <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.eu\/d\/3iw0onH\">a \u00a340 wired mic<\/a> to try the principle out. It worked a treat! Small, convenient, good sound, easy to use, portable, low noise. Great!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I walked away from my desk with it attached and dragged my laptop across the desk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not so great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d been eyeing up wireless equivalents too. I won&#8217;t like, my recent wave of vanity was on full show here. I hate most of them because they have big high-contrast logos on them! The <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.eu\/d\/5yK3kuG\">Hollyland Lark M1<\/a> was interesting and seemed like good value, but that big logo and LEDs didn&#8217;t appeal, and some of the stuff in reviews put me off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so to the mid-range where lots of people talk about the <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.eu\/d\/8hbOeg4\">Rode Wireless Go<\/a>. But this was about 3 times what I wanted to pay. There&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/R%C3%98DE-Microphones-WAVE-Wireless-400836009\/dp\/B0BQLB596V\/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2Y48DJRHN40QP&amp;keywords=rode+wireless+go+2&amp;qid=1704756771&amp;s=musical-instruments&amp;sprefix=rode+go,mi,88&amp;sr=1-4&amp;ufe=app_do:amzn1.fos.cc223b57-2b86-485c-a85e-6431c1f06c86&amp;th=1\">an ME version of this<\/a>, that is a less feature-rich package, and it appealed until I discovered the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dji.com\/uk\/mic\">DJI Mic<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dji.com\/uk\/mic\">The DJI Mic<\/a>. Still about twice what I wanted to pay, but SUCH an appealing package. A little touch-screen on the receiver; gain controls; lightning and USB-C connectors; a dual charging cable; a not in-your-face design; an option to use a magnet instead of a clip; mic input on the transmitter; every output you could want on the receiver.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just kept opening it in a browser window on this to check if it was on sale. And generally, my rule about purchasing new tech is that I have to keep going back to see it before I buy it. I have to hold the &#8220;Oooooh, that looks like something I <em>neeeeeed<\/em>!&#8221; for a while before I buy on the basis that if I don&#8217;t need it I&#8217;ll forget about it. But this just seems like such a versatile little package, and I couldn&#8217;t shake off the temptation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Aside: Yes, I&#8217;m confusing &#8220;need&#8221; with &#8220;want&#8221; here in a big way. I&#8217;m very privileged to even be considering spending this much on a gadget but as you&#8217;ll see, I don&#8217;t do this lightly.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final thing was a reminder from a colleague that I will use this thing for several hours most working days. And paying good money for good quality equipment you use every day and that will last is a good idea!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I bought one to try out. (Note: I bought the kit with the single transmitter and receiver)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this little thing is a triumph of miniaturisation. The receiver is SO tiny but has this brilliant little LED touch screen which shows you levels and status. It&#8217;s well built. It&#8217;s a really versatile little device with USB-C and Lightning adaptors to plug straight in to a mobile, a USB-A cable cleverly designed to charge both transmitter and receiver at the same time and a hot-shoe mount for a camera. Adding a strong magnet to the clip is great, though it only works through a shirt or thin jumper. It connects fast and just works really slickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it sounds great too! There&#8217;s some background noise still, but that can be filtered. But it&#8217;s not accompanied by loads of echo and it levels out my voice nicely &#8211; not too boomy or poppy. ALL in a really convenient and versatile little package.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-audio\"><audio controls src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/djimic.mp3\"><\/audio><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a few downsides &#8211; the transmitter is a little heavy and weighs down whatever piece of clothing you clip it to. And there&#8217;s just the faff of having to charge the two parts and plug things in and connect them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s a really cool piece of kit, and hopefully it&#8217;s made my calls a little better for my colleagues! (And I have other plans for how to make good use of it too!)<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>The Holy Grail is this: wireless, reliable, low-latency, high-quality sound in a reasonably-priced, portable package with noise reduction that doesn&#8217;t rely on fancy software that the IT and security departments won&#8217;t like. Is it possible?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My one, guilty, I-have-so-many-of-these-things thing is: audio equipment. OK, and bags. I like expensive, strong, functional rucksacks. But I have SO many headphones and several microphones, and recently have been working out out what the best mic setup is for me. But it&#8217;s not easy&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My audio environment<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My situation is that I rent a small office. And it&#8217;s a noisy office. Paper-thin walls you can almost hear conversations through. Single glazed windows with lorries passing by outside. A hissing 50-year-old (estimated) radiator that seems to make the perfect frequency for all microphones to pick up as strong background noise. Oh, and a mechanical keyboard. But that&#8217;s self-inflicted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have Zoom calls. Several most days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m NOT an audiophile, but for some reason I strive for good audio, but without spending LOADS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, while listening to a playback of a meeting I was in, I realised how bad my audio was. Tinny. Echoey. Distant. I wanted it better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if I&#8217;m not in the office, my home office setup isn&#8217;t ideal. I sometimes have kids moving around behind me, a washing machine on not far away, the stuff of life happens around me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I&#8217;ve tried<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried a Blue Yeti. It&#8217;s a USB condenser mic. It&#8217;s REALLY fricking sensitive. If I put it on a mic arm with a strong shock mount, turn the gain right down, and get really close, the sound is GREAT. But it&#8217;s not for my room. And it&#8217;s not portable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried a Rode Podcaster. This is a great USB dynamic mic. But the gain is really low and so I need to get close. Not as close as the Yeti-with-the-gain-down. But it&#8217;s still a big, in-yer-face piece of equipment. I still have this for when I want to record decent audio. But I don&#8217;t want it in my face on calls and, again, it&#8217;s not portable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-audio\"><audio controls src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/podcaster.mp3\"><\/audio><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve tried my headphones. Many of my headphones have mics in. They are all crap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got a Sennheiser headset. This is actually really good for sound. But it&#8217;s uncomfortable to wear for a long time and it&#8217;s clumsy and looks dorky.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got a mic built into my Macbook, but it&#8217;s too far away when docked to be useful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got a mic built into my webcam (Logitech C920) and it&#8217;s the current solution. It kinda works good, but I want it to be better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-audio\"><audio controls src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/webcam.mp3\"><\/audio><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve tried condenser mics, dynamic mics, headsets, earbuds. The only things I&#8217;ve not really tried are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Highly directional shotgun mics. These are supposedly good. I could get one of these in front of me and mostly out of picture, but it would still be too in-the-way for calls. And most of the mics I can find are either twice as much as I want to pay, OR they&#8217;re hot-shoe, camera-mounted. Oh, and they&#8217;re not portable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A clip-on\/lavalier mic. Why does no one talk about these for calls? Loads of YouTubers use them when out and about, but no one seems to suggest using them for calls. Why not? They use them for broadcast audio all the time, so they must be good quality. They&#8217;re not too expensive. They get the mic close without too much visual clutter. Hmm&#8230;.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I was curious about lavalier mics and so set out to research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Research<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I put a call out for help and got some really helpful feedback. But a lot of it didn&#8217;t quite fit with what I wanted:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Use a big fancy mic with compression and gain. This would be either a) more equipment and not be portable; or b) need software that I&#8217;m not allowed to install.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use software that I&#8217;m not allowed to install due to corporate IT restrictions<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use a miniature audio booth, like an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaoticaeyeball.com\/\">Eyeball<\/a> &#8211; this would look even worse on calls than what I have!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hide under a duvet &#8211; sounds fun, but&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I then went looking up lavalier mics. They vary in price and quality. A cheap wired one is a few pounds. Expensive wired ones are \u00a340-60. A cheap wireless one is \u00a340-100, and more expensive wireless kits can be \u00a3100-400.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially I bought <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.eu\/d\/3iw0onH\">a \u00a340 wired mic<\/a> to try the principle out. It worked a treat! Small, convenient, good sound, easy to use, portable, low noise. Great!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I walked away from my desk with it attached and dragged my laptop across the desk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not so great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d been eyeing up wireless equivalents too. I won&#8217;t like, my recent wave of vanity was on full show here. I hate most of them because they have big high-contrast logos on them! The <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.eu\/d\/5yK3kuG\">Hollyland Lark M1<\/a> was interesting and seemed like good value, but that big logo and LEDs didn&#8217;t appeal, and some of the stuff in reviews put me off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so to the mid-range where lots of people talk about the <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.eu\/d\/8hbOeg4\">Rode Wireless Go<\/a>. But this was about 3 times what I wanted to pay. There&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/R%C3%98DE-Microphones-WAVE-Wireless-400836009\/dp\/B0BQLB596V\/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2Y48DJRHN40QP&amp;keywords=rode+wireless+go+2&amp;qid=1704756771&amp;s=musical-instruments&amp;sprefix=rode+go,mi,88&amp;sr=1-4&amp;ufe=app_do:amzn1.fos.cc223b57-2b86-485c-a85e-6431c1f06c86&amp;th=1\">an ME version of this<\/a>, that is a less feature-rich package, and it appealed until I discovered the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dji.com\/uk\/mic\">DJI Mic<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dji.com\/uk\/mic\">The DJI Mic<\/a>. Still about twice what I wanted to pay, but SUCH an appealing package. A little touch-screen on the receiver; gain controls; lightning and USB-C connectors; a dual charging cable; a not in-your-face design; an option to use a magnet instead of a clip; mic input on the transmitter; every output you could want on the receiver.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just kept opening it in a browser window on this to check if it was on sale. And generally, my rule about purchasing new tech is that I have to keep going back to see it before I buy it. I have to hold the &#8220;Oooooh, that looks like something I <em>neeeeeed<\/em>!&#8221; for a while before I buy on the basis that if I don&#8217;t need it I&#8217;ll forget about it. But this just seems like such a versatile little package, and I couldn&#8217;t shake off the temptation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Aside: Yes, I&#8217;m confusing &#8220;need&#8221; with &#8220;want&#8221; here in a big way. I&#8217;m very privileged to even be considering spending this much on a gadget but as you&#8217;ll see, I don&#8217;t do this lightly.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final thing was a reminder from a colleague that I will use this thing for several hours most working days. And paying good money for good quality equipment you use every day and that will last is a good idea!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I bought one to try out. (Note: I bought the kit with the single transmitter and receiver)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this little thing is a triumph of miniaturisation. The receiver is SO tiny but has this brilliant little LED touch screen which shows you levels and status. It&#8217;s well built. It&#8217;s a really versatile little device with USB-C and Lightning adaptors to plug straight in to a mobile, a USB-A cable cleverly designed to charge both transmitter and receiver at the same time and a hot-shoe mount for a camera. Adding a strong magnet to the clip is great, though it only works through a shirt or thin jumper. It connects fast and just works really slickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it sounds great too! There&#8217;s some background noise still, but that can be filtered. But it&#8217;s not accompanied by loads of echo and it levels out my voice nicely &#8211; not too boomy or poppy. ALL in a really convenient and versatile little package.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-audio\"><audio controls src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/djimic.mp3\"><\/audio><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a few downsides &#8211; the transmitter is a little heavy and weighs down whatever piece of clothing you clip it to. And there&#8217;s just the faff of having to charge the two parts and plug things in and connect them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s a really cool piece of kit, and hopefully it&#8217;s made my calls a little better for my colleagues! (And I have other plans for how to make good use of it too!)<\/p>\n",

And it may not even work for you. And it&#8217;s probably not allowed. But I&#8217;d argue that if you can see all your friends birthdays on Facebook anyway then this is just an automated version of something you could do manually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway, I wanted to record what I did.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s the situation: I&#8217;m not really on Facebook. But there are some people I&#8217;m friends with on there for whom I wanted reminders of their birthdays. So I wanted to be able to download just these dates so that I can save them for my own use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is to open your browser&#8217;s dev tools, and go to the Facebook Birthdays page: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/friends\/birthdays\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/friends\/birthdays<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the network tab you&#8217;ll now see all the network requests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hit Ctrl\/Cmd-F to open the find window and search for <code>friends_by_birthday_month_context_sentence<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will show all the requests that contain the birthday data. It will look something like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"412\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-29-at-15.41.56@2x-1024x412.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-254931\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-29-at-15.41.56@2x-1024x412.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-29-at-15.41.56@2x-300x121.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-29-at-15.41.56@2x-768x309.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-29-at-15.41.56@2x-1536x618.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-29-at-15.41.56@2x-2048x824.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the left, in the search results, you can see the <code>\/birthdays<\/code> request with results for February, March and April. (Note: I&#8217;m doing this in January!) And then a follow-up request to <code>\/graphql<\/code> that gets the data for May and June.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you scroll the page down the other months load as well, but you&#8217;ll need to reload the search to get the full results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You then need to get the data from these requests into somewhere you can run JavaScript.  And this will need some manual effort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Processing the \/birthdays request<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For the <code>\/birthdays<\/code> request you&#8217;ll need to track down the script that contains <code>friends_by_birthday_month_context_sentence<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then copy that script into a code editor (I actually did this in an interactive JavaScript tool called <a href=\"https:\/\/runjs.app\/\">RunJS<\/a>). Do NOT use an online code editor like CodePen or JSBin as this file contains the personal data of your friends!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then edit the code to assign the JSON from the response to a variable by prepending it with <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>const data = <\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of this file you should then add code to extract the names and dates. Mine looks like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nlet friends_by_months = data.require&#x5B;0]&#x5B;3]&#x5B;0]&#x5B;'__bbox'].require&#x5B;5]&#x5B;3]&#x5B;1]&#x5B;'__bbox'].result.data.viewer.all_friends_by_birthday_month.edges.flatMap(m =&gt; m.node.friends.edges)\nfriends_by_months.map(f =&gt; f.node.name + ',' + f.node.birthdate.year + '-' + f.node.birthdate.month + '-' + f.node.birthdate.day)\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Yes. This is a mess. But if you run this JS code it you should get out an array of names and birthdays for the first few months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Processing the \/graphql requests<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The requests for the other months are GraphQL requests. You&#8217;ll need to do something similar to what you did for the main <code>birthdays<\/code> request for each of the GraphQL requests containing birthday data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Copy the JSON response into a code editor and prepend with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>const data = <\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The code to extract the dates is slightly different. But putting this at the end of the file and executing it should give you the array of names and dates:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nlet friends_by_months = data.data.viewer.all_friends_by_birthday_month.edges.flatMap(m =&gt; m.node.friends.edges)\nfriends_by_months.map(f =&gt; f.node.name + ',' + f.node.birthdate.year + '-' + f.node.birthdate.month + '-' + f.node.birthdate.day)\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all I got! Maybe this is useful to someone.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>I used some hacky JavaScript to scrape my friends birthdays from Facebook so that I can put them in my actual calendar.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a bit technical and probably not something you want to do. And it may not even work for you. And it&#8217;s probably not allowed. But I&#8217;d argue that if you can see all your friends birthdays on Facebook anyway then this is just an automated version of something you could do manually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway, I wanted to record what I did.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s the situation: I&#8217;m not really on Facebook. But there are some people I&#8217;m friends with on there for whom I wanted reminders of their birthdays. So I wanted to be able to download just these dates so that I can save them for my own use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is to open your browser&#8217;s dev tools, and go to the Facebook Birthdays page: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/friends\/birthdays\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/friends\/birthdays<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the network tab you&#8217;ll now see all the network requests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hit Ctrl\/Cmd-F to open the find window and search for <code>friends_by_birthday_month_context_sentence<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will show all the requests that contain the birthday data. It will look something like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"412\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-29-at-15.41.56@2x-1024x412.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-254931\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-29-at-15.41.56@2x-1024x412.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-29-at-15.41.56@2x-300x121.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-29-at-15.41.56@2x-768x309.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-29-at-15.41.56@2x-1536x618.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/CleanShot-2024-01-29-at-15.41.56@2x-2048x824.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the left, in the search results, you can see the <code>\/birthdays<\/code> request with results for February, March and April. (Note: I&#8217;m doing this in January!) And then a follow-up request to <code>\/graphql<\/code> that gets the data for May and June.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you scroll the page down the other months load as well, but you&#8217;ll need to reload the search to get the full results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You then need to get the data from these requests into somewhere you can run JavaScript.  And this will need some manual effort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Processing the \/birthdays request<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For the <code>\/birthdays<\/code> request you&#8217;ll need to track down the script that contains <code>friends_by_birthday_month_context_sentence<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then copy that script into a code editor (I actually did this in an interactive JavaScript tool called <a href=\"https:\/\/runjs.app\/\">RunJS<\/a>). Do NOT use an online code editor like CodePen or JSBin as this file contains the personal data of your friends!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then edit the code to assign the JSON from the response to a variable by prepending it with <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>const data = <\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of this file you should then add code to extract the names and dates. Mine looks like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nlet friends_by_months = data.require&#x5B;0]&#x5B;3]&#x5B;0]&#x5B;'__bbox'].require&#x5B;5]&#x5B;3]&#x5B;1]&#x5B;'__bbox'].result.data.viewer.all_friends_by_birthday_month.edges.flatMap(m =&gt; m.node.friends.edges)\nfriends_by_months.map(f =&gt; f.node.name + ',' + f.node.birthdate.year + '-' + f.node.birthdate.month + '-' + f.node.birthdate.day)\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Yes. This is a mess. But if you run this JS code it you should get out an array of names and birthdays for the first few months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Processing the \/graphql requests<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The requests for the other months are GraphQL requests. You&#8217;ll need to do something similar to what you did for the main <code>birthdays<\/code> request for each of the GraphQL requests containing birthday data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Copy the JSON response into a code editor and prepend with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>const data = <\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The code to extract the dates is slightly different. But putting this at the end of the file and executing it should give you the array of names and dates:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nlet friends_by_months = data.data.viewer.all_friends_by_birthday_month.edges.flatMap(m =&gt; m.node.friends.edges)\nfriends_by_months.map(f =&gt; f.node.name + ',' + f.node.birthdate.year + '-' + f.node.birthdate.month + '-' + f.node.birthdate.day)\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all I got! Maybe this is useful to someone.<\/p>\n",

Here are my very brief thoughts on Doughnut Economics.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I read a lot, but I find long books with lots of words hard to maintain focus on &#8211; especially with non-fiction. But I wanted to read Doughnut Economics to see what it was all about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I won&#8217;t go into detail on what the model is &#8211; I&#8217;m sure you can find a summary somewhere. But I LIKE the Doughnut model presented and I think there are some very important ideas in this book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was quite academic, so be prepared for that if you want to read it. This was fine, but I think a less-academic version of it would be helpful. Having said that, as I persevered I learned a LOT about economics as a discipline, and how it&#8217;s taught. It left me curious to know more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I don&#8217;t understand is what someone like me gains from reading it. The Doughtnut is good, but what can I do&#8230; really&#8230; what practical action can I take away to progress this idea? It feels so big and out of my control. Basically a change to the way that the whole world organises itself, in the face of a huge majority of people of influence who really don&#8217;t want that change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, interesting ideas. A nice summary of how economics works (or doesn&#8217;t). But I was left hanging. How do these ideas start to become reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It just seems too hard.<\/p>\n",

Here are my very brief thoughts on Doughnut Economics.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I read a lot, but I find long books with lots of words hard to maintain focus on &#8211; especially with non-fiction. But I wanted to read Doughnut Economics to see what it was all about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I won&#8217;t go into detail on what the model is &#8211; I&#8217;m sure you can find a summary somewhere. But I LIKE the Doughnut model presented and I think there are some very important ideas in this book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was quite academic, so be prepared for that if you want to read it. This was fine, but I think a less-academic version of it would be helpful. Having said that, as I persevered I learned a LOT about economics as a discipline, and how it&#8217;s taught. It left me curious to know more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I don&#8217;t understand is what someone like me gains from reading it. The Doughtnut is good, but what can I do&#8230; really&#8230; what practical action can I take away to progress this idea? It feels so big and out of my control. Basically a change to the way that the whole world organises itself, in the face of a huge majority of people of influence who really don&#8217;t want that change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, interesting ideas. A nice summary of how economics works (or doesn&#8217;t). But I was left hanging. How do these ideas start to become reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It just seems too hard.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p><em>Continuing my &#8220;reading books&#8221; habit &#8211; I&#8217;ve finished TWO in 2024!! I was one of Manton&#8217;s Kickstarters for Micro.blog and his book. The book is finally here. And I&#8217;ve managed to read it quite quickly (for me). Is it any good?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s worth saying that Manton&#8217;s book on Indie Microblogging is <a href=\"https:\/\/book.micro.blog\/\">free to read on the internet<\/a>, can be downloaded as a <a href=\"https:\/\/book.micro.blog\/indie-microblogging.epub\">free ePub<\/a> and is licensed as Creative Commons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve always loved the idea of micro blogging, of the Indie Web, of owning your content, of federation and so on. I blog here, on my own site, and my Mastodon feed is replicated to <a href=\"https:\/\/latest.rosswintle.uk\/\">https:\/\/latest.rosswintle.uk\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, despite trying&#8230; hard&#8230; several times&#8230;, I&#8217;ve always found Manton&#8217;s Micro.blog service a bit clumsy and over complicated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now Manton has, after all these years, finally finished the book! Hooray! And congrats!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does this help me get my head around the Micro.blog service any more?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it kinda does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two things I took away from this book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Manton&#8217;s thoughts (and those of others) on the nature of the web, of blogging, and of social media.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some really deep detail on the inner workings of the Micro.blog service and some of the protocols and standards that it uses.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, I think this should be two books. One is a really good manual\/technical guide to Indie Web protocols and a user manual and developer guide for Micro.blog. And the other is the &#8220;thinky&#8221; bit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I enjoyed both, I suppose. I got much more out of the thinky bit. But it was interesting to learn more about how Micro.blog works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just found it weird that the start and end were philosophical, and relevant to many. But then there was a huge diversion in the middle into code snippets and JSON output and&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. That felt like it should have been elsewhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also left me feeling&#8230; well&#8230; how the Indie Web always leaves me feeling. It&#8217;s too complicated! Manton walks the talk, by literally running a service that makes the indie web protocols much easier (THANK YOU!!!!). But then&#8230; it&#8217;s still complicated. RSS, XML, JSONFeed, ActivityPub, Webmention, Micropub, Pingbacks, Microformats, PubSubHubub.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, this book does help you understand how it all fits together. But it also makes it evident that it&#8217;s just really complicated. And if even <em>I <\/em>don&#8217;t care enough, then there&#8217;s a very small number of people who do. And that&#8217;s always bothered me about the Indie Web.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All credit to Manton though. He got the book out! And it&#8217;s good. Just feel free to skip the Micro.blog manual parts.<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Book: Indie Microblogging by Manton Reece",
        "content": "\n<p><em>Continuing my &#8220;reading books&#8221; habit &#8211; I&#8217;ve finished TWO in 2024!! I was one of Manton&#8217;s Kickstarters for Micro.blog and his book. The book is finally here. And I&#8217;ve managed to read it quite quickly (for me). Is it any good?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s worth saying that Manton&#8217;s book on Indie Microblogging is <a href=\"https:\/\/book.micro.blog\/\">free to read on the internet<\/a>, can be downloaded as a <a href=\"https:\/\/book.micro.blog\/indie-microblogging.epub\">free ePub<\/a> and is licensed as Creative Commons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve always loved the idea of micro blogging, of the Indie Web, of owning your content, of federation and so on. I blog here, on my own site, and my Mastodon feed is replicated to <a href=\"https:\/\/latest.rosswintle.uk\/\">https:\/\/latest.rosswintle.uk\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, despite trying&#8230; hard&#8230; several times&#8230;, I&#8217;ve always found Manton&#8217;s Micro.blog service a bit clumsy and over complicated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now Manton has, after all these years, finally finished the book! Hooray! And congrats!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does this help me get my head around the Micro.blog service any more?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it kinda does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two things I took away from this book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Manton&#8217;s thoughts (and those of others) on the nature of the web, of blogging, and of social media.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some really deep detail on the inner workings of the Micro.blog service and some of the protocols and standards that it uses.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, I think this should be two books. One is a really good manual\/technical guide to Indie Web protocols and a user manual and developer guide for Micro.blog. And the other is the &#8220;thinky&#8221; bit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I enjoyed both, I suppose. I got much more out of the thinky bit. But it was interesting to learn more about how Micro.blog works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just found it weird that the start and end were philosophical, and relevant to many. But then there was a huge diversion in the middle into code snippets and JSON output and&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. That felt like it should have been elsewhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also left me feeling&#8230; well&#8230; how the Indie Web always leaves me feeling. It&#8217;s too complicated! Manton walks the talk, by literally running a service that makes the indie web protocols much easier (THANK YOU!!!!). But then&#8230; it&#8217;s still complicated. RSS, XML, JSONFeed, ActivityPub, Webmention, Micropub, Pingbacks, Microformats, PubSubHubub.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, this book does help you understand how it all fits together. But it also makes it evident that it&#8217;s just really complicated. And if even <em>I <\/em>don&#8217;t care enough, then there&#8217;s a very small number of people who do. And that&#8217;s always bothered me about the Indie Web.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All credit to Manton though. He got the book out! And it&#8217;s good. Just feel free to skip the Micro.blog manual parts.<\/p>\n",

How&#8217;s that all going?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2023\/12\/2024-self-improvement-and-habits\/\">I explained how I wanted to start some new habits<\/a> to make 2024-me better. The top habits &#8211; the easy ones with the most impact &#8211; were:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Eat well<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exercise<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Floss<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Declutter<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But there were others that should have been do-able too:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Clean\/tidy\/fix up our house properly<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stop going to bed late<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Read more books<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Write more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And the things I wanted to do, but that really had to give way because they were harder and lower value:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Work on side projects&#8230; \ud83d\ude15<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I&#8217;m just about recovered from Covid, which hasn&#8217;t helped matters. It&#8217;s basically written off the last week, and February will be a clean start. But let&#8217;s look at how it&#8217;s gone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tracking in the excellent TickTick app (which I plan to write about sometime) and it lets me export a nice little graphic of my month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"396\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/IMG_1738-396x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-254960\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/IMG_1738-396x1024.png 396w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/IMG_1738-116x300.png 116w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/IMG_1738-768x1984.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/IMG_1738-793x2048.png 793w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/IMG_1738.png 1029w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clarifications on some of the habits<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just to clarify some of these, because their wording in some cases doesn&#8217;t really say what they are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Quit snacks&#8221; is pretty self-explanatory, but I&#8217;m basically calorie tracking with the Lose It app, and this is me hitting my goal there.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;Do housework&#8221; makes is sound like I don&#8217;t normally do any. Which is not true. The idea of this is that I will do a significant piece of housework OR a DIY job on the house\/garden\/car _before_ I sit and have &#8220;me time&#8221; in the evening. It&#8217;s about doing things in the right order (rather than playing Zelda for two hours and then rushing to get the dishes done before I go to bed).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;Early to bed&#8221; actually means not starting doing anything new after 10:30pm. I still may not be asleep until quite late. But it&#8217;s the cut off for new things that&#8217;s important.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>How&#8217;s it going then?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Plan your day: Started well, but have dropped off. This ALWAYS happens. Need to nail it because it&#8217;s SO useful.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Quit snacks: Was doing so well and losing some weight and was proud of myself. Then events and illness happened. A fresh start in February. Let&#8217;s do better!!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mini workouts: Again, started strong, but succumbed to events. Need to find ways to not let events get in the way here. Should be doable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do housework: Not sure what happened in that middle week. But I recovered before Covid struck. This is good!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reading: This is was lower importance, but has clearly been easy to do. I&#8217;ve even finished <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/02\/book-doughnut-economics-by-kate-raworth\/\">two<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/02\/book-indie-microblogging-by-manton-reece\/\">books<\/a>!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Early to bed: Excellent. Skipped a few nights. Because sometimes I just want to pause and do something fun or interesting. But generally good here!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Flossing: Excellent. I am now a &#8220;person who flosses&#8221;. My dentist will be proud!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Declutter: Very poor. This is really interesting. BUT&#8230; given how well I&#8217;m doing with the others I&#8217;m not going to beat myself up about it. Call this a stretch goal.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exercise: The goal here is actually 5 days a week of either cycling to my office, or doing some other &#8220;proper&#8221; exercise. So I&#8217;m actually doing pretty well. Again &#8211; Covid stopped me in my tracks. But I should be able to get this one back on the go.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summary<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I&#8217;m REALLY happy. It&#8217;s supposed to be hard to work on multiple habits, and I&#8217;ve done it pretty well. I&#8217;m really pleased.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Covid did really mess things up though. It&#8217;s Monday tomorrow. A new week. Let&#8217;s see how we get on as we reset and start a new month!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How are your goals or resolutions going?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>I was putting some new habits in place to try and bring more energy and discipline to 2024. How&#8217;s that all going?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2023\/12\/2024-self-improvement-and-habits\/\">I explained how I wanted to start some new habits<\/a> to make 2024-me better. The top habits &#8211; the easy ones with the most impact &#8211; were:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Eat well<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exercise<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Floss<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Declutter<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But there were others that should have been do-able too:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Clean\/tidy\/fix up our house properly<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stop going to bed late<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Read more books<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Write more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And the things I wanted to do, but that really had to give way because they were harder and lower value:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Work on side projects&#8230; \ud83d\ude15<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I&#8217;m just about recovered from Covid, which hasn&#8217;t helped matters. It&#8217;s basically written off the last week, and February will be a clean start. But let&#8217;s look at how it&#8217;s gone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tracking in the excellent TickTick app (which I plan to write about sometime) and it lets me export a nice little graphic of my month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"396\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/IMG_1738-396x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-254960\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/IMG_1738-396x1024.png 396w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/IMG_1738-116x300.png 116w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/IMG_1738-768x1984.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/IMG_1738-793x2048.png 793w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/IMG_1738.png 1029w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clarifications on some of the habits<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just to clarify some of these, because their wording in some cases doesn&#8217;t really say what they are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Quit snacks&#8221; is pretty self-explanatory, but I&#8217;m basically calorie tracking with the Lose It app, and this is me hitting my goal there.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;Do housework&#8221; makes is sound like I don&#8217;t normally do any. Which is not true. The idea of this is that I will do a significant piece of housework OR a DIY job on the house\/garden\/car _before_ I sit and have &#8220;me time&#8221; in the evening. It&#8217;s about doing things in the right order (rather than playing Zelda for two hours and then rushing to get the dishes done before I go to bed).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;Early to bed&#8221; actually means not starting doing anything new after 10:30pm. I still may not be asleep until quite late. But it&#8217;s the cut off for new things that&#8217;s important.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>How&#8217;s it going then?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Plan your day: Started well, but have dropped off. This ALWAYS happens. Need to nail it because it&#8217;s SO useful.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Quit snacks: Was doing so well and losing some weight and was proud of myself. Then events and illness happened. A fresh start in February. Let&#8217;s do better!!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mini workouts: Again, started strong, but succumbed to events. Need to find ways to not let events get in the way here. Should be doable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do housework: Not sure what happened in that middle week. But I recovered before Covid struck. This is good!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reading: This is was lower importance, but has clearly been easy to do. I&#8217;ve even finished <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/02\/book-doughnut-economics-by-kate-raworth\/\">two<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/02\/book-indie-microblogging-by-manton-reece\/\">books<\/a>!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Early to bed: Excellent. Skipped a few nights. Because sometimes I just want to pause and do something fun or interesting. But generally good here!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Flossing: Excellent. I am now a &#8220;person who flosses&#8221;. My dentist will be proud!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Declutter: Very poor. This is really interesting. BUT&#8230; given how well I&#8217;m doing with the others I&#8217;m not going to beat myself up about it. Call this a stretch goal.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exercise: The goal here is actually 5 days a week of either cycling to my office, or doing some other &#8220;proper&#8221; exercise. So I&#8217;m actually doing pretty well. Again &#8211; Covid stopped me in my tracks. But I should be able to get this one back on the go.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summary<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I&#8217;m REALLY happy. It&#8217;s supposed to be hard to work on multiple habits, and I&#8217;ve done it pretty well. I&#8217;m really pleased.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Covid did really mess things up though. It&#8217;s Monday tomorrow. A new week. Let&#8217;s see how we get on as we reset and start a new month!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How are your goals or resolutions going?<\/p>\n",

But they are held back by the lack of dynamic data. Sure, you can store data in local storage, but what if you want to share data between browsers? Is there a way to do that that is simple and ultra-low-cost for side-projects that I let the world use for free?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A simple solution is fine. I don&#8217;t plan using this for large volumes of data. So is there some kind of key-value (KV) store I can put a JSON blob in using a simple REST API that is somehow secure?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned this on social media a couple of times. I get responses suggesting tools. The responses I get are good, but they are things like <a href=\"https:\/\/fauna.com\/\">Fauna<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/redis.io\/\">Redis<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/supabase.com\/\">Supabase<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudflare.com\/en-gb\/developer-platform\/workers-kv\/\">Cloudflare KV<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/dynamodb\/\">DynamoDB<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rqlite\/rqlite\">rqlite<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/kvdb.io\/\">KVdb<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these fall into one or more of these categories:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Doesn&#8217;t have an HTTP API<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Requires me to jump through lots of hoops to set up<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Requires me to self-host<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Is just overkill for what I want to do<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though some of them have decent free tiers, I still think these don&#8217;t meet the need that I have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also an overriding feeling that these just wouldn&#8217;t work for an everyday person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I try to discuss it, people don&#8217;t seem to quite understand the requirement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let me try to explain what I think I would like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a static-file web application. It&#8217;s just HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to read and write data to a data store using a simple REST API call that takes two parameters: a key name, and a data value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The endpoint should be authenticated for security. The API key or password should be per-user and per-app and should be stored in the browser&#8217;s local storage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The per-user thing is important. This avoids the application having an application key that needs to be kept safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also means that I as the app developer don&#8217;t have to be responsible for user data and privacy. It leaves the user in control of their own data. All I provide is the JavaScript code that moves the data around. The data is either in your browser, or it&#8217;s pushed to a place that you own and control.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From an end-user&#8217;s point of view this is like having your own personal KV store. Like a Dropbox but for data. You connect each app to your datastore&#8217;s account. Or you manually get an API key and save it in the app. Then the app can push and pull the data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside: Yes, I could just connect to Dropbox and save the data as a JSON file. The downside of this is that the JSON files exist in the user&#8217;s Dropbox and can be accessed, which could be dangerous. I could also use <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/icloud\/cloudkit\/\">Apple&#8217;s CloudKit<\/a>, which basically works this way but without showing data to the user. But it needs an Apple account which doesn&#8217;t make for a very cross-platform solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be clear:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>This should be online\/cloud-based with an HTTP API (probably a REST API).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>This should not be a database. I do not expect schemas to be defined. Storing long strings is totally fine.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>This should not be self-hosted &#8211; perhaps that could be an option if people want it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Everything should be as simple as possible: auth, API calls, data structures.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These static apps work by reading text files over HTTP. I want this system to be as simple as possible. Reading the data can be reading a static file using HTTP (with user identification and auth!). Writing the data should be as simple as that too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s <em>really <\/em>simple to make a service like this. I could build one in Laravel in probably about half an hour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my guess is that this doesn&#8217;t exist because:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s hard to market it. It&#8217;s difficult to explain to end-users exactly what this is. And that limits the audience.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nothing that writes data on the web is easy. You need to consider authentication, privacy, security, spam, misuse, scaling, backups, legal stuff. So there isn&#8217;t enough value here to become a service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Scaling up my ambitions: What if this was actually a web standard? A protocol for simple read\/write of key\/value data from web pages. One where users could choose a provider and connect web apps by providing an endpoint URL and a password &#8211; or using some oAuth-like system. Where users control their data, and can export\/migrate their data to another platform. Like the Fediverse but for data?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know this is a pipe dream. Something with little value. Something just for little indie devs like me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I love the idea of these simple, applications running in the browser. And if there was some simple way to save data perhaps making things like this would be more popular? And for end-users, signing up to try a new app wouldn&#8217;t come with all the give-us-your-email-address-and-sign-your-life-away stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember when I first encountered an app like this. It was Gaya Kessler&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/usethyme.com\/\">Thyme<\/a>&#8221; time-tracker. And I was stunned that I could use it by just clicking a button. No sign up. No login. Just start using it. I was surprising. Delightful. And, at the time, disconcerting. How was this storing my data? But once I understood, I immediately knew more applications should be like this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think? Am I missing something? Does this exist? Is it actually pointless? Should I accept that I&#8217;m the only person in the world that wants this and just sign up for Supabase?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>Regular readers will know about <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2023\/08\/free-websites-for-side-projects\/\">my love of simple, static-hosted, web-based apps<\/a> that are easy to build and maintain, and free to host. But they are held back by the lack of dynamic data. Sure, you can store data in local storage, but what if you want to share data between browsers? Is there a way to do that that is simple and ultra-low-cost for side-projects that I let the world use for free?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A simple solution is fine. I don&#8217;t plan using this for large volumes of data. So is there some kind of key-value (KV) store I can put a JSON blob in using a simple REST API that is somehow secure?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned this on social media a couple of times. I get responses suggesting tools. The responses I get are good, but they are things like <a href=\"https:\/\/fauna.com\/\">Fauna<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/redis.io\/\">Redis<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/supabase.com\/\">Supabase<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudflare.com\/en-gb\/developer-platform\/workers-kv\/\">Cloudflare KV<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/dynamodb\/\">DynamoDB<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rqlite\/rqlite\">rqlite<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/kvdb.io\/\">KVdb<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these fall into one or more of these categories:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Doesn&#8217;t have an HTTP API<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Requires me to jump through lots of hoops to set up<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Requires me to self-host<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Is just overkill for what I want to do<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though some of them have decent free tiers, I still think these don&#8217;t meet the need that I have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also an overriding feeling that these just wouldn&#8217;t work for an everyday person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I try to discuss it, people don&#8217;t seem to quite understand the requirement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let me try to explain what I think I would like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a static-file web application. It&#8217;s just HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to read and write data to a data store using a simple REST API call that takes two parameters: a key name, and a data value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The endpoint should be authenticated for security. The API key or password should be per-user and per-app and should be stored in the browser&#8217;s local storage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The per-user thing is important. This avoids the application having an application key that needs to be kept safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also means that I as the app developer don&#8217;t have to be responsible for user data and privacy. It leaves the user in control of their own data. All I provide is the JavaScript code that moves the data around. The data is either in your browser, or it&#8217;s pushed to a place that you own and control.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From an end-user&#8217;s point of view this is like having your own personal KV store. Like a Dropbox but for data. You connect each app to your datastore&#8217;s account. Or you manually get an API key and save it in the app. Then the app can push and pull the data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside: Yes, I could just connect to Dropbox and save the data as a JSON file. The downside of this is that the JSON files exist in the user&#8217;s Dropbox and can be accessed, which could be dangerous. I could also use <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/icloud\/cloudkit\/\">Apple&#8217;s CloudKit<\/a>, which basically works this way but without showing data to the user. But it needs an Apple account which doesn&#8217;t make for a very cross-platform solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be clear:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>This should be online\/cloud-based with an HTTP API (probably a REST API).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>This should not be a database. I do not expect schemas to be defined. Storing long strings is totally fine.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>This should not be self-hosted &#8211; perhaps that could be an option if people want it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Everything should be as simple as possible: auth, API calls, data structures.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These static apps work by reading text files over HTTP. I want this system to be as simple as possible. Reading the data can be reading a static file using HTTP (with user identification and auth!). Writing the data should be as simple as that too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s <em>really <\/em>simple to make a service like this. I could build one in Laravel in probably about half an hour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my guess is that this doesn&#8217;t exist because:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s hard to market it. It&#8217;s difficult to explain to end-users exactly what this is. And that limits the audience.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nothing that writes data on the web is easy. You need to consider authentication, privacy, security, spam, misuse, scaling, backups, legal stuff. So there isn&#8217;t enough value here to become a service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Scaling up my ambitions: What if this was actually a web standard? A protocol for simple read\/write of key\/value data from web pages. One where users could choose a provider and connect web apps by providing an endpoint URL and a password &#8211; or using some oAuth-like system. Where users control their data, and can export\/migrate their data to another platform. Like the Fediverse but for data?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know this is a pipe dream. Something with little value. Something just for little indie devs like me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I love the idea of these simple, applications running in the browser. And if there was some simple way to save data perhaps making things like this would be more popular? And for end-users, signing up to try a new app wouldn&#8217;t come with all the give-us-your-email-address-and-sign-your-life-away stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember when I first encountered an app like this. It was Gaya Kessler&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/usethyme.com\/\">Thyme<\/a>&#8221; time-tracker. And I was stunned that I could use it by just clicking a button. No sign up. No login. Just start using it. I was surprising. Delightful. And, at the time, disconcerting. How was this storing my data? But once I understood, I immediately knew more applications should be like this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think? Am I missing something? Does this exist? Is it actually pointless? Should I accept that I&#8217;m the only person in the world that wants this and just sign up for Supabase?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> <\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p><em>I&#8217;m having a lot of fun building small, static web apps. And there are certain principles I&#8217;m trying to stick to as I do it. Let&#8217;s see what they are&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a manifesto anyway?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I started writing this, I asked myself: &#8220;Is this actually a manifesto? What is a manifesto?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the definition is actually helpful: &#8220;<em>a written declaration of the intentions, motives, or views <strong>of the issuer<\/strong><\/em>&#8220;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what I want to make clear is that these are <em>my<\/em> intentions. Sure, you may find them helpful. Or you may disagree with them entirely. That&#8217;s fine. They aren&#8217;t yours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m writing them down because I think they are an interesting way to look at software for the web. And a useful set of constraints for what I am trying to do. You may want to adopt some or all of them for your own projects. But I&#8217;m not demanding anyone does. You can take or leave them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Manifesto<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a summary of the articles, I shall talk more about each below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Static first\/only<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>No login<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Don&#8217;t store user data<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use the smallest JS library possible<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use web standards as much as possible<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use simple build steps that won&#8217;t break<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u201cDone\u201d is a goal<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Zero-maintenance (and easy maintenance) is a goal<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Don\u2019t minify<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Be accessible<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Static first\/only<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My goal when building these web apps is to see what I can do with static files only. I&#8217;m <em>very<\/em> curious about how far you can take static-only apps. It makes hosting trivial and mostly free. It makes apps fast. And it&#8217;s a <em>really<\/em> interesting constraint to work within.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases there will be a large benefit in having a database or something else that is more dynamic. In these cases I will try to build &#8220;static first&#8221;. My <a href=\"https:\/\/notes.veryuseful.app\/\">notes app<\/a> is a good example of this: it works fine writing to local files. But there is a large benefit in having notes available across multiple browsers. So <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/02\/static-databases-for-static-sites-possible\/\">I&#8217;m thinking about ways to achieve that<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In these cases I&#8217;m hoping that the app will be &#8220;static first&#8221;. It will work without some additional &#8220;cloud&#8221; stuff as an optional enhancement. But first it will be a static app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. No login<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I mentioned this in <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/02\/static-databases-for-static-sites-possible\/\">my last post<\/a>, but the first time I came across an app that worked using the browser&#8217;s local storage (Gaya Kessler&#8217;s time tracker, &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/usethyme.com\/\">Thyme<\/a>&#8220;) and had no login it was so surprising and delightful. I can just use this tool, without registering and handing over an email address? I just click a button and works?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want my helpful little apps to be like this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Don&#8217;t store user data<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By this I mean, don&#8217;t store data on behalf of the user. Find ways to let the user store their own data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This frees you from privacy policies and rules. It helps with the &#8220;No login&#8221; goal. It helps with the &#8220;Static first&#8221; goal. And yes, it&#8217;s a constraint\/limitation. But it&#8217;s part of the challenge: how can you implement your tool in a way that doesn&#8217;t need you to store data?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/02\/static-databases-for-static-sites-possible\/\">my previous post<\/a> explores this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Use the smallest JS library possible<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually fail at this as I normally use <a href=\"https:\/\/alpinejs.dev\/\">AlpineJS<\/a>, which I realised recently has steadily grown to about 43kB. I almost certainly don&#8217;t need 40+kB of JS to do most of what I want to do. It&#8217;s super helpful as a reactive JS library. But <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/vuejs\/petite-vue\">Petite Vue<\/a> clocks in at 6kB. <a href=\"https:\/\/preactjs.com\/\">Preact<\/a> is 3kB. And Alpine v2 was 24kB. So it&#8217;s feeling a little bloated (sorry, Caleb!).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I want to reduce this, so having this as a goal will encourage me to look around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Use web standards as much as possible<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Web browsers have <em>so<\/em> much built-in stuff now. And these web apps should assume up-to-date browsers with modern features. This helps achieve simple build steps and fewer dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Use simple build steps that won&#8217;t break<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to make maintenance easy, build steps should be simple and robust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do currently use TailwindCSS, but I consider that robust and it has few dependencies. Its not breaking every year and as the output is static I consider it acceptable as a tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, my other build steps are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>build.sh<\/code> &#8211; a project-specific shell script that performs whatever other steps are needed to build the site. It&#8217;s a shell script, so it runs everywhere and should have a long lifespan<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>while true; do .\/build.sh; sleep 5; done;<\/code> &#8211; this is fine as a &#8220;watch&#8221; script. It doesn&#8217;t hot-reload, it doesn&#8217;t auto-refresh. But that&#8217;s fine. I accept needing to manually reload a page as acceptable. It&#8217;s zero-dependency and is unlikely to break. That&#8217;s more important.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure there are better ways. But these work and meet my needs without compromising the other goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. \u201cDone\u201d is a goal<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I hear so much about software never being finished. But I think, these little apps <em>can<\/em> and <em>should<\/em> be finished. They should reach a state where they are complete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pattern of startups is so familiar. Build something simple; gain excited users; realise you need to compete and grow; add more features; pivot to different features; add more features; either a) run out of money and shut down or b) get acquired, monetise and become crap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole idea of my little apps is that they can be built quickly to do a simple job, and shared easily and cheaply on the internet for everyone to use. They don&#8217;t need to grow or be sold. They don&#8217;t even need to make money &#8211; I put <a href=\"https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/magicroundabout\/\">a ko-fi link<\/a> on some of mine, or link to something else I make or sell, but that&#8217;s 100% optional. The joy is in the making and sharing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think these tools can be complete. By being static, not having logins, using web standards and minimal libraries, they should be good for a long time!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Zero-maintenance (and easy maintenance) is a goal<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Related to &#8220;Done&#8221; being a goal is that zero-maintenance is also a goal. It won&#8217;t actually be zero. But in making things be &#8220;done&#8221;, in referencing minimal libraries and in not storing user logins and data, it should be able to be close to zero. Using simple build steps ensures that returning to a project to do maintenance is also easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Don\u2019t minify<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I want these tools to be educational. If nothing else I want others to see I want people to be able to inspect the source. They will use minimal JavaScript, and that will be compressed in transit by the CDN. So I&#8217;m not concerned about performance. Readability is more important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, while I know about source maps, I think &#8220;don&#8217;t minify&#8221; is a good goal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Be accessible<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been bad at this but it needs to be a part.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web <em>apps<\/em> are harder to do accessibility for than web <em>sites<\/em> as they are more interactive. I need to learn more in this area and these little projects are an excuse to do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I confess, I have neglected it, and I really want the things I make to be accessible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other goals, such as using web standards, should make accessibility easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This should not be neglected. It should be a priority, both for my own learning, and it&#8217;s the right thing to do for my little tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summary thoughts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I wrote this all out and explained it, it was amazing how all of these goals interlink with each other. This is why I&#8217;m excited about the approach. Joining all these things up enables a whole new way of thinking about building stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to build and publish a finished thing that works and does something useful but that requires no (or very little) future involvement from me is really exciting. It&#8217;s freeing. It opens up my geeky creativity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many ways this manifesto is massively constraining. But in other ways it makes doing fun web-stuff possible again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguably this is my own &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jamstack\">Jamstack<\/a>&#8220;, and I&#8217;m about twelve years later than everyone else to it. I&#8217;m fine with that. Jamstack also had APIs at its core and this frequently meant having a node.js back-end, which is, well, just not my jam (yes pun intended).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope this inspires you in some way.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>I&#8217;m having a lot of fun building small, static web apps. And there are certain principles I&#8217;m trying to stick to as I do it. Let&#8217;s see what they are&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a manifesto anyway?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I started writing this, I asked myself: &#8220;Is this actually a manifesto? What is a manifesto?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the definition is actually helpful: &#8220;<em>a written declaration of the intentions, motives, or views <strong>of the issuer<\/strong><\/em>&#8220;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what I want to make clear is that these are <em>my<\/em> intentions. Sure, you may find them helpful. Or you may disagree with them entirely. That&#8217;s fine. They aren&#8217;t yours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m writing them down because I think they are an interesting way to look at software for the web. And a useful set of constraints for what I am trying to do. You may want to adopt some or all of them for your own projects. But I&#8217;m not demanding anyone does. You can take or leave them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Manifesto<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a summary of the articles, I shall talk more about each below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Static first\/only<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>No login<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Don&#8217;t store user data<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use the smallest JS library possible<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use web standards as much as possible<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use simple build steps that won&#8217;t break<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u201cDone\u201d is a goal<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Zero-maintenance (and easy maintenance) is a goal<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Don\u2019t minify<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Be accessible<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Static first\/only<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My goal when building these web apps is to see what I can do with static files only. I&#8217;m <em>very<\/em> curious about how far you can take static-only apps. It makes hosting trivial and mostly free. It makes apps fast. And it&#8217;s a <em>really<\/em> interesting constraint to work within.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases there will be a large benefit in having a database or something else that is more dynamic. In these cases I will try to build &#8220;static first&#8221;. My <a href=\"https:\/\/notes.veryuseful.app\/\">notes app<\/a> is a good example of this: it works fine writing to local files. But there is a large benefit in having notes available across multiple browsers. So <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/02\/static-databases-for-static-sites-possible\/\">I&#8217;m thinking about ways to achieve that<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In these cases I&#8217;m hoping that the app will be &#8220;static first&#8221;. It will work without some additional &#8220;cloud&#8221; stuff as an optional enhancement. But first it will be a static app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. No login<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I mentioned this in <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/02\/static-databases-for-static-sites-possible\/\">my last post<\/a>, but the first time I came across an app that worked using the browser&#8217;s local storage (Gaya Kessler&#8217;s time tracker, &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/usethyme.com\/\">Thyme<\/a>&#8220;) and had no login it was so surprising and delightful. I can just use this tool, without registering and handing over an email address? I just click a button and works?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want my helpful little apps to be like this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Don&#8217;t store user data<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By this I mean, don&#8217;t store data on behalf of the user. Find ways to let the user store their own data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This frees you from privacy policies and rules. It helps with the &#8220;No login&#8221; goal. It helps with the &#8220;Static first&#8221; goal. And yes, it&#8217;s a constraint\/limitation. But it&#8217;s part of the challenge: how can you implement your tool in a way that doesn&#8217;t need you to store data?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2024\/02\/static-databases-for-static-sites-possible\/\">my previous post<\/a> explores this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Use the smallest JS library possible<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually fail at this as I normally use <a href=\"https:\/\/alpinejs.dev\/\">AlpineJS<\/a>, which I realised recently has steadily grown to about 43kB. I almost certainly don&#8217;t need 40+kB of JS to do most of what I want to do. It&#8217;s super helpful as a reactive JS library. But <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/vuejs\/petite-vue\">Petite Vue<\/a> clocks in at 6kB. <a href=\"https:\/\/preactjs.com\/\">Preact<\/a> is 3kB. And Alpine v2 was 24kB. So it&#8217;s feeling a little bloated (sorry, Caleb!).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I want to reduce this, so having this as a goal will encourage me to look around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Use web standards as much as possible<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Web browsers have <em>so<\/em> much built-in stuff now. And these web apps should assume up-to-date browsers with modern features. This helps achieve simple build steps and fewer dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Use simple build steps that won&#8217;t break<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to make maintenance easy, build steps should be simple and robust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do currently use TailwindCSS, but I consider that robust and it has few dependencies. Its not breaking every year and as the output is static I consider it acceptable as a tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, my other build steps are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>build.sh<\/code> &#8211; a project-specific shell script that performs whatever other steps are needed to build the site. It&#8217;s a shell script, so it runs everywhere and should have a long lifespan<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>while true; do .\/build.sh; sleep 5; done;<\/code> &#8211; this is fine as a &#8220;watch&#8221; script. It doesn&#8217;t hot-reload, it doesn&#8217;t auto-refresh. But that&#8217;s fine. I accept needing to manually reload a page as acceptable. It&#8217;s zero-dependency and is unlikely to break. That&#8217;s more important.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure there are better ways. But these work and meet my needs without compromising the other goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. \u201cDone\u201d is a goal<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I hear so much about software never being finished. But I think, these little apps <em>can<\/em> and <em>should<\/em> be finished. They should reach a state where they are complete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pattern of startups is so familiar. Build something simple; gain excited users; realise you need to compete and grow; add more features; pivot to different features; add more features; either a) run out of money and shut down or b) get acquired, monetise and become crap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole idea of my little apps is that they can be built quickly to do a simple job, and shared easily and cheaply on the internet for everyone to use. They don&#8217;t need to grow or be sold. They don&#8217;t even need to make money &#8211; I put <a href=\"https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/magicroundabout\/\">a ko-fi link<\/a> on some of mine, or link to something else I make or sell, but that&#8217;s 100% optional. The joy is in the making and sharing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think these tools can be complete. By being static, not having logins, using web standards and minimal libraries, they should be good for a long time!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Zero-maintenance (and easy maintenance) is a goal<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Related to &#8220;Done&#8221; being a goal is that zero-maintenance is also a goal. It won&#8217;t actually be zero. But in making things be &#8220;done&#8221;, in referencing minimal libraries and in not storing user logins and data, it should be able to be close to zero. Using simple build steps ensures that returning to a project to do maintenance is also easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Don\u2019t minify<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I want these tools to be educational. If nothing else I want others to see I want people to be able to inspect the source. They will use minimal JavaScript, and that will be compressed in transit by the CDN. So I&#8217;m not concerned about performance. Readability is more important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, while I know about source maps, I think &#8220;don&#8217;t minify&#8221; is a good goal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Be accessible<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been bad at this but it needs to be a part.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web <em>apps<\/em> are harder to do accessibility for than web <em>sites<\/em> as they are more interactive. I need to learn more in this area and these little projects are an excuse to do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I confess, I have neglected it, and I really want the things I make to be accessible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other goals, such as using web standards, should make accessibility easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This should not be neglected. It should be a priority, both for my own learning, and it&#8217;s the right thing to do for my little tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summary thoughts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I wrote this all out and explained it, it was amazing how all of these goals interlink with each other. This is why I&#8217;m excited about the approach. Joining all these things up enables a whole new way of thinking about building stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to build and publish a finished thing that works and does something useful but that requires no (or very little) future involvement from me is really exciting. It&#8217;s freeing. It opens up my geeky creativity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many ways this manifesto is massively constraining. But in other ways it makes doing fun web-stuff possible again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguably this is my own &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jamstack\">Jamstack<\/a>&#8220;, and I&#8217;m about twelve years later than everyone else to it. I&#8217;m fine with that. Jamstack also had APIs at its core and this frequently meant having a node.js back-end, which is, well, just not my jam (yes pun intended).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope this inspires you in some way.<\/p>\n",
