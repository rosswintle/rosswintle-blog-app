We always enjoy live music, but finding bands\/artists we like at venues we like on dates that we&#8217;re free, and at prices we like is always difficult.<\/p>\n<p>However &#8211; despite our picky-ness we made it to the following recently (nicely matching with some recent CD purschases!)<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">KT Tunstall at Colston Hall, Bristol<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now&#8230;one of the games we played when we lived in Shepherd&#8217;s Bush was guessing who was playing at the Empire (a popular music venue just round the corner from where we lived) from the people who were queueing up\/milling around.  e.g. Jack Johnson gigs have lots of normally-dressed, but pretty stoned, surfer and indie types; The Beautiful South had lots of middle-aged, middle-of-the-road-looking people queueing outside.<\/p>\n<p>For some reason, I was very self-concious at this KT gig.  Though the crowd was a real mix, I felt slightly too young, slightly too normal, slightly too 90&#8217;s indie.  Yet, I think if I was playing the &#8220;who&#8217;s on at the Colston Hall&#8221; game, I&#8217;d have picked me out as a MOR soft-rocker type along with everyone else.  And I didn&#8217;t like that.  Part of me is embarrassed that I went.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;I don&#8217;t really care.  The gig was GREAT!  KT is a great entertainer, with lots of crowd-pleasing banter.  She&#8217;s confident and charming, but a bit kooky.  She&#8217;s incredibly cool, and very talented, but comes across as homely and clumsy.  Her mum and dad were in the audience and she even forgot the words to one song called &#8220;Hopeless&#8221;, which, ironically, is about being just that!<\/p>\n<p>The band were awesome and KT certainly doesn&#8217;t stand alone, with a bassist, guitarist, keyboards\/random sounds guy, a brilliant percussionist (I&#8217;m not calling him a drummer because he played far more than just drums), and two backing singers, playing, between them all, a HUGE number of different instruments.<\/p>\n<p>The songs were great, and we had fun, and enjoyed a class act.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Martyn Joseph at Marlborough Town Hall<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I was almost certainly too young and too cool to attend this aging, accoustic folk-rockers latest tour, but we love him to bits and we&#8217;ve caught the last 2 tours (and previous gigs too), so I&#8217;ve already lost any credibility I might have had. \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve seen MJ with accompaniment before &#8211; a single keyboard player at a gig at Bush Hall in London.  But this time he had a little band of sorts.  There was a very cool-looking and talented female bassist playing double bass and both fretted and fretless electric bass &#8211; not all at the same time of course.  And a very un-cool-looking but equally talented wind-instrument guy, playing tenor sax, clarinet and&#8230;yes really&#8230;the recorder!<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t say much about MJ.  He was on good form and the new songs, which have grown on me more since my album review, sound great live.  Though I prefer &#8220;Kindness&#8221; unaccompanied&#8230;it has a certain kind of emotion and tension when it&#8217;s just the accoustic guitar&#8230;it&#8217;s longing for more sound around it&#8230;&#8221;how I miss you\/my angel and my reason how I miss you&#8221;.  (Though I&#8217;m just listening to it again and there&#8217;s a hint of piano and electric guitar on the album version&#8230;so I&#8217;m wrong there.  I do prefer the album version though).<\/p>\n<p>What did amaze me at this gig was the teamwork, humility and restraint of the musicians.  The wind-instrument guy hardly played at all.  He only chipped in when it was needed.  He didn&#8217;t, pardon the pun, blow his own trumpet.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a great metaphor in here for how we should live our lives.  Quietly working in the background, not demanding attention, playing along to the tune of our creator, but remembering always that it&#8217;s His work.  He&#8217;s the lead, we follow, we play, and if we demand too much attention that will detract from His glory!<\/p>\n<p>Music is a great gift and I left both gigs thankful for the talented people who write and play these songs to bring us pleasure.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>We&#8217;ve had the good fortune of seeing a couple of gigs lately.  We always enjoy live music, but finding bands\/artists we like at venues we like on dates that we&#8217;re free, and at prices we like is always difficult.<\/p>\n<p>However &#8211; despite our picky-ness we made it to the following recently (nicely matching with some recent CD purschases!)<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">KT Tunstall at Colston Hall, Bristol<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now&#8230;one of the games we played when we lived in Shepherd&#8217;s Bush was guessing who was playing at the Empire (a popular music venue just round the corner from where we lived) from the people who were queueing up\/milling around.  e.g. Jack Johnson gigs have lots of normally-dressed, but pretty stoned, surfer and indie types; The Beautiful South had lots of middle-aged, middle-of-the-road-looking people queueing outside.<\/p>\n<p>For some reason, I was very self-concious at this KT gig.  Though the crowd was a real mix, I felt slightly too young, slightly too normal, slightly too 90&#8217;s indie.  Yet, I think if I was playing the &#8220;who&#8217;s on at the Colston Hall&#8221; game, I&#8217;d have picked me out as a MOR soft-rocker type along with everyone else.  And I didn&#8217;t like that.  Part of me is embarrassed that I went.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;I don&#8217;t really care.  The gig was GREAT!  KT is a great entertainer, with lots of crowd-pleasing banter.  She&#8217;s confident and charming, but a bit kooky.  She&#8217;s incredibly cool, and very talented, but comes across as homely and clumsy.  Her mum and dad were in the audience and she even forgot the words to one song called &#8220;Hopeless&#8221;, which, ironically, is about being just that!<\/p>\n<p>The band were awesome and KT certainly doesn&#8217;t stand alone, with a bassist, guitarist, keyboards\/random sounds guy, a brilliant percussionist (I&#8217;m not calling him a drummer because he played far more than just drums), and two backing singers, playing, between them all, a HUGE number of different instruments.<\/p>\n<p>The songs were great, and we had fun, and enjoyed a class act.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Martyn Joseph at Marlborough Town Hall<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I was almost certainly too young and too cool to attend this aging, accoustic folk-rockers latest tour, but we love him to bits and we&#8217;ve caught the last 2 tours (and previous gigs too), so I&#8217;ve already lost any credibility I might have had. \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve seen MJ with accompaniment before &#8211; a single keyboard player at a gig at Bush Hall in London.  But this time he had a little band of sorts.  There was a very cool-looking and talented female bassist playing double bass and both fretted and fretless electric bass &#8211; not all at the same time of course.  And a very un-cool-looking but equally talented wind-instrument guy, playing tenor sax, clarinet and&#8230;yes really&#8230;the recorder!<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t say much about MJ.  He was on good form and the new songs, which have grown on me more since my album review, sound great live.  Though I prefer &#8220;Kindness&#8221; unaccompanied&#8230;it has a certain kind of emotion and tension when it&#8217;s just the accoustic guitar&#8230;it&#8217;s longing for more sound around it&#8230;&#8221;how I miss you\/my angel and my reason how I miss you&#8221;.  (Though I&#8217;m just listening to it again and there&#8217;s a hint of piano and electric guitar on the album version&#8230;so I&#8217;m wrong there.  I do prefer the album version though).<\/p>\n<p>What did amaze me at this gig was the teamwork, humility and restraint of the musicians.  The wind-instrument guy hardly played at all.  He only chipped in when it was needed.  He didn&#8217;t, pardon the pun, blow his own trumpet.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a great metaphor in here for how we should live our lives.  Quietly working in the background, not demanding attention, playing along to the tune of our creator, but remembering always that it&#8217;s His work.  He&#8217;s the lead, we follow, we play, and if we demand too much attention that will detract from His glory!<\/p>\n<p>Music is a great gift and I left both gigs thankful for the talented people who write and play these songs to bring us pleasure.<\/p>\n",

Marketing &#8211; hahahaha&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Which pretty much sums up my understanding of the topic.<\/p>\n<p>The issue of &#8220;corporate re-blanding&#8221; has been bothering me for a while.  A certain company quite close to my heart has recently scrapped its well-known logo and put in its place the name of the company, written in a bold, sans serif font, in a variety of colours&#8230;which is exactly what a similar company had done a couple of years beforehand.<\/p>\n<p>But why?  Why scrap an image that&#8217;s recognised around the world and replace it with the same thing that everyone else is doing?<\/p>\n<p>Some examples.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Welcome Break<\/span> &#8211; you&#8217;ve all stopped on the motorway services and experienced the wonders of their toilets.  They used to have a nice old fashioned picture of a swan coming in to land above their name.<\/p>\n<p>I never quite got the swan thing.  Presumably swans like a gigantic fried breakfast halfway through their migration or something (do swans migrate?), but it was recognisable and kinda homely&#8230;welcoming.   So what&#8217;s with the new &#8220;logo&#8221;, which basically looks like this&#8230;<\/p>\n<table style=\"width:154px;height:25px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr><\/p>\n<td bgcolor=\"black\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:rgb(0,102,0);vertical-align:middle;font-family:arial;\">WELCOME<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:rgb(255,255,255);vertical-align:middle;font-family:arial;\">BREAK<\/span><\/td>\n<p><\/tr>\n<p><\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>This one particularly irritates me because <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">NOW<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">THEY<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">WRITE<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">EVERYTHING<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">IN<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">BOLD <\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">UPPERCASE<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">SANS-SERIF<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">AND<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">ITS<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">REALLY<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">HARD<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">TO<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">READ<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">AND<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">IT<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">SOUNDS<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">LIKE<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">THEY&#8217;RE <\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">SHOUTING<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">AT<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">YOU<\/span><\/span>.

Yes, they&#8217;re doing it on the high street too!  The old, angular logo was just a name and a magic little ampersand, presented on two lines in a nice shade of green.  But it was a well-recognised name.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/span>However, M&amp;S have actually changed a lot.  They used to be seen as a stuffy old supermarket that only sold its own brand food to old people, but for many that view has changed.  Their new logo is modern and reflects that change but I&#8217;m still left wondering if they could have come up with something more unique than their initials in a curvy black and greeny-yellow&#8230;this is not just any logo, it&#8217;s a smooth, sophisticated, trips-off-your tongue logo&#8230;my cheap imitation is simply something like:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-size:180%;\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana;\">M<span style=\"color:rgb(51,153,153);\">&amp;<\/span>S<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/span>The Co-op.  Possibly another story of a stuffy old shop modernising &#8211; the old logo&#8217;s loopy, lowercase, blue letters laid out in a square formation, firmly reminding me of shopping with my granny.  Like M&amp;S I like what the Co-operative are doing but surely they&#8217;re just jumping on a bandwagon with the new look&#8230;which isn&#8217;t far off something like&#8230;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,153);font-size:180%;\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana;\">The<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:arial;\">co-operative<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<p>Even charities are at it&#8230;internation Christian development agency, Tearfund, had their name in two fonts &#8211; with and without serifs, two colours &#8211; deep green and clean white, two weights &#8211; normal and bold, with a nice dandelion head in an orange box next to it.  But even charities modernise and we now have nothing more than&#8230;<\/p>\n<table style=\"width:81px;height:57px;\" bgcolor=\"#339999\">\n<tbody>\n<tr><\/p>\n<td>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:180%;\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana;color:white;\">tearfund<\/span><br \/><\/span><\/td>\n<p><\/tr>\n<p><\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>(I should point out that the &#8220;t&#8221; should be cross-shaped with no curly bottom.  This is probably important, but I don&#8217;t have a standard font that looks like that!)<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a silly thing to have a rant about but what bugs me is that all the skill and creativity seems to have gone from marketing.  Let&#8217;s just take a company name, optionally abbreviate it in some way, pick a modern typeface, and choose a couple of colours.  Anyone could do it?  Couldn&#8217;t they?<br \/>If I had the time I could write a computer program to randomly re-brand company names in this way.  And people get paid a fortune to do it?<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;to any marketing people out there&#8230;what&#8217;s stopping me?<\/p>\n<p>Alien 1: Here, buy this<br \/>Alien 2: I already have this<br \/>Alien 1: &#8220;Marketing&#8221;<br \/>Alien 2: Okay then, I&#8217;ll buy it<br \/>Alien 1: I have laughed so hard I have accidentally passed what passes for alien wee-wee<br \/>Alien 2: Put it in a bottle, you could sell it to the humans<br \/>Both: hahahahaha<\/p>\n",

A certain company quite close to my heart has recently scrapped its well-known logo and put in its place the name of the company, written in a bold, sans serif font, in a variety of colours&#8230;which is exactly what a similar company had done a couple of years beforehand.<\/p>\n<p>But why?  Why scrap an image that&#8217;s recognised around the world and replace it with the same thing that everyone else is doing?<\/p>\n<p>Some examples.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Welcome Break<\/span> &#8211; you&#8217;ve all stopped on the motorway services and experienced the wonders of their toilets.  They used to have a nice old fashioned picture of a swan coming in to land above their name.<\/p>\n<p>I never quite got the swan thing.  Presumably swans like a gigantic fried breakfast halfway through their migration or something (do swans migrate?), but it was recognisable and kinda homely&#8230;welcoming.   So what&#8217;s with the new &#8220;logo&#8221;, which basically looks like this&#8230;<\/p>\n<table style=\"width:154px;height:25px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr><\/p>\n<td bgcolor=\"black\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:rgb(0,102,0);vertical-align:middle;font-family:arial;\">WELCOME<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:rgb(255,255,255);vertical-align:middle;font-family:arial;\">BREAK<\/span><\/td>\n<p><\/tr>\n<p><\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>This one particularly irritates me because <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:arial;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">NOW<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">THEY<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">WRITE<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">EVERYTHING<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">IN<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">BOLD <\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">UPPERCASE<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">SANS-SERIF<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">AND<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">ITS<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">REALLY<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">HARD<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">TO<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">READ<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">AND<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">IT<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">SOUNDS<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">LIKE<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">THEY&#8217;RE <\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">SHOUTING<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,102,0);\">AT<\/span><span style=\"color:rgb(204,102,204);\">YOU<\/span><\/span>.

Yes, they&#8217;re doing it on the high street too!  The old, angular logo was just a name and a magic little ampersand, presented on two lines in a nice shade of green.  But it was a well-recognised name.<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/span>However, M&amp;S have actually changed a lot.  They used to be seen as a stuffy old supermarket that only sold its own brand food to old people, but for many that view has changed.  Their new logo is modern and reflects that change but I&#8217;m still left wondering if they could have come up with something more unique than their initials in a curvy black and greeny-yellow&#8230;this is not just any logo, it&#8217;s a smooth, sophisticated, trips-off-your tongue logo&#8230;my cheap imitation is simply something like:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-size:180%;\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana;\">M<span style=\"color:rgb(51,153,153);\">&amp;<\/span>S<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/span>The Co-op.  Possibly another story of a stuffy old shop modernising &#8211; the old logo&#8217;s loopy, lowercase, blue letters laid out in a square formation, firmly reminding me of shopping with my granny.  Like M&amp;S I like what the Co-operative are doing but surely they&#8217;re just jumping on a bandwagon with the new look&#8230;which isn&#8217;t far off something like&#8230;<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,153);font-size:180%;\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana;\">The<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:arial;\">co-operative<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<p>Even charities are at it&#8230;internation Christian development agency, Tearfund, had their name in two fonts &#8211; with and without serifs, two colours &#8211; deep green and clean white, two weights &#8211; normal and bold, with a nice dandelion head in an orange box next to it.  But even charities modernise and we now have nothing more than&#8230;<\/p>\n<table style=\"width:81px;height:57px;\" bgcolor=\"#339999\">\n<tbody>\n<tr><\/p>\n<td>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:180%;\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana;color:white;\">tearfund<\/span><br \/><\/span><\/td>\n<p><\/tr>\n<p><\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>(I should point out that the &#8220;t&#8221; should be cross-shaped with no curly bottom.  This is probably important, but I don&#8217;t have a standard font that looks like that!)<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a silly thing to have a rant about but what bugs me is that all the skill and creativity seems to have gone from marketing.  Let&#8217;s just take a company name, optionally abbreviate it in some way, pick a modern typeface, and choose a couple of colours.  Anyone could do it?  Couldn&#8217;t they?<br \/>If I had the time I could write a computer program to randomly re-brand company names in this way.  And people get paid a fortune to do it?<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;to any marketing people out there&#8230;what&#8217;s stopping me?<\/p>\n<p>Alien 1: Here, buy this<br \/>Alien 2: I already have this<br \/>Alien 1: &#8220;Marketing&#8221;<br \/>Alien 2: Okay then, I&#8217;ll buy it<br \/>Alien 1: I have laughed so hard I have accidentally passed what passes for alien wee-wee<br \/>Alien 2: Put it in a bottle, you could sell it to the humans<br \/>Both: hahahahaha<\/p>\n",

Well mostly because I totally overloaded the weight on one of my wheels and broke four of the spokes.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;ve heard that wheel building, and spoke replacement are pretty difficult to get right and it&#8217;s easy to end up with a very wobbly wheel.  But, with a bit of effort and a lot of fiddling, I managed to do this myself.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 2<\/span>: Don&#8217;t be scared of people in bike shops.  If you explain that you&#8217;re trying to fix something yourself they&#8217;re quite helpful.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 3<\/span>: Replacing spokes isn&#8217;t as hard as everyone makes it out to be.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 4<\/span>: When replacing multiple spokes do some serious preparation working out the spoke pattern.  This will save you much time later on!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">My first flat<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Pretty chuffed with my wheel work, I started the ride to work an back again.  I&#8217;ve been playing with different routes at weekend with the aim of extending my rides to make them into longer training rides.<\/p>\n<p>On the first extended ride home, I must sadly report that I got my first puncture.  Yes, after just over a year and about 1300 miles, I finally got my first flat!<\/p>\n<p>I had a pump with me, but my multi-tool, patches and spare tube were in my seat pack&#8230;at home.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 5<\/span>: It doesn&#8217;t matter if your ride is short and not straying too far from home.  It&#8217;s ALWAYS worth putting your seat-pack-full-of-tools on.<\/p>\n<p>I swallowed my pride and phoned home for a lift.  Sally was most gracious and drove out to pick me, and my poor wheels, up.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 6<\/span>: My hybrid with fully-loaded paniers is pretty heavy and carrying it any distance is hard work.  When calling for roadside assistance be sure to get the person to drive to where you are, not to a point several hundred metres away up a hill!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Replacing Tyres<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>As I repaired the flat, I realised that my tyres were starting to look pretty worn.  So they&#8217;ve been replaced now too.  I still feel like the back wheel is a bit lumpy.  It looks straight and true and, if anything, the bulge\/wobble that I used to have in my tyre is gone.  So it should be better!  But it just feels not-quite-right when I do any speed in a straight line.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the, erm, well, a the bit of the bike that holds attaches the handlebar to the frame, is loose.  It&#8217;s occasionally worked it way loose before but a good strong turn of an allen key has sorted it out.  Sadly, this time, the hexagonal hole that you put the allen key into is wearing away and I can&#8217;t get enough force onto it to get it tight without it slipping.  It might be a bike shop job now.<\/p>\n<p>So in general my poor old machine is suffering a bit.  I try to look after it but I guess 1300 miles is quite a lot for a cheap little Raleigh.  Poor thing.<\/p>\n",

Well mostly because I totally overloaded the weight on one of my wheels and broke four of the spokes.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;ve heard that wheel building, and spoke replacement are pretty difficult to get right and it&#8217;s easy to end up with a very wobbly wheel.  But, with a bit of effort and a lot of fiddling, I managed to do this myself.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 2<\/span>: Don&#8217;t be scared of people in bike shops.  If you explain that you&#8217;re trying to fix something yourself they&#8217;re quite helpful.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 3<\/span>: Replacing spokes isn&#8217;t as hard as everyone makes it out to be.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 4<\/span>: When replacing multiple spokes do some serious preparation working out the spoke pattern.  This will save you much time later on!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">My first flat<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Pretty chuffed with my wheel work, I started the ride to work an back again.  I&#8217;ve been playing with different routes at weekend with the aim of extending my rides to make them into longer training rides.<\/p>\n<p>On the first extended ride home, I must sadly report that I got my first puncture.  Yes, after just over a year and about 1300 miles, I finally got my first flat!<\/p>\n<p>I had a pump with me, but my multi-tool, patches and spare tube were in my seat pack&#8230;at home.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 5<\/span>: It doesn&#8217;t matter if your ride is short and not straying too far from home.  It&#8217;s ALWAYS worth putting your seat-pack-full-of-tools on.<\/p>\n<p>I swallowed my pride and phoned home for a lift.  Sally was most gracious and drove out to pick me, and my poor wheels, up.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 6<\/span>: My hybrid with fully-loaded paniers is pretty heavy and carrying it any distance is hard work.  When calling for roadside assistance be sure to get the person to drive to where you are, not to a point several hundred metres away up a hill!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Replacing Tyres<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>As I repaired the flat, I realised that my tyres were starting to look pretty worn.  So they&#8217;ve been replaced now too.  I still feel like the back wheel is a bit lumpy.  It looks straight and true and, if anything, the bulge\/wobble that I used to have in my tyre is gone.  So it should be better!  But it just feels not-quite-right when I do any speed in a straight line.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the, erm, well, a the bit of the bike that holds attaches the handlebar to the frame, is loose.  It&#8217;s occasionally worked it way loose before but a good strong turn of an allen key has sorted it out.  Sadly, this time, the hexagonal hole that you put the allen key into is wearing away and I can&#8217;t get enough force onto it to get it tight without it slipping.  It might be a bike shop job now.<\/p>\n<p>So in general my poor old machine is suffering a bit.  I try to look after it but I guess 1300 miles is quite a lot for a cheap little Raleigh.  Poor thing.<\/p>\n",

Here&#8217;s my excuses for not writing for a month&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Moving House<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Well, the house exchange and completion went through.  We got the keys to our new house on October 5th.  Sally was away for the weekend and I&#8217;d been banned from moving in until she got home, so I got on with the job of cleaning and tidying the old place.  We moved in proper on the Monday.<\/p>\n<p>The house is great but a little rough around the edges.  Lots of bits of DIY\/building that seem to have been finished in a hurry.  But it&#8217;s ours, it has three bedrooms, a huge garden and it&#8217;s in a great location.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, we&#8217;ve had to clean up and get out of the old rented house too.  Phew.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">No Broadband<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Moving house means setting up a new phone line and having our Internet connection set up.  This meant several weeks without Broadband.  Quite a nice experience really.  We get so much more &#8220;real&#8221; stuff done without Google and Facebook and Blogger.  We didn&#8217;t really miss it at all.  Of course, now it&#8217;s back we&#8217;re back in the habit of making good use of our &#8220;always on&#8221; pipe to the universe.<\/p>\n<p>A note about providers&#8230;we were with Zen Internet, who provide excellent service, but at a cost.  Our up-to-8Mb connection was costing \u00a317 per month with a 2GB usage limit.  So after some debate and research we decided to KEEP Sky TV and take Sky Broadband and Sky Talk (phone calls) too.  Much as I dislike having hundreds of TV channels that I never watch.  This appealed because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sky Talk costs nothing and gives free evening and weekend calls.<\/li>\n<li>Sky Broadband is \u00a35 for up-to-8Mb with a 40GB usage limit.<\/li>\n<li>Sky + (Sky&#8217;s hard-disk based TV recording system), now has no monthly subscription cost.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sky+ turns out to be awesome! VERY high quality recorded TV that you set up from the on-screen TV guide.  You just find the programme and tell it to record.  It&#8217;ll record a whole series of the same programme.  And you can pause and rewind live TV too.  I understand how the technology works, and I&#8217;m STILL very impressed.  Good technology, well implemented, is hard to find these days.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Holiday<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We decided, shortly after the house move, to take a week&#8217;s holiday.  My In-Law&#8217;s were off to Spain for a few nights and asked if we wanted to house-sit.  With a free weeks&#8217; holiday on the edge of Dartmoor being offered we couldn&#8217;t really refuse and it turned out to be just what we needed.  We&#8217;ve just got back from this week off and we&#8217;re well relaxed and trying to summon up the mental effort required to get back to work tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>We also popped to London on Friday for a couple of friends of ours who were having an engagement party.  We&#8217;re VERY excited that they&#8217;re getting married and the party was really great.<\/p>\n<p>Returning to London is an odd experience.  We drive in thinking that it&#8217;s horrid, busy, noisy, etc, but after a couple of hours re-uniting with good friends we miss it.  Of course, we&#8217;ve made good friends here in Swindon too, but we&#8217;re really still getting to know people and it&#8217;s not the same as connecting with people that you&#8217;ve known inside-out for many years.  There are things about London as a city that we miss, but mostly it&#8217;s the people.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Finally&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><\/span>So, yes, after all that  we&#8217;re in the new house, broadband is back, and we&#8217;re not on holiday any more.  I probably have some catching up to do.  I keep having &#8220;I must write about that&#8221; moments, but can&#8217;t remember what any of them are now.  If they&#8217;re that important then they&#8217;ll come back to me I&#8217;m sure.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Phew, I&#8217;m finally back in the land of the living.  Where have I been?  Here&#8217;s my excuses for not writing for a month&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Moving House<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Well, the house exchange and completion went through.  We got the keys to our new house on October 5th.  Sally was away for the weekend and I&#8217;d been banned from moving in until she got home, so I got on with the job of cleaning and tidying the old place.  We moved in proper on the Monday.<\/p>\n<p>The house is great but a little rough around the edges.  Lots of bits of DIY\/building that seem to have been finished in a hurry.  But it&#8217;s ours, it has three bedrooms, a huge garden and it&#8217;s in a great location.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, we&#8217;ve had to clean up and get out of the old rented house too.  Phew.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">No Broadband<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Moving house means setting up a new phone line and having our Internet connection set up.  This meant several weeks without Broadband.  Quite a nice experience really.  We get so much more &#8220;real&#8221; stuff done without Google and Facebook and Blogger.  We didn&#8217;t really miss it at all.  Of course, now it&#8217;s back we&#8217;re back in the habit of making good use of our &#8220;always on&#8221; pipe to the universe.<\/p>\n<p>A note about providers&#8230;we were with Zen Internet, who provide excellent service, but at a cost.  Our up-to-8Mb connection was costing \u00a317 per month with a 2GB usage limit.  So after some debate and research we decided to KEEP Sky TV and take Sky Broadband and Sky Talk (phone calls) too.  Much as I dislike having hundreds of TV channels that I never watch.  This appealed because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sky Talk costs nothing and gives free evening and weekend calls.<\/li>\n<li>Sky Broadband is \u00a35 for up-to-8Mb with a 40GB usage limit.<\/li>\n<li>Sky + (Sky&#8217;s hard-disk based TV recording system), now has no monthly subscription cost.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sky+ turns out to be awesome! VERY high quality recorded TV that you set up from the on-screen TV guide.  You just find the programme and tell it to record.  It&#8217;ll record a whole series of the same programme.  And you can pause and rewind live TV too.  I understand how the technology works, and I&#8217;m STILL very impressed.  Good technology, well implemented, is hard to find these days.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Holiday<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We decided, shortly after the house move, to take a week&#8217;s holiday.  My In-Law&#8217;s were off to Spain for a few nights and asked if we wanted to house-sit.  With a free weeks&#8217; holiday on the edge of Dartmoor being offered we couldn&#8217;t really refuse and it turned out to be just what we needed.  We&#8217;ve just got back from this week off and we&#8217;re well relaxed and trying to summon up the mental effort required to get back to work tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>We also popped to London on Friday for a couple of friends of ours who were having an engagement party.  We&#8217;re VERY excited that they&#8217;re getting married and the party was really great.<\/p>\n<p>Returning to London is an odd experience.  We drive in thinking that it&#8217;s horrid, busy, noisy, etc, but after a couple of hours re-uniting with good friends we miss it.  Of course, we&#8217;ve made good friends here in Swindon too, but we&#8217;re really still getting to know people and it&#8217;s not the same as connecting with people that you&#8217;ve known inside-out for many years.  There are things about London as a city that we miss, but mostly it&#8217;s the people.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Finally&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><\/span>So, yes, after all that  we&#8217;re in the new house, broadband is back, and we&#8217;re not on holiday any more.  I probably have some catching up to do.  I keep having &#8220;I must write about that&#8221; moments, but can&#8217;t remember what any of them are now.  If they&#8217;re that important then they&#8217;ll come back to me I&#8217;m sure.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

Sally and I are booked in to see Martyn Joseph and KT Tunstall in the coming months, plus, there was a new Athlete album out that I splashed out on.  Thoughts below:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Drastic Fantsatic &#8211; KT Tunstall<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The catchiest of the new albums, very easy to get into.  KT is a good songwriter, a very accomplished musican and singer, and she&#8217;s intelligent too.  We very much liked the first album and this one didn&#8217;t disappoint as a follow up.<\/p>\n<p>The songs are a variety of styles, there&#8217;s folk, rock and roll, ballads, pop, even a hint of Latin American.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a great album, but I don&#8217;t think it will quite have the lasting appeal of &#8220;Through the Telescope&#8221;.  Enjoying it for the moment though.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vegas &#8211; Martyn Joseph<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is the album about which I&#8217;d like to say the most.  I became a fan of MJ quite recently (probably after the Bush Hall gig&#8230;3 yeas ago?) and missed out on a lot of his older stuff.  But he is one of my favourite musicians.<\/p>\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, he&#8217;s a Welsh folk-rocker who writes about stuff that he really cares about and sings and plays with an enormous amount of passion.<\/p>\n<p>This record is a bit different to some of his other stuff.  MJ himself says something like &#8220;it might even make you smile&#8221;.  And that&#8217;s true &#8211; there&#8217;s a tribute to Elvis and some other nice moments, but he remains gritty, slightly angry, political, and, occasionally melancholy.<\/p>\n<p>I must confess that after a few listens I&#8217;m feeling like the album doesn&#8217;t have much new &#8211; it feels like a union of the last two (&#8220;Whoever it was that brought me here&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;Deep Blue&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>Song-wise examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vegas is a catchy tribute with an easy chorus, in much the same way as &#8220;This Being Woman&#8221;;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Weight of the World&#8221; is a bit like &#8220;This Fragile World&#8221;;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Nobody Loves You Anymore&#8221; is reminiscent of &#8220;Six Sixty Six&#8221; (though I&#8217;ll avoid comparisons of George Bush and the Devil &#8211; that would be going too far);<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;The Fading of Light&#8221; seems to be an updated &#8220;Yet Still This Will Not Be&#8221;;<\/li>\n<li>and &#8220;The things that we have carried here&#8221; is like &#8220;Whoever it was that brought me here&#8230;&#8221; in more than just the length of the song name.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But that shouldn&#8217;t detract from the quality of this album.  MJ&#8217;s consistently good songwriting hasn&#8217;t gone away.  His percussive accoustic guitar playing makes sounds like a single instrument shouldn&#8217;t.  His intricate fingerstyle is beautiful as ever.  And his vocals, though mostly lacking range of pitch, vary from the haunting whispers of &#8220;Kindness&#8221; to the angry growls of &#8220;Nobody Loves You Any More&#8221; .The little flourishes of percussion, harmonica, woodwind, strings, piano, even an electric guitar or two (!) add depth and interest without detracting from the key elements of MJ&#8217;s voice and guitar.<\/p>\n<p>I DO like this album.  A lot.  I will play it over and over.  And the gig in November will be one of the highlights of my year. But I&#8217;d like to see him writing about something a bit different next time&#8230;perhaps a few elections, on both sides of the pond, will make for some more variety in the next album.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Beyond the Neighbourhood &#8211; Athlete<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And the album I&#8217;ll say the least about.  Certainly the most difficult to get into!<\/p>\n<p>Athlete&#8217;s first album was a catchy, pop-rock record.  The second, Wires, was more downbeat, but more mature.  I still haven&#8217;t quite got to grips with all of it but the music is excellent and it was worth spending time having it grow on me &#8211; there&#8217;s some cracking songs on there.  I suspect this third album is like the second.  It&#8217;s in the shadow of two much more easily accessible albums at the moment, but I will persevere.<\/p>\n<p>Musically it sounds rich and intricate and I suspect there&#8217;s some awesome songs on there &#8211; I&#8217;ve just not found them yet&#8230;or they&#8217;ve not found me.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe more notes required in a few weeks.<\/p>\n",

I became a fan of MJ quite recently (probably after the Bush Hall gig&#8230;3 yeas ago?) and missed out on a lot of his older stuff.  But he is one of my favourite musicians.<\/p>\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, he&#8217;s a Welsh folk-rocker who writes about stuff that he really cares about and sings and plays with an enormous amount of passion.<\/p>\n<p>This record is a bit different to some of his other stuff.  MJ himself says something like &#8220;it might even make you smile&#8221;.  And that&#8217;s true &#8211; there&#8217;s a tribute to Elvis and some other nice moments, but he remains gritty, slightly angry, political, and, occasionally melancholy.<\/p>\n<p>I must confess that after a few listens I&#8217;m feeling like the album doesn&#8217;t have much new &#8211; it feels like a union of the last two (&#8220;Whoever it was that brought me here&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;Deep Blue&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>Song-wise examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vegas is a catchy tribute with an easy chorus, in much the same way as &#8220;This Being Woman&#8221;;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Weight of the World&#8221; is a bit like &#8220;This Fragile World&#8221;;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Nobody Loves You Anymore&#8221; is reminiscent of &#8220;Six Sixty Six&#8221; (though I&#8217;ll avoid comparisons of George Bush and the Devil &#8211; that would be going too far);<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;The Fading of Light&#8221; seems to be an updated &#8220;Yet Still This Will Not Be&#8221;;<\/li>\n<li>and &#8220;The things that we have carried here&#8221; is like &#8220;Whoever it was that brought me here&#8230;&#8221; in more than just the length of the song name.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But that shouldn&#8217;t detract from the quality of this album.  MJ&#8217;s consistently good songwriting hasn&#8217;t gone away.  His percussive accoustic guitar playing makes sounds like a single instrument shouldn&#8217;t.  His intricate fingerstyle is beautiful as ever.  And his vocals, though mostly lacking range of pitch, vary from the haunting whispers of &#8220;Kindness&#8221; to the angry growls of &#8220;Nobody Loves You Any More&#8221; .The little flourishes of percussion, harmonica, woodwind, strings, piano, even an electric guitar or two (!) add depth and interest without detracting from the key elements of MJ&#8217;s voice and guitar.<\/p>\n<p>I DO like this album.  A lot.  I will play it over and over.  And the gig in November will be one of the highlights of my year. But I&#8217;d like to see him writing about something a bit different next time&#8230;perhaps a few elections, on both sides of the pond, will make for some more variety in the next album.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Beyond the Neighbourhood &#8211; Athlete<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And the album I&#8217;ll say the least about.  Certainly the most difficult to get into!<\/p>\n<p>Athlete&#8217;s first album was a catchy, pop-rock record.  The second, Wires, was more downbeat, but more mature.  I still haven&#8217;t quite got to grips with all of it but the music is excellent and it was worth spending time having it grow on me &#8211; there&#8217;s some cracking songs on there.  I suspect this third album is like the second.  It&#8217;s in the shadow of two much more easily accessible albums at the moment, but I will persevere.<\/p>\n<p>Musically it sounds rich and intricate and I suspect there&#8217;s some awesome songs on there &#8211; I&#8217;ve just not found them yet&#8230;or they&#8217;ve not found me.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe more notes required in a few weeks.<\/p>\n",

My sister and her boyfriend invited us to climb Snowdon the hard way (via Crib Goch) months ago and this weekend, it finally came about.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the forward planning, for Sally and I it was all a bit last minute.  My &#8220;post-viral fatigue&#8221; had raised questions about whether or not we would go away, let alone climb a mountain, but we decided that we would at least get out of town and spend a few nights in the company of good friends in a beautiful place.<\/p>\n<p>In the event, we DID attempt to climb Snowdon.  We set out on Friday morning with the aim of following the Crib-Goch-scrambling party to the start of the difficult bit, and then following an easier track (the Pyg Track) from there on our own steam.<\/p>\n<p>I quite quickly gave up and didn&#8217;t make it far past the point at which we split up.  My legs got really tired and I just didn&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;d make it very far.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RwPv3Ue8_SI\/AAAAAAAABiE\/adQBjtLDD8Y\/s1600-h\/DSC00041.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RwPv3Ue8_SI\/AAAAAAAABiE\/adQBjtLDD8Y\/s400\/DSC00041.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>However, on Saturday I tried again &#8211; the party headed out to climb Glyder Fach and Glyder Fawr &#8211; the other side of the valley from Snowdon, and I went with them with the intention of going as far as I felt comfortable.  With a bit of encouragement from the others I kept on going and did a whole 7 hours walk, climbing a total of 800m over a distance of about 10km.  Not bad for an invalid &#8211; climbing something higher than Scafell.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RwPv20e8_RI\/AAAAAAAABh8\/Kyw5QPiDnZI\/s1600-h\/DSC00039.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RwPv20e8_RI\/AAAAAAAABh8\/Kyw5QPiDnZI\/s400\/DSC00039.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It was a good scramble.  We headed up into mist at first and the unclear footpath we were trying to follow lead to some difficult, if unexposed, scrambling.  However, the mist cleared once we got to the second peak and we were rewarded with some awesome views of Snowdon and<\/p>\n<p>I WAS shattered today though and the drive back was very hard work.<\/p>\n<p>My health is an odd thing.  It feels like Friday&#8217;s aborted attempt at Snowdon kickstarted my body a bit &#8211; made it realise that, at some point, it would have to stop moping around and get on and do some physical work.  I&#8217;m also not sure how much of what I&#8217;m going through is psychological and how much is really physical.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, health issues aside, I&#8217;ve had a cracking weekend.  Snowdonia is beautiful, the hostel was comfortable and the food good, we had lots of fun, and there was a bit of me that looked up at Crib Goch and REALLY wanted to climb it.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s something in us that wants to explore, to experience danger, to go to the difficult place.  We&#8217;ll definitely be back at some point!<\/p>\n",

My sister and her boyfriend invited us to climb Snowdon the hard way (via Crib Goch) months ago and this weekend, it finally came about.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the forward planning, for Sally and I it was all a bit last minute.  My &#8220;post-viral fatigue&#8221; had raised questions about whether or not we would go away, let alone climb a mountain, but we decided that we would at least get out of town and spend a few nights in the company of good friends in a beautiful place.<\/p>\n<p>In the event, we DID attempt to climb Snowdon.  We set out on Friday morning with the aim of following the Crib-Goch-scrambling party to the start of the difficult bit, and then following an easier track (the Pyg Track) from there on our own steam.<\/p>\n<p>I quite quickly gave up and didn&#8217;t make it far past the point at which we split up.  My legs got really tired and I just didn&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;d make it very far.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RwPv3Ue8_SI\/AAAAAAAABiE\/adQBjtLDD8Y\/s1600-h\/DSC00041.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RwPv3Ue8_SI\/AAAAAAAABiE\/adQBjtLDD8Y\/s400\/DSC00041.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>However, on Saturday I tried again &#8211; the party headed out to climb Glyder Fach and Glyder Fawr &#8211; the other side of the valley from Snowdon, and I went with them with the intention of going as far as I felt comfortable.  With a bit of encouragement from the others I kept on going and did a whole 7 hours walk, climbing a total of 800m over a distance of about 10km.  Not bad for an invalid &#8211; climbing something higher than Scafell.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RwPv20e8_RI\/AAAAAAAABh8\/Kyw5QPiDnZI\/s1600-h\/DSC00039.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RwPv20e8_RI\/AAAAAAAABh8\/Kyw5QPiDnZI\/s400\/DSC00039.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It was a good scramble.  We headed up into mist at first and the unclear footpath we were trying to follow lead to some difficult, if unexposed, scrambling.  However, the mist cleared once we got to the second peak and we were rewarded with some awesome views of Snowdon and<\/p>\n<p>I WAS shattered today though and the drive back was very hard work.<\/p>\n<p>My health is an odd thing.  It feels like Friday&#8217;s aborted attempt at Snowdon kickstarted my body a bit &#8211; made it realise that, at some point, it would have to stop moping around and get on and do some physical work.  I&#8217;m also not sure how much of what I&#8217;m going through is psychological and how much is really physical.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, health issues aside, I&#8217;ve had a cracking weekend.  Snowdonia is beautiful, the hostel was comfortable and the food good, we had lots of fun, and there was a bit of me that looked up at Crib Goch and REALLY wanted to climb it.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s something in us that wants to explore, to experience danger, to go to the difficult place.  We&#8217;ll definitely be back at some point!<\/p>\n",

Tonight has been a particularly bad evening with me collapsing in bed and feeling like I&#8217;m right back at square one.<\/p>\n<p>The doctor doesn&#8217;t seem surprised and a little bit of web research (dangerous as you could probably self-diagnose pretty much anything) shows that &#8220;post viral fatigue&#8221; is not uncommon and can last a long time.<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s very frustrating.  I&#8217;ve been surprised at how much my life is defined by physical activity.  I miss my cycling and I&#8217;m unable to do much that&#8217;s strenuous at all.  I tried cycling yesterday, about 4 miles worth at a very slow pace.  Perhaps that what&#8217;s killed me off this evening?<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s stressing me out a bit as we&#8217;re buying the house&#8230;probably real soon now&#8230;and I won&#8217;t be up to much packing and cleaning and shifting big boxes around.  Plus, I don&#8217;t know what the future holds &#8211; I guess I&#8217;ll slowly recover but if there is something more long-term wrong with me, is taking on a mortgage such a good thing?<\/p>\n<p>Only time will tell I guess.

Tonight has been a particularly bad evening with me collapsing in bed and feeling like I&#8217;m right back at square one.<\/p>\n<p>The doctor doesn&#8217;t seem surprised and a little bit of web research (dangerous as you could probably self-diagnose pretty much anything) shows that &#8220;post viral fatigue&#8221; is not uncommon and can last a long time.<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s very frustrating.  I&#8217;ve been surprised at how much my life is defined by physical activity.  I miss my cycling and I&#8217;m unable to do much that&#8217;s strenuous at all.
