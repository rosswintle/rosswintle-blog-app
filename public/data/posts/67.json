Well mostly because I totally overloaded the weight on one of my wheels and broke four of the spokes.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;ve heard that wheel building, and spoke replacement are pretty difficult to get right and it&#8217;s easy to end up with a very wobbly wheel.  But, with a bit of effort and a lot of fiddling, I managed to do this myself.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 2<\/span>: Don&#8217;t be scared of people in bike shops.  If you explain that you&#8217;re trying to fix something yourself they&#8217;re quite helpful.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 3<\/span>: Replacing spokes isn&#8217;t as hard as everyone makes it out to be.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 4<\/span>: When replacing multiple spokes do some serious preparation working out the spoke pattern.  This will save you much time later on!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">My first flat<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Pretty chuffed with my wheel work, I started the ride to work an back again.  I&#8217;ve been playing with different routes at weekend with the aim of extending my rides to make them into longer training rides.<\/p>\n<p>On the first extended ride home, I must sadly report that I got my first puncture.  Yes, after just over a year and about 1300 miles, I finally got my first flat!<\/p>\n<p>I had a pump with me, but my multi-tool, patches and spare tube were in my seat pack&#8230;at home.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 5<\/span>: It doesn&#8217;t matter if your ride is short and not straying too far from home.  It&#8217;s ALWAYS worth putting your seat-pack-full-of-tools on.<\/p>\n<p>I swallowed my pride and phoned home for a lift.  Sally was most gracious and drove out to pick me, and my poor wheels, up.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 6<\/span>: My hybrid with fully-loaded paniers is pretty heavy and carrying it any distance is hard work.  When calling for roadside assistance be sure to get the person to drive to where you are, not to a point several hundred metres away up a hill!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Replacing Tyres<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>As I repaired the flat, I realised that my tyres were starting to look pretty worn.  So they&#8217;ve been replaced now too.  I still feel like the back wheel is a bit lumpy.  It looks straight and true and, if anything, the bulge\/wobble that I used to have in my tyre is gone.  So it should be better!  But it just feels not-quite-right when I do any speed in a straight line.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the, erm, well, a the bit of the bike that holds attaches the handlebar to the frame, is loose.  It&#8217;s occasionally worked it way loose before but a good strong turn of an allen key has sorted it out.  Sadly, this time, the hexagonal hole that you put the allen key into is wearing away and I can&#8217;t get enough force onto it to get it tight without it slipping.  It might be a bike shop job now.<\/p>\n<p>So in general my poor old machine is suffering a bit.  I try to look after it but I guess 1300 miles is quite a lot for a cheap little Raleigh.  Poor thing.<\/p>\n",

Well mostly because I totally overloaded the weight on one of my wheels and broke four of the spokes.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;ve heard that wheel building, and spoke replacement are pretty difficult to get right and it&#8217;s easy to end up with a very wobbly wheel.  But, with a bit of effort and a lot of fiddling, I managed to do this myself.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 2<\/span>: Don&#8217;t be scared of people in bike shops.  If you explain that you&#8217;re trying to fix something yourself they&#8217;re quite helpful.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 3<\/span>: Replacing spokes isn&#8217;t as hard as everyone makes it out to be.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 4<\/span>: When replacing multiple spokes do some serious preparation working out the spoke pattern.  This will save you much time later on!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">My first flat<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Pretty chuffed with my wheel work, I started the ride to work an back again.  I&#8217;ve been playing with different routes at weekend with the aim of extending my rides to make them into longer training rides.<\/p>\n<p>On the first extended ride home, I must sadly report that I got my first puncture.  Yes, after just over a year and about 1300 miles, I finally got my first flat!<\/p>\n<p>I had a pump with me, but my multi-tool, patches and spare tube were in my seat pack&#8230;at home.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 5<\/span>: It doesn&#8217;t matter if your ride is short and not straying too far from home.  It&#8217;s ALWAYS worth putting your seat-pack-full-of-tools on.<\/p>\n<p>I swallowed my pride and phoned home for a lift.  Sally was most gracious and drove out to pick me, and my poor wheels, up.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Lesson 6<\/span>: My hybrid with fully-loaded paniers is pretty heavy and carrying it any distance is hard work.  When calling for roadside assistance be sure to get the person to drive to where you are, not to a point several hundred metres away up a hill!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:130%;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Replacing Tyres<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>As I repaired the flat, I realised that my tyres were starting to look pretty worn.  So they&#8217;ve been replaced now too.  I still feel like the back wheel is a bit lumpy.  It looks straight and true and, if anything, the bulge\/wobble that I used to have in my tyre is gone.  So it should be better!  But it just feels not-quite-right when I do any speed in a straight line.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the, erm, well, a the bit of the bike that holds attaches the handlebar to the frame, is loose.  It&#8217;s occasionally worked it way loose before but a good strong turn of an allen key has sorted it out.  Sadly, this time, the hexagonal hole that you put the allen key into is wearing away and I can&#8217;t get enough force onto it to get it tight without it slipping.  It might be a bike shop job now.<\/p>\n<p>So in general my poor old machine is suffering a bit.  I try to look after it but I guess 1300 miles is quite a lot for a cheap little Raleigh.  Poor thing.<\/p>\n",

Here&#8217;s my excuses for not writing for a month&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Moving House<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Well, the house exchange and completion went through.  We got the keys to our new house on October 5th.  Sally was away for the weekend and I&#8217;d been banned from moving in until she got home, so I got on with the job of cleaning and tidying the old place.  We moved in proper on the Monday.<\/p>\n<p>The house is great but a little rough around the edges.  Lots of bits of DIY\/building that seem to have been finished in a hurry.  But it&#8217;s ours, it has three bedrooms, a huge garden and it&#8217;s in a great location.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, we&#8217;ve had to clean up and get out of the old rented house too.  Phew.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">No Broadband<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Moving house means setting up a new phone line and having our Internet connection set up.  This meant several weeks without Broadband.  Quite a nice experience really.  We get so much more &#8220;real&#8221; stuff done without Google and Facebook and Blogger.  We didn&#8217;t really miss it at all.  Of course, now it&#8217;s back we&#8217;re back in the habit of making good use of our &#8220;always on&#8221; pipe to the universe.<\/p>\n<p>A note about providers&#8230;we were with Zen Internet, who provide excellent service, but at a cost.  Our up-to-8Mb connection was costing \u00a317 per month with a 2GB usage limit.  So after some debate and research we decided to KEEP Sky TV and take Sky Broadband and Sky Talk (phone calls) too.  Much as I dislike having hundreds of TV channels that I never watch.  This appealed because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sky Talk costs nothing and gives free evening and weekend calls.<\/li>\n<li>Sky Broadband is \u00a35 for up-to-8Mb with a 40GB usage limit.<\/li>\n<li>Sky + (Sky&#8217;s hard-disk based TV recording system), now has no monthly subscription cost.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sky+ turns out to be awesome! VERY high quality recorded TV that you set up from the on-screen TV guide.  You just find the programme and tell it to record.  It&#8217;ll record a whole series of the same programme.  And you can pause and rewind live TV too.  I understand how the technology works, and I&#8217;m STILL very impressed.  Good technology, well implemented, is hard to find these days.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Holiday<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We decided, shortly after the house move, to take a week&#8217;s holiday.  My In-Law&#8217;s were off to Spain for a few nights and asked if we wanted to house-sit.  With a free weeks&#8217; holiday on the edge of Dartmoor being offered we couldn&#8217;t really refuse and it turned out to be just what we needed.  We&#8217;ve just got back from this week off and we&#8217;re well relaxed and trying to summon up the mental effort required to get back to work tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>We also popped to London on Friday for a couple of friends of ours who were having an engagement party.  We&#8217;re VERY excited that they&#8217;re getting married and the party was really great.<\/p>\n<p>Returning to London is an odd experience.  We drive in thinking that it&#8217;s horrid, busy, noisy, etc, but after a couple of hours re-uniting with good friends we miss it.  Of course, we&#8217;ve made good friends here in Swindon too, but we&#8217;re really still getting to know people and it&#8217;s not the same as connecting with people that you&#8217;ve known inside-out for many years.  There are things about London as a city that we miss, but mostly it&#8217;s the people.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Finally&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><\/span>So, yes, after all that  we&#8217;re in the new house, broadband is back, and we&#8217;re not on holiday any more.  I probably have some catching up to do.  I keep having &#8220;I must write about that&#8221; moments, but can&#8217;t remember what any of them are now.  If they&#8217;re that important then they&#8217;ll come back to me I&#8217;m sure.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

Here&#8217;s my excuses for not writing for a month&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Moving House<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Well, the house exchange and completion went through.  We got the keys to our new house on October 5th.  Sally was away for the weekend and I&#8217;d been banned from moving in until she got home, so I got on with the job of cleaning and tidying the old place.  We moved in proper on the Monday.<\/p>\n<p>The house is great but a little rough around the edges.  Lots of bits of DIY\/building that seem to have been finished in a hurry.  But it&#8217;s ours, it has three bedrooms, a huge garden and it&#8217;s in a great location.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, we&#8217;ve had to clean up and get out of the old rented house too.  Phew.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">No Broadband<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Moving house means setting up a new phone line and having our Internet connection set up.  This meant several weeks without Broadband.  Quite a nice experience really.  We get so much more &#8220;real&#8221; stuff done without Google and Facebook and Blogger.  We didn&#8217;t really miss it at all.  Of course, now it&#8217;s back we&#8217;re back in the habit of making good use of our &#8220;always on&#8221; pipe to the universe.<\/p>\n<p>A note about providers&#8230;we were with Zen Internet, who provide excellent service, but at a cost.  Our up-to-8Mb connection was costing \u00a317 per month with a 2GB usage limit.  So after some debate and research we decided to KEEP Sky TV and take Sky Broadband and Sky Talk (phone calls) too.  Much as I dislike having hundreds of TV channels that I never watch.  This appealed because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sky Talk costs nothing and gives free evening and weekend calls.<\/li>\n<li>Sky Broadband is \u00a35 for up-to-8Mb with a 40GB usage limit.<\/li>\n<li>Sky + (Sky&#8217;s hard-disk based TV recording system), now has no monthly subscription cost.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sky+ turns out to be awesome! VERY high quality recorded TV that you set up from the on-screen TV guide.  You just find the programme and tell it to record.  It&#8217;ll record a whole series of the same programme.  And you can pause and rewind live TV too.  I understand how the technology works, and I&#8217;m STILL very impressed.  Good technology, well implemented, is hard to find these days.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Holiday<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We decided, shortly after the house move, to take a week&#8217;s holiday.  My In-Law&#8217;s were off to Spain for a few nights and asked if we wanted to house-sit.  With a free weeks&#8217; holiday on the edge of Dartmoor being offered we couldn&#8217;t really refuse and it turned out to be just what we needed.  We&#8217;ve just got back from this week off and we&#8217;re well relaxed and trying to summon up the mental effort required to get back to work tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>We also popped to London on Friday for a couple of friends of ours who were having an engagement party.  We&#8217;re VERY excited that they&#8217;re getting married and the party was really great.<\/p>\n<p>Returning to London is an odd experience.  We drive in thinking that it&#8217;s horrid, busy, noisy, etc, but after a couple of hours re-uniting with good friends we miss it.  Of course, we&#8217;ve made good friends here in Swindon too, but we&#8217;re really still getting to know people and it&#8217;s not the same as connecting with people that you&#8217;ve known inside-out for many years.  There are things about London as a city that we miss, but mostly it&#8217;s the people.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Finally&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><\/span>So, yes, after all that  we&#8217;re in the new house, broadband is back, and we&#8217;re not on holiday any more.  I probably have some catching up to do.  I keep having &#8220;I must write about that&#8221; moments, but can&#8217;t remember what any of them are now.  If they&#8217;re that important then they&#8217;ll come back to me I&#8217;m sure.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

This is great for visibility and is, in my opinion, a fairly sporty-looking thing (rather than the nerdy day-glo work jackets you can get).  I found a down side today though when I went to put the recycling out before heading off to work.  The next door neighbour thought I was the bin man!!!  Still &#8211; gave Sally a laugh.<\/p>\n",

Sally and I are booked in to see Martyn Joseph and KT Tunstall in the coming months, plus, there was a new Athlete album out that I splashed out on.  Thoughts below:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Drastic Fantsatic &#8211; KT Tunstall<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The catchiest of the new albums, very easy to get into.  KT is a good songwriter, a very accomplished musican and singer, and she&#8217;s intelligent too.  We very much liked the first album and this one didn&#8217;t disappoint as a follow up.<\/p>\n<p>The songs are a variety of styles, there&#8217;s folk, rock and roll, ballads, pop, even a hint of Latin American.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a great album, but I don&#8217;t think it will quite have the lasting appeal of &#8220;Through the Telescope&#8221;.  Enjoying it for the moment though.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vegas &#8211; Martyn Joseph<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is the album about which I&#8217;d like to say the most.  I became a fan of MJ quite recently (probably after the Bush Hall gig&#8230;3 yeas ago?) and missed out on a lot of his older stuff.  But he is one of my favourite musicians.<\/p>\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, he&#8217;s a Welsh folk-rocker who writes about stuff that he really cares about and sings and plays with an enormous amount of passion.<\/p>\n<p>This record is a bit different to some of his other stuff.  MJ himself says something like &#8220;it might even make you smile&#8221;.  And that&#8217;s true &#8211; there&#8217;s a tribute to Elvis and some other nice moments, but he remains gritty, slightly angry, political, and, occasionally melancholy.<\/p>\n<p>I must confess that after a few listens I&#8217;m feeling like the album doesn&#8217;t have much new &#8211; it feels like a union of the last two (&#8220;Whoever it was that brought me here&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;Deep Blue&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>Song-wise examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vegas is a catchy tribute with an easy chorus, in much the same way as &#8220;This Being Woman&#8221;;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Weight of the World&#8221; is a bit like &#8220;This Fragile World&#8221;;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Nobody Loves You Anymore&#8221; is reminiscent of &#8220;Six Sixty Six&#8221; (though I&#8217;ll avoid comparisons of George Bush and the Devil &#8211; that would be going too far);<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;The Fading of Light&#8221; seems to be an updated &#8220;Yet Still This Will Not Be&#8221;;<\/li>\n<li>and &#8220;The things that we have carried here&#8221; is like &#8220;Whoever it was that brought me here&#8230;&#8221; in more than just the length of the song name.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But that shouldn&#8217;t detract from the quality of this album.  MJ&#8217;s consistently good songwriting hasn&#8217;t gone away.  His percussive accoustic guitar playing makes sounds like a single instrument shouldn&#8217;t.  His intricate fingerstyle is beautiful as ever.  And his vocals, though mostly lacking range of pitch, vary from the haunting whispers of &#8220;Kindness&#8221; to the angry growls of &#8220;Nobody Loves You Any More&#8221; .The little flourishes of percussion, harmonica, woodwind, strings, piano, even an electric guitar or two (!) add depth and interest without detracting from the key elements of MJ&#8217;s voice and guitar.<\/p>\n<p>I DO like this album.  A lot.  I will play it over and over.  And the gig in November will be one of the highlights of my year. But I&#8217;d like to see him writing about something a bit different next time&#8230;perhaps a few elections, on both sides of the pond, will make for some more variety in the next album.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Beyond the Neighbourhood &#8211; Athlete<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And the album I&#8217;ll say the least about.  Certainly the most difficult to get into!<\/p>\n<p>Athlete&#8217;s first album was a catchy, pop-rock record.  The second, Wires, was more downbeat, but more mature.  I still haven&#8217;t quite got to grips with all of it but the music is excellent and it was worth spending time having it grow on me &#8211; there&#8217;s some cracking songs on there.  I suspect this third album is like the second.  It&#8217;s in the shadow of two much more easily accessible albums at the moment, but I will persevere.<\/p>\n<p>Musically it sounds rich and intricate and I suspect there&#8217;s some awesome songs on there &#8211; I&#8217;ve just not found them yet&#8230;or they&#8217;ve not found me.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe more notes required in a few weeks.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>It&#8217;s been a good month for music.  Sally and I are booked in to see Martyn Joseph and KT Tunstall in the coming months, plus, there was a new Athlete album out that I splashed out on.  Thoughts below:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Drastic Fantsatic &#8211; KT Tunstall<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The catchiest of the new albums, very easy to get into.  KT is a good songwriter, a very accomplished musican and singer, and she&#8217;s intelligent too.  We very much liked the first album and this one didn&#8217;t disappoint as a follow up.<\/p>\n<p>The songs are a variety of styles, there&#8217;s folk, rock and roll, ballads, pop, even a hint of Latin American.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a great album, but I don&#8217;t think it will quite have the lasting appeal of &#8220;Through the Telescope&#8221;.  Enjoying it for the moment though.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Vegas &#8211; Martyn Joseph<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is the album about which I&#8217;d like to say the most.  I became a fan of MJ quite recently (probably after the Bush Hall gig&#8230;3 yeas ago?) and missed out on a lot of his older stuff.  But he is one of my favourite musicians.<\/p>\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, he&#8217;s a Welsh folk-rocker who writes about stuff that he really cares about and sings and plays with an enormous amount of passion.<\/p>\n<p>This record is a bit different to some of his other stuff.  MJ himself says something like &#8220;it might even make you smile&#8221;.  And that&#8217;s true &#8211; there&#8217;s a tribute to Elvis and some other nice moments, but he remains gritty, slightly angry, political, and, occasionally melancholy.<\/p>\n<p>I must confess that after a few listens I&#8217;m feeling like the album doesn&#8217;t have much new &#8211; it feels like a union of the last two (&#8220;Whoever it was that brought me here&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;Deep Blue&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>Song-wise examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vegas is a catchy tribute with an easy chorus, in much the same way as &#8220;This Being Woman&#8221;;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Weight of the World&#8221; is a bit like &#8220;This Fragile World&#8221;;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Nobody Loves You Anymore&#8221; is reminiscent of &#8220;Six Sixty Six&#8221; (though I&#8217;ll avoid comparisons of George Bush and the Devil &#8211; that would be going too far);<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;The Fading of Light&#8221; seems to be an updated &#8220;Yet Still This Will Not Be&#8221;;<\/li>\n<li>and &#8220;The things that we have carried here&#8221; is like &#8220;Whoever it was that brought me here&#8230;&#8221; in more than just the length of the song name.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But that shouldn&#8217;t detract from the quality of this album.  MJ&#8217;s consistently good songwriting hasn&#8217;t gone away.  His percussive accoustic guitar playing makes sounds like a single instrument shouldn&#8217;t.  His intricate fingerstyle is beautiful as ever.  And his vocals, though mostly lacking range of pitch, vary from the haunting whispers of &#8220;Kindness&#8221; to the angry growls of &#8220;Nobody Loves You Any More&#8221; .The little flourishes of percussion, harmonica, woodwind, strings, piano, even an electric guitar or two (!) add depth and interest without detracting from the key elements of MJ&#8217;s voice and guitar.<\/p>\n<p>I DO like this album.  A lot.  I will play it over and over.  And the gig in November will be one of the highlights of my year. But I&#8217;d like to see him writing about something a bit different next time&#8230;perhaps a few elections, on both sides of the pond, will make for some more variety in the next album.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Beyond the Neighbourhood &#8211; Athlete<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And the album I&#8217;ll say the least about.  Certainly the most difficult to get into!<\/p>\n<p>Athlete&#8217;s first album was a catchy, pop-rock record.  The second, Wires, was more downbeat, but more mature.  I still haven&#8217;t quite got to grips with all of it but the music is excellent and it was worth spending time having it grow on me &#8211; there&#8217;s some cracking songs on there.  I suspect this third album is like the second.  It&#8217;s in the shadow of two much more easily accessible albums at the moment, but I will persevere.<\/p>\n<p>Musically it sounds rich and intricate and I suspect there&#8217;s some awesome songs on there &#8211; I&#8217;ve just not found them yet&#8230;or they&#8217;ve not found me.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe more notes required in a few weeks.<\/p>\n",

My sister and her boyfriend invited us to climb Snowdon the hard way (via Crib Goch) months ago and this weekend, it finally came about.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the forward planning, for Sally and I it was all a bit last minute.  My &#8220;post-viral fatigue&#8221; had raised questions about whether or not we would go away, let alone climb a mountain, but we decided that we would at least get out of town and spend a few nights in the company of good friends in a beautiful place.<\/p>\n<p>In the event, we DID attempt to climb Snowdon.  We set out on Friday morning with the aim of following the Crib-Goch-scrambling party to the start of the difficult bit, and then following an easier track (the Pyg Track) from there on our own steam.<\/p>\n<p>I quite quickly gave up and didn&#8217;t make it far past the point at which we split up.  My legs got really tired and I just didn&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;d make it very far.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RwPv3Ue8_SI\/AAAAAAAABiE\/adQBjtLDD8Y\/s1600-h\/DSC00041.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RwPv3Ue8_SI\/AAAAAAAABiE\/adQBjtLDD8Y\/s400\/DSC00041.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>However, on Saturday I tried again &#8211; the party headed out to climb Glyder Fach and Glyder Fawr &#8211; the other side of the valley from Snowdon, and I went with them with the intention of going as far as I felt comfortable.  With a bit of encouragement from the others I kept on going and did a whole 7 hours walk, climbing a total of 800m over a distance of about 10km.  Not bad for an invalid &#8211; climbing something higher than Scafell.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RwPv20e8_RI\/AAAAAAAABh8\/Kyw5QPiDnZI\/s1600-h\/DSC00039.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RwPv20e8_RI\/AAAAAAAABh8\/Kyw5QPiDnZI\/s400\/DSC00039.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It was a good scramble.  We headed up into mist at first and the unclear footpath we were trying to follow lead to some difficult, if unexposed, scrambling.  However, the mist cleared once we got to the second peak and we were rewarded with some awesome views of Snowdon and<\/p>\n<p>I WAS shattered today though and the drive back was very hard work.<\/p>\n<p>My health is an odd thing.  It feels like Friday&#8217;s aborted attempt at Snowdon kickstarted my body a bit &#8211; made it realise that, at some point, it would have to stop moping around and get on and do some physical work.  I&#8217;m also not sure how much of what I&#8217;m going through is psychological and how much is really physical.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, health issues aside, I&#8217;ve had a cracking weekend.  Snowdonia is beautiful, the hostel was comfortable and the food good, we had lots of fun, and there was a bit of me that looked up at Crib Goch and REALLY wanted to climb it.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s something in us that wants to explore, to experience danger, to go to the difficult place.  We&#8217;ll definitely be back at some point!<\/p>\n",

My sister and her boyfriend invited us to climb Snowdon the hard way (via Crib Goch) months ago and this weekend, it finally came about.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the forward planning, for Sally and I it was all a bit last minute.  My &#8220;post-viral fatigue&#8221; had raised questions about whether or not we would go away, let alone climb a mountain, but we decided that we would at least get out of town and spend a few nights in the company of good friends in a beautiful place.<\/p>\n<p>In the event, we DID attempt to climb Snowdon.  We set out on Friday morning with the aim of following the Crib-Goch-scrambling party to the start of the difficult bit, and then following an easier track (the Pyg Track) from there on our own steam.<\/p>\n<p>I quite quickly gave up and didn&#8217;t make it far past the point at which we split up.  My legs got really tired and I just didn&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;d make it very far.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RwPv3Ue8_SI\/AAAAAAAABiE\/adQBjtLDD8Y\/s1600-h\/DSC00041.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RwPv3Ue8_SI\/AAAAAAAABiE\/adQBjtLDD8Y\/s400\/DSC00041.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>However, on Saturday I tried again &#8211; the party headed out to climb Glyder Fach and Glyder Fawr &#8211; the other side of the valley from Snowdon, and I went with them with the intention of going as far as I felt comfortable.  With a bit of encouragement from the others I kept on going and did a whole 7 hours walk, climbing a total of 800m over a distance of about 10km.  Not bad for an invalid &#8211; climbing something higher than Scafell.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RwPv20e8_RI\/AAAAAAAABh8\/Kyw5QPiDnZI\/s1600-h\/DSC00039.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RwPv20e8_RI\/AAAAAAAABh8\/Kyw5QPiDnZI\/s400\/DSC00039.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It was a good scramble.  We headed up into mist at first and the unclear footpath we were trying to follow lead to some difficult, if unexposed, scrambling.  However, the mist cleared once we got to the second peak and we were rewarded with some awesome views of Snowdon and<\/p>\n<p>I WAS shattered today though and the drive back was very hard work.<\/p>\n<p>My health is an odd thing.  It feels like Friday&#8217;s aborted attempt at Snowdon kickstarted my body a bit &#8211; made it realise that, at some point, it would have to stop moping around and get on and do some physical work.  I&#8217;m also not sure how much of what I&#8217;m going through is psychological and how much is really physical.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, health issues aside, I&#8217;ve had a cracking weekend.  Snowdonia is beautiful, the hostel was comfortable and the food good, we had lots of fun, and there was a bit of me that looked up at Crib Goch and REALLY wanted to climb it.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s something in us that wants to explore, to experience danger, to go to the difficult place.  We&#8217;ll definitely be back at some point!<\/p>\n",

Tonight has been a particularly bad evening with me collapsing in bed and feeling like I&#8217;m right back at square one.<\/p>\n<p>The doctor doesn&#8217;t seem surprised and a little bit of web research (dangerous as you could probably self-diagnose pretty much anything) shows that &#8220;post viral fatigue&#8221; is not uncommon and can last a long time.<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s very frustrating.  I&#8217;ve been surprised at how much my life is defined by physical activity.  I miss my cycling and I&#8217;m unable to do much that&#8217;s strenuous at all.  I tried cycling yesterday, about 4 miles worth at a very slow pace.  Perhaps that what&#8217;s killed me off this evening?<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s stressing me out a bit as we&#8217;re buying the house&#8230;probably real soon now&#8230;and I won&#8217;t be up to much packing and cleaning and shifting big boxes around.  Plus, I don&#8217;t know what the future holds &#8211; I guess I&#8217;ll slowly recover but if there is something more long-term wrong with me, is taking on a mortgage such a good thing?<\/p>\n<p>Only time will tell I guess.  In the meantime we press on with our plans in faith that God will stop us if we&#8217;re doing the wrong thing.<\/p>\n",

Tonight has been a particularly bad evening with me collapsing in bed and feeling like I&#8217;m right back at square one.<\/p>\n<p>The doctor doesn&#8217;t seem surprised and a little bit of web research (dangerous as you could probably self-diagnose pretty much anything) shows that &#8220;post viral fatigue&#8221; is not uncommon and can last a long time.<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s very frustrating.  I&#8217;ve been surprised at how much my life is defined by physical activity.  I miss my cycling and I&#8217;m unable to do much that&#8217;s strenuous at all.  I tried cycling yesterday, about 4 miles worth at a very slow pace.  Perhaps that what&#8217;s killed me off this evening?<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s stressing me out a bit as we&#8217;re buying the house&#8230;probably real soon now&#8230;and I won&#8217;t be up to much packing and cleaning and shifting big boxes around.  Plus, I don&#8217;t know what the future holds &#8211; I guess I&#8217;ll slowly recover but if there is something more long-term wrong with me, is taking on a mortgage such a good thing?<\/p>\n<p>Only time will tell I guess.  In the meantime we press on with our plans in faith that God will stop us if we&#8217;re doing the wrong thing.<\/p>\n",

They have these 8 legs and they build this super-strong web thing with stuff that they naturally produce to catch their food.

And I have to say that, despite the slow start to it, the book did grow on me as I read it, and it did inspire me to pray more and differently.  But it was with relief that I finished it.  It was just REALLY hard going.<\/p>\n<p>This is probably more a reflection on me than on the book.  Let me explain&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Much as my writing is very long and waffly, I like my reading to be concise and to the point.  I like stories and illustrations, but they should help make the point rather than clog up the book and make it slow going and repetitive.  Plus, I read non-fiction books like this slowly and carefully, taking everything in, underlining what&#8217;s important, so I don&#8217;t need the same point to be made several times.<\/p>\n<p>You can probably work out that I thought that this book was too heavy on anecdotes, too light on simple, to-the-point theology, and too repetitive.  The book IS a meandering journey rather than a write up of the destination.  It&#8217;s a discussion rather than a sermon.<\/p>\n<p>In a book like this it is sometimes important to reinforce a point but, particularly in the early chapters, I found Yancey going round in circles without making much real progress.  After reading about a third of it I wondered what I was going to get from it other than lots of questions and fairly stock answers.<\/p>\n<p>I found later chapters were a bit more practical and inspiring and Yancey&#8217;s honesty and openness about his struggles with prayer really make the book.  By the end I has the feeling that he has somehow gained some mastery of the topic and he had managed to share it with me.  I just wish it hadn&#8217;t taken him so many words to do it.<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t find many points to disagree on, though Yancey&#8217;s theology is obviously very open.  He&#8217;s not afraid to tackle the difficult questions, and not afraid to leave you without a firm answer either.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to see an edited version distilling his findings into a much shorter work.  But worth reading if you have the time.<\/p>\n",

And I have to say that, despite the slow start to it, the book did grow on me as I read it, and it did inspire me to pray more and differently.  But it was with relief that I finished it.  It was just REALLY hard going.<\/p>\n<p>This is probably more a reflection on me than on the book.  Let me explain&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Much as my writing is very long and waffly, I like my reading to be concise and to the point.  I like stories and illustrations, but they should help make the point rather than clog up the book and make it slow going and repetitive.  Plus, I read non-fiction books like this slowly and carefully, taking everything in, underlining what&#8217;s important, so I don&#8217;t need the same point to be made several times.<\/p>\n<p>You can probably work out that I thought that this book was too heavy on anecdotes, too light on simple, to-the-point theology, and too repetitive.  The book IS a meandering journey rather than a write up of the destination.  It&#8217;s a discussion rather than a sermon.<\/p>\n<p>In a book like this it is sometimes important to reinforce a point but, particularly in the early chapters, I found Yancey going round in circles without making much real progress.  After reading about a third of it I wondered what I was going to get from it other than lots of questions and fairly stock answers.<\/p>\n<p>I found later chapters were a bit more practical and inspiring and Yancey&#8217;s honesty and openness about his struggles with prayer really make the book.  By the end I has the feeling that he has somehow gained some mastery of the topic and he had managed to share it with me.  I just wish it hadn&#8217;t taken him so many words to do it.<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t find many points to disagree on, though Yancey&#8217;s theology is obviously very open.  He&#8217;s not afraid to tackle the difficult questions, and not afraid to leave you without a firm answer either.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to see an edited version distilling his findings into a much shorter work.  But worth reading if you have the time.<\/p>\n",

We stalled a bit while we chose a mortgage but that&#8217;s applied for, the legal stuff has all moved along as it should, the survey is now done, and it seems that nothing can now stand in the way of our purchase (famous last words&#8230;you read them here!).<\/p>\n<p>My main feeling, other then excitement, is the completely overwhelming amount of information that&#8217;s involved.  We requested some extra reports and searches because the house:<br \/>&#8211; is near a flood plain (far enough from it to be safe though),<br \/>&#8211; is near the site of an old refuse site,<br \/>&#8211; has recently had an extension built.<\/p>\n<p>So we have the following documentation:<br \/>&#8211; an environmental report,<br \/>&#8211; a water and drainage report,<br \/>&#8211; a survey and homebuyers report,<br \/>&#8211; the information pack from the seller,<br \/>&#8211; all the mortgage information,<br \/>&#8211; information on buildings and contents insurance.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, today we&#8217;ve received a couple of quotes and information packs for life assurance and payment protection.  And my brain has just overloaded.  I can&#8217;t take any more!!!<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been some discussion recently about things called home information packs that the seller is supposed to put together.  I believe these are becoming mandatory for 3-bedroom houses just this week (if only we&#8217;d waited!!).  What a good idea this is! If our purchase had fallen through the searches we&#8217;ve done and paid for would have to be re-done and re-paid-for.  With a Home Information Pack it&#8217;s all done once and by the seller, which seems to make a whole world of sense to me.<\/p>\n<p>We are excited, we are thankful for the hugely privileged position that we find ourselves in in being able to buy a house in the first place, we&#8217;re particularly thankful for the house that we&#8217;ve found that meets our needs so well&#8230;but my brain really is quite full up now and I need a rest.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>A while ago I mentioned that we&#8217;d had an offer accepted on a house!  A quick update is due.<\/p>\n<p>The process has been moving along quite well.  We stalled a bit while we chose a mortgage but that&#8217;s applied for, the legal stuff has all moved along as it should, the survey is now done, and it seems that nothing can now stand in the way of our purchase (famous last words&#8230;you read them here!).<\/p>\n<p>My main feeling, other then excitement, is the completely overwhelming amount of information that&#8217;s involved.  We requested some extra reports and searches because the house:<br \/>&#8211; is near a flood plain (far enough from it to be safe though),<br \/>&#8211; is near the site of an old refuse site,<br \/>&#8211; has recently had an extension built.<\/p>\n<p>So we have the following documentation:<br \/>&#8211; an environmental report,<br \/>&#8211; a water and drainage report,<br \/>&#8211; a survey and homebuyers report,<br \/>&#8211; the information pack from the seller,<br \/>&#8211; all the mortgage information,<br \/>&#8211; information on buildings and contents insurance.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, today we&#8217;ve received a couple of quotes and information packs for life assurance and payment protection.  And my brain has just overloaded.  I can&#8217;t take any more!!!<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been some discussion recently about things called home information packs that the seller is supposed to put together.  I believe these are becoming mandatory for 3-bedroom houses just this week (if only we&#8217;d waited!!).  What a good idea this is! If our purchase had fallen through the searches we&#8217;ve done and paid for would have to be re-done and re-paid-for.  With a Home Information Pack it&#8217;s all done once and by the seller, which seems to make a whole world of sense to me.<\/p>\n<p>We are excited, we are thankful for the hugely privileged position that we find ourselves in in being able to buy a house in the first place, we&#8217;re particularly thankful for the house that we&#8217;ve found that meets our needs so well&#8230;but my brain really is quite full up now and I need a rest.<\/p>\n",
