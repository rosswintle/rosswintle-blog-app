So&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I exist in geeky tech spaces where kindness is often far too lacking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opinions abound. Pragmatism, spectrums of opinion, and nuance in debate is rare. Right\/wrong dichotomies abound, and discussion can be heartless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kindness to me is acceptance that I don&#8217;t know everything; that the opinions of others are valid even if they are different to mine; that asking questions is better than stating opinions; that the person I&#8217;m talking with or thinking about is a person with feelings just like me, and that I should treat them as I would want myself to be treated. Yes, this is ancient and Biblical, but for me it defines kindness!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also once heard this seemingly-bizarre thing about &#8220;cows looking at cars&#8221; that has had a profound impact on me. I probably remember it because the picture it conjures is so odd and yet so meaningful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is from a monologue about what &#8220;love&#8221; (the non-romantic kind) is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>So when you&#8217;re walking around in the world you see lots of people. But you don&#8217;t really see them. They&#8217;re just objects. They are functions. You&#8217;re like a cow looking at cars. You know, a cow looks at a car. They watch it. But nothing&#8217;s going on. When you drive past a cow [in Ireland] it looks up, it watches, but there&#8217;s nothing going on inside. And then it goes back to eating. That&#8217;s how we treat people in daily life.<\/p><p>But when you love somebody, some individual comes out of that background and you see them in their subjectivity. You see them as an individual.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this notion that I can look at a person as an object without soul, without mind, without feelings, thoughts or a &#8220;spirit&#8221; of the person. If I see them like that I can justify all sorts of bad behaviour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I stop and think that that person is a person like me: an individual; something more than a functional mass of atoms. Then, regardless of our differences of opinion, I find I have no choice but to consider my actions carefully and be kind.<\/p>\n",

So&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I exist in geeky tech spaces where kindness is often far too lacking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opinions abound. Pragmatism, spectrums of opinion, and nuance in debate is rare. Right\/wrong dichotomies abound, and discussion can be heartless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kindness to me is acceptance that I don&#8217;t know everything; that the opinions of others are valid even if they are different to mine; that asking questions is better than stating opinions; that the person I&#8217;m talking with or thinking about is a person with feelings just like me, and that I should treat them as I would want myself to be treated. Yes, this is ancient and Biblical, but for me it defines kindness!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also once heard this seemingly-bizarre thing about &#8220;cows looking at cars&#8221; that has had a profound impact on me. I probably remember it because the picture it conjures is so odd and yet so meaningful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is from a monologue about what &#8220;love&#8221; (the non-romantic kind) is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>So when you&#8217;re walking around in the world you see lots of people. But you don&#8217;t really see them. They&#8217;re just objects. They are functions. You&#8217;re like a cow looking at cars. You know, a cow looks at a car. They watch it. But nothing&#8217;s going on. When you drive past a cow [in Ireland] it looks up, it watches, but there&#8217;s nothing going on inside. And then it goes back to eating. That&#8217;s how we treat people in daily life.<\/p><p>But when you love somebody, some individual comes out of that background and you see them in their subjectivity. You see them as an individual.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this notion that I can look at a person as an object without soul, without mind, without feelings, thoughts or a &#8220;spirit&#8221; of the person. If I see them like that I can justify all sorts of bad behaviour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I stop and think that that person is a person like me: an individual; something more than a functional mass of atoms. Then, regardless of our differences of opinion, I find I have no choice but to consider my actions carefully and be kind.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ve read articles about <a href=\"https:\/\/richtabor.com\/block-patterns\/\">Block Patterns<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/impress.org\/wordpress-full-site-editing-gutenberg-7-7\/\">Full Site Editing<\/a> and I keep up with <a href=\"https:\/\/wptavern.com\/?s=gutenberg\">WP Tavern&#8217;s excellent coverage<\/a> of development on the editor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve not done much other than simple post writing, and development of custom blocks using Advanced Custom Field&#8217;s excellent features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s time I caught up with new features and dived into what&#8217;s been going on and what the future looks like for the editor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg development happens outside of WordPress &#8220;core&#8221; in the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/gutenberg\/\">Gutenberg plugin<\/a>. I&#8217;d been saving up articles to read on each of the Gutenberg releases with the aim of reviewing them and trying things out. But I wasn&#8217;t getting through them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Live Streaming Gutenberg Releases<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Live Streaming &#8211; it&#8217;s what the cool kids do these days. And while I&#8217;m not a cool kid, and I have some objections to live streaming (mostly I don&#8217;t have time to watch everyone else&#8217;s streams &#8211; there&#8217;s too much interesting content!!), it&#8217;s something I thought I&#8217;d try out because:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>It kinda makes me accountable for doing things.<\/li><li>If I recorded and published video I&#8217;d want to edit it and I often get stuck at the very-time-consuming editing stage &#8211; live streaming means I just do it and publish.<\/li><li>It will help me develop a video &#8220;style&#8221;.<\/li><li>It will get me used to recording my work again &#8211; something I want to do for some projects in the future.<\/li><li>Maybe, if people come along for the ride, I&#8217;ll get some help as I explore Gutenberg!<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m keeping it simple, just streaming on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/the_magicroundabout\">Twitch<\/a>, and publishing later on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCkx-5bxvKn1mGn90XfLikBA\">YouTube<\/a>.

So finding quieter times when I won&#8217;t be interrupted is hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Technology:<\/strong> While I have a pretty good A\/V setup, my laptop is pretty old and struggling with the job of working, streaming and recording, so, compared to others, the streams aren&#8217;t brilliant quality, but I&#8217;m working with what I have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also new to streaming. <a href=\"https:\/\/streamlabs.com\/\">StreamLabs OBS<\/a> is good software and is helping me a lot. But I am getting to grips with it as I go, and for the early streams I&#8217;m using an out-of-the-box &#8220;theme&#8221;. But if you&#8217;re a regular streamer yourself, or used to watching streams, know that mine won&#8217;t be the best, but they are getting better!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thoughts and reflections<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m enjoying the streaming<\/strong>, and it&#8217;s good to be getting back into video and learning what&#8217;s coming in Gutenberg. I&#8217;ve already learned a lot about both!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Streaming software is pretty good.<\/strong> I&#8217;ve played with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjN9fj2ssfqAhXXQUEAHYocCRA4FBAWMAB6BAgGEAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecamm.com%2Fmac%2Fecammlive%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1_hQf3vhAgGFP1oOrWTDej\">eCamm Live<\/a> (paid), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjfkfeqs8fqAhXKilwKHcJFARcQFjAAegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fobsproject.com%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw054AIqrSkxDm8_ctWCSWgb\">OBS<\/a> (free\/open source, but clunky) and now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjf2Oiys8fqAhVGilwKHY_uABUQFjAAegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstreamlabs.com%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1GJO6w3mUw7KXC_z7IGH04\">StreamLabs<\/a>. StreamLabs is based on OBS but seems simpler to use. And there&#8217;s a mobile app you can use as a remote control that&#8217;s a real bonus and gives you a mini control deck without needing something like a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elgato.com\/en\/gaming\/stream-deck\">Stream Deck<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mine is a simple and low cost setup, but it works for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Streaming is hard<\/strong>: typing; thinking; talking; making sure audio and video are working; making sure you don&#8217;t disclose passwords and other secrets while on screen. There&#8217;s a LOT to be doing all at once. And that&#8217;s before people start to chat!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Properly streaming also looks like a lot of work<\/strong>. You start seeing how others are managing their stream schedule, building communities in the chat, giving people chat moderation permissions, and designing all the screens and layouts and stuff. It&#8217;s a huge commitment to do it properly, and my reasons for doing it are so that I can do video more ad-hoc and SAVE me time. So there&#8217;s a bit of a conflict of needs there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I&#8217;ve chosen NOT to do too much promotion.<\/strong> On a Friday my Twitter feed becomes a stream of &#8220;Streaming in&#8230;&#8221; posts from others, most of which, as far as I can tell, are unnecessary because Twitch emails me when someone starts streaming. Plus, I&#8217;m nervous about putting myself out there in the early days while I&#8217;m still learning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s early days, and it&#8217;s mostly just me. But hopefully this Exploring Gutenberg process is helpful to others.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ve read articles about <a href=\"https:\/\/richtabor.com\/block-patterns\/\">Block Patterns<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/impress.org\/wordpress-full-site-editing-gutenberg-7-7\/\">Full Site Editing<\/a> and I keep up with <a href=\"https:\/\/wptavern.com\/?s=gutenberg\">WP Tavern&#8217;s excellent coverage<\/a> of development on the editor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve not done much other than simple post writing, and development of custom blocks using Advanced Custom Field&#8217;s excellent features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s time I caught up with new features and dived into what&#8217;s been going on and what the future looks like for the editor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg development happens outside of WordPress &#8220;core&#8221; in the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/gutenberg\/\">Gutenberg plugin<\/a>. I&#8217;d been saving up articles to read on each of the Gutenberg releases with the aim of reviewing them and trying things out. But I wasn&#8217;t getting through them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Live Streaming Gutenberg Releases<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Live Streaming &#8211; it&#8217;s what the cool kids do these days. And while I&#8217;m not a cool kid, and I have some objections to live streaming (mostly I don&#8217;t have time to watch everyone else&#8217;s streams &#8211; there&#8217;s too much interesting content!!), it&#8217;s something I thought I&#8217;d try out because:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>It kinda makes me accountable for doing things.<\/li><li>If I recorded and published video I&#8217;d want to edit it and I often get stuck at the very-time-consuming editing stage &#8211; live streaming means I just do it and publish.<\/li><li>It will help me develop a video &#8220;style&#8221;.<\/li><li>It will get me used to recording my work again &#8211; something I want to do for some projects in the future.<\/li><li>Maybe, if people come along for the ride, I&#8217;ll get some help as I explore Gutenberg!<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m keeping it simple, just streaming on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/the_magicroundabout\">Twitch<\/a>, and publishing later on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCkx-5bxvKn1mGn90XfLikBA\">YouTube<\/a>. So follow along if you want to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The videos are in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLhrmKLkDYLGHlWwq45NTOahsPRfF5xlaI\">YouTube playlist<\/a>.

So finding quieter times when I won&#8217;t be interrupted is hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Technology:<\/strong> While I have a pretty good A\/V setup, my laptop is pretty old and struggling with the job of working, streaming and recording, so, compared to others, the streams aren&#8217;t brilliant quality, but I&#8217;m working with what I have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also new to streaming. <a href=\"https:\/\/streamlabs.com\/\">StreamLabs OBS<\/a> is good software and is helping me a lot. But I am getting to grips with it as I go, and for the early streams I&#8217;m using an out-of-the-box &#8220;theme&#8221;. But if you&#8217;re a regular streamer yourself, or used to watching streams, know that mine won&#8217;t be the best, but they are getting better!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thoughts and reflections<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m enjoying the streaming<\/strong>, and it&#8217;s good to be getting back into video and learning what&#8217;s coming in Gutenberg. I&#8217;ve already learned a lot about both!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Streaming software is pretty good.<\/strong> I&#8217;ve played with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjN9fj2ssfqAhXXQUEAHYocCRA4FBAWMAB6BAgGEAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecamm.com%2Fmac%2Fecammlive%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1_hQf3vhAgGFP1oOrWTDej\">eCamm Live<\/a> (paid), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjfkfeqs8fqAhXKilwKHcJFARcQFjAAegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fobsproject.com%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw054AIqrSkxDm8_ctWCSWgb\">OBS<\/a> (free\/open source, but clunky) and now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjf2Oiys8fqAhVGilwKHY_uABUQFjAAegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstreamlabs.com%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1GJO6w3mUw7KXC_z7IGH04\">StreamLabs<\/a>. StreamLabs is based on OBS but seems simpler to use. And there&#8217;s a mobile app you can use as a remote control that&#8217;s a real bonus and gives you a mini control deck without needing something like a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elgato.com\/en\/gaming\/stream-deck\">Stream Deck<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mine is a simple and low cost setup, but it works for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Streaming is hard<\/strong>: typing; thinking; talking; making sure audio and video are working; making sure you don&#8217;t disclose passwords and other secrets while on screen. There&#8217;s a LOT to be doing all at once. And that&#8217;s before people start to chat!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Properly streaming also looks like a lot of work<\/strong>. You start seeing how others are managing their stream schedule, building communities in the chat, giving people chat moderation permissions, and designing all the screens and layouts and stuff. It&#8217;s a huge commitment to do it properly, and my reasons for doing it are so that I can do video more ad-hoc and SAVE me time. So there&#8217;s a bit of a conflict of needs there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I&#8217;ve chosen NOT to do too much promotion.<\/strong> On a Friday my Twitter feed becomes a stream of &#8220;Streaming in&#8230;&#8221; posts from others, most of which, as far as I can tell, are unnecessary because Twitch emails me when someone starts streaming. Plus, I&#8217;m nervous about putting myself out there in the early days while I&#8217;m still learning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s early days, and it&#8217;s mostly just me. But hopefully this Exploring Gutenberg process is helpful to others.<\/p>\n",

I love it as a CMS. But I often feel like I push it to its limits. As a back-end developer who deals with complex data and builds applications, I\u2019ve needed alternatives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I found the <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/\">Laravel<\/a> framework!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning Laravel and being immersed in its ecosystem &#8211; the tooling, the learning resources, the people in the community &#8211; has been hugely beneficial for my work and career. Including ongoing WordPress work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I want to bring those benefits to others who&#8217;ve not found these things yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-white-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-1024x147.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9465\" width=\"501\" height=\"72\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-1024x147.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-300x43.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-768x110.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-1536x220.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-2048x293.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, I\u2019m not the only person that spans WordPress and Laravel worlds. But I made a <a href=\"https:\/\/wptolaravel.com\">WordPress-to-Laravel<\/a> course, and some videos about useful PHP tools. And I\u2019ve come to see one of my roles as being a bridge between these communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond WP gives some structure to this. To start with, it will be an occasional email (I can\u2019t promise a schedule) with useful stuff from outside the WP bubble that I think will interest and inspire WordPress developers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If people like it I may expand the format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you will read more and sign up at <a href=\"https:\/\/beyond-wp.com\/\">https:\/\/beyond-wp.com\/<\/a>, and please share this with others. You can follow on Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/beyond_wp\">@beyond_wp<\/a> too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join me in taking a step Beyond WP! It\u2019s exciting and inspiring and fun.<\/p>\n",

I love it as a CMS. But I often feel like I push it to its limits. As a back-end developer who deals with complex data and builds applications, I\u2019ve needed alternatives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I found the <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/\">Laravel<\/a> framework!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning Laravel and being immersed in its ecosystem &#8211; the tooling, the learning resources, the people in the community &#8211; has been hugely beneficial for my work and career. Including ongoing WordPress work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I want to bring those benefits to others who&#8217;ve not found these things yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-white-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-1024x147.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9465\" width=\"501\" height=\"72\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-1024x147.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-300x43.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-768x110.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-1536x220.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Round-logo-in-text-blue@2x-2048x293.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, I\u2019m not the only person that spans WordPress and Laravel worlds. But I made a <a href=\"https:\/\/wptolaravel.com\">WordPress-to-Laravel<\/a> course, and some videos about useful PHP tools. And I\u2019ve come to see one of my roles as being a bridge between these communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond WP gives some structure to this. To start with, it will be an occasional email (I can\u2019t promise a schedule) with useful stuff from outside the WP bubble that I think will interest and inspire WordPress developers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If people like it I may expand the format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you will read more and sign up at <a href=\"https:\/\/beyond-wp.com\/\">https:\/\/beyond-wp.com\/<\/a>, and please share this with others. You can follow on Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/beyond_wp\">@beyond_wp<\/a> too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join me in taking a step Beyond WP! It\u2019s exciting and inspiring and fun.<\/p>\n",

But I think there&#8217;s an opportunity to do everything better.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caveats: OK, I&#8217;m not an economist; I&#8217;m not a town planner. I have no expertise here. I&#8217;m well aware of this. And I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a reason no one is talking about this particular approach. But I present it anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A dream<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a sub-urban town where COVID changed everything for the better. The high street was dying, but the council saw an opportunity and took it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cars are few and far between. Congestion is minimal. Yet the high street thrives. White-collar office workers can choose to work from home, or to gather with colleagues in town-centre offices. Their commutes are short and many cycle or use the cheap, electric buses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Health has improved. Air quality is high. The local economy is booming. Social mobility is high and unemployment is low.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Planners from other towns come just to see what has been done. It is a model of sustainable and equitable growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how did they get there from here?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This town is a dream, of course. But I&#8217;ve long had ideas about how the high street might look different based on my experience of many years working both in corporates and for myself as a freelance, remote and home worker. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Remote Working Fallacy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The COVID 19 lockdown has forced many people to work from home and there has been a boom in remote and home working. Large companies have announced that offices will be closed for the medium term, or that remote working will now be permanent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, the UK government are urging people to go back to work to stimulate life and the economy in city and town centres. And I&#8217;m seeing a lot of push-back on this idea of the return to office life: home working has been shown to be effective; why should we return?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Yet, in my bubble at least, I&#8217;m seeing overwhelming support for home\/remote working, and little critique of it.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, my bubble contains a lot of white collar office and information sector workers, many of whom already home work or remote work. And this includes myself &#8211; effectively a home\/remote worker for the last 10 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The downside to the economy has been discussed a LOT. But other issues haven&#8217;t. So beyond the death of Pret-a-Manger and the obvious &#8220;you can&#8217;t chat in person with your colleagues&#8221; thing (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/helloalegria\/status\/1301290315593191426\/photo\/1\">today known as &#8220;Proper bants&#8221;, &#8220;The boss&#8217;s jokes&#8221; and &#8220;Hearing buzzwords&#8221;<\/a>), what might the critique of home-working be?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a few things that bother me about it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Equality<\/strong>: Not everyone has an office or spare room in their house that they can use to work from. So if you require people to work from home there&#8217;s no guarantee that they have an appropriate space to work from, and you might put off attracting people into jobs if they don&#8217;t have such a space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Equipment<\/strong>: Full-time office work from home requires a desk, a decent chair, a decent, ergonomic keyboard and mouse, and if you&#8217;re doing video calls you may want a better camera and mic than you have in your laptop, or maybe a headset.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure many employers happily provide these, but I&#8217;m also sure that some won&#8217;t, expecting the employer to stump up for them instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Health and Safety<\/strong>: Large offices usually have people who do health and safety, ergonomics and occupational health. I wonder how much of this crucial input to the well-being of employees is missed with home\/remote working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transitions<\/strong>: I actually find the transition between home and work very useful. Granted, my commute is normally a 15 &#8211; 20 minute bike ride, but even a bus ride is a good time to chill out, reflect on what&#8217;s coming or has happened in the day, listen to a podcast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find the near-instant transition from work-brain to home\/dad-brain when I&#8217;m working at home really quite difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, my bike ride is one of my main forms of regular exercise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The home-to-office transition is actually very useful for some. But only if it&#8217;s short.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I also think we have a real problem with long-distance commuting, which is bad for people, really expensive, and unsustainable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Utility costs<\/strong>: Office-working from home requires a good, fast internet connection, and working from home will increase your utility bills. Plus you&#8217;ll have to provide things like your own tea\/coffee. These are savings for the employer, but I wonder if they are passed on?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguably, if the employee was commuting to the office, then they could be saving money here. And the employer may need additional IT infrastructure to provide things like VPNs. So some things will balance out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do wonder if some unscrupulous companies might see this as a way to cut costs at the expense of employees absorbing the impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, my main worry is that some corporates might see this as a chance to ditch large office costs, but then not fulfill their new responsibilities to their new home-workers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could be wrong, and I&#8217;m sure that most companies will do a good job here. But I&#8217;m also sure that not all will.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s sum up:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remote\/homeworking has benefits:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Employees don&#8217;t have to commute.<\/li><li>Employees get more flexibility.<\/li><li>Employers can recruit from a broader pool of (non-local) people.<\/li><li>Employers potentially have much lower costs.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But remote\/home working may have drawbacks for some people:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>A negative effect on the town\/city-centre economy.<\/li><li>Issues with not meeting and working face-to-face.<\/li><li>Employees may not have a space to work in and this may prevent people from applying for or getting jobs.<\/li><li>Employers may not invest in employees&#8217; well-being and compensate them for additional equipment and utilities.<\/li><li>Employees may lack useful transition time or not get exercise &#8211; never leaving the house can be a thing!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The high street issue<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the high-street issue is pretty clear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The boom in online shopping and the exodus of companies from expensive town-centre offices, all compounded by the effects of COVID 19, means retail on the high street is dying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, by my observation, service industries still seem to be doing OK, if not booming! There are SO many cafe&#8217;s and coffee shops in my local town centre now. I still travel in specifically to do banking sometimes. People seem to use hairdressers and gyms and post offices and so on. Things that you have to go in person to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So what can we do instead? How do we get the benefits of home remote working and avoid the pitfalls, while also benefiting the high street?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Remote working hubs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s where the dream comes in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The council, with support and commitment from a collective of companies, converts some dis-used office space in the town centre into remote working hubs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Larger companies, with a workforce spread across a number of different &#8220;home&#8221; locations, rent space in these hubs for the employees that live in and around that town.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The space is secure and has good connectivity secured by the company VPN. It&#8217;s the company&#8217;s space, so they are still required to furnish and equip it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular visits from health and safety\/occupational health ensure legal compliance and wellbeing of staff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smaller companies can rent this space too, and you could build in co-working for individuals. The space can run events &#8211; both educational and social &#8211; for people that use the building. Co-working spaces like this have begun to thrive in recent years prior to COVID 19 and lockdown!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Travel planning is done properly and multiple incentives are offered to encourage employees to not use single-occupancy cars, with walking, cycling and well-subsidised bus networks encouraging people to not use cars at all unless they have special needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the high street, retail declines, but services boom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People go back to the town centre in the week. They eat and drink in the morning and at lunchtime, sure. But there are also collection and return points for their online-ordered goods. They get their hair cut or do a bit of shopping in their lunch break and pick up some things for dinner before going home. Maybe they pop out for dinner with some colleagues or visit a bar or cinema after work? They try out technology in phone shops and get advice and customer service in person for things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This plan:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>taps into the booming co-working culture;<\/li><li>gives people the flexibility of choosing home OR office work;<\/li><li>reduces commute distances\/times while still enabling transitions if people want them;<\/li><li>gets people into the town centre and grows town-centre service economies, while propping up retail a little too;<\/li><li>enables employees to be properly supported by employers in an real office environment;<\/li><li>retains &#8211; probably improves &#8211; equality of employment opportunities, by not demanding people travel long distances to a central office, but also not demanding they have a space to work from at home<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I see two possible downsides:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>This is more expensive for larger employers as they may now maintain multiple office locations.<\/li><li>Large corporates may not be happy sharing a building with other large corporates. Could information leak between them if people intermingle in communal areas? What are the physical and &#8220;cyber&#8221; security risks? Are they worse than home-working? Or just different?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Could this work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There will certainly be office-based roles that need to be in a specific location. But this approach seems, to me, to be hugely beneficial to pretty much everyone. A best-of-both-worlds compromise between central offices and home-working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder why it&#8217;s not been discussed much? Has it not been thought of? Is it just too hard a change to make? Are those security issues just too big a barrier to overcome?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said at the start &#8211; I&#8217;m not qualified to be coming up with ideas like this and analysing the pros and cons. So: over to you&#8230; who IS? Could this work? What are the blockers? How might we take steps towards this dream?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>The high street is dying. Remote\/home working as a result of COVID 19 is exacerbating this. But I think there&#8217;s an opportunity to do everything better.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caveats: OK, I&#8217;m not an economist; I&#8217;m not a town planner. I have no expertise here. I&#8217;m well aware of this. And I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a reason no one is talking about this particular approach. But I present it anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A dream<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a sub-urban town where COVID changed everything for the better. The high street was dying, but the council saw an opportunity and took it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cars are few and far between. Congestion is minimal. Yet the high street thrives. White-collar office workers can choose to work from home, or to gather with colleagues in town-centre offices. Their commutes are short and many cycle or use the cheap, electric buses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Health has improved. Air quality is high. The local economy is booming. Social mobility is high and unemployment is low.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Planners from other towns come just to see what has been done. It is a model of sustainable and equitable growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how did they get there from here?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This town is a dream, of course. But I&#8217;ve long had ideas about how the high street might look different based on my experience of many years working both in corporates and for myself as a freelance, remote and home worker. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Remote Working Fallacy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The COVID 19 lockdown has forced many people to work from home and there has been a boom in remote and home working. Large companies have announced that offices will be closed for the medium term, or that remote working will now be permanent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, the UK government are urging people to go back to work to stimulate life and the economy in city and town centres. And I&#8217;m seeing a lot of push-back on this idea of the return to office life: home working has been shown to be effective; why should we return?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Yet, in my bubble at least, I&#8217;m seeing overwhelming support for home\/remote working, and little critique of it.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, my bubble contains a lot of white collar office and information sector workers, many of whom already home work or remote work. And this includes myself &#8211; effectively a home\/remote worker for the last 10 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The downside to the economy has been discussed a LOT. But other issues haven&#8217;t. So beyond the death of Pret-a-Manger and the obvious &#8220;you can&#8217;t chat in person with your colleagues&#8221; thing (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/helloalegria\/status\/1301290315593191426\/photo\/1\">today known as &#8220;Proper bants&#8221;, &#8220;The boss&#8217;s jokes&#8221; and &#8220;Hearing buzzwords&#8221;<\/a>), what might the critique of home-working be?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a few things that bother me about it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Equality<\/strong>: Not everyone has an office or spare room in their house that they can use to work from. So if you require people to work from home there&#8217;s no guarantee that they have an appropriate space to work from, and you might put off attracting people into jobs if they don&#8217;t have such a space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Equipment<\/strong>: Full-time office work from home requires a desk, a decent chair, a decent, ergonomic keyboard and mouse, and if you&#8217;re doing video calls you may want a better camera and mic than you have in your laptop, or maybe a headset.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure many employers happily provide these, but I&#8217;m also sure that some won&#8217;t, expecting the employer to stump up for them instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Health and Safety<\/strong>: Large offices usually have people who do health and safety, ergonomics and occupational health. I wonder how much of this crucial input to the well-being of employees is missed with home\/remote working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transitions<\/strong>: I actually find the transition between home and work very useful. Granted, my commute is normally a 15 &#8211; 20 minute bike ride, but even a bus ride is a good time to chill out, reflect on what&#8217;s coming or has happened in the day, listen to a podcast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find the near-instant transition from work-brain to home\/dad-brain when I&#8217;m working at home really quite difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, my bike ride is one of my main forms of regular exercise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The home-to-office transition is actually very useful for some. But only if it&#8217;s short.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I also think we have a real problem with long-distance commuting, which is bad for people, really expensive, and unsustainable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Utility costs<\/strong>: Office-working from home requires a good, fast internet connection, and working from home will increase your utility bills. Plus you&#8217;ll have to provide things like your own tea\/coffee. These are savings for the employer, but I wonder if they are passed on?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguably, if the employee was commuting to the office, then they could be saving money here. And the employer may need additional IT infrastructure to provide things like VPNs. So some things will balance out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do wonder if some unscrupulous companies might see this as a way to cut costs at the expense of employees absorbing the impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, my main worry is that some corporates might see this as a chance to ditch large office costs, but then not fulfill their new responsibilities to their new home-workers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could be wrong, and I&#8217;m sure that most companies will do a good job here. But I&#8217;m also sure that not all will.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s sum up:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remote\/homeworking has benefits:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Employees don&#8217;t have to commute.<\/li><li>Employees get more flexibility.<\/li><li>Employers can recruit from a broader pool of (non-local) people.<\/li><li>Employers potentially have much lower costs.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But remote\/home working may have drawbacks for some people:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>A negative effect on the town\/city-centre economy.<\/li><li>Issues with not meeting and working face-to-face.<\/li><li>Employees may not have a space to work in and this may prevent people from applying for or getting jobs.<\/li><li>Employers may not invest in employees&#8217; well-being and compensate them for additional equipment and utilities.<\/li><li>Employees may lack useful transition time or not get exercise &#8211; never leaving the house can be a thing!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The high street issue<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the high-street issue is pretty clear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The boom in online shopping and the exodus of companies from expensive town-centre offices, all compounded by the effects of COVID 19, means retail on the high street is dying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, by my observation, service industries still seem to be doing OK, if not booming! There are SO many cafe&#8217;s and coffee shops in my local town centre now. I still travel in specifically to do banking sometimes. People seem to use hairdressers and gyms and post offices and so on. Things that you have to go in person to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So what can we do instead? How do we get the benefits of home remote working and avoid the pitfalls, while also benefiting the high street?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Remote working hubs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s where the dream comes in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The council, with support and commitment from a collective of companies, converts some dis-used office space in the town centre into remote working hubs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Larger companies, with a workforce spread across a number of different &#8220;home&#8221; locations, rent space in these hubs for the employees that live in and around that town.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The space is secure and has good connectivity secured by the company VPN. It&#8217;s the company&#8217;s space, so they are still required to furnish and equip it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular visits from health and safety\/occupational health ensure legal compliance and wellbeing of staff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smaller companies can rent this space too, and you could build in co-working for individuals. The space can run events &#8211; both educational and social &#8211; for people that use the building. Co-working spaces like this have begun to thrive in recent years prior to COVID 19 and lockdown!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Travel planning is done properly and multiple incentives are offered to encourage employees to not use single-occupancy cars, with walking, cycling and well-subsidised bus networks encouraging people to not use cars at all unless they have special needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the high street, retail declines, but services boom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People go back to the town centre in the week. They eat and drink in the morning and at lunchtime, sure. But there are also collection and return points for their online-ordered goods. They get their hair cut or do a bit of shopping in their lunch break and pick up some things for dinner before going home. Maybe they pop out for dinner with some colleagues or visit a bar or cinema after work? They try out technology in phone shops and get advice and customer service in person for things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This plan:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>taps into the booming co-working culture;<\/li><li>gives people the flexibility of choosing home OR office work;<\/li><li>reduces commute distances\/times while still enabling transitions if people want them;<\/li><li>gets people into the town centre and grows town-centre service economies, while propping up retail a little too;<\/li><li>enables employees to be properly supported by employers in an real office environment;<\/li><li>retains &#8211; probably improves &#8211; equality of employment opportunities, by not demanding people travel long distances to a central office, but also not demanding they have a space to work from at home<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I see two possible downsides:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>This is more expensive for larger employers as they may now maintain multiple office locations.<\/li><li>Large corporates may not be happy sharing a building with other large corporates. Could information leak between them if people intermingle in communal areas? What are the physical and &#8220;cyber&#8221; security risks? Are they worse than home-working? Or just different?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Could this work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There will certainly be office-based roles that need to be in a specific location. But this approach seems, to me, to be hugely beneficial to pretty much everyone. A best-of-both-worlds compromise between central offices and home-working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder why it&#8217;s not been discussed much? Has it not been thought of? Is it just too hard a change to make? Are those security issues just too big a barrier to overcome?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said at the start &#8211; I&#8217;m not qualified to be coming up with ideas like this and analysing the pros and cons. So: over to you&#8230; who IS? Could this work? What are the blockers? How might we take steps towards this dream?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

That&#8217;s really NOT my intention. I&#8217;ve tried to say that I think Laravel and Jetstream are amazing things and Taylor has my utmost respect and thanks. My comments are meant to be entirely constructive. And I&#8217;ve presented small, concrete things that I think could improve first-time experience with Jetstream for some audiences.<\/li><li>I come at this from the point of view of someone who&#8217;s far from a Laravel expert &#8211; I&#8217;m really still learning. But that&#8217;s part of my point: for someone in my position, Jetstream feels a bit inaccessible.<\/li><li>Taylor Otwell (the creator of Laravel) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=krn39HjxPTs\">has clarified<\/a> that he made Jetstream as the kind of thing that HE would use. So in some ways, any critique of it from a less-experienced Laravel developer&#8217;s perspective (which is what this article presents) isn&#8217;t valid. Is it fair to say that it seems this is not a tool intended for beginners with the framework?<\/li><li>However, I feel that with a few small changes and some additions to the documentation, it could be made more accessible for beginners and this would be a good thing for everyone.<\/li><li>Yes, I should have read more of the docs before diving in. But Jetstream seems too inviting, I dived in headfirst and so got stuck. That&#8217;s a lesson for me. <\/li><li>It&#8217;s because I think Laravel and Jetstream are awesome that I&#8217;d love them to be more accessible to more developers. Jetstream is actually a really good example of a set of components and classes at work, and it could serve as some easily explorable code demonstrating good practices. Auth scaffolding is like the &#8220;Hello world&#8221; of Laravel and I&#8217;d love for it to be as easy for the first time Laravel dev to explore as it is for the experienced one.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel 8 is out today, along with the amazing new &#8220;Jetstream&#8221; authentication scaffolding that has been built.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve just worked through doing a quick install and had a poke around and it is incredible what you get out of the box now. But also, I have two issues with it. This isn&#8217;t really a rant, I do love it. Just observations and possible things that could be thought about for the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. The barrier to entry is too high now<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you install Laravel + Jetstream (the Livewire version), you are now faced with this as your welcome template:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;x-app-layout&gt;\n    &lt;x-slot name=&quot;header&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;h2 class=&quot;font-semibold text-xl text-gray-800 leading-tight&quot;&gt;\n            Dashboard\n        &lt;\/h2&gt;\n    &lt;\/x-slot&gt;\n\n    &lt;div class=&quot;py-12&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;max-w-7xl mx-auto sm:px-6 lg:px-8&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;bg-white overflow-hidden shadow-xl sm:rounded-lg&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;x-jet-welcome \/&gt;\n            &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/x-app-layout&gt;\n\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>My first question was &#8220;How can I customise the welcome component? That <code>&lt;x-jet-welcome \/&gt;<\/code> bit?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I spent half an hour tracking down the <code>JetstreamServiceProvider.php<\/code> which registers all the components using this method:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nprotected function registerComponent(string $component)\n    {\n        Blade::component('jetstream::components.'.$component, 'jet-'.$component);\n    }\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And what&#8217;s super-annoying about this is that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>a) Because the <code>registerComponent()<\/code> method dynamically prefixes the component name with <code>'jet-<\/code>&#8216;, you can&#8217;t search the code for the full component name and find where it&#8217;s registered<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>b) Even if you could, it wouldn&#8217;t help very much finding the component template, but it would at least leave you able to search for the component name and find something!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So anyone without a pretty good grasp of Blade components and how to dive around in the vendor directory to find stuff, is going to be a bit stuck!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless they notice that you can publish the components (if you know what that means), which you need to do to modify them. Sure, you can find out about publishing the components by reading <a href=\"https:\/\/jetstream.laravel.com\/1.x\/installation.html#livewire-components\">the Jetstream docs<\/a>. But I was keen to dive in and thought it would be easy to see how to edit what is effectively the &#8220;Hello world&#8221; page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like if I came from basic PHP, or some other eco system into Laravel now, I&#8217;d get stuck pretty quickly. There&#8217;s a LOT of implied knowledge needed to get started: Tailwind; Blade Components; Livewire\/Inertia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That barrier to entry just got a whole heap higher!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. There&#8217;s too much out of the box<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>[Note: Taylor took note of people&#8217;s feedback on this and has disabled the API and profile photos by default as of <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/laravel\/jetstream\/releases\/tag\/v1.3.2\">version 1.3.2<\/a>!]<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E8pZvl6L5N4\">a live-streamed chat<\/a> with some WordPress friends today about the benefits of looking into Laravel if you&#8217;re a WordPress developer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one thing I said was that so often with WordPress core and many plugins, I find myself with too much stuff and wanting to turn some of it off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really think that the out-of-the box Laravel Jetstream setup has too much turned on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>API tokens<\/li><li>Profile photos<\/li><li>2FA<\/li><li>Account deleting<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I LOVE that I could turn these on with a single-line-of-code change, but, perhaps with the exception of 2FA, should these really all be on by default? I&#8217;m really not sure they should, and my first step on many projects will be to turn some of these features off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is easy enough to do: the <code>config\/jetstream.php<\/code> file has a features array that allows you to turn off profile pictures and the API bits:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n    'features' =&gt; &#x5B;\n        Features::profilePhotos(),\n        Features::api(),\n        \/\/ Features::teams(),\n    ],\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p> But I still think they should be off by default!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">In summary<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a slightly-experienced Laravel developer, this is all really exciting stuff, if a little enigmatic in places &#8211; how DOES this stuff work!?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as someone who wants to introduce people to Laravel as a way to build cool stuff, I really feel like there are some issues here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But who am I to say? Kudos to Taylor and the team for an awesome release.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m off to build something!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>UPDATE &#8211; 6\/10\/2020<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article was written before the Jetstream Drama over the weekend and it&#8217;s worth clarifying a few things, and saying what I&#8217;ve learned from the drama.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>I really hope I didn&#8217;t contribute any hate. That&#8217;s really NOT my intention. I&#8217;ve tried to say that I think Laravel and Jetstream are amazing things and Taylor has my utmost respect and thanks. My comments are meant to be entirely constructive. And I&#8217;ve presented small, concrete things that I think could improve first-time experience with Jetstream for some audiences.<\/li><li>I come at this from the point of view of someone who&#8217;s far from a Laravel expert &#8211; I&#8217;m really still learning. But that&#8217;s part of my point: for someone in my position, Jetstream feels a bit inaccessible.<\/li><li>Taylor Otwell (the creator of Laravel) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=krn39HjxPTs\">has clarified<\/a> that he made Jetstream as the kind of thing that HE would use. So in some ways, any critique of it from a less-experienced Laravel developer&#8217;s perspective (which is what this article presents) isn&#8217;t valid. Is it fair to say that it seems this is not a tool intended for beginners with the framework?<\/li><li>However, I feel that with a few small changes and some additions to the documentation, it could be made more accessible for beginners and this would be a good thing for everyone.<\/li><li>Yes, I should have read more of the docs before diving in. But Jetstream seems too inviting, I dived in headfirst and so got stuck. That&#8217;s a lesson for me. <\/li><li>It&#8217;s because I think Laravel and Jetstream are awesome that I&#8217;d love them to be more accessible to more developers. Jetstream is actually a really good example of a set of components and classes at work, and it could serve as some easily explorable code demonstrating good practices. Auth scaffolding is like the &#8220;Hello world&#8221; of Laravel and I&#8217;d love for it to be as easy for the first time Laravel dev to explore as it is for the experienced one.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel 8 is out today, along with the amazing new &#8220;Jetstream&#8221; authentication scaffolding that has been built.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve just worked through doing a quick install and had a poke around and it is incredible what you get out of the box now. But also, I have two issues with it. This isn&#8217;t really a rant, I do love it. Just observations and possible things that could be thought about for the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. The barrier to entry is too high now<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you install Laravel + Jetstream (the Livewire version), you are now faced with this as your welcome template:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;x-app-layout&gt;\n    &lt;x-slot name=&quot;header&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;h2 class=&quot;font-semibold text-xl text-gray-800 leading-tight&quot;&gt;\n            Dashboard\n        &lt;\/h2&gt;\n    &lt;\/x-slot&gt;\n\n    &lt;div class=&quot;py-12&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;max-w-7xl mx-auto sm:px-6 lg:px-8&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;bg-white overflow-hidden shadow-xl sm:rounded-lg&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;x-jet-welcome \/&gt;\n            &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/x-app-layout&gt;\n\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>My first question was &#8220;How can I customise the welcome component? That <code>&lt;x-jet-welcome \/&gt;<\/code> bit?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I spent half an hour tracking down the <code>JetstreamServiceProvider.php<\/code> which registers all the components using this method:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nprotected function registerComponent(string $component)\n    {\n        Blade::component('jetstream::components.'.$component, 'jet-'.$component);\n    }\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And what&#8217;s super-annoying about this is that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>a) Because the <code>registerComponent()<\/code> method dynamically prefixes the component name with <code>'jet-<\/code>&#8216;, you can&#8217;t search the code for the full component name and find where it&#8217;s registered<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>b) Even if you could, it wouldn&#8217;t help very much finding the component template, but it would at least leave you able to search for the component name and find something!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So anyone without a pretty good grasp of Blade components and how to dive around in the vendor directory to find stuff, is going to be a bit stuck!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless they notice that you can publish the components (if you know what that means), which you need to do to modify them. Sure, you can find out about publishing the components by reading <a href=\"https:\/\/jetstream.laravel.com\/1.x\/installation.html#livewire-components\">the Jetstream docs<\/a>. But I was keen to dive in and thought it would be easy to see how to edit what is effectively the &#8220;Hello world&#8221; page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like if I came from basic PHP, or some other eco system into Laravel now, I&#8217;d get stuck pretty quickly. There&#8217;s a LOT of implied knowledge needed to get started: Tailwind; Blade Components; Livewire\/Inertia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That barrier to entry just got a whole heap higher!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. There&#8217;s too much out of the box<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>[Note: Taylor took note of people&#8217;s feedback on this and has disabled the API and profile photos by default as of <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/laravel\/jetstream\/releases\/tag\/v1.3.2\">version 1.3.2<\/a>!]<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E8pZvl6L5N4\">a live-streamed chat<\/a> with some WordPress friends today about the benefits of looking into Laravel if you&#8217;re a WordPress developer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one thing I said was that so often with WordPress core and many plugins, I find myself with too much stuff and wanting to turn some of it off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really think that the out-of-the box Laravel Jetstream setup has too much turned on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>API tokens<\/li><li>Profile photos<\/li><li>2FA<\/li><li>Account deleting<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I LOVE that I could turn these on with a single-line-of-code change, but, perhaps with the exception of 2FA, should these really all be on by default? I&#8217;m really not sure they should, and my first step on many projects will be to turn some of these features off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is easy enough to do: the <code>config\/jetstream.php<\/code> file has a features array that allows you to turn off profile pictures and the API bits:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n    'features' =&gt; &#x5B;\n        Features::profilePhotos(),\n        Features::api(),\n        \/\/ Features::teams(),\n    ],\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p> But I still think they should be off by default!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">In summary<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a slightly-experienced Laravel developer, this is all really exciting stuff, if a little enigmatic in places &#8211; how DOES this stuff work!?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as someone who wants to introduce people to Laravel as a way to build cool stuff, I really feel like there are some issues here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But who am I to say? Kudos to Taylor and the team for an awesome release.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m off to build something!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>I have a confession: despite being a WordPress developer since 2010, I&#8217;ve rarely used WooCommerce! Where I have I&#8217;ve only done the very basics. And now I&#8217;m knee deep in a custom WooCommerce project with a lot to figure out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating custom fields on the checkout was a particular area of confusion. Here&#8217;s what I needed:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>A bunch of custom fields&#8230;<\/li><li>with conditional logic (i.e. some fields are only sometimes visible depending on values of other fields)&#8230;<\/li><li>that save in the order (and get displayed in the back-end order screen, and, potentially, in emails)&#8230;<\/li><li>and that can be passed to MailChimp &#8211; again, conditionally, based on the values of some fields.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The logic is something like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Ask if a user is over 18.<\/li><li>If they are collect their year of birth and send it to MailChimp as part of the ordering process.<\/li><li>If they aren&#8217;t collect their date of birth, and only let them order if they are over 13, and send the date of birth to MailChimp as part of the ordering process.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially I was thinking that I could do this with some custom fields plugin maybe? But I consulted with some expert friends and they encouraged me to code this myself. Which, for this application with two interacting integrations (custom fields and MailChimp) and the conditional logic and stuff was probably a good idea. Bullying off-the-shelf plugins into doing this was never going to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that WooCommerce has <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.woocommerce.com\/document\/tutorial-customising-checkout-fields-using-actions-and-filters\/\">a pretty good guide<\/a> to doing most of this. And they have REALLY EXTENSIVE <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.woocommerce.com\/document\/introduction-to-hooks-actions-and-filters\/\">action and filter hooks<\/a> &#8211; so much so that it&#8217;s hard to know what you should be hooking into.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was one thing that tripped me up along the way though. I was trying to write some JavaScript to work on some markup that was added with the <code>woocommerce_checkout_before_terms_and_conditions<\/code> hook, just above the button to make the purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any event handlers added to input in this area were inactive. It was like WooCommerce was removing them or intercepting them somehow, and despite <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/woocommerce\/woocommerce\/blob\/4dd42309315b8938beb47b3e877d0ae8dc56db83\/assets\/js\/frontend\/checkout.js#L247\">source-diving<\/a> a little I&#8217;ve still not quite figured out what it was doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that every time the cart updates via AJAX on the checkout page, the HTML elements are re-created. And there is an update when the page first loads. So any event handlers I added during page initialisation were immediately overridden or remvoed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution was to add my event handlers when the <code>updated_checkout<\/code> event fired in JavaScript. This ensured that after the checkout update, my handlers were added to the elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phew!<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Custom WooCommerce Checkout Fields",
        "content": "\n<p>I have a confession: despite being a WordPress developer since 2010, I&#8217;ve rarely used WooCommerce! Where I have I&#8217;ve only done the very basics. And now I&#8217;m knee deep in a custom WooCommerce project with a lot to figure out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating custom fields on the checkout was a particular area of confusion. Here&#8217;s what I needed:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>A bunch of custom fields&#8230;<\/li><li>with conditional logic (i.e. some fields are only sometimes visible depending on values of other fields)&#8230;<\/li><li>that save in the order (and get displayed in the back-end order screen, and, potentially, in emails)&#8230;<\/li><li>and that can be passed to MailChimp &#8211; again, conditionally, based on the values of some fields.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The logic is something like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Ask if a user is over 18.<\/li><li>If they are collect their year of birth and send it to MailChimp as part of the ordering process.<\/li><li>If they aren&#8217;t collect their date of birth, and only let them order if they are over 13, and send the date of birth to MailChimp as part of the ordering process.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially I was thinking that I could do this with some custom fields plugin maybe? But I consulted with some expert friends and they encouraged me to code this myself. Which, for this application with two interacting integrations (custom fields and MailChimp) and the conditional logic and stuff was probably a good idea. Bullying off-the-shelf plugins into doing this was never going to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that WooCommerce has <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.woocommerce.com\/document\/tutorial-customising-checkout-fields-using-actions-and-filters\/\">a pretty good guide<\/a> to doing most of this. And they have REALLY EXTENSIVE <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.woocommerce.com\/document\/introduction-to-hooks-actions-and-filters\/\">action and filter hooks<\/a> &#8211; so much so that it&#8217;s hard to know what you should be hooking into.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was one thing that tripped me up along the way though. I was trying to write some JavaScript to work on some markup that was added with the <code>woocommerce_checkout_before_terms_and_conditions<\/code> hook, just above the button to make the purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any event handlers added to input in this area were inactive. It was like WooCommerce was removing them or intercepting them somehow, and despite <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/woocommerce\/woocommerce\/blob\/4dd42309315b8938beb47b3e877d0ae8dc56db83\/assets\/js\/frontend\/checkout.js#L247\">source-diving<\/a> a little I&#8217;ve still not quite figured out what it was doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that every time the cart updates via AJAX on the checkout page, the HTML elements are re-created. And there is an update when the page first loads. So any event handlers I added during page initialisation were immediately overridden or remvoed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution was to add my event handlers when the <code>updated_checkout<\/code> event fired in JavaScript. This ensured that after the checkout update, my handlers were added to the elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phew!<\/p>\n",

Outstanding issues I have are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>ScreenFlow and some Rogue Amoeba audio apps don&#8217;t work &#8211; I guess these are doing some clever low-level stuff.<\/li><li>I&#8217;m having issues importing my MySQL databases from backup. This is not really an M1 specific issue, apart from the fact that I can&#8217;t use homebrew to install anything other than the latest version of MariaDB.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some useful links that have helped me out along the way:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Homebrew\/brew\/issues\/7857\">Status of Homebrew on Apple Silicon<\/a><\/li><li>&#8220;Sam&#8221; has <a href=\"https:\/\/soffes.blog\/homebrew-on-apple-silicon\">a tip on running command line stuff using Rosetta<\/a><\/li><li>A clever person figured out that if you make a copy of terminal (or iTerm) and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.notion.so\/Run-x86-Apps-including-homebrew-in-the-Terminal-on-Apple-Silicon-8350b43d97de4ce690f283277e958602\">set it to &#8220;Run as Rosetta&#8221;<\/a> it seems to run any sub-commands using Rosetta too.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll have some write ups &#8211; or possibly unstructured brain dumps &#8211; on stuff I&#8217;ve learned along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>22:42<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside: yarn and npm are the one thing that I&#8217;ve noticed it REALLY FREAKING FAST on this machine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>22:32<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes &#8211; I&#8217;m still at it &#8211; in between other things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;d heard from a friend that lib-sass or node-sass &#8211; I don&#8217;t recall which &#8211; maybe both would fail to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s true. And it raises a whole weird load of questions about how Rosetta works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>yarn and npm both seem to work OK. But if I understand correctly, lib-sass was a compiled binary, and it refused to run with the usual webpack\/npm\/webpack barf, including:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nModule build failed: ModuleBuildError: Module build failed: Error: Node Sass does not yet support your current environment: OS X Unsupported architecture (arm64) with Unsupported runtime (88)\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>So why does everything else seem to run fine under Rosetta, but not this one thing?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, I eventually found a way to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>update <code>node-sass<\/code> to <code>dart-sass<\/code><\/li><li>update the <code>sass-loader<\/code> (v10 is too high &#8211; I get more barf and errors &#8211; v7.1 seems to work)<\/li><li>update the sass-loader config<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This then all runs under node 15, which I have compiled for ARM\/M1. And&#8230;YAY!!! I can successfully build the project I need to put live VERY SOON!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>20:18<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gosh I have a LOT of software!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is going pretty well considering. HOWEVER&#8230;  brew and node are pretty confusing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve basically got brew working, but it&#8217;s giving me this nudge to run it with Rosetta which I have no idea how to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have node v15 installed using <code>brew install -s node<\/code> (I had to run it a few times to get it to work)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can&#8217;t get the &#8216;<code>n<\/code>&#8216; node version manager to do anything &#8211; it&#8217;s installed but won&#8217;t list or install any versions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can&#8217;t get node@10 or node@12 to install with homebrew.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up &#8211; can I actually compile a project that uses node?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>16:28<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While pretty much every download-to-your-applicaitons folder app seems fine, the problems are on command-line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got Homebrew installed. And seem to have compiled my own version of PHP with <code>brew install -s php<\/code>, but I can&#8217;t get a build of nodeJs to compile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps there&#8217;s a better way than homebrew for this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>15:29<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be honest, this is going pretty well. I&#8217;ve not got some system utilities like Moom, Better Touch Tool, Bartender and the Harvest time tracking app installed. I&#8217;ve yet to set them up properly but they all seem to be working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have Sequel Ace for databases and Wavebox for managing some web apps &#8211; this is an Electron app and I thought there was issues with Electron. But seems it&#8217;s OK!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dashdocs, Tweetbot and iTerm are all doing fine now too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nice that MacOS now has zsh by default but there&#8217;s some dotfiles I&#8217;ll need to recover!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14:43<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a school run to do&#8230; back later!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14:17<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have Homebrew and am attempting a PHP 7.4 install. Not sure what&#8217;s gonna happen!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14:15<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tinkerwell and HELO installed. I have iTunes\/Music set up. I&#8217;ve attempted ClamXAV install but need to get a new license. Hmmm&#8230; Hurrying through now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:54<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weird &#8211; having installed the MacOS command-line tools, Firefox seems much happier! Perhaps extensions need some command line thing installed to work?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slack is installed and fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:10<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime I have an update from the Apple Service centre about my old MacBook &#8211; they can&#8217;t do anything. What diagnostics they can do are showing &#8211; surprise! &#8211; logic board failures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s back to Apple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:16<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to have to do some real work now. But just to add:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Homebrew not properly supported yet &#8211; it says to run it under Rosetta, but I don&#8217;t know how you do that from the command line! Work ongoing <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Homebrew\/brew\/issues\/7857\">here<\/a>. Another dev linked from that issue also has <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mikelxc\/Workarounds-for-ARM-mac\">a list of fixes and workarounds<\/a> for things.<\/li><li>PHP 7.3 in installed by default. I have composer running.<\/li><li>Git not installed by default? Having to download Apple&#8217;s command line utilities &#8211; this could take a while!<\/li><li>SourceTree is incoming&#8230;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Also &#8211; I will need to find a way to copy over, or recreate a LOT of configuration from my old machine. Not just dot files, but other stuff too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fun few days ahead!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:07<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not able to specifically point to anything wrong with Firefox extensions, but they generally seem broken. I turned them all off, and I could get a couple of them back on, but the Containers extension and React Dev tools seemed to just break Firefox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This needs sorting FAST!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12:54<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I&#8217;m gonna call it: Something in Firefox doesn&#8217;t work! It kinda opens tabs, but doesn&#8217;t load them. Incognito windows are fine. So it&#8217;s probably extension related.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blazing through app installs &#8211; I have a lot of stuff to install.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this my first Apple Silicon issue though? Wow! Not where I expected it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"368\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-1024x368.png\" alt=\"Operating system error sating &quot;Google Chrome quit unexpectedly&quot;\" class=\"wp-image-9658\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-1024x368.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-300x108.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-768x276.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25.png 1036w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>11:52<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weird that the 1Password APP wouldn&#8217;t take a physical security key.

How do I know if apps are using Rosetta or are built for ARM?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:37<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, so far so good. I have 1Password (was a good test of my own security getting in on a new device!). I have Telegram and WhatsApp for chatting to some people. I have Alfred because I&#8217;m an option-space person, not a Cmd-space one! I&#8217;m downloading Dropbox&#8230;  argh! Is that going to work?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:23<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK &#8211; here I am in WordPress in Safari. First step: Get 1Password up and running so I can log in to stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Install from App Store was OK. But then it wouldn&#8217;t open. Eventually found a little window asking me to install Rosetta. Surprised 1Password isn&#8217;t a universal build yet! But it&#8217;s open and working!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No I\u2019m not \u201cunboxing\u201d it. You don\u2019t care about that. You want to know what software runs on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a dongle. You don\u2019t need a photo of that! ?<br><br>11:04<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/31318691-B160-46B0-BD72-11B2917399CA-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9647\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/31318691-B160-46B0-BD72-11B2917399CA-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/31318691-B160-46B0-BD72-11B2917399CA-300x225.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>11:00<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we are then. I have travelled to the stars (OK, to Cirencester) and I have forged new elements (OK, I have a new laptop with Apple Silicon)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big question is: can I get WordPress on my phone to upload photos?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9:10<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should say that this isn\u2019t some vain, impulse buy. It\u2019s well thought through. I\u2019ve been wanting to upgrade for about two years, but wanted a robust keyboard. That came along from Apple last year. And then Apple Silicon was announced and it\u2019s a call between a) how long before software stops working on Intel and b) how long before it starts working on M1?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I NEED to get a new laptop and I\u2019m trying to play the long game. If I want this machine to be running all my software in 5 or 6 years, the new chips seem to be the right choice. I hope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>8:40<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people have been warning me about compatibility of software and I do have concerns. But I\u2019ve researched and discussed this with people and let me say where I\u2019m at:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t do much\/any virtualisation. I don\u2019t use Docker &#8211; which I know doesn\u2019t work. What virtualisation I do is minimal and not mission-critical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looks like some software that integrates with the OS at low level like screen recorders and audio tools might struggle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There seem to have been concerns around Electron apps but I couldn\u2019t find anything concrete. It looks like Electron apps will build. But I\u2019m not sure what specific tools are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have concerns about Homebrew, PHP, composer, databases. But these are all Linux things right? Creating ARM binaries &#8211; if they don\u2019t already exist &#8211; should be OK?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well &#8211; that\u2019s what we\u2019re about to find out!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8:15 am: My late 2013 MacBook Pro has failed. Totally bricked. Others are reporting this failure too and a fix could be weeks away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m normally a risk-averse person. But for some stupid reason I\u2019ve decided to jump in on day 1 with an Apple Silicon M1 MacBook Air that I\u2019m collecting this morning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will I sink or swim? I know not everything will work on day 1. But will it be disastrous? Or just mildly annoying?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow along and see how it goes. If nothing else it might be an insight into the tools of this full-stack PHP\/WordPress\/Laravel developer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ll post updates here rather than Twitter. I guess you have to revisit occasionally to see what\u2019s going on!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

Outstanding issues I have are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>ScreenFlow and some Rogue Amoeba audio apps don&#8217;t work &#8211; I guess these are doing some clever low-level stuff.<\/li><li>I&#8217;m having issues importing my MySQL databases from backup. This is not really an M1 specific issue, apart from the fact that I can&#8217;t use homebrew to install anything other than the latest version of MariaDB.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some useful links that have helped me out along the way:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Homebrew\/brew\/issues\/7857\">Status of Homebrew on Apple Silicon<\/a><\/li><li>&#8220;Sam&#8221; has <a href=\"https:\/\/soffes.blog\/homebrew-on-apple-silicon\">a tip on running command line stuff using Rosetta<\/a><\/li><li>A clever person figured out that if you make a copy of terminal (or iTerm) and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.notion.so\/Run-x86-Apps-including-homebrew-in-the-Terminal-on-Apple-Silicon-8350b43d97de4ce690f283277e958602\">set it to &#8220;Run as Rosetta&#8221;<\/a> it seems to run any sub-commands using Rosetta too.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll have some write ups &#8211; or possibly unstructured brain dumps &#8211; on stuff I&#8217;ve learned along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>22:42<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside: yarn and npm are the one thing that I&#8217;ve noticed it REALLY FREAKING FAST on this machine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>22:32<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes &#8211; I&#8217;m still at it &#8211; in between other things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;d heard from a friend that lib-sass or node-sass &#8211; I don&#8217;t recall which &#8211; maybe both would fail to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s true. And it raises a whole weird load of questions about how Rosetta works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>yarn and npm both seem to work OK. But if I understand correctly, lib-sass was a compiled binary, and it refused to run with the usual webpack\/npm\/webpack barf, including:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nModule build failed: ModuleBuildError: Module build failed: Error: Node Sass does not yet support your current environment: OS X Unsupported architecture (arm64) with Unsupported runtime (88)\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>So why does everything else seem to run fine under Rosetta, but not this one thing?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, I eventually found a way to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>update <code>node-sass<\/code> to <code>dart-sass<\/code><\/li><li>update the <code>sass-loader<\/code> (v10 is too high &#8211; I get more barf and errors &#8211; v7.1 seems to work)<\/li><li>update the sass-loader config<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This then all runs under node 15, which I have compiled for ARM\/M1. And&#8230;YAY!!! I can successfully build the project I need to put live VERY SOON!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>20:18<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gosh I have a LOT of software!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is going pretty well considering. HOWEVER&#8230;  brew and node are pretty confusing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve basically got brew working, but it&#8217;s giving me this nudge to run it with Rosetta which I have no idea how to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have node v15 installed using <code>brew install -s node<\/code> (I had to run it a few times to get it to work)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can&#8217;t get the &#8216;<code>n<\/code>&#8216; node version manager to do anything &#8211; it&#8217;s installed but won&#8217;t list or install any versions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can&#8217;t get node@10 or node@12 to install with homebrew.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up &#8211; can I actually compile a project that uses node?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>16:28<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While pretty much every download-to-your-applicaitons folder app seems fine, the problems are on command-line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got Homebrew installed. And seem to have compiled my own version of PHP with <code>brew install -s php<\/code>, but I can&#8217;t get a build of nodeJs to compile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps there&#8217;s a better way than homebrew for this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>15:29<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be honest, this is going pretty well. I&#8217;ve not got some system utilities like Moom, Better Touch Tool, Bartender and the Harvest time tracking app installed. I&#8217;ve yet to set them up properly but they all seem to be working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have Sequel Ace for databases and Wavebox for managing some web apps &#8211; this is an Electron app and I thought there was issues with Electron. But seems it&#8217;s OK!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dashdocs, Tweetbot and iTerm are all doing fine now too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nice that MacOS now has zsh by default but there&#8217;s some dotfiles I&#8217;ll need to recover!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14:43<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a school run to do&#8230; back later!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14:17<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have Homebrew and am attempting a PHP 7.4 install. Not sure what&#8217;s gonna happen!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>14:15<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tinkerwell and HELO installed. I have iTunes\/Music set up. I&#8217;ve attempted ClamXAV install but need to get a new license. Hmmm&#8230; Hurrying through now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:54<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weird &#8211; having installed the MacOS command-line tools, Firefox seems much happier! Perhaps extensions need some command line thing installed to work?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slack is installed and fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:10<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime I have an update from the Apple Service centre about my old MacBook &#8211; they can&#8217;t do anything. What diagnostics they can do are showing &#8211; surprise! &#8211; logic board failures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s back to Apple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:16<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to have to do some real work now. But just to add:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Homebrew not properly supported yet &#8211; it says to run it under Rosetta, but I don&#8217;t know how you do that from the command line! Work ongoing <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Homebrew\/brew\/issues\/7857\">here<\/a>. Another dev linked from that issue also has <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mikelxc\/Workarounds-for-ARM-mac\">a list of fixes and workarounds<\/a> for things.<\/li><li>PHP 7.3 in installed by default. I have composer running.<\/li><li>Git not installed by default? Having to download Apple&#8217;s command line utilities &#8211; this could take a while!<\/li><li>SourceTree is incoming&#8230;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Also &#8211; I will need to find a way to copy over, or recreate a LOT of configuration from my old machine. Not just dot files, but other stuff too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fun few days ahead!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>13:07<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not able to specifically point to anything wrong with Firefox extensions, but they generally seem broken. I turned them all off, and I could get a couple of them back on, but the Containers extension and React Dev tools seemed to just break Firefox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This needs sorting FAST!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12:54<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I&#8217;m gonna call it: Something in Firefox doesn&#8217;t work! It kinda opens tabs, but doesn&#8217;t load them. Incognito windows are fine. So it&#8217;s probably extension related.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>12:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blazing through app installs &#8211; I have a lot of stuff to install.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this my first Apple Silicon issue though? Wow! Not where I expected it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"368\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-1024x368.png\" alt=\"Operating system error sating &quot;Google Chrome quit unexpectedly&quot;\" class=\"wp-image-9658\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-1024x368.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-300x108.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25-768x276.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-12.06.25.png 1036w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>11:52<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weird that the 1Password APP wouldn&#8217;t take a physical security key.

How do I know if apps are using Rosetta or are built for ARM?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:37<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, so far so good. I have 1Password (was a good test of my own security getting in on a new device!). I have Telegram and WhatsApp for chatting to some people. I have Alfred because I&#8217;m an option-space person, not a Cmd-space one! I&#8217;m downloading Dropbox&#8230;  argh! Is that going to work?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:23<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK &#8211; here I am in WordPress in Safari. First step: Get 1Password up and running so I can log in to stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Install from App Store was OK. But then it wouldn&#8217;t open. Eventually found a little window asking me to install Rosetta. Surprised 1Password isn&#8217;t a universal build yet! But it&#8217;s open and working!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:06<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No I\u2019m not \u201cunboxing\u201d it. You don\u2019t care about that. You want to know what software runs on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a dongle. You don\u2019t need a photo of that! ?<br><br>11:04<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/31318691-B160-46B0-BD72-11B2917399CA-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9647\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/31318691-B160-46B0-BD72-11B2917399CA-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/31318691-B160-46B0-BD72-11B2917399CA-300x225.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>11:00<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we are then. I have travelled to the stars (OK, to Cirencester) and I have forged new elements (OK, I have a new laptop with Apple Silicon)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big question is: can I get WordPress on my phone to upload photos?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9:10<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should say that this isn\u2019t some vain, impulse buy. It\u2019s well thought through. I\u2019ve been wanting to upgrade for about two years, but wanted a robust keyboard. That came along from Apple last year. And then Apple Silicon was announced and it\u2019s a call between a) how long before software stops working on Intel and b) how long before it starts working on M1?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I NEED to get a new laptop and I\u2019m trying to play the long game. If I want this machine to be running all my software in 5 or 6 years, the new chips seem to be the right choice. I hope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>8:40<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people have been warning me about compatibility of software and I do have concerns. But I\u2019ve researched and discussed this with people and let me say where I\u2019m at:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t do much\/any virtualisation. I don\u2019t use Docker &#8211; which I know doesn\u2019t work. What virtualisation I do is minimal and not mission-critical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looks like some software that integrates with the OS at low level like screen recorders and audio tools might struggle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There seem to have been concerns around Electron apps but I couldn\u2019t find anything concrete. It looks like Electron apps will build. But I\u2019m not sure what specific tools are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have concerns about Homebrew, PHP, composer, databases. But these are all Linux things right? Creating ARM binaries &#8211; if they don\u2019t already exist &#8211; should be OK?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well &#8211; that\u2019s what we\u2019re about to find out!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8:15 am: My late 2013 MacBook Pro has failed. Totally bricked. Others are reporting this failure too and a fix could be weeks away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m normally a risk-averse person. But for some stupid reason I\u2019ve decided to jump in on day 1 with an Apple Silicon M1 MacBook Air that I\u2019m collecting this morning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will I sink or swim? I know not everything will work on day 1. But will it be disastrous? Or just mildly annoying?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow along and see how it goes. If nothing else it might be an insight into the tools of this full-stack PHP\/WordPress\/Laravel developer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ll post updates here rather than Twitter. I guess you have to revisit occasionally to see what\u2019s going on!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

Which is odd. This MUST be configurable from somewhere, but I didn&#8217;t get to finding out where it was. <code>\/some\/homebrew\/path\/etc<\/code> would be the obvious place. And there is a file there, but it doesn&#8217;t have much config in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll have to dig in to this to find out yourself. I would assume MySQL has some default location it&#8217;s reading from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Starting and stopping MySQL\/MariaDB using homebrew<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Worth a quick note that you can start and stop homebrew-installed MySQL\/MariaDB as a service using:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>\/some\/homebrew\/path\/bin\/brew services start &lt;servicename><\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>\/some\/homebrew\/path\/bin\/brew services start mariadb@10.4<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What even IS DBngin?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DBngin is a free MacOS app that lets you install\/start\/stop different databases. I figured all this out while I was moving to a new Mac and so thought I&#8217;d give it a go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s limited in that it doesn&#8217;t include MariaDB yet. One of my big issues was &#8211; I think &#8211; incompatibilities between MariaDB and MySQL when reading data files.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where are DBngin MySQL binaries?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DBngin puts binaries in <code>\/Users\/Shared\/DBngin\/mysql\/&lt;version><\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where does DBngin put data files?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DBngin puts data files in <code>\/Users\/&lt;you>\/Library\/Application Support\/com.tinyapp.DBngin\/engines\/mysql\/&lt;some ID><\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I discovered while doing this migration that if there are not files called <code>auto.cnf<\/code> and <code>com.tinyapp.DBngin.mysqld-&lt;some ID>.plist<\/code> in this directory then the whole directory will be wiped clean when you use DBngin to start up the database.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you empty this directory and copy a bunch of existing data files into it then you&#8217;ll immediately have them all deleted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">That&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>is all I got!<\/p>\n",

Which is odd. This MUST be configurable from somewhere, but I didn&#8217;t get to finding out where it was. <code>\/some\/homebrew\/path\/etc<\/code> would be the obvious place. And there is a file there, but it doesn&#8217;t have much config in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll have to dig in to this to find out yourself. I would assume MySQL has some default location it&#8217;s reading from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Starting and stopping MySQL\/MariaDB using homebrew<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Worth a quick note that you can start and stop homebrew-installed MySQL\/MariaDB as a service using:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>\/some\/homebrew\/path\/bin\/brew services start &lt;servicename><\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>\/some\/homebrew\/path\/bin\/brew services start mariadb@10.4<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What even IS DBngin?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DBngin is a free MacOS app that lets you install\/start\/stop different databases. I figured all this out while I was moving to a new Mac and so thought I&#8217;d give it a go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s limited in that it doesn&#8217;t include MariaDB yet. One of my big issues was &#8211; I think &#8211; incompatibilities between MariaDB and MySQL when reading data files.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where are DBngin MySQL binaries?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DBngin puts binaries in <code>\/Users\/Shared\/DBngin\/mysql\/&lt;version><\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where does DBngin put data files?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DBngin puts data files in <code>\/Users\/&lt;you>\/Library\/Application Support\/com.tinyapp.DBngin\/engines\/mysql\/&lt;some ID><\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I discovered while doing this migration that if there are not files called <code>auto.cnf<\/code> and <code>com.tinyapp.DBngin.mysqld-&lt;some ID>.plist<\/code> in this directory then the whole directory will be wiped clean when you use DBngin to start up the database.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you empty this directory and copy a bunch of existing data files into it then you&#8217;ll immediately have them all deleted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">That&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>is all I got!<\/p>\n",

I don&#8217;t have an answer &#8211; maybe you do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a WP multisite running in sub-DIRECTORIES. And it has a domain alias pointing at it. There are some redirection plugins installed but these turned out to be irrelevant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The domain alias was redirecting to the main domain BUT\u2026 it was stripping any path off. So:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>https:\/\/my-domain-alias.com\/some-path<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>was being redirected to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"CaiUphoKdn\"><a href=\"https:\/\/my-domain.com\/\">Home<\/a><\/blockquote><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Home&#8221; &#8212; MY DOMAIN\" src=\"https:\/\/my-domain.com\/embed\/#?secret=CfqtbRYuG4#?secret=CaiUphoKdn\" data-secret=\"CaiUphoKdn\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which was annoying because I wanted the path so I could do further redirects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I experimented and eliminated the other redirection plugins as a cause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I added some stuff to <code>wp-config.php<\/code> to trap my requests. These WERE being triggered and so I eliminated the web server as a cause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I figured WordPress core was doing a redirect to the main domain without the URL.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/maybe_redirect_404\/\"><code>maybe_redirect_404<\/code><\/a> function that seems to do the redirect I&#8217;m describing and runs in multisite IF a <code>NOBLOGREDIRECT<\/code> constant is set. But this constant was NOT set.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then tried trapping the request in a must-use plugin, figuring that this was the earliest I could load anything custom, but this code wasn&#8217;t being hit!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this redirect was happening AFTER loading <code>wp-config.php<\/code> but before mu-plugins are loaded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really odd. I&#8217;ve added the hacky fix of redirecting from <code>wp-config.php<\/code> but I&#8217;m not very happy about doing so!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does anyone with WP Multisite internals knowlegde know what&#8217;s going on here?<\/p>\n",

And it has a domain alias pointing at it. There are some redirection plugins installed but these turned out to be irrelevant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The domain alias was redirecting to the main domain BUT\u2026 it was stripping any path off. So:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>https:\/\/my-domain-alias.com\/some-path<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>was being redirected to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"CaiUphoKdn\"><a href=\"https:\/\/my-domain.com\/\">Home<\/a><\/blockquote><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Home&#8221; &#8212; MY DOMAIN\" src=\"https:\/\/my-domain.com\/embed\/#?secret=CfqtbRYuG4#?secret=CaiUphoKdn\" data-secret=\"CaiUphoKdn\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which was annoying because I wanted the path so I could do further redirects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I experimented and eliminated the other redirection plugins as a cause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I added some stuff to <code>wp-config.php<\/code> to trap my requests. These WERE being triggered and so I eliminated the web server as a cause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I figured WordPress core was doing a redirect to the main domain without the URL.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/maybe_redirect_404\/\"><code>maybe_redirect_404<\/code><\/a> function that seems to do the redirect I&#8217;m describing and runs in multisite IF a <code>NOBLOGREDIRECT<\/code> constant is set. But this constant was NOT set.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then tried trapping the request in a must-use plugin, figuring that this was the earliest I could load anything custom, but this code wasn&#8217;t being hit!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this redirect was happening AFTER loading <code>wp-config.php<\/code> but before mu-plugins are loaded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really odd. I&#8217;ve added the hacky fix of redirecting from <code>wp-config.php<\/code> but I&#8217;m not very happy about doing so!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does anyone with WP Multisite internals knowlegde know what&#8217;s going on here?<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>I was listening to the <a href=\"https:\/\/noplanstomerge.com\/63\">No Plans To Merge guys today discussing the rebuild of Laravel Livewire<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a segment where they were talking about the difference between building an application and building a framework and how you start to build things one way that\u2019s a bit hacky to get things going and then completely rework things later on to make it more modular.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I realised that this is KINDA what I\u2019m doing with building <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wpui_app\">WP-UI<\/a>. And so I thought it was time to get some rambling thoughts down on paper about WP-UI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"What is WP-UI?\">What is WP-UI?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wpui_app\">WP-UI<\/a> is a desktop app I\u2019m building in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.electronjs.org\/\">Electron<\/a> that makes working with WordPress quick and easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s quite hard to explain, but:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>If you know what <a href=\"https:\/\/wp-cli.org\/\">WP-CLI<\/a> is, then the aim is for it to be a GUI version of that.<\/li><li>If you know what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.phpmyadmin.net\/\">PHPMyAdmin<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adminer.org\/\">Adminer<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/sequelpro.com\/\">Sequel Pro<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/sequel-ace.com\/\">Sequel Ace<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.araelium.com\/querious\">Querious<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tableplus.io\/\">Table Plus<\/a> are then it\u2019s like a WordPress-aware version of that that requires no SQL knowledge.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen-1024x649.jpg\" alt=\"Screen grab of WP-UI\" class=\"wp-image-9787\" width=\"768\" height=\"487\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen-1024x649.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen-300x190.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen-768x487.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen.jpg 1365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><figcaption>Screengrab of WP-UI showing a post list<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>WP-UI lets you inspect WordPress data quickly and easily. And ultimately I\u2019d like you to be able to modify data through it and take actions like managing plugins and themes, deleting transients, running cron jobs &#8211; lots of the things WP-CLI lets you do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Why I\u2019m building it\">Why I\u2019m building it<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kinda because I wanted it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d seen a product called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/invoker.dev\/\">Invoker<\/a>\u201d that does a similar thing for Laravel applications, and thought \u201cI\u2019d love this for WordPress\u201d. And I had <a href=\"https:\/\/desktopappswithelectron.com\/\">a video course on building Electron apps<\/a>. So I put the two together and started building to see what was possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My initial aim was to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>See if my initial ideas were possible<\/li><li>Learn some more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.electronjs.org\/\">Electron<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/vuejs.org\/\">Vue.js<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/\">Tailwind CSS<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But I got in quite deep beyond an initial prototype!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"How I\u2019m building WP-UI\">How I\u2019m building WP-UI<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.electronjs.org\/\">Electron<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/vuejs.org\/\">VueJS.<\/a> I currently use <a href=\"https:\/\/router.vuejs.org\/\">vue-router<\/a>, but not <a href=\"https:\/\/vuex.vuejs.org\/\">vuex<\/a>. I\u2019m kinda putting off adding vuex into the mix because it seems to come with warnings of \u201cyou probably don\u2019t need this\u201d, yet I think it\u2019s inevitable for what I\u2019m doing here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m styling with <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/\">TailwindCSS<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\/\">TailwindUI<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the abstractions I currently have that power the thing, I have a bunch of Vue components for things like table headers, rows and data items. These help componentise the markup, which is essential for using Tailwind without going crazy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a fairly good abstraction for running PHP\/WordPress. Electron has a node back-end that lets me call command line commands. So I\u2019m running a PHP command line instance and passing it some PHP code to run, then catching the output of the command.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The abstraction automatically uses the PHP binary set in the applications options, and loads <code class=\"code-inline\">wp-load.php<\/code> (I should do this more intelligently &#8211; it assumes it\u2019s in the root of your project for now).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This PHP code has to echo something out that we can get back into JavaScript for display. You usually end with something like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code class=\"code-inline\">echo json_encode( [ ... some stuff you need \u2026 ] );<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, back in JavaScript\/Vue land you JSON.parse the output back into a usable object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This all works nicely and doesn\u2019t require any plugins or anything to be installed into WordPress. Writing PHP code inside a JavaScript string is pretty weird but I\u2019m not doing anything hugely complex. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a better way though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should add that I\u2019m trying, where possible, to use WordPress APIs rather than going straight to writing SQL queries, though in some cases SQL is needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an extra abstraction, the application uses lots of \u201cpost lists\u201d. So I\u2019ve build a post list API that runs instances of <code>WP_Query<\/code> for you and populates a table. You pass it query options and it creates the table for you. It adds pagination, search, and (I hope, eventually) sorting in for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Posts are kinda special and used a lot though, and I\u2019m considering what other abstractions would be helpful. This is where the \u201cam I building a framework?\u201d thing comes in. More on this later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Security\">Security<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I need to jot things down about security while I think of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve honestly not thought through security properly yet. But I guess it works on the principle that if you can use WP-UI on a WordPress install you\u2019ve got shell access anyways so all bets are off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I am thinking through things like: can someone store something in the WordPress database that when I pull it out could do weird stuff on your local machine?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Definitely needs more thought though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"What is your plan for it?\">What is your plan for it?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not entirely sure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d like it to be a paid product of some sort, but there are a LOT of steps to get to that point (licensing, allowing trials, payments and eCommerce, support processes, documentation, legal stuff, tax stuff like VAT, marketing, to name but a few).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several people have asked if I will open source it? But I\u2019ve put a fair bit of time into this now and I consider it an \u201casset\u201d that I think has value and would like to make some money from if I can. And I hope it\u2019s a tool that will have value for others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Will this need to be GPL licensed?\">Will this need to be GPL licensed?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there\u2019s this thing about tools that integrate with WordPress needing to be GPL licensed. I think this is possible without making the source code public. And if I\u2019m to keep it as a paid product then this is what I will want to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Thoughts about extending WP-UI\">Thoughts about extending WP-UI<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where Caleb and Daniel\u2019s discussion application code vs framework code and the iterations of framework code got me thinking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of their conversation was about how, eventually, if you\u2019re writing a framework, it\u2019s good to be super-modular. They talk about how good frameworks seem to end up with \u201cloader\u201d files that contain a bunch of lines that just import functionality from discrete packages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would LOVE for WP-UI to be like this and, subsequently, extendable by others in this sort of way. This is how WP-CLI works. And I think Invoker will eventually have extensions that work like this too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is a REALLY interesting space. I\u2019m kinda chuffed that my brain has gone down the route of thinking like this. I feel like it\u2019s a pretty advanced thing to be thinking of this in abstract enough terms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>RIGHT NOW I\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m almost daily, when working on WP-UI, having to decide if I make a layer abstract or not. Whether to do something quickly so that I can deliver WP-UI into the hands of people, or whether to spend time on refactor to make things more abstract and extendable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, I have a couple of good abstractions as mentioned above:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>One for running PHP (though this could be better) &#8211; a JavaScript class\/object that I can pass some PHP code to and have that code executed in the context of the currently-configured WordPress project.<\/li><li>One for lists of WordPress posts (you basically pass it a set of WP_Query options and it builds the data table)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I think Post Lists will always be \u201cspecial\u201d because they\u2019re quite complex. But I feel like the other tables probably need to be abstracted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can see a world where an extension:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Defines a new \u201cPage\u201d in the app<\/li><li>Gives some PHP code to run that produces output matching a specific format<\/li><li>Specifies how that data output is converted into tables (by specifying column types, which columns are searchable and sortable, for example)<\/li><li>Specifies how rows in the data table map to other, \u201csingle-entry\u201d screens.<\/li><li>Somehow specifies \u201cactions\u201d for rows in the data table that can run PHP code to make stuff happen &#8211; this probably needs variables\/placeholders to be made available somehow.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These \u201cdo I abstract?\u201d questions are huge at this point, because I\u2019m accumulating technical debt. I\u2019m deciding to add work to the pile for myself if I want to make the abstraction later on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m tending towards thinking that I need to get a version 1 out that\u2019s less frameworky and extendable. I want people to be able to use this thing! So that\u2019s v1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then v2 will be a big refactor that makes it more frameworky. Build the internal APIs, define the data formats, then refactor all my internal pages to use those APIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my main App file should become a loader file that contains a bunch of lines that import the pages of the app from discrete packages! Win!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does this mean I\u2019m building a framework? This isn\u2019t what I set out to do!! But maybe I AM! Eeeek!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, something like this would allow you to do stuff like extend WP-UI to allow it to act as a desktop app for managing WooCommerce orders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonkers! (In a good way)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"A brief aside on datatables and UI libraries\">A brief aside on datatables and UI libraries<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While writing this I looked into some datatable libraries like <a href=\"https:\/\/datatables.net\/\">https:\/\/datatables.net\/<\/a> and I came across the <a href=\"https:\/\/vuetifyjs.com\/en\/\">Vuetify<\/a> design framework too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It got me wondering if it would be possible and beneficial to use something like this rather than crafting everything myself with Tailwind UI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the initial phase of this project it\u2019s been SUPER helpful for me to build things by myself with just Tailwind UI taking care of the layout and some styling. I\u2019ve learned a LOT of Vue along the way and really feel like a JavaScript application programmer (which I never thought I would say).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But maybe I\u2019ll eject out into a UI framework like this in future. It certainly seems like I\u2019ve re-invented the wheel a bit! In some cases this may be necessary, but in many I suspect it\u2019s not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"What else would you like it to do?\">What else would you like it to do?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a roadmap with a bunch of minor tweaks, and some bigger ideas. Eventually I\u2019d like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>To allow editing as well as just viewing of data<\/li><li>To handle serialised data nicely somehow<\/li><li>To be able to use with remote (live?!) sites over SSH<\/li><li>To allow actions to be taken, such as updating plugins, or expiring transients<\/li><li>There was also a cool idea that someone suggested where the application could show you the code that it runs. This would allow you to visually build a query or action in WP-UI by selecting the page, filters, pagination options, sorting, etc and then get the WP_Query or other PHP code to paste back into your theme\/plugin\/whatever.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So\u2026lots of ideas. But\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"How does this fit with the block editor and full site editing?\">How does this fit with the block editor and full site editing?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a really interesting question I\u2019ve asked myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block editing, full-site-editing and so on are (in my opinion) turning WordPress away from general content management and towards being a publishing platform that cares less for structure data. Data is being pushed into in-post HTML-comments rather than being made available in a structured way in WordPress\u2019s relational database.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And WP-UI is really a relational database explorer. Most of my use cases are exploring things like post meta and options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don\u2019t know if this tool even has a medium\/long term future given the direction of WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I march onwards anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s see where we get to. Follow along at <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wpui_app\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/wpui_app<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A website is coming soon!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I was listening to the <a href=\"https:\/\/noplanstomerge.com\/63\">No Plans To Merge guys today discussing the rebuild of Laravel Livewire<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a segment where they were talking about the difference between building an application and building a framework and how you start to build things one way that\u2019s a bit hacky to get things going and then completely rework things later on to make it more modular.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I realised that this is KINDA what I\u2019m doing with building <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wpui_app\">WP-UI<\/a>. And so I thought it was time to get some rambling thoughts down on paper about WP-UI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"What is WP-UI?\">What is WP-UI?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wpui_app\">WP-UI<\/a> is a desktop app I\u2019m building in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.electronjs.org\/\">Electron<\/a> that makes working with WordPress quick and easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s quite hard to explain, but:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>If you know what <a href=\"https:\/\/wp-cli.org\/\">WP-CLI<\/a> is, then the aim is for it to be a GUI version of that.<\/li><li>If you know what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.phpmyadmin.net\/\">PHPMyAdmin<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adminer.org\/\">Adminer<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/sequelpro.com\/\">Sequel Pro<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/sequel-ace.com\/\">Sequel Ace<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.araelium.com\/querious\">Querious<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tableplus.io\/\">Table Plus<\/a> are then it\u2019s like a WordPress-aware version of that that requires no SQL knowledge.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen-1024x649.jpg\" alt=\"Screen grab of WP-UI\" class=\"wp-image-9787\" width=\"768\" height=\"487\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen-1024x649.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen-300x190.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen-768x487.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/WP-UI-screen.jpg 1365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><figcaption>Screengrab of WP-UI showing a post list<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>WP-UI lets you inspect WordPress data quickly and easily. And ultimately I\u2019d like you to be able to modify data through it and take actions like managing plugins and themes, deleting transients, running cron jobs &#8211; lots of the things WP-CLI lets you do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Why I\u2019m building it\">Why I\u2019m building it<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kinda because I wanted it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d seen a product called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/invoker.dev\/\">Invoker<\/a>\u201d that does a similar thing for Laravel applications, and thought \u201cI\u2019d love this for WordPress\u201d. And I had <a href=\"https:\/\/desktopappswithelectron.com\/\">a video course on building Electron apps<\/a>. So I put the two together and started building to see what was possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My initial aim was to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>See if my initial ideas were possible<\/li><li>Learn some more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.electronjs.org\/\">Electron<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/vuejs.org\/\">Vue.js<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/\">Tailwind CSS<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But I got in quite deep beyond an initial prototype!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"How I\u2019m building WP-UI\">How I\u2019m building WP-UI<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.electronjs.org\/\">Electron<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/vuejs.org\/\">VueJS.<\/a> I currently use <a href=\"https:\/\/router.vuejs.org\/\">vue-router<\/a>, but not <a href=\"https:\/\/vuex.vuejs.org\/\">vuex<\/a>. I\u2019m kinda putting off adding vuex into the mix because it seems to come with warnings of \u201cyou probably don\u2019t need this\u201d, yet I think it\u2019s inevitable for what I\u2019m doing here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m styling with <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/\">TailwindCSS<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\/\">TailwindUI<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the abstractions I currently have that power the thing, I have a bunch of Vue components for things like table headers, rows and data items. These help componentise the markup, which is essential for using Tailwind without going crazy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a fairly good abstraction for running PHP\/WordPress. Electron has a node back-end that lets me call command line commands. So I\u2019m running a PHP command line instance and passing it some PHP code to run, then catching the output of the command.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The abstraction automatically uses the PHP binary set in the applications options, and loads <code class=\"code-inline\">wp-load.php<\/code> (I should do this more intelligently &#8211; it assumes it\u2019s in the root of your project for now).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This PHP code has to echo something out that we can get back into JavaScript for display. You usually end with something like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code class=\"code-inline\">echo json_encode( [ ... some stuff you need \u2026 ] );<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, back in JavaScript\/Vue land you JSON.parse the output back into a usable object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This all works nicely and doesn\u2019t require any plugins or anything to be installed into WordPress. Writing PHP code inside a JavaScript string is pretty weird but I\u2019m not doing anything hugely complex. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a better way though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should add that I\u2019m trying, where possible, to use WordPress APIs rather than going straight to writing SQL queries, though in some cases SQL is needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an extra abstraction, the application uses lots of \u201cpost lists\u201d. So I\u2019ve build a post list API that runs instances of <code>WP_Query<\/code> for you and populates a table. You pass it query options and it creates the table for you. It adds pagination, search, and (I hope, eventually) sorting in for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Posts are kinda special and used a lot though, and I\u2019m considering what other abstractions would be helpful. This is where the \u201cam I building a framework?\u201d thing comes in. More on this later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Security\">Security<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I need to jot things down about security while I think of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve honestly not thought through security properly yet. But I guess it works on the principle that if you can use WP-UI on a WordPress install you\u2019ve got shell access anyways so all bets are off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I am thinking through things like: can someone store something in the WordPress database that when I pull it out could do weird stuff on your local machine?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Definitely needs more thought though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"What is your plan for it?\">What is your plan for it?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not entirely sure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d like it to be a paid product of some sort, but there are a LOT of steps to get to that point (licensing, allowing trials, payments and eCommerce, support processes, documentation, legal stuff, tax stuff like VAT, marketing, to name but a few).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several people have asked if I will open source it? But I\u2019ve put a fair bit of time into this now and I consider it an \u201casset\u201d that I think has value and would like to make some money from if I can. And I hope it\u2019s a tool that will have value for others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Will this need to be GPL licensed?\">Will this need to be GPL licensed?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there\u2019s this thing about tools that integrate with WordPress needing to be GPL licensed. I think this is possible without making the source code public. And if I\u2019m to keep it as a paid product then this is what I will want to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Thoughts about extending WP-UI\">Thoughts about extending WP-UI<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where Caleb and Daniel\u2019s discussion application code vs framework code and the iterations of framework code got me thinking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of their conversation was about how, eventually, if you\u2019re writing a framework, it\u2019s good to be super-modular. They talk about how good frameworks seem to end up with \u201cloader\u201d files that contain a bunch of lines that just import functionality from discrete packages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would LOVE for WP-UI to be like this and, subsequently, extendable by others in this sort of way. This is how WP-CLI works. And I think Invoker will eventually have extensions that work like this too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is a REALLY interesting space. I\u2019m kinda chuffed that my brain has gone down the route of thinking like this. I feel like it\u2019s a pretty advanced thing to be thinking of this in abstract enough terms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>RIGHT NOW I\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m almost daily, when working on WP-UI, having to decide if I make a layer abstract or not. Whether to do something quickly so that I can deliver WP-UI into the hands of people, or whether to spend time on refactor to make things more abstract and extendable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, I have a couple of good abstractions as mentioned above:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>One for running PHP (though this could be better) &#8211; a JavaScript class\/object that I can pass some PHP code to and have that code executed in the context of the currently-configured WordPress project.<\/li><li>One for lists of WordPress posts (you basically pass it a set of WP_Query options and it builds the data table)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I think Post Lists will always be \u201cspecial\u201d because they\u2019re quite complex. But I feel like the other tables probably need to be abstracted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can see a world where an extension:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Defines a new \u201cPage\u201d in the app<\/li><li>Gives some PHP code to run that produces output matching a specific format<\/li><li>Specifies how that data output is converted into tables (by specifying column types, which columns are searchable and sortable, for example)<\/li><li>Specifies how rows in the data table map to other, \u201csingle-entry\u201d screens.<\/li><li>Somehow specifies \u201cactions\u201d for rows in the data table that can run PHP code to make stuff happen &#8211; this probably needs variables\/placeholders to be made available somehow.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These \u201cdo I abstract?\u201d questions are huge at this point, because I\u2019m accumulating technical debt. I\u2019m deciding to add work to the pile for myself if I want to make the abstraction later on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m tending towards thinking that I need to get a version 1 out that\u2019s less frameworky and extendable. I want people to be able to use this thing! So that\u2019s v1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then v2 will be a big refactor that makes it more frameworky. Build the internal APIs, define the data formats, then refactor all my internal pages to use those APIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my main App file should become a loader file that contains a bunch of lines that import the pages of the app from discrete packages! Win!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does this mean I\u2019m building a framework? This isn\u2019t what I set out to do!! But maybe I AM! Eeeek!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, something like this would allow you to do stuff like extend WP-UI to allow it to act as a desktop app for managing WooCommerce orders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonkers! (In a good way)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"A brief aside on datatables and UI libraries\">A brief aside on datatables and UI libraries<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While writing this I looked into some datatable libraries like <a href=\"https:\/\/datatables.net\/\">https:\/\/datatables.net\/<\/a> and I came across the <a href=\"https:\/\/vuetifyjs.com\/en\/\">Vuetify<\/a> design framework too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It got me wondering if it would be possible and beneficial to use something like this rather than crafting everything myself with Tailwind UI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the initial phase of this project it\u2019s been SUPER helpful for me to build things by myself with just Tailwind UI taking care of the layout and some styling. I\u2019ve learned a LOT of Vue along the way and really feel like a JavaScript application programmer (which I never thought I would say).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But maybe I\u2019ll eject out into a UI framework like this in future. It certainly seems like I\u2019ve re-invented the wheel a bit! In some cases this may be necessary, but in many I suspect it\u2019s not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"What else would you like it to do?\">What else would you like it to do?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a roadmap with a bunch of minor tweaks, and some bigger ideas. Eventually I\u2019d like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>To allow editing as well as just viewing of data<\/li><li>To handle serialised data nicely somehow<\/li><li>To be able to use with remote (live?!) sites over SSH<\/li><li>To allow actions to be taken, such as updating plugins, or expiring transients<\/li><li>There was also a cool idea that someone suggested where the application could show you the code that it runs. This would allow you to visually build a query or action in WP-UI by selecting the page, filters, pagination options, sorting, etc and then get the WP_Query or other PHP code to paste back into your theme\/plugin\/whatever.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So\u2026lots of ideas. But\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"How does this fit with the block editor and full site editing?\">How does this fit with the block editor and full site editing?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a really interesting question I\u2019ve asked myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block editing, full-site-editing and so on are (in my opinion) turning WordPress away from general content management and towards being a publishing platform that cares less for structure data. Data is being pushed into in-post HTML-comments rather than being made available in a structured way in WordPress\u2019s relational database.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And WP-UI is really a relational database explorer. Most of my use cases are exploring things like post meta and options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don\u2019t know if this tool even has a medium\/long term future given the direction of WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I march onwards anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s see where we get to. Follow along at <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wpui_app\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/wpui_app<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A website is coming soon!<\/p>\n",
