                "rendered": "\n<p>I was chatting with some people today about passwords and internet security. There&#8217;s a lot of complicated terminology and sometimes conflicting advice. And I wanted to try and cut through it a bit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Security &#8211; not just on computers, but in other places too &#8211; is a trade-off of convenience for safety. It would be great if we could leave all our doors unlocked and not have to carry keys, for example. But people would go into our houses and steal our stuff. So we add locks and have the inconvenience of carrying keys, and of sometimes forgetting them and getting locked out. This is the trade off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next level of home security might be to add an alarm. This gets you extra safety, but you need to arm and disarm the alarm, remember the code, put up with annoying false alarms, and so on. You get extra security, but pay the price of convenience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are different levels of internet security too. And just as some people have more valuable stuff in their homes and want more security, some people have more valuable internet stuff and need greater online protections. Not all levels are appropriate for everybody.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT being on the first step &#8211; the lowest level &#8211; probably isn&#8217;t a great idea for anyone. No one has a three-digit combination lock on their front door.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s a list of steps you can take with internet\/online security. Each step is an increase in security, but in most cases with more complexity, inconvenience and\/or cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disclaimer: You are entirely responsible for your own internet security. I can not be held liable for anything that happens as a result of your decisions to use or not use one of the tools or approaches outlined below. Thanks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Level 1: Stop using the same password for everything<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use one password for everything, then stop doing so. Why? Well, your personal details can be hacked or become public. The <a href=\"https:\/\/haveibeenpwned.com\/\">Have I been Pwned website<\/a> can tell you if your details are public because of a data breach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your email address and password are somehow &#8220;out there&#8221; then other nasty people can take them and try to log in with them. And once they have access to one thing of yours, they may be able to get access to others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the very least you should identify critical services and set different passwords for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, once your email account is hacked, people can do password resets for other things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your Facebook is hacked then people may have access to services where you use a Facebook login button.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if your Amazon account is hacked then people can send themselves cheap plastic or electronic tat at your expense as it stores your payment cards online!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you have email on your own domain like &#8220;<a href=\"mailto:me@mydomain.com\">me@mydomain.com<\/a>&#8221; rather than GMail or Outlook or Yahoo mail then consider your domain and hosting accounts special too. If they get hacked it may be possible to redirect your email elsewhere and then, again, other things can be gotten into using email-based password resets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Level 2: Use complex passwords<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A complex password is one that is hard to guess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Easy-to-guess passwords are those that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>contain commonly used words or patterns (see the most <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_the_most_common_passwords\">common password lists<\/a>!)<\/li><li>contain dictionary words or commonly used names like football teams<\/li><li>simple variations of these things created by adding numbers or changing letters to numbers, like swapping an &#8216;o&#8217; for a zero.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These common patterns and tricks are all know by the nasty people who want to hack you and they will try them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do NOT type your actual password into here (or anywhere that you don&#8217;t trust). Let me say that again: do NOT type your actual password in here. But you can use a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/howsecureismypassword.net\/\">How Secure Is My Password<\/a> to see how long it might take a hacker to guess different kinds of password.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a long, complex and randomly-generated password is better, even though it&#8217;s hard to remember. I&#8217;d argue that even if you write it down, that&#8217;s still better. Most hacks are not by people who steal your wallet or handbag. They are by armies of computer programs trying to get into your online profiles from afar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So having &#8220;8xgbek65sg$gstv:&#8221; as a password written on a piece of paper that you keep safely somewhere is probably better than having a password like &#8220;JackIsAwesome77&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it doesn&#8217;t have to be a random collection of letters, numbers and symbols. You can also combine random words together such as &#8220;proud-taken-dollar&#8221; and this is MORE secure and easier to remember. If you ignore the geeky maths and terminology this little cartoon explains that: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.xkcd.com\/936\/\">https:\/\/www.xkcd.com\/936\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 3: Combine levels 1 and 2 and use a password manager<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A password manager is a tool that stores all your passwords, and generates new ones for you. They keep everything secure and encrypted, and you just need to remember one strong, complex master password to get access to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a password manager you can use a different, and complex password on every website that you can create an account on!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example password manager tools are <a href=\"https:\/\/1password.com\/\">1Password<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lastpass.com\/\">LastPass<\/a>, which are not open-source, but are easy to get started with and well supported. Open source tools also exist such as <a href=\"https:\/\/keepass.info\/\">KeePass<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/bitwarden.com\/\">Bitwarden<\/a>, but they are harder to get started with, so not for the non-tech-savvy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always remember to use a service that is trusted and recommended before typing passwords into it. Some web browsers also have password remembering built in, but remember that this only works for that browser &#8211; if you use a different web browser one day your remembered passwords won&#8217;t be there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Password managers cost a little bit of money, but seriously, it&#8217;s the cost of like two cups of coffee a month. Is keeping safe online worth that? (This is a rhetorical question and the answer is YES IT IS!!!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in a strange twist to what I said earlier, passsword managers may actually be MORE convenient as well as more secure. Many have tools that automatically fill in log in forms for you and if you take time to learn the tools well and use keyboard shortcuts you&#8217;ll probably find them more convenient. Here&#8217;s a video I recorded demonstrating that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/336674830?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"387\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 4: Use &#8220;2 factor authentication&#8221; for critical services<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two-factor authentication (which may go under a different name in some places) is where you have to do something else after entering a password to prove that you are you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could be sending a code to your phone, making you tap something in an app on your phone, or using an app on your phone to generate a code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With two-factor authentication enabled, if someone gets hold of or manages to guess your password (which you can assume they will) they will need something else to log in. Plus, these codes also only work once, so even if someone got a code it probably wouldn&#8217;t work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So level 4 is to start using this two-factor login for some of the critical services like email, domain names, hosting and social media accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some intricacies to this. It&#8217;s suggested that codes to your phone may not be a good idea as your phone can be hijacked. Storing the codes in the same place as your passwords (as some password managers allow you to do) may be putting all of your eggs in one basket. And the Google Authenticator app forgets all your codes if you get a new phone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;you&#8217;re always better off with two-factor codes, regardless of how you store them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s worth noting that many places will refer to the Google Authenticator app, but most one-time code apps (such as <a href=\"https:\/\/authy.com\/\">Authy<\/a>, or the tools built in to password managers) do exactly the same thing and can be used as a replacement for Google Authenticator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 5: Use 2 factor codes for as many things as possible&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;and store the codes in you password manager for convenience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As stated in Level 4, this is an all-your-eggs-in-one-basket approach but password managers make this really convenient and two-factor is always a step up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you&#8217;re used to using it on your critical services, start to turn it on in other places too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 6: Use 2 factor codes for as many things as possible&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;but store them somewhere other than your password manager.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is harder to do and we&#8217;re kinda into the realm of high levels of inconvenience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously-mentioned apps like Google Authenticator and Authy help you to do it. But then you need to remember another PIN or password. And it may be, if both your passwords and the codes are on your phone, that your phone becomes the single thing that knows everything, and this isn&#8217;t do great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key here is to be thinking about keeping the &#8220;two factors&#8221; &#8211; the passwords and the codes &#8211; separate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to achieve this might be just to use different master passwords for your password manager and two-factor code app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, if you&#8217;re read this far you are probably taking security very seriously and can start to do your own research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 7: Physical security keys<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Physical security keys, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yubico.com\/\">Yubikeys<\/a>, are small devices that you plug into a USB port, lightning port on your phone, or use an &#8220;NFC&#8221; tap (like a contactless payment card) to identify you. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are expensive but give you a couple of additional levels of security:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It proves that it&#8217;s actually you (or whoever has the key) physically present at the login.<\/li><li>They ensure that you&#8217;re authenticating with a REAL site, not a fake\/phishing site designed to steal your details.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you re-sell hosting or deal with sensitive personal data under GDPR you should probably be looking at this kind of technology, and it&#8217;s actually super easy to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you lose or forget your key? Well, you would probably have your 2FA codes as a backup! And you can also buy two keys: one to carry with you, and a backup to keep in a safe or something. Both keys will need to be registered with each service you use them on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve found that these keys are actually incredibly convenient. And there are good guides to getting started:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/paulstamatiou.com\/getting-started-with-security-keys\/\">Getting Started with Security Keys<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/timnash.co.uk\/feitian-epass-u2f-2-factor-authentication\/\">Tim Nash&#8217;s expereinces getting started with a Feitian ePass key<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This probably all sounds a bit scary and there&#8217;s lots of information and technical stuff here. I add that this is not a comprehensive or definitive list of levels. It&#8217;s just how I see things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;you should take this seriously and not be scared by the higher levels if you&#8217;re not there yet or don&#8217;t need that level of security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d encourage everyone to evaluate which level they are on, and seriously consider if they could move to the next level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an area that I&#8217;m REALLY keen to help less technical people with. So if that&#8217;s you drop me a line and I&#8217;ll see what I can do to help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally&#8230;I&#8217;ve not actually said which level I&#8217;m on or what I do for security. You can assume I&#8217;m on one of the higher levels, but I would never publish my security strategy, and neither should you. ALWAYS keep your security details, logins, passwords and so on private and only ever share details with people you 100% trust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">BONUS: Sending passwords to people<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Occasionally&#8230;VERY occasionally&#8230;you may need to send a login to someone else. As a web developer who helps people with email and websites I get this a lot. So here are some things to consider about that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Do you need to send a login?:<\/strong> Many services where you need to give access to someone else allow you to add other people. Examples of this that I frequently come across are: WordPress, CloudFlare, MailChimp and Facebook pages or apps. Add a new user if you can. Then&#8230;when that person no longer needs access, remove it or delete them. Don&#8217;t send a login if you don&#8217;t need to!<\/li><li><strong>Email is probably not secure:<\/strong> If you really do need to send a login, there is no guarantee that email is encrypted or secure. Assume your message can be intercepted and read by someone other than the recipient. So do not send complete login details by email.<\/li><li><strong>Email may persist:<\/strong> There is no guarantee that an email will be deleted by the recipient. If you email someone login details they may sit in that person&#8217;s inbox for years to come. So, again, don&#8217;t send complete login details by email. If you do, or have ever done so, change the password for that account.<\/li><li><strong>Split the details up!<\/strong>: Splitting up the login details over two different communication methods is a good stragety. Like with passwords this makes the process a bit &#8220;two factor&#8221;. If the username is intercepted by email, the hacker still won&#8217;t have the password. So, for example, send the username by email, but send the password using a text message or messenger app.  For an extra bit of security don&#8217;t mention where to use the login details. Say &#8220;here&#8217;s the password you need&#8221; rather than &#8220;Here&#8217;s the password for my Facebook account&#8221;.<\/li><li><strong>Use a one-time messaging service<\/strong>: There are services that basically work like a &#8220;this message will self destruct&#8221; service. I often use <a href=\"https:\/\/onetimesecret.com\">https:\/\/onetimesecret.com<\/a>. You copy the information in, it gives you a link, you send the link to the other person, and once they have opened the link, the information is deleted. It can&#8217;t be seen again! As always, be careful who you trust. Assume the person running this is malicious and if you put a password into the system do NOT say what the password is for.<\/li><li><strong>Change\/remove\/delete<\/strong>: Change the password once access is no longer needed &#8211; remember that password managers make this easy. Remove users that no longer need access. Delete secret information when it no longer needs to be shared.<br><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I was chatting with some people today about passwords and internet security. There&#8217;s a lot of complicated terminology and sometimes conflicting advice. And I wanted to try and cut through it a bit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Security &#8211; not just on computers, but in other places too &#8211; is a trade-off of convenience for safety. It would be great if we could leave all our doors unlocked and not have to carry keys, for example. But people would go into our houses and steal our stuff. So we add locks and have the inconvenience of carrying keys, and of sometimes forgetting them and getting locked out. This is the trade off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next level of home security might be to add an alarm. This gets you extra safety, but you need to arm and disarm the alarm, remember the code, put up with annoying false alarms, and so on. You get extra security, but pay the price of convenience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are different levels of internet security too. And just as some people have more valuable stuff in their homes and want more security, some people have more valuable internet stuff and need greater online protections. Not all levels are appropriate for everybody.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT being on the first step &#8211; the lowest level &#8211; probably isn&#8217;t a great idea for anyone. No one has a three-digit combination lock on their front door.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s a list of steps you can take with internet\/online security. Each step is an increase in security, but in most cases with more complexity, inconvenience and\/or cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disclaimer: You are entirely responsible for your own internet security. I can not be held liable for anything that happens as a result of your decisions to use or not use one of the tools or approaches outlined below. Thanks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Level 1: Stop using the same password for everything<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use one password for everything, then stop doing so. Why? Well, your personal details can be hacked or become public. The <a href=\"https:\/\/haveibeenpwned.com\/\">Have I been Pwned website<\/a> can tell you if your details are public because of a data breach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your email address and password are somehow &#8220;out there&#8221; then other nasty people can take them and try to log in with them. And once they have access to one thing of yours, they may be able to get access to others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the very least you should identify critical services and set different passwords for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, once your email account is hacked, people can do password resets for other things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your Facebook is hacked then people may have access to services where you use a Facebook login button.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if your Amazon account is hacked then people can send themselves cheap plastic or electronic tat at your expense as it stores your payment cards online!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you have email on your own domain like &#8220;<a href=\"mailto:me@mydomain.com\">me@mydomain.com<\/a>&#8221; rather than GMail or Outlook or Yahoo mail then consider your domain and hosting accounts special too. If they get hacked it may be possible to redirect your email elsewhere and then, again, other things can be gotten into using email-based password resets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Level 2: Use complex passwords<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A complex password is one that is hard to guess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Easy-to-guess passwords are those that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>contain commonly used words or patterns (see the most <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_the_most_common_passwords\">common password lists<\/a>!)<\/li><li>contain dictionary words or commonly used names like football teams<\/li><li>simple variations of these things created by adding numbers or changing letters to numbers, like swapping an &#8216;o&#8217; for a zero.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These common patterns and tricks are all know by the nasty people who want to hack you and they will try them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do NOT type your actual password into here (or anywhere that you don&#8217;t trust). Let me say that again: do NOT type your actual password in here. But you can use a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/howsecureismypassword.net\/\">How Secure Is My Password<\/a> to see how long it might take a hacker to guess different kinds of password.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a long, complex and randomly-generated password is better, even though it&#8217;s hard to remember. I&#8217;d argue that even if you write it down, that&#8217;s still better. Most hacks are not by people who steal your wallet or handbag. They are by armies of computer programs trying to get into your online profiles from afar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So having &#8220;8xgbek65sg$gstv:&#8221; as a password written on a piece of paper that you keep safely somewhere is probably better than having a password like &#8220;JackIsAwesome77&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it doesn&#8217;t have to be a random collection of letters, numbers and symbols. You can also combine random words together such as &#8220;proud-taken-dollar&#8221; and this is MORE secure and easier to remember. If you ignore the geeky maths and terminology this little cartoon explains that: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.xkcd.com\/936\/\">https:\/\/www.xkcd.com\/936\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 3: Combine levels 1 and 2 and use a password manager<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A password manager is a tool that stores all your passwords, and generates new ones for you. They keep everything secure and encrypted, and you just need to remember one strong, complex master password to get access to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a password manager you can use a different, and complex password on every website that you can create an account on!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example password manager tools are <a href=\"https:\/\/1password.com\/\">1Password<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lastpass.com\/\">LastPass<\/a>, which are not open-source, but are easy to get started with and well supported. Open source tools also exist such as <a href=\"https:\/\/keepass.info\/\">KeePass<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/bitwarden.com\/\">Bitwarden<\/a>, but they are harder to get started with, so not for the non-tech-savvy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always remember to use a service that is trusted and recommended before typing passwords into it. Some web browsers also have password remembering built in, but remember that this only works for that browser &#8211; if you use a different web browser one day your remembered passwords won&#8217;t be there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Password managers cost a little bit of money, but seriously, it&#8217;s the cost of like two cups of coffee a month. Is keeping safe online worth that? (This is a rhetorical question and the answer is YES IT IS!!!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in a strange twist to what I said earlier, passsword managers may actually be MORE convenient as well as more secure. Many have tools that automatically fill in log in forms for you and if you take time to learn the tools well and use keyboard shortcuts you&#8217;ll probably find them more convenient. Here&#8217;s a video I recorded demonstrating that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/336674830?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"387\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 4: Use &#8220;2 factor authentication&#8221; for critical services<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two-factor authentication (which may go under a different name in some places) is where you have to do something else after entering a password to prove that you are you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could be sending a code to your phone, making you tap something in an app on your phone, or using an app on your phone to generate a code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With two-factor authentication enabled, if someone gets hold of or manages to guess your password (which you can assume they will) they will need something else to log in. Plus, these codes also only work once, so even if someone got a code it probably wouldn&#8217;t work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So level 4 is to start using this two-factor login for some of the critical services like email, domain names, hosting and social media accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some intricacies to this. It&#8217;s suggested that codes to your phone may not be a good idea as your phone can be hijacked. Storing the codes in the same place as your passwords (as some password managers allow you to do) may be putting all of your eggs in one basket. And the Google Authenticator app forgets all your codes if you get a new phone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;you&#8217;re always better off with two-factor codes, regardless of how you store them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s worth noting that many places will refer to the Google Authenticator app, but most one-time code apps (such as <a href=\"https:\/\/authy.com\/\">Authy<\/a>, or the tools built in to password managers) do exactly the same thing and can be used as a replacement for Google Authenticator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 5: Use 2 factor codes for as many things as possible&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;and store the codes in you password manager for convenience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As stated in Level 4, this is an all-your-eggs-in-one-basket approach but password managers make this really convenient and two-factor is always a step up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you&#8217;re used to using it on your critical services, start to turn it on in other places too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 6: Use 2 factor codes for as many things as possible&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;but store them somewhere other than your password manager.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is harder to do and we&#8217;re kinda into the realm of high levels of inconvenience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously-mentioned apps like Google Authenticator and Authy help you to do it. But then you need to remember another PIN or password. And it may be, if both your passwords and the codes are on your phone, that your phone becomes the single thing that knows everything, and this isn&#8217;t do great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key here is to be thinking about keeping the &#8220;two factors&#8221; &#8211; the passwords and the codes &#8211; separate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to achieve this might be just to use different master passwords for your password manager and two-factor code app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, if you&#8217;re read this far you are probably taking security very seriously and can start to do your own research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Level 7: Physical security keys<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Physical security keys, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yubico.com\/\">Yubikeys<\/a>, are small devices that you plug into a USB port, lightning port on your phone, or use an &#8220;NFC&#8221; tap (like a contactless payment card) to identify you. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are expensive but give you a couple of additional levels of security:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It proves that it&#8217;s actually you (or whoever has the key) physically present at the login.<\/li><li>They ensure that you&#8217;re authenticating with a REAL site, not a fake\/phishing site designed to steal your details.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you re-sell hosting or deal with sensitive personal data under GDPR you should probably be looking at this kind of technology, and it&#8217;s actually super easy to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you lose or forget your key? Well, you would probably have your 2FA codes as a backup! And you can also buy two keys: one to carry with you, and a backup to keep in a safe or something. Both keys will need to be registered with each service you use them on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve found that these keys are actually incredibly convenient. And there are good guides to getting started:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/paulstamatiou.com\/getting-started-with-security-keys\/\">Getting Started with Security Keys<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/timnash.co.uk\/feitian-epass-u2f-2-factor-authentication\/\">Tim Nash&#8217;s expereinces getting started with a Feitian ePass key<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This probably all sounds a bit scary and there&#8217;s lots of information and technical stuff here. I add that this is not a comprehensive or definitive list of levels. It&#8217;s just how I see things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;you should take this seriously and not be scared by the higher levels if you&#8217;re not there yet or don&#8217;t need that level of security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d encourage everyone to evaluate which level they are on, and seriously consider if they could move to the next level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an area that I&#8217;m REALLY keen to help less technical people with. So if that&#8217;s you drop me a line and I&#8217;ll see what I can do to help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally&#8230;I&#8217;ve not actually said which level I&#8217;m on or what I do for security. You can assume I&#8217;m on one of the higher levels, but I would never publish my security strategy, and neither should you. ALWAYS keep your security details, logins, passwords and so on private and only ever share details with people you 100% trust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">BONUS: Sending passwords to people<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Occasionally&#8230;VERY occasionally&#8230;you may need to send a login to someone else. As a web developer who helps people with email and websites I get this a lot. So here are some things to consider about that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Do you need to send a login?:<\/strong> Many services where you need to give access to someone else allow you to add other people. Examples of this that I frequently come across are: WordPress, CloudFlare, MailChimp and Facebook pages or apps. Add a new user if you can. Then&#8230;when that person no longer needs access, remove it or delete them. Don&#8217;t send a login if you don&#8217;t need to!<\/li><li><strong>Email is probably not secure:<\/strong> If you really do need to send a login, there is no guarantee that email is encrypted or secure. Assume your message can be intercepted and read by someone other than the recipient. So do not send complete login details by email.<\/li><li><strong>Email may persist:<\/strong> There is no guarantee that an email will be deleted by the recipient. If you email someone login details they may sit in that person&#8217;s inbox for years to come. So, again, don&#8217;t send complete login details by email. If you do, or have ever done so, change the password for that account.<\/li><li><strong>Split the details up!<\/strong>: Splitting up the login details over two different communication methods is a good stragety. Like with passwords this makes the process a bit &#8220;two factor&#8221;. If the username is intercepted by email, the hacker still won&#8217;t have the password. So, for example, send the username by email, but send the password using a text message or messenger app.  For an extra bit of security don&#8217;t mention where to use the login details. Say &#8220;here&#8217;s the password you need&#8221; rather than &#8220;Here&#8217;s the password for my Facebook account&#8221;.<\/li><li><strong>Use a one-time messaging service<\/strong>: There are services that basically work like a &#8220;this message will self destruct&#8221; service. I often use <a href=\"https:\/\/onetimesecret.com\">https:\/\/onetimesecret.com<\/a>. You copy the information in, it gives you a link, you send the link to the other person, and once they have opened the link, the information is deleted. It can&#8217;t be seen again! As always, be careful who you trust. Assume the person running this is malicious and if you put a password into the system do NOT say what the password is for.<\/li><li><strong>Change\/remove\/delete<\/strong>: Change the password once access is no longer needed &#8211; remember that password managers make this easy. Remove users that no longer need access. Delete secret information when it no longer needs to be shared.<br><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p><em>A huge number of people in my tech circles seemed to love Adam Wathan&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/\">Tailwind CSS<\/a> framework. But, for some reason, I just didn&#8217;t get it. Until I had this revelation about components that has caused me to go and take a serious look.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I want to understand this better!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I did <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/my-new-css-framework-sucss\/\">a bit of a (lengthy) write up last year<\/a> about my history with CSS and how I thought I should write CSS now. But the nagging sense that I was missing something with Tailwind has not gone away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as I explained in <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2020\/01\/understanding-web-components\/\">my last post<\/a>, I started this year with wanting to understand Tailwind and components better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, suddenly, and I can&#8217;t remember where from, I had this revelation about &#8220;components&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT THIS THING IS?!?!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s be clear: I totally get the idea of utility CSS, and I understand the syntax to a point where I could read it but not write it. But I&#8217;ve struggled to get past the initial barriers of understanding utility-FIRST CSS, which is what Tailwind is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get all the arguments people make. People I admire and respect rave about the how they can build more quickly; about how Tailwind code is super easy to change and maintain. I&#8217;m not wedded to semantic class-naming or ideas about how separation of concerns should work (you&#8217;re HTML and CSS are always going to be tied together <em>somehow<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I looked at screenshots of Tailwind code with bafflement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"686\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-1024x686.jpg\" alt=\"TailWind example screenshot\" class=\"wp-image-4497\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-1024x686.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-768x514.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-945x633.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-600x402.jpg 600w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender.jpg 1519w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I fiercely held to the idea that yes, I can work out what this looks like by reading the code, but I don&#8217;t know what that thing <em>IS<\/em>. And if I want more than one of those things (the profile &#8220;card&#8221; in the image above), surely I need to extract all that code into some CSS classes that I can apply and I&#8217;m back where I started?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People talked of &#8220;extracting components&#8221; and I figured this was what they meant: pulling a load of Tailwind properties into a single CSS class so that you can re-use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(For those who are ahead of me&#8230;yes&#8230;I know!! Wait!!)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Great Scott!!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the revelation. Like an Emmet Brown Flux Capacitor moment, only without the slipping in the bathroom and bumping your head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if the extracted components aren&#8217;t CSS? What if, instead you extract the HTML markup to a partial?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>THEN you could still have the MEANING in the project code, the &#8220;what is this?&#8221; can still be present, and you can still get the re-use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my head there&#8217;s a movie scene where I dash to my computer to confirm this revelation; fire up the <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/installation\">Tailwind docs<\/a>; and in some kind of strange, slow-motion dream effect, the truth becomes clear as I read the text:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;<strong>Don&#8217;t rely on CSS classes to extract complex components &#8230; <\/strong>it&#8217;s often better to extract reusable pieces of your UI into <em>template partials<\/em> or <em>JavaScript components<\/em> instead of writing custom CSS classes.&#8221;<\/p><cite><a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/extracting-components#extracting-html-components\">Tailwind Docs<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A simple example<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s some more traditional-style markup for some buttons:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;a href=&quot;\/signup&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;\n  Sign up\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;\/login&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;\n  Log in\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll do some conversion to Tailwind. You don&#8217;t really have to know what it means for now:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;a href=&quot;\/signup&quot; class=&quot;inline-block bg-blue-300 px-4 py-3 rounded hover:bg-blue-500 hover:text-white&quot;&gt;\n  Sign up\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;\/login&quot; class=&quot;inline-block bg-blue-300 px-4 py-3 rounded hover:bg-blue-500 hover:text-white&quot;&gt;\n  Log in\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Woah! Look at all the classes and duplication. And&#8230; HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT THIS IS?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now in Tailwind you could extract the classes to your own CSS component. You can use the <code>@apply<\/code> rule to bring Tailwind&#8217;s utilities into a class:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: css; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n.button {\n  @apply inline-block bg-blue-300 px-4 py-3 rounded;\n}\n.button:hover {\n  @apply bg-blue-500 text-white;\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>But now we&#8217;re pretty much back where we started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alternative way &#8211; and the preferred way in utility-first CSS land &#8211; is to extract the HTML to a component.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to pass in parameters for the URL and label. So you would create a template partial like this (in <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/6.x\/blade\">Laravel Blade<\/a> syntax):<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;a href=&quot;{{ $url }}&quot; class=&quot;inline-block bg-blue-300 px-4 py-3 rounded hover:bg-blue-500 hover:text-white&quot;&gt;\n  {{ $label }}\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And then your template with the buttons becomes:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n@include('partials\/components\/button', &#x5B;'url' =&gt; '\/signup', 'label' =&gt; 'Sign up'])\n@include('partials\/components\/button', &#x5B;'url' =&gt; '\/login', 'label' =&gt; 'Log in'])\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>With this we get all the benefits of Tailwind&#8217;s CSS: consistent spacing, fonts, and colours with ease; quick-to-write and easy-to-maintain code, and so on. But with re-usable components, and meaningful &#8220;source&#8221; template code (although the HTML output is still kinda meaningless garbage)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Oooooh!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The big assumptions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I know at this point those of you experienced with components and Tailwind are wondering how on earth I didn&#8217;t understand this. But the truth is that it&#8217;s a key fact in piecing together this puzzle and not once has it been explained to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This understanding of components seems to be assumed. Yet to many coming from an approach like BEM CSS and WordPress world where templates tend not to be broken down into much smaller component-level partials, it&#8217;s something you have to be told or find out somehow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the explanations of Tailwind I&#8217;ve seen me show the code inside the component. Not the code that includes the component. And this is a critical piece of understanding how to work with Tailwind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But what about&#8230;?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I know, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re still getting to grips with this, and is quite a large paradigm shift to make in your head, you probably have loads of questions about how the details of this work in practice?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How do I create button style variants?<\/li><li>What if I want to add some CSS to just one button?<\/li><li>Sometimes buttons are <code>a<\/code> tags and sometimes they are <code>button<\/code> tags&#8230;how do I do that?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I&#8217;ve gone ahead and dabbled with Tailwind, I&#8217;ve found it&#8217;s not without a lot of questions of my own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;it is quite easy to learn. It is easy to set up. It is quick to work with (if you&#8217;re working within what it gives you). It&#8217;s very comprehensive and well thought out. Adam has done a GREAT job making this thing and has my HUGE respect. And I think I can see the attraction of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my next post (which may take a while to compile) I&#8217;m going to try to walk you through my explorations. I&#8217;ve recorded an hour of video that I want to cut into bite-sized chunks and then write up. Hopefully you&#8217;ll see the problems and questions I come across, and I hope you&#8217;ll come to a place where you can make your own mind up about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch this space!<\/p>\n",

But the nagging sense that I was missing something with Tailwind has not gone away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as I explained in <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2020\/01\/understanding-web-components\/\">my last post<\/a>, I started this year with wanting to understand Tailwind and components better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, suddenly, and I can&#8217;t remember where from, I had this revelation about &#8220;components&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT THIS THING IS?!?!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s be clear: I totally get the idea of utility CSS, and I understand the syntax to a point where I could read it but not write it. But I&#8217;ve struggled to get past the initial barriers of understanding utility-FIRST CSS, which is what Tailwind is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get all the arguments people make. People I admire and respect rave about the how they can build more quickly; about how Tailwind code is super easy to change and maintain. I&#8217;m not wedded to semantic class-naming or ideas about how separation of concerns should work (you&#8217;re HTML and CSS are always going to be tied together <em>somehow<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I looked at screenshots of Tailwind code with bafflement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"686\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-1024x686.jpg\" alt=\"TailWind example screenshot\" class=\"wp-image-4497\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-1024x686.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-768x514.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-945x633.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-600x402.jpg 600w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender.jpg 1519w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I fiercely held to the idea that yes, I can work out what this looks like by reading the code, but I don&#8217;t know what that thing <em>IS<\/em>. And if I want more than one of those things (the profile &#8220;card&#8221; in the image above), surely I need to extract all that code into some CSS classes that I can apply and I&#8217;m back where I started?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People talked of &#8220;extracting components&#8221; and I figured this was what they meant: pulling a load of Tailwind properties into a single CSS class so that you can re-use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(For those who are ahead of me&#8230;yes&#8230;I know!! Wait!!)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Great Scott!!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the revelation. Like an Emmet Brown Flux Capacitor moment, only without the slipping in the bathroom and bumping your head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if the extracted components aren&#8217;t CSS? What if, instead you extract the HTML markup to a partial?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>THEN you could still have the MEANING in the project code, the &#8220;what is this?&#8221; can still be present, and you can still get the re-use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my head there&#8217;s a movie scene where I dash to my computer to confirm this revelation; fire up the <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/installation\">Tailwind docs<\/a>; and in some kind of strange, slow-motion dream effect, the truth becomes clear as I read the text:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;<strong>Don&#8217;t rely on CSS classes to extract complex components &#8230; <\/strong>it&#8217;s often better to extract reusable pieces of your UI into <em>template partials<\/em> or <em>JavaScript components<\/em> instead of writing custom CSS classes.&#8221;<\/p><cite><a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/extracting-components#extracting-html-components\">Tailwind Docs<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A simple example<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s some more traditional-style markup for some buttons:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;a href=&quot;\/signup&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;\n  Sign up\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;\/login&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;\n  Log in\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll do some conversion to Tailwind. You don&#8217;t really have to know what it means for now:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;a href=&quot;\/signup&quot; class=&quot;inline-block bg-blue-300 px-4 py-3 rounded hover:bg-blue-500 hover:text-white&quot;&gt;\n  Sign up\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;\/login&quot; class=&quot;inline-block bg-blue-300 px-4 py-3 rounded hover:bg-blue-500 hover:text-white&quot;&gt;\n  Log in\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Woah! Look at all the classes and duplication. And&#8230; HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT THIS IS?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now in Tailwind you could extract the classes to your own CSS component. You can use the <code>@apply<\/code> rule to bring Tailwind&#8217;s utilities into a class:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: css; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n.button {\n  @apply inline-block bg-blue-300 px-4 py-3 rounded;\n}\n.button:hover {\n  @apply bg-blue-500 text-white;\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>But now we&#8217;re pretty much back where we started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alternative way &#8211; and the preferred way in utility-first CSS land &#8211; is to extract the HTML to a component.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to pass in parameters for the URL and label. So you would create a template partial like this (in <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/6.x\/blade\">Laravel Blade<\/a> syntax):<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;a href=&quot;{{ $url }}&quot; class=&quot;inline-block bg-blue-300 px-4 py-3 rounded hover:bg-blue-500 hover:text-white&quot;&gt;\n  {{ $label }}\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And then your template with the buttons becomes:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n@include('partials\/components\/button', &#x5B;'url' =&gt; '\/signup', 'label' =&gt; 'Sign up'])\n@include('partials\/components\/button', &#x5B;'url' =&gt; '\/login', 'label' =&gt; 'Log in'])\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>With this we get all the benefits of Tailwind&#8217;s CSS: consistent spacing, fonts, and colours with ease; quick-to-write and easy-to-maintain code, and so on. But with re-usable components, and meaningful &#8220;source&#8221; template code (although the HTML output is still kinda meaningless garbage)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Oooooh!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The big assumptions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I know at this point those of you experienced with components and Tailwind are wondering how on earth I didn&#8217;t understand this. But the truth is that it&#8217;s a key fact in piecing together this puzzle and not once has it been explained to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This understanding of components seems to be assumed. Yet to many coming from an approach like BEM CSS and WordPress world where templates tend not to be broken down into much smaller component-level partials, it&#8217;s something you have to be told or find out somehow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the explanations of Tailwind I&#8217;ve seen me show the code inside the component. Not the code that includes the component. And this is a critical piece of understanding how to work with Tailwind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But what about&#8230;?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I know, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re still getting to grips with this, and is quite a large paradigm shift to make in your head, you probably have loads of questions about how the details of this work in practice?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How do I create button style variants?<\/li><li>What if I want to add some CSS to just one button?<\/li><li>Sometimes buttons are <code>a<\/code> tags and sometimes they are <code>button<\/code> tags&#8230;how do I do that?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I&#8217;ve gone ahead and dabbled with Tailwind, I&#8217;ve found it&#8217;s not without a lot of questions of my own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;it is quite easy to learn. It is easy to set up. It is quick to work with (if you&#8217;re working within what it gives you). It&#8217;s very comprehensive and well thought out. Adam has done a GREAT job making this thing and has my HUGE respect. And I think I can see the attraction of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my next post (which may take a while to compile) I&#8217;m going to try to walk you through my explorations. I&#8217;ve recorded an hour of video that I want to cut into bite-sized chunks and then write up. Hopefully you&#8217;ll see the problems and questions I come across, and I hope you&#8217;ll come to a place where you can make your own mind up about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch this space!<\/p>\n",

I tried re-writing this in the past tense but it didn&#8217;t make sense. So just know that this is me writing at the very start of the year a week or so back.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think one of my tech goals for 2020 needs to be getting a proper understanding of building using web \u201ccomponents\u201d. I feel like I understand what components are and how to use them individually, but not how to compose them together onto bigger things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example: I get how a table could be a component. Or a row of a table could be a component. But I don\u2019t think I understand which of those things should be components, or if the rows should be child components of the table component.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried the table-component-with-child-row-components thing once and it was HORRIBLE. Either it\u2019s not \u201cthe way\u201d, or I was doing it totally wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the kind of thing I want to understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m happy to do it in React or Vue or whatever. It\u2019s the principles I want to learn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also think that once I\u2019ve done this, the Tailwind CSS framework (that everyone else raves about but that I don&#8217;t yet &#8220;get&#8221;) will make more sense. I THINK Tailwind and \u201ccomponents\u201d go hand in hand and it will make much more sense to me as creator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still fear that any Tailwind stuff I create will be incomprehensible to others though. ??\u200d\u2642\ufe0f<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all of this I note this piece of wisdom from Adam Wathan &#8211; the creator of Tailwind:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A framework that I&#39;ve found useful for filtering through the bullshit:<br><br>Be suspicious of people who talk about how *you* should do things, and pay close attention to people who talk about what works for *them*.<\/p>&mdash; Adam Wathan (@adamwathan) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adamwathan\/status\/1213870157480767489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 5, 2020<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n",

I tried re-writing this in the past tense but it didn&#8217;t make sense. So just know that this is me writing at the very start of the year a week or so back.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think one of my tech goals for 2020 needs to be getting a proper understanding of building using web \u201ccomponents\u201d. I feel like I understand what components are and how to use them individually, but not how to compose them together onto bigger things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example: I get how a table could be a component. Or a row of a table could be a component. But I don\u2019t think I understand which of those things should be components, or if the rows should be child components of the table component.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried the table-component-with-child-row-components thing once and it was HORRIBLE. Either it\u2019s not \u201cthe way\u201d, or I was doing it totally wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the kind of thing I want to understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m happy to do it in React or Vue or whatever. It\u2019s the principles I want to learn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also think that once I\u2019ve done this, the Tailwind CSS framework (that everyone else raves about but that I don&#8217;t yet &#8220;get&#8221;) will make more sense. I THINK Tailwind and \u201ccomponents\u201d go hand in hand and it will make much more sense to me as creator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still fear that any Tailwind stuff I create will be incomprehensible to others though. ??\u200d\u2642\ufe0f<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all of this I note this piece of wisdom from Adam Wathan &#8211; the creator of Tailwind:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A framework that I&#39;ve found useful for filtering through the bullshit:<br><br>Be suspicious of people who talk about how *you* should do things, and pay close attention to people who talk about what works for *them*.<\/p>&mdash; Adam Wathan (@adamwathan) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adamwathan\/status\/1213870157480767489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 5, 2020<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n",

He put a call out for help and advice from others, and I was one of the responders.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The reply I gave was quite long and worthy of being a post of it\u2019s own, so here it is: my own, multi-tooled, mixed-media approach to organisation.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I don&#8217;t think I was much help to Tim because, as he currently does, I use a variety of approaches and am perfectly happy with that. But maybe one of my points here is that a mixed up approach is perfectly OK!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, I find it really useful to separate stuff I\u2019m organising into ephemeral and practical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideas are ephemeral. They accumulate over time and as they accumulate they gain traction in my brain. The drip, drip, drip of thoughts and ideas accumulate until they are ready to become practical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doodling and jotting down in notebooks is IDEAL for ephemeral stuff. I might not want to refer back to it later and it&#8217;s not structured enough to make sense in the long term and to make it worth making it permanent\/searchable\/structured.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually there comes a time when the ephemeral becomes more focused and starts to turn into more structured thoughts or practical actions. At this point stuff tends to become digital and I gather my ephemeral notes and record them digitally and organise them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sounds like I have some wonderful working process, but I really don&#8217;t!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A bit like Tim and other commenters on his post I have:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Physical Notebook(s) for jotting stuff down. I love the focus this gives me. Though, oddly, using an iPad works the same way. I often type blog posts on an iPad and it&#8217;s way less distracting that having my laptop open somehow.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\">Bear Notes<\/a>: For recording everything written I want to remember (except links\/bookmarks which go in Pinboard) plus writing draft blog posts and ideas for talks and videos and stuff. Sadly iOS\/MacOS only.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/trello.com\/\">Trello<\/a>. I use this in two ways: 1) as a high-level project status board (with separate boards for personal, work and household projects) 2) as kanban-style boards for in-flight projects.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ticktick.com\/\">TickTick<\/a> for the day to day &#8220;what the heck am I doing next&#8221; and odd things that don&#8217;t warrant a Trello card. I\u2019ve used a bunch of ToDo apps over the years and TickTick suits me really well. Good apps, cloud sync, reminders, tags. Everything I need in a simple package.<\/li><li>I also use other project management tools for clients that use them. I\u2019m happy to be flexible on a project-by-project basis and have used Asana, Basecamp, simple spreadsheets and plain emails to manage project work. It SUPER important that my clients are happy with the tools we are using to collaborate.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I also think it&#8217;s useful to do something like a physical written-down daily plan at the start of the day. What are the three things I want to do today? Ticking them off gives you satisfaction and some brain chemicals that make you feel good! But I&#8217;m not really sure how this fits with using TickTick for day-to-day todos. Hmm\u2026there ARE too many things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this paper-based, day-o-day stuff, I&#8217;ve used <a href=\"https:\/\/justthree.me\/\">Just Three<\/a> journals by Sam Hotchkiss) pretty successfully, but they no longer exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I use a <a href=\"https:\/\/dailygreatness.co.uk\/collections\/dailygreatness\/products\/dailygreatness-business-planner-blue?variant=13559365599307\">Daily Greatness Business Planner<\/a> on and off too, which I LOVE but it&#8217;s a whole year with week-to-a-page and loads of other stuff too and it&#8217;s just too big to carry around with you. I actually love the planner format, but I want a quarterly planner like this, not a whole year in one book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll see that I use a variety of methods, and that\u2019s because I have a variety of needs. Not just the ephemeral\/practical split  I mentioned earlier; there are other considerations too. But I\u2019m happy with mixed media and a multi-faceted approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, maybe there&#8217;s some helpful stuff there. Let us know what you do!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>My friend Tim wrote <a href=\"https:\/\/timnash.co.uk\/new-year-means-new-plans-and-new-tools\/\">a great blog post<\/a> the other day about his unhappiness with his mixed-up approach to organisational and productivity tools, and his dilemma of whether to use paper or digital tools and processes in future. He put a call out for help and advice from others, and I was one of the responders.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The reply I gave was quite long and worthy of being a post of it\u2019s own, so here it is: my own, multi-tooled, mixed-media approach to organisation.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I don&#8217;t think I was much help to Tim because, as he currently does, I use a variety of approaches and am perfectly happy with that. But maybe one of my points here is that a mixed up approach is perfectly OK!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, I find it really useful to separate stuff I\u2019m organising into ephemeral and practical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideas are ephemeral. They accumulate over time and as they accumulate they gain traction in my brain. The drip, drip, drip of thoughts and ideas accumulate until they are ready to become practical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doodling and jotting down in notebooks is IDEAL for ephemeral stuff. I might not want to refer back to it later and it&#8217;s not structured enough to make sense in the long term and to make it worth making it permanent\/searchable\/structured.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually there comes a time when the ephemeral becomes more focused and starts to turn into more structured thoughts or practical actions. At this point stuff tends to become digital and I gather my ephemeral notes and record them digitally and organise them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sounds like I have some wonderful working process, but I really don&#8217;t!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A bit like Tim and other commenters on his post I have:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Physical Notebook(s) for jotting stuff down. I love the focus this gives me. Though, oddly, using an iPad works the same way. I often type blog posts on an iPad and it&#8217;s way less distracting that having my laptop open somehow.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\">Bear Notes<\/a>: For recording everything written I want to remember (except links\/bookmarks which go in Pinboard) plus writing draft blog posts and ideas for talks and videos and stuff. Sadly iOS\/MacOS only.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/trello.com\/\">Trello<\/a>. I use this in two ways: 1) as a high-level project status board (with separate boards for personal, work and household projects) 2) as kanban-style boards for in-flight projects.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ticktick.com\/\">TickTick<\/a> for the day to day &#8220;what the heck am I doing next&#8221; and odd things that don&#8217;t warrant a Trello card. I\u2019ve used a bunch of ToDo apps over the years and TickTick suits me really well. Good apps, cloud sync, reminders, tags. Everything I need in a simple package.<\/li><li>I also use other project management tools for clients that use them. I\u2019m happy to be flexible on a project-by-project basis and have used Asana, Basecamp, simple spreadsheets and plain emails to manage project work. It SUPER important that my clients are happy with the tools we are using to collaborate.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I also think it&#8217;s useful to do something like a physical written-down daily plan at the start of the day. What are the three things I want to do today? Ticking them off gives you satisfaction and some brain chemicals that make you feel good! But I&#8217;m not really sure how this fits with using TickTick for day-to-day todos. Hmm\u2026there ARE too many things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this paper-based, day-o-day stuff, I&#8217;ve used <a href=\"https:\/\/justthree.me\/\">Just Three<\/a> journals by Sam Hotchkiss) pretty successfully, but they no longer exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I use a <a href=\"https:\/\/dailygreatness.co.uk\/collections\/dailygreatness\/products\/dailygreatness-business-planner-blue?variant=13559365599307\">Daily Greatness Business Planner<\/a> on and off too, which I LOVE but it&#8217;s a whole year with week-to-a-page and loads of other stuff too and it&#8217;s just too big to carry around with you. I actually love the planner format, but I want a quarterly planner like this, not a whole year in one book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll see that I use a variety of methods, and that\u2019s because I have a variety of needs. Not just the ephemeral\/practical split  I mentioned earlier; there are other considerations too. But I\u2019m happy with mixed media and a multi-faceted approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, maybe there&#8217;s some helpful stuff there. Let us know what you do!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p><em>I\u2019m in some Facebook Groups full of busy family people who are also freelancers and entrepreneurs. Every now and then the question of \u201chow do you fit things into your routine\u201d is asked. And I just posted a hefty answer of my own, so thought I\u2019d copy it here. Maybe some tips for people with families and business or homeworkers on health and housework<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My partner is employed but only 3.5 days a week. We have one kid at a preschool and one at school &#8211; they are in opposite directions but the school is really close to home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I work freelance and flexibly. And I have a small and very cheap office I rent that\u2019s about 3.5 miles from home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a pretty good routine for getting the kids and adults to the right places. But have also struggled with household stuff and social time. Especially as our little one (4) won\u2019t do bedtime with me very easily, older one (8) is resisting independence and needs chivvying though bedtime until 9ish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cleaning and some household stuff has just been done as and when due to the chaos of having a sub-four-year old around for the last 8 years. We\u2019re just about feeling like we could make some kind of rota for jobs now, and include 8yo on it. But really\u2026do the important stuff and don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t get to dust or hoover for weeks on end. You\u2019re not the only one and you need some personal time too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT\u2026I often combine chores with personal time. Listen to music or podcasts while washing up, hoovering or mowing the lawn, for example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get exercise by cycling to and from my office when I can. Its awesome exercise without really having to think about it. I have an extended route I can use if I have time for extra \u201cgym\u201d activity. If you don\u2019t have a commute then going for a run, brisk walk or bike ride around your local streets is a good way. Invent a commute &#8211; it acts as a transition time between home and work life too. Super helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also just bought some small dumbbell weights from Aldi (Aldi and Lidl both have fitness kit in the \u201csilly aisles\u201d right now!) and I\u2019m doing reps with those, or push ups or crunches, in my few minutes of break time each hour (I run a sort-of Pomodoro technique). This will hopefully get me extra calories burned through the day and some extra strength built up without the travel and financial costs of a gym.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I guess I\u2019m trying to integrate these things together. Make the personal care an integral part of the routines I\u2019m working with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t always get it right, but it seems to work well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when 4yo goes to school in September hopefully everything will be a load easier!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>I\u2019m in some Facebook Groups full of busy family people who are also freelancers and entrepreneurs. Every now and then the question of \u201chow do you fit things into your routine\u201d is asked. And I just posted a hefty answer of my own, so thought I\u2019d copy it here. Maybe some tips for people with families and business or homeworkers on health and housework<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My partner is employed but only 3.5 days a week. We have one kid at a preschool and one at school &#8211; they are in opposite directions but the school is really close to home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I work freelance and flexibly. And I have a small and very cheap office I rent that\u2019s about 3.5 miles from home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a pretty good routine for getting the kids and adults to the right places. But have also struggled with household stuff and social time. Especially as our little one (4) won\u2019t do bedtime with me very easily, older one (8) is resisting independence and needs chivvying though bedtime until 9ish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cleaning and some household stuff has just been done as and when due to the chaos of having a sub-four-year old around for the last 8 years. We\u2019re just about feeling like we could make some kind of rota for jobs now, and include 8yo on it. But really\u2026do the important stuff and don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t get to dust or hoover for weeks on end. You\u2019re not the only one and you need some personal time too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT\u2026I often combine chores with personal time. Listen to music or podcasts while washing up, hoovering or mowing the lawn, for example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get exercise by cycling to and from my office when I can. Its awesome exercise without really having to think about it. I have an extended route I can use if I have time for extra \u201cgym\u201d activity. If you don\u2019t have a commute then going for a run, brisk walk or bike ride around your local streets is a good way. Invent a commute &#8211; it acts as a transition time between home and work life too. Super helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also just bought some small dumbbell weights from Aldi (Aldi and Lidl both have fitness kit in the \u201csilly aisles\u201d right now!) and I\u2019m doing reps with those, or push ups or crunches, in my few minutes of break time each hour (I run a sort-of Pomodoro technique). This will hopefully get me extra calories burned through the day and some extra strength built up without the travel and financial costs of a gym.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I guess I\u2019m trying to integrate these things together. Make the personal care an integral part of the routines I\u2019m working with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t always get it right, but it seems to work well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when 4yo goes to school in September hopefully everything will be a load easier!<\/p>\n",

Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook won&#8217;t be interviewed by The Guardian, so they:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>built a Zuckerbot &#8230; trained on three years of interviews, speeches, blogposts and testimony from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zuckerbergfiles.org\/\">Zuckerberg Files<\/a>  \u2013 more than 200,000 words of Zuckerverbiage in all. Guardian and  Observer journalists then provided the questions, and [the company that made the bot] used the  Zuckerbot to produce the answers.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2019\/dec\/22\/zuckerbot-mark-zuckerberg-facebook-botnik\">https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2019\/dec\/22\/zuckerbot-mark-zuckerberg-facebook-botnik<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My first thought was &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s clever and fun&#8221;, (and the Zuckerbot&#8217;s answers are mostly clearly nonsensical) but my second thought quickly overrode it: &#8220;Hang on, this is a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Deepfake\">deepfake<\/a>, but with words. Is this ethical?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There has been a lot of robust debate about the ethics of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Deepfake\">deepfakes<\/a>. They can do some amazing stuff with images and video now. I don&#8217;t have links to hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But text as a medium often kinda slips under the radar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I very rarely share photos of my kids on social media because I want to protect their privacy. But I have talked about them a lot, and this is ALSO an invasion of their privacy. Somehow it feels less so, but it could be MORE so. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing about their character and behaviour could be more damaging to them in future than just a picture of them walking in the woods or riding their bike for the first time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, words are important. And I wonder if fake words are harder to spot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recently heard about the wonderous new AI that produced a convincing news story about Unicorns: listen to <a href=\"https:\/\/99percentinvisible.org\/episode\/the-eliza-effect\/\">the 99 Percent Invisible podcast about The Eliza Effect<\/a> from about 33:10 &#8211; I mean, listen to it all because it&#8217;s excellent, but from 33:10 is relevant. They discuss and critique how AI could so quickly churn out fake words, articles, and even fake interviews!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they already are?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps THIS is being written by AI, and not a human?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How would you tell?<\/p>\n",

Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook won&#8217;t be interviewed by The Guardian, so they:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>built a Zuckerbot &#8230; trained on three years of interviews, speeches, blogposts and testimony from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zuckerbergfiles.org\/\">Zuckerberg Files<\/a>  \u2013 more than 200,000 words of Zuckerverbiage in all. Guardian and  Observer journalists then provided the questions, and [the company that made the bot] used the  Zuckerbot to produce the answers.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2019\/dec\/22\/zuckerbot-mark-zuckerberg-facebook-botnik\">https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2019\/dec\/22\/zuckerbot-mark-zuckerberg-facebook-botnik<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My first thought was &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s clever and fun&#8221;, (and the Zuckerbot&#8217;s answers are mostly clearly nonsensical) but my second thought quickly overrode it: &#8220;Hang on, this is a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Deepfake\">deepfake<\/a>, but with words. Is this ethical?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There has been a lot of robust debate about the ethics of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Deepfake\">deepfakes<\/a>. They can do some amazing stuff with images and video now. I don&#8217;t have links to hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But text as a medium often kinda slips under the radar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I very rarely share photos of my kids on social media because I want to protect their privacy. But I have talked about them a lot, and this is ALSO an invasion of their privacy. Somehow it feels less so, but it could be MORE so. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing about their character and behaviour could be more damaging to them in future than just a picture of them walking in the woods or riding their bike for the first time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, words are important. And I wonder if fake words are harder to spot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recently heard about the wonderous new AI that produced a convincing news story about Unicorns: listen to <a href=\"https:\/\/99percentinvisible.org\/episode\/the-eliza-effect\/\">the 99 Percent Invisible podcast about The Eliza Effect<\/a> from about 33:10 &#8211; I mean, listen to it all because it&#8217;s excellent, but from 33:10 is relevant. They discuss and critique how AI could so quickly churn out fake words, articles, and even fake interviews!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they already are?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps THIS is being written by AI, and not a human?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How would you tell?<\/p>\n",

Despite the morning being spent with my wife and some of my best friends &#8211; people that know each other very well &#8211; I was left feeling like no one understood me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the main reason for this &#8211; the main way in which my brain seems to  work differently &#8211; is that changes of plan, or new ideas, cause a cascade of thoughts and questions that need to be resolved before I can become excited about something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably some of this is learned behaviour or habit, but I also put this down to having the character trait of &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2015\/07\/highly-sensitive\/\">High sensitivity<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To others observing, or expecting a response from me, this probably appears as negativity or aloofness or cynicism or needless anxiety (I won&#8217;t pretend &#8211; sometimes I get anxious if too much of this stuff happens at once).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By why is it seen this way? Why is this sensitivity not seen as positive?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Literally, all I do&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday a bunch of tweets went around that started &#8220;Literally all I do as a&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to say for sure where it started, but I traced it back to an attorney:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Literally all I do as an attorney:<br><br>No.<br>No. <br>Seriously, no. <br>Like, how did you even think this was a good idea. <br>Stop immediately.<br>No, that doesn&#39;t make it okay, either. <br>No. <br>Stop. <br>Stop it, you can\u2019t do that.<br>No.<\/p>&mdash; FP (@FaciePrima) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FaciePrima\/status\/1194785651574505472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 14, 2019<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure it spun off in all sorts of directions, but there was parenting:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Literally all I do as a Dad:<br><br>No. <br>No. <br>Don&#39;t do that. <br>No, that girls decision doesn&#39;t matter. <br>No. <br>No, social media doesn&#39;t have good ideas. <br>No. <br>Stop immediately. <br>No, that doesn&#39;t make it okay, either. <br>No. <br>Stop, don&#39;t do that. <br>No.<\/p>&mdash; Temptedge (@Anthony13051547) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Anthony13051547\/status\/1195436580120354817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 15, 2019<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And Feline care:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">All I do as a human with cats:<br>No.<br>It is not dinner time yet.<br>No, not yet either.<br>No.<br>Get off the stove it will kill you.<br>No.<br>Get off the stairs you will kill me.<br>No, please, barf on the tile instead!<br>No.<br>It\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re cute.<\/p>&mdash; Kim Goodwin (@kimgoodwin) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kimgoodwin\/status\/1197136346466471944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 20, 2019<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And it ended up coming to me via UX Design:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Literally all I do as a UX designer:<br><br>No.<br>No.<br>Have you spoken to a current user?<br>NO.<br>How would anyone except you know where that option is?<br>No one will use it.<br>No.<br>Which metric is this meant to push?<br>How does this fit into the content model?<br>Absolutely not.<br>Sales is not the user. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/p3oiy0hY00\">https:\/\/t.co\/p3oiy0hY00<\/a><\/p>&mdash; Pavel A.

But they made me think of how saying &#8220;no&#8221; or asking awkward questions is so often seen as negative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All these people, in their jobs, are applying their education, experience, wisdom of years, and attention to detail to Doing The Right Thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a (mis)quote about how if a job takes me 30 minutes, it because of the ten years of training and experience I have; you pay for the ten years, not the 30 minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But is it also true that a person&#8217;s job might be telling you not to do something at all. Or that to do that 30 minute job actually requires 2 days of preparatory work doing other things in order to do it correctly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AND&#8230;this application of skill and experience will probably protect you. From hackers; from legal action; from causing harm; from losing money; or from bad business decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our &#8220;no&#8221; might seem like a block in your path. But, from the right person, it&#8217;s valuable insight into what you should be doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">We Are Creative!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Often these skilled and experienced people are creative and want to find a way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite my seeming reluctance when you throw something new at me, I love new ideas. I <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/337727445\">preach creativity.<\/a> I have <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/projects\/\">umpteen stupid side projects<\/a> that I tinker with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/337727445?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But when you put creative things out into the real world you do have to consider the consequences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People that help you to do that are like gold dust. They may seem awkward to others in their teams. They may need to be gently nudged away from their pickiness at times. But they are valuable assets. Their insight should be celebrated and embraced. We should do this more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go cheer on the pedant on your team today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Literally all *I* do&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose I should chip in then, in jest and in solidarity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Literally all I do&#8230;as a software and website developer:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Really?!<\/li><li>And how will this look\/work on mobile?<\/li><li>Do you have a privacy policy for that form?<\/li><li>That slider probably isn&#8217;t a good idea.<\/li><li>And on mobile?<\/li><li>Seriously, have you tested it on your phone?<\/li><li>That won&#8217;t work<\/li><li>Really?!<\/li><li>And what if the title wraps on to two lines?<\/li><li>Do you really need that?<\/li><li>And what about on a portrait tablet?<\/li><li>How will you get consent for GDPR?<\/li><li>Really?!<\/li><li>YAY!

A number of things had happened in quick succession that had caused me to have a bit of a moment. In this moment I felt incredibly alien, like my brain works SO differently to everyone else&#8217;s. Despite the morning being spent with my wife and some of my best friends &#8211; people that know each other very well &#8211; I was left feeling like no one understood me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the main reason for this &#8211; the main way in which my brain seems to  work differently &#8211; is that changes of plan, or new ideas, cause a cascade of thoughts and questions that need to be resolved before I can become excited about something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably some of this is learned behaviour or habit, but I also put this down to having the character trait of &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2015\/07\/highly-sensitive\/\">High sensitivity<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To others observing, or expecting a response from me, this probably appears as negativity or aloofness or cynicism or needless anxiety (I won&#8217;t pretend &#8211; sometimes I get anxious if too much of this stuff happens at once).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By why is it seen this way? Why is this sensitivity not seen as positive?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Literally, all I do&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday a bunch of tweets went around that started &#8220;Literally all I do as a&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to say for sure where it started, but I traced it back to an attorney:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Literally all I do as an attorney:<br><br>No.<br>No. <br>Seriously, no. <br>Like, how did you even think this was a good idea. <br>Stop immediately.<br>No, that doesn&#39;t make it okay, either. <br>No. <br>Stop. <br>Stop it, you can\u2019t do that.<br>No.<\/p>&mdash; FP (@FaciePrima) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FaciePrima\/status\/1194785651574505472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 14, 2019<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure it spun off in all sorts of directions, but there was parenting:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Literally all I do as a Dad:<br><br>No. <br>No. <br>Don&#39;t do that. <br>No, that girls decision doesn&#39;t matter. <br>No. <br>No, social media doesn&#39;t have good ideas. <br>No. <br>Stop immediately. <br>No, that doesn&#39;t make it okay, either. <br>No. <br>Stop, don&#39;t do that. <br>No.<\/p>&mdash; Temptedge (@Anthony13051547) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Anthony13051547\/status\/1195436580120354817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 15, 2019<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And Feline care:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">All I do as a human with cats:<br>No.<br>It is not dinner time yet.<br>No, not yet either.<br>No.<br>Get off the stove it will kill you.<br>No.<br>Get off the stairs you will kill me.<br>No, please, barf on the tile instead!<br>No.<br>It\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re cute.<\/p>&mdash; Kim Goodwin (@kimgoodwin) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kimgoodwin\/status\/1197136346466471944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 20, 2019<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And it ended up coming to me via UX Design:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Literally all I do as a UX designer:<br><br>No.<br>No.<br>Have you spoken to a current user?<br>NO.<br>How would anyone except you know where that option is?<br>No one will use it.<br>No.<br>Which metric is this meant to push?<br>How does this fit into the content model?<br>Absolutely not.<br>Sales is not the user. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/p3oiy0hY00\">https:\/\/t.co\/p3oiy0hY00<\/a><\/p>&mdash; Pavel A.

But they made me think of how saying &#8220;no&#8221; or asking awkward questions is so often seen as negative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All these people, in their jobs, are applying their education, experience, wisdom of years, and attention to detail to Doing The Right Thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a (mis)quote about how if a job takes me 30 minutes, it because of the ten years of training and experience I have; you pay for the ten years, not the 30 minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But is it also true that a person&#8217;s job might be telling you not to do something at all. Or that to do that 30 minute job actually requires 2 days of preparatory work doing other things in order to do it correctly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AND&#8230;this application of skill and experience will probably protect you. From hackers; from legal action; from causing harm; from losing money; or from bad business decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our &#8220;no&#8221; might seem like a block in your path. But, from the right person, it&#8217;s valuable insight into what you should be doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">We Are Creative!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Often these skilled and experienced people are creative and want to find a way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite my seeming reluctance when you throw something new at me, I love new ideas. I <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/337727445\">preach creativity.<\/a> I have <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/projects\/\">umpteen stupid side projects<\/a> that I tinker with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/337727445?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But when you put creative things out into the real world you do have to consider the consequences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People that help you to do that are like gold dust. They may seem awkward to others in their teams. They may need to be gently nudged away from their pickiness at times. But they are valuable assets. Their insight should be celebrated and embraced. We should do this more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go cheer on the pedant on your team today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Literally all *I* do&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose I should chip in then, in jest and in solidarity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Literally all I do&#8230;as a software and website developer:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Really?!<\/li><li>And how will this look\/work on mobile?<\/li><li>Do you have a privacy policy for that form?<\/li><li>That slider probably isn&#8217;t a good idea.<\/li><li>And on mobile?<\/li><li>Seriously, have you tested it on your phone?<\/li><li>That won&#8217;t work<\/li><li>Really?!<\/li><li>And what if the title wraps on to two lines?<\/li><li>Do you really need that?<\/li><li>And what about on a portrait tablet?<\/li><li>How will you get consent for GDPR?<\/li><li>Really?!<\/li><li>YAY!

Here&#8217;s how!<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that I have built my own personal Messenger \u201cbot\u201d for school information called SchoolBot.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But at some point I\u2019d love for it to be more public, to get people to test it, to get some feedback from more normal people than I to see if it\u2019s really, actually useful, or just a toy for me to play with.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So I created a test instance for \u201cSpringfield Elementary\u201d with the aim of allowing others to try it out.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I don\u2019t want to make this thing public to everyone &#8211; but I do want people to be able to find it and give controlled access to it to test it out. But HOW does this work?<\/p>\r\n<p>The way that Facebook Messenger bots use apps and pages and which users are allowed to use which things when you\u2019re in test\/development mode is REALLY confusing. But I think I\u2019ve figured it out.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The component parts<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2018m building SchoolBot with BotMan &#8211; a Laravel-based chatbot framework. This forms the ultimate back-end for the bot.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At the \u201cfront end\u201d of this system is a page that you message through Facebook Messenger.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And a Facebook App connects the page to the BotMan back-end, passing messages between the two.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Private, published, dev, live and all the roles!<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The two Facebook components &#8211; the app and the page &#8211; both have a status. The page can be Published or Unpublished. The app can be in development mode, or live mode.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Development Apps vs Live Apps<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Development apps are only usable by those users that have been added with an app role.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To allow anyone to use your app you need to make the app live. To get your app live can be quite tricky as you may need to submit it for review, and this requires all sorts of things like privacy policies and maybe organisational verification. (This is a GOOD thing! It prevents random apps stealing all your data!!)<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So if you want to just do some testing before you apply for review, or if you\u2019re waiting to go through the review process you\u2019ll be stuck in development mode.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Published vs Unpublished pages<\/h3>\r\n<p>Unpublished pages won&#8217;t be found in search and can only be seen by and interacted with by those users that have been added with a page role.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Page roles<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A published page can be searched for and discovered by anyone. But an unpublished page can only be seen and used by people who have a Page Role.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Page Roles are a bit annoying because there isn\u2019t a role that lets someone just see and use an unpublished page. The lowest level is \u201cAnalyst\u201d which \u201cCan see which admin created a post or comment and view Insights.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">App Roles<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>App Roles are better because you can actually give people a \u201cTester\u201d role. BUT&#8230;App Roles are annoying for test users because they have to use the developer.facebook.com developer portal to accept their role and the whole thing is a bit scary if they\u2019ve not seen it before.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Putting it together<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So I have my Page which talks to my BotMan through my App. I\u2019ve connected them all together (this is a whole other post worth of stuff) and now I\u2019m wanting to bring in some people to test it the Messenger bot. What do we have to do?:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Page can be published or unpublished. Just bear in mind that it\u2019s harder for people to find if it\u2019s unpublished &#8211; you\u2019ll probably have to send them a link.<\/li>\r\n<li>IF the Page is unpublished then the test users will need to be added with a Page Role, the lowest of which is \u201cAnalyst\u201d. And then you\u2019ll have to send them the link to the page too because it won&#8217;t be found in search.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>They should then be able to Message the page once you set up a \u201cSend Message\u201d button on the page. But their message won\u2019t get to the Bot because they aren\u2019t allowed to use the app part that relays the message. So&#8230;<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You need to go to the developer portal and add them as a &#8220;Tester&#8221;. This will send them an invite but they&#8217;ll need to log in to the developer portal themselves to accept it.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>Done!<\/h2>\r\n<p>With that all done, the person should be able to send a message to the page, have it relayed to the bot by the app, and the have the responses relayed back too.<\/p>\r\n<p>It&#8217;s not massively easy, and it&#8217;s definitely not clear. But you CAN have test users for your Messenger bot in this way.<\/p>\r\n<p>YAY!<\/p>\r\n",

        "content": "\r\n<p><em>It&#8217;s not massively easy, and it&#8217;s definitely not clear. But you CAN have test users for your Messenger bot. Here&#8217;s how!<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that I have built my own personal Messenger \u201cbot\u201d for school information called SchoolBot.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But at some point I\u2019d love for it to be more public, to get people to test it, to get some feedback from more normal people than I to see if it\u2019s really, actually useful, or just a toy for me to play with.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So I created a test instance for \u201cSpringfield Elementary\u201d with the aim of allowing others to try it out.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I don\u2019t want to make this thing public to everyone &#8211; but I do want people to be able to find it and give controlled access to it to test it out. But HOW does this work?<\/p>\r\n<p>The way that Facebook Messenger bots use apps and pages and which users are allowed to use which things when you\u2019re in test\/development mode is REALLY confusing. But I think I\u2019ve figured it out.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The component parts<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2018m building SchoolBot with BotMan &#8211; a Laravel-based chatbot framework. This forms the ultimate back-end for the bot.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At the \u201cfront end\u201d of this system is a page that you message through Facebook Messenger.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And a Facebook App connects the page to the BotMan back-end, passing messages between the two.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Private, published, dev, live and all the roles!<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The two Facebook components &#8211; the app and the page &#8211; both have a status. The page can be Published or Unpublished. The app can be in development mode, or live mode.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Development Apps vs Live Apps<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Development apps are only usable by those users that have been added with an app role.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To allow anyone to use your app you need to make the app live. To get your app live can be quite tricky as you may need to submit it for review, and this requires all sorts of things like privacy policies and maybe organisational verification. (This is a GOOD thing! It prevents random apps stealing all your data!!)<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So if you want to just do some testing before you apply for review, or if you\u2019re waiting to go through the review process you\u2019ll be stuck in development mode.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Published vs Unpublished pages<\/h3>\r\n<p>Unpublished pages won&#8217;t be found in search and can only be seen by and interacted with by those users that have been added with a page role.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Page roles<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A published page can be searched for and discovered by anyone. But an unpublished page can only be seen and used by people who have a Page Role.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Page Roles are a bit annoying because there isn\u2019t a role that lets someone just see and use an unpublished page. The lowest level is \u201cAnalyst\u201d which \u201cCan see which admin created a post or comment and view Insights.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">App Roles<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>App Roles are better because you can actually give people a \u201cTester\u201d role. BUT&#8230;App Roles are annoying for test users because they have to use the developer.facebook.com developer portal to accept their role and the whole thing is a bit scary if they\u2019ve not seen it before.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Putting it together<\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So I have my Page which talks to my BotMan through my App. I\u2019ve connected them all together (this is a whole other post worth of stuff) and now I\u2019m wanting to bring in some people to test it the Messenger bot. What do we have to do?:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Page can be published or unpublished. Just bear in mind that it\u2019s harder for people to find if it\u2019s unpublished &#8211; you\u2019ll probably have to send them a link.<\/li>\r\n<li>IF the Page is unpublished then the test users will need to be added with a Page Role, the lowest of which is \u201cAnalyst\u201d. And then you\u2019ll have to send them the link to the page too because it won&#8217;t be found in search.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>They should then be able to Message the page once you set up a \u201cSend Message\u201d button on the page. But their message won\u2019t get to the Bot because they aren\u2019t allowed to use the app part that relays the message. So&#8230;<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You need to go to the developer portal and add them as a &#8220;Tester&#8221;. This will send them an invite but they&#8217;ll need to log in to the developer portal themselves to accept it.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2>Done!<\/h2>\r\n<p>With that all done, the person should be able to send a message to the page, have it relayed to the bot by the app, and the have the responses relayed back too.<\/p>\r\n<p>It&#8217;s not massively easy, and it&#8217;s definitely not clear. But you CAN have test users for your Messenger bot in this way.<\/p>\r\n<p>YAY!<\/p>\r\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p><em>I&#8217;m sure you all know that the rules about how websites use cookies have changed a bit over the last few years. This post explains my current setup for cookie consents and analytics on WordPress sites.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Update: This post is still worth reading to work through the issue, but there is now <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/gdpr-cookie-compliance\/\">a free plugin that seems to do everything<\/a> all in one without any additional hand-coding required. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Firstly: Do you need analytics?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I start explaining HOW I set up cookie consent for analytics, it&#8217;s worth asking yourself: &#8220;Do I need analytics?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of my clients run small websites and feel like they should have analytics, but can&#8217;t often articulate why, and using a big analytics provider like Google Analytics or WordPress&#8217;s Jetpack Stats could mean that your users are being unnecessarily tracked and that personally identifiable data could be being shipped outside the EU.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analytics may or may not be private\/anonymous enough to avoid GDPR (this seems debatable still) but the starting point should be that you don&#8217;t have them installed, and only add them when you have a clear plan for using them and an up to date privacy policy that you understand and actually implement. Remember that a policy should reflect what you do rather than being a document of what you aspire to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do you need Google Analytics?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people default to wanting Google Analytics as it&#8217;s the tool that they&#8217;ve heard of and used before. But as well as thinking about Google&#8217;s tracking and privacy, it&#8217;s worth considering that Google Analytics is a HUGE piece of software that does enormous amounts of things that you probably don&#8217;t need or even understand, and it&#8217;s very complicated as a result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last few years a number of other, simpler, privacy-focussed analytics tools have sprung up, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/usefathom.com\/\">Fathom<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/simpleanalytics.com\/\">Simple Analytics<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ticksel.com\/\">Ticksel<\/a>. Some of these don&#8217;t use cookies at all, or have cookie-free options. They cost, but if both your analytics and your users are important to you then maybe it&#8217;s worth a small amount each month to get a good service?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">OK, you want Google Analytics. What next?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;ve decided you&#8217;re happy with Google Analytics (I&#8217;ll call it GA from here on), and &#8211; here&#8217;s a little checklist before you get started:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You have good reason to want to collect this data about people visiting your website and will regularly make use of the information in constructive ways.<\/li><li>You don&#8217;t mind the complexity and possible user tracking issues.<\/li><li>You&#8217;re happy with the <a href=\"https:\/\/marketingplatform.google.com\/about\/analytics\/terms\/gb\/\">terms of service<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/privacy.google.com\/businesses\/processorterms\/\">data processing terms<\/a>.<\/li><li>You have a privacy policy that explains what data you collect, why you collect it and what you do with it, including passing it to Google.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you need to be aware that GA uses cookies and that these are &#8220;non-essential&#8221; cookies and that <a href=\"https:\/\/ico.org.uk\/for-organisations\/guide-to-pecr\/guidance-on-the-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies\/\">the rules<\/a> now state that you must get consent from users before you use the cookies. Consent can not be assumed!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(This is my interpretation. I am not a lawyer. This is not legal advice. I can not be held responsible for anything that happens as a result of you taking action based on this article. Seek your own legal advice should you need it.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK. Now we&#8217;re good. So how do I set up cookie consent and analytics on my WordPress website?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choosing a plugin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a developer with time on your hands you could probably build your own thing, but I went and tried some of the popular cookie consent plugins to see if any did what I wanted. My needs were:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Can be configured to load scripts only once consent is given<\/li><li>Reloads page after consent is given, preserving the referrer<\/li><li>Is clear about the difference between necessary and non-necessary cookies<\/li><li>Can be styled and have texts, buttons and links changed<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I confess that I stopped looking when I found one that fulfilled my criteria. That plugin is <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/cookie-law-info\/\">GDPR Cookie Consent<\/a> by Webtoffee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Configuring the plugin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the steps that I take to configure the plugin &#8211; you should determine your own set of options but here&#8217;s mine:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Go to GDPR Cookie Consent in the WordPress Dashboard.<\/li><li>Work through the General -&gt; Cookie Bar options, changing any that you want.<\/li><li>Turn the Show Again Tab off in General -&gt; Show Again Tab &#8211; I&#8217;ve decided that I don&#8217;t need this and it&#8217;s intrusive.<\/li><li>In General -&gt; Other I set &#8220;Reload after accept button click&#8221; to &#8220;Yes&#8221; to allow the page to reload after cookies are accepted. I&#8217;ve checked that the referrer header is preserved. <\/li><li>In &#8220;Customise Cookie Bar&#8221; I tailor the message &#8211; specifically I make this refer to the privacy policy and include a <code>[cookie_link]<\/code> shortcode. I also REMOVE the <code>[cookie_settings]<\/code> link because I don&#8217;t depend on these for enabling the non-necessary cookies. More on this later.<\/li><li>I tailor the colours in Customise Cookie Bar, and each of the sub-panels of &#8220;Customise buttons&#8221;<\/li><li>On Customise Buttons -&gt; Read More Link I also set the URL or Page to be the Privacy Policy page<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it for settings. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I skip the Cookie List and Policy Generator in the GDRP Cookie Consent plugins, assuming that the privacy policy has already been written, but you may want to pay these features some attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you need to actually add the Google Analytics code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally I thought I&#8217;d do this in the &#8220;Non-necessary cookie&#8221; setting bit in the plugin BUT I thought that the &#8220;Accept&#8221; button would turn on all Non-necessary cookies, but it doesn&#8217;t! To turn on non-necessary cookies a website visitor needs to use the cookie settings option, and change a toggle. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this bit didn&#8217;t work:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><s>Because we want this to only load when cookies are accepted, I add this in the Non-necessary cookie settings of the plugin.<\/s><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><s>Set &#8220;Enable Non-necessary cookie&#8221; to &#8220;Yes&#8221; if it&#8217;s not already.<\/s><\/li><li><s>Set &#8220;Default state&#8221; to &#8220;Disabled&#8221;<\/s><\/li><li><s>I leave the default description. But you should review it and confirm it&#8217;s OK.<\/s><\/li><li><s>You can then choose to add your script tag to the header or footer.<\/s><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><s>You&#8217;ll need to visit Google Analytics to get your script code. And Google ask for it to be the first thing in the header, but that&#8217;s probably unrealistic here. Add it, <code>&lt;script&gt;<\/code> tags and all to the &#8220;HEAD&#8221; section.<\/s><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My next thought was to add a code snippet to my theme&#8217;s <code>functions.php<\/code> that detected the &#8220;Accepted&#8221; cookie and loaded the analytics in the header. The code looked like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n\/**\n * Include Google Analytics in the head only if the viewed_cookie_policy cookies is set\n * This cookie is set by the GDPR Cookie Consent plugin once cookies are accepted\n *\/\nadd_action('wp_head', 'mytheme_google_analytics');\nfunction mytheme_google_analytics() {\n\tif (isset($_COOKIE&#x5B;'viewed_cookie_policy'])) {\n\t\t?&gt;\n\t\t&lt;!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics --&gt;\n\t\t&lt;script async src=&quot;https:\/\/www.googletagmanager.com\/gtag\/js?id=UA-XXXXXXXXX-1&quot;&gt;&lt;\/script&gt;\n\t\t&lt;script&gt;\n\t\t  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || &#x5B;];\n\t\t  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n\t\t  gtag('js', new Date());\n\n\t\t  gtag('config', 'UA-XXXXXXXXXX-1');\n\t\t&lt;\/script&gt;\n\t\t&lt;?php\n\t}\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>The problem with THIS code is that if you&#8217;re doing page caching it won&#8217;t work. You could try fragment caching but that&#8217;s pretty hard to set up on most hosting setups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my next and final step was to print the GA code from the theme, but just move the logic into the JavaScript. This needed a bit of wrangling to create the Tag Manager script tag but it wasn&#8217;t too hard. This is my final PHP code &#8211; be sure to replace both instances of UA-XXXXXXXXX-1 with your own GA property ID.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nadd_action('wp_head', 'mytheme_google_analytics');\nfunction mytheme_google_analytics() {\n\t?&gt;\n\t&lt;script&gt;\n\t\tif (document.cookie.indexOf(&quot;viewed_cookie_policy=&quot;) &gt;= 0) {\n\t\t\tvar analyticsScriptTag = document.createElement('script');\n\t\t\tanalyticsScriptTag.async=true;\n\t\t\tanalyticsScriptTag.src=&quot;https:\/\/www.googletagmanager.com\/gtag\/js?id=UA-XXXXXXXXX-1&quot;;\n\t\t\tdocument.head.prepend(analyticsScriptTag);\n\n\t\t\twindow.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || &#x5B;];\n\t\t\tfunction gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n\t  \t\tgtag('js', new Date());\n\t  \t\tgtag('config', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-1');\n\t  \t}\n\t&lt;\/script&gt;\n\t&lt;?php\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And yes, you could, and probably should, put this in a plugin to preserve the functionality across theme changes. I&#8217;ll work on a good way to do that sometime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s probably a good idea to clear any caches and CDNs you may have too just to make sure your changes get out there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AND, if you want to test this, make sure you use a private browsing window and turn off any tracking blockers you might have. I&#8217;m using Firefox and it&#8217;s blocking is pretty strong these days. Clicking &#8220;Accept&#8221; may reload the page and enable cookies, but it&#8217;s also possible you&#8217;re not sending page hits to GA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"885\" height=\"44\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screenshot-2019-11-15-at-13.08.39.png\" alt=\"Dev tools console showing Google Analytics being blocked.\" class=\"wp-image-8798\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screenshot-2019-11-15-at-13.08.39.png 885w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screenshot-2019-11-15-at-13.08.39-300x15.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screenshot-2019-11-15-at-13.08.39-768x38.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px\" \/><figcaption>Consult the dev tools console if it&#8217;s not working!

I know, there&#8217;s a lot to consider here, but I finish just by saying that all these new rules are a GOOD THING. Yes, the internet is still working out the best ways of adhering to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But protecting your website visitors from tracking, collecting only the information you will need and use about them, keeping their personal data private, and being transparent about what data you collect and how you use it are all positive steps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These things are sometimes annoying &#8211; and I hope I&#8217;ve chosen a solution here that isn&#8217;t too annoying &#8211; but they not only protect your website visitors as they browse the web, they protect YOU from it too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope this was helpful.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>I&#8217;m sure you all know that the rules about how websites use cookies have changed a bit over the last few years. This post explains my current setup for cookie consents and analytics on WordPress sites.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Update: This post is still worth reading to work through the issue, but there is now <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/gdpr-cookie-compliance\/\">a free plugin that seems to do everything<\/a> all in one without any additional hand-coding required. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Firstly: Do you need analytics?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I start explaining HOW I set up cookie consent for analytics, it&#8217;s worth asking yourself: &#8220;Do I need analytics?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of my clients run small websites and feel like they should have analytics, but can&#8217;t often articulate why, and using a big analytics provider like Google Analytics or WordPress&#8217;s Jetpack Stats could mean that your users are being unnecessarily tracked and that personally identifiable data could be being shipped outside the EU.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analytics may or may not be private\/anonymous enough to avoid GDPR (this seems debatable still) but the starting point should be that you don&#8217;t have them installed, and only add them when you have a clear plan for using them and an up to date privacy policy that you understand and actually implement. Remember that a policy should reflect what you do rather than being a document of what you aspire to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do you need Google Analytics?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people default to wanting Google Analytics as it&#8217;s the tool that they&#8217;ve heard of and used before. But as well as thinking about Google&#8217;s tracking and privacy, it&#8217;s worth considering that Google Analytics is a HUGE piece of software that does enormous amounts of things that you probably don&#8217;t need or even understand, and it&#8217;s very complicated as a result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last few years a number of other, simpler, privacy-focussed analytics tools have sprung up, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/usefathom.com\/\">Fathom<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/simpleanalytics.com\/\">Simple Analytics<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ticksel.com\/\">Ticksel<\/a>. Some of these don&#8217;t use cookies at all, or have cookie-free options. They cost, but if both your analytics and your users are important to you then maybe it&#8217;s worth a small amount each month to get a good service?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">OK, you want Google Analytics. What next?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;ve decided you&#8217;re happy with Google Analytics (I&#8217;ll call it GA from here on), and &#8211; here&#8217;s a little checklist before you get started:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You have good reason to want to collect this data about people visiting your website and will regularly make use of the information in constructive ways.<\/li><li>You don&#8217;t mind the complexity and possible user tracking issues.<\/li><li>You&#8217;re happy with the <a href=\"https:\/\/marketingplatform.google.com\/about\/analytics\/terms\/gb\/\">terms of service<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/privacy.google.com\/businesses\/processorterms\/\">data processing terms<\/a>.<\/li><li>You have a privacy policy that explains what data you collect, why you collect it and what you do with it, including passing it to Google.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you need to be aware that GA uses cookies and that these are &#8220;non-essential&#8221; cookies and that <a href=\"https:\/\/ico.org.uk\/for-organisations\/guide-to-pecr\/guidance-on-the-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies\/\">the rules<\/a> now state that you must get consent from users before you use the cookies. Consent can not be assumed!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(This is my interpretation. I am not a lawyer. This is not legal advice. I can not be held responsible for anything that happens as a result of you taking action based on this article. Seek your own legal advice should you need it.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK. Now we&#8217;re good. So how do I set up cookie consent and analytics on my WordPress website?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choosing a plugin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a developer with time on your hands you could probably build your own thing, but I went and tried some of the popular cookie consent plugins to see if any did what I wanted. My needs were:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Can be configured to load scripts only once consent is given<\/li><li>Reloads page after consent is given, preserving the referrer<\/li><li>Is clear about the difference between necessary and non-necessary cookies<\/li><li>Can be styled and have texts, buttons and links changed<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I confess that I stopped looking when I found one that fulfilled my criteria. That plugin is <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/cookie-law-info\/\">GDPR Cookie Consent<\/a> by Webtoffee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Configuring the plugin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the steps that I take to configure the plugin &#8211; you should determine your own set of options but here&#8217;s mine:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Go to GDPR Cookie Consent in the WordPress Dashboard.<\/li><li>Work through the General -&gt; Cookie Bar options, changing any that you want.<\/li><li>Turn the Show Again Tab off in General -&gt; Show Again Tab &#8211; I&#8217;ve decided that I don&#8217;t need this and it&#8217;s intrusive.<\/li><li>In General -&gt; Other I set &#8220;Reload after accept button click&#8221; to &#8220;Yes&#8221; to allow the page to reload after cookies are accepted. I&#8217;ve checked that the referrer header is preserved. <\/li><li>In &#8220;Customise Cookie Bar&#8221; I tailor the message &#8211; specifically I make this refer to the privacy policy and include a <code>[cookie_link]<\/code> shortcode. I also REMOVE the <code>[cookie_settings]<\/code> link because I don&#8217;t depend on these for enabling the non-necessary cookies. More on this later.<\/li><li>I tailor the colours in Customise Cookie Bar, and each of the sub-panels of &#8220;Customise buttons&#8221;<\/li><li>On Customise Buttons -&gt; Read More Link I also set the URL or Page to be the Privacy Policy page<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it for settings. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I skip the Cookie List and Policy Generator in the GDRP Cookie Consent plugins, assuming that the privacy policy has already been written, but you may want to pay these features some attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you need to actually add the Google Analytics code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally I thought I&#8217;d do this in the &#8220;Non-necessary cookie&#8221; setting bit in the plugin BUT I thought that the &#8220;Accept&#8221; button would turn on all Non-necessary cookies, but it doesn&#8217;t! To turn on non-necessary cookies a website visitor needs to use the cookie settings option, and change a toggle. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this bit didn&#8217;t work:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><s>Because we want this to only load when cookies are accepted, I add this in the Non-necessary cookie settings of the plugin.<\/s><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><s>Set &#8220;Enable Non-necessary cookie&#8221; to &#8220;Yes&#8221; if it&#8217;s not already.<\/s><\/li><li><s>Set &#8220;Default state&#8221; to &#8220;Disabled&#8221;<\/s><\/li><li><s>I leave the default description. But you should review it and confirm it&#8217;s OK.<\/s><\/li><li><s>You can then choose to add your script tag to the header or footer.<\/s><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><s>You&#8217;ll need to visit Google Analytics to get your script code. And Google ask for it to be the first thing in the header, but that&#8217;s probably unrealistic here. Add it, <code>&lt;script&gt;<\/code> tags and all to the &#8220;HEAD&#8221; section.<\/s><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My next thought was to add a code snippet to my theme&#8217;s <code>functions.php<\/code> that detected the &#8220;Accepted&#8221; cookie and loaded the analytics in the header. The code looked like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n\/**\n * Include Google Analytics in the head only if the viewed_cookie_policy cookies is set\n * This cookie is set by the GDPR Cookie Consent plugin once cookies are accepted\n *\/\nadd_action('wp_head', 'mytheme_google_analytics');\nfunction mytheme_google_analytics() {\n\tif (isset($_COOKIE&#x5B;'viewed_cookie_policy'])) {\n\t\t?&gt;\n\t\t&lt;!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics --&gt;\n\t\t&lt;script async src=&quot;https:\/\/www.googletagmanager.com\/gtag\/js?id=UA-XXXXXXXXX-1&quot;&gt;&lt;\/script&gt;\n\t\t&lt;script&gt;\n\t\t  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || &#x5B;];\n\t\t  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n\t\t  gtag('js', new Date());\n\n\t\t  gtag('config', 'UA-XXXXXXXXXX-1');\n\t\t&lt;\/script&gt;\n\t\t&lt;?php\n\t}\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>The problem with THIS code is that if you&#8217;re doing page caching it won&#8217;t work. You could try fragment caching but that&#8217;s pretty hard to set up on most hosting setups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my next and final step was to print the GA code from the theme, but just move the logic into the JavaScript. This needed a bit of wrangling to create the Tag Manager script tag but it wasn&#8217;t too hard. This is my final PHP code &#8211; be sure to replace both instances of UA-XXXXXXXXX-1 with your own GA property ID.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nadd_action('wp_head', 'mytheme_google_analytics');\nfunction mytheme_google_analytics() {\n\t?&gt;\n\t&lt;script&gt;\n\t\tif (document.cookie.indexOf(&quot;viewed_cookie_policy=&quot;) &gt;= 0) {\n\t\t\tvar analyticsScriptTag = document.createElement('script');\n\t\t\tanalyticsScriptTag.async=true;\n\t\t\tanalyticsScriptTag.src=&quot;https:\/\/www.googletagmanager.com\/gtag\/js?id=UA-XXXXXXXXX-1&quot;;\n\t\t\tdocument.head.prepend(analyticsScriptTag);\n\n\t\t\twindow.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || &#x5B;];\n\t\t\tfunction gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n\t  \t\tgtag('js', new Date());\n\t  \t\tgtag('config', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-1');\n\t  \t}\n\t&lt;\/script&gt;\n\t&lt;?php\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And yes, you could, and probably should, put this in a plugin to preserve the functionality across theme changes. I&#8217;ll work on a good way to do that sometime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s probably a good idea to clear any caches and CDNs you may have too just to make sure your changes get out there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AND, if you want to test this, make sure you use a private browsing window and turn off any tracking blockers you might have. I&#8217;m using Firefox and it&#8217;s blocking is pretty strong these days. Clicking &#8220;Accept&#8221; may reload the page and enable cookies, but it&#8217;s also possible you&#8217;re not sending page hits to GA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"885\" height=\"44\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screenshot-2019-11-15-at-13.08.39.png\" alt=\"Dev tools console showing Google Analytics being blocked.\" class=\"wp-image-8798\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screenshot-2019-11-15-at-13.08.39.png 885w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screenshot-2019-11-15-at-13.08.39-300x15.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screenshot-2019-11-15-at-13.08.39-768x38.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px\" \/><figcaption>Consult the dev tools console if it&#8217;s not working!

I know, there&#8217;s a lot to consider here, but I finish just by saying that all these new rules are a GOOD THING. Yes, the internet is still working out the best ways of adhering to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But protecting your website visitors from tracking, collecting only the information you will need and use about them, keeping their personal data private, and being transparent about what data you collect and how you use it are all positive steps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These things are sometimes annoying &#8211; and I hope I&#8217;ve chosen a solution here that isn&#8217;t too annoying &#8211; but they not only protect your website visitors as they browse the web, they protect YOU from it too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope this was helpful.<\/p>\n",

It\u2019s normal to want validation, but don\u2019t have yourself on it entirely.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What if there isn\u2019t a path?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same episode, Paul talked about being asked for long term goals and how sometimes &#8211; especially when he\u2019s struggling &#8211; he isn\u2019t focussed on the long term goals he\u2019s focussed on doing what he has to do today, in the moment. Sometimes he knows what he has to do in the present, right now, and the focus is on doing that and not worrying about the bigger goals and the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve had some difficult weeks of late, and this idea that \u201cdoing the stuff of today is enough\u201d has really helped me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know there are some bigger goals, and they are good, but they also seem unattainable at times. So sometimes, doing what I have to do today is enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve been ill. My kids have been ill and I\u2019ve had to look after them. It\u2019s been a month of not getting much done. But I\u2019ve had to accept that. I\u2019ve had to accept that I didn\u2019t walk much along The Path today, but what I did today was enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What have you learned?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m grateful for all the podcasts and videos and articles. There is a lot of good knowledge being passed around in the world. These things have helped me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder what has helped you lately? Leave your own wisdom learned in the comments.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I was on a beautiful walk in rural Devon the other week and I was listening to some podcasts and several things stood out to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Doing is better than telling!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Taylor Orwell &#8211; the creator of Laravel &#8211; is currently using his \u201cLaravel Snippet\u201d podcast to share lessons he\u2019s learned while developing software products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/pca.st\/episode\/1c9b4f48-e8bc-4ff0-9fe5-0a819bc24fb7\">Episode 17 on \u201cMotivation and Discipline\u201d<\/a> had a lot of good take-aways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The background to this is that I have several side products that could become paid products in one way or another, and I\u2019m constantly trying to push them forward and test the water to see which to run with the most.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Taylor said (paraphrased): \u201cDon\u2019t announce that you are going to do something &#8211; just do it!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apparently there is some research that shows that, to your brain, announcing something gives the same sense of completion as actually doing it, and so removes your motivation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve been really guilty of this with side projects of late. I was really going to get going with Press Ups again, but that\u2019s fallen by the wayside because of illness and having to prioritise paid work. But I also wonder how much of that me procrastinating because my brain thinks I\u2019ve already done it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Save you announcements for when you are DONE!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How much of my work is tied to my self worth?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/pca.st\/episode\/d29cbe2e-9f3b-4362-927d-0cc94d0d6b2f\">Episode 50 of Paul Jarvis and Kaleigh Moor\u2019s Creative Class podcast<\/a> was good too &#8211; they talked about mental health, and it was really valuable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think a lot of freelancers could learn from the paragraph:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>How much of my work is tied to my self worth? It\u2019s normal to want validation, but don\u2019t have yourself on it entirely.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What if there isn\u2019t a path?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same episode, Paul talked about being asked for long term goals and how sometimes &#8211; especially when he\u2019s struggling &#8211; he isn\u2019t focussed on the long term goals he\u2019s focussed on doing what he has to do today, in the moment. Sometimes he knows what he has to do in the present, right now, and the focus is on doing that and not worrying about the bigger goals and the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve had some difficult weeks of late, and this idea that \u201cdoing the stuff of today is enough\u201d has really helped me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know there are some bigger goals, and they are good, but they also seem unattainable at times. So sometimes, doing what I have to do today is enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve been ill. My kids have been ill and I\u2019ve had to look after them. It\u2019s been a month of not getting much done. But I\u2019ve had to accept that. I\u2019ve had to accept that I didn\u2019t walk much along The Path today, but what I did today was enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What have you learned?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m grateful for all the podcasts and videos and articles. There is a lot of good knowledge being passed around in the world. These things have helped me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder what has helped you lately? Leave your own wisdom learned in the comments.<\/p>\n",
