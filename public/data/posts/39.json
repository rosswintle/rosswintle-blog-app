I&#8217;m going to start cycling into work from next week, I&#8217;ve decided. It&#8217;s a 7 mile ride one way and I&#8217;ve worked out a route which mostly cuts through parks and quiet roads which I&#8217;m happy about. I don&#8217;t have a bike at the moment. This is where I need your advice.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to borrow a bike for a week to see if I can hack it before I spend any money but I&#8217;m basically looking for a road bike which doesn&#8217;t sit me down too low (so a road-mountain hybrid?) and I&#8217;m not willing to spend a lot of money. I mean something that won&#8217;t fall to bits, will do the job and will last for the next 3 or 4 years or so &#8211; all for under \u00a3200ish (or \u00a3150 pref). What do you think? I&#8217;ve looked on the Halfords website and they had 2 suitable ones but it occurred to me that real bike afficianados such as yourself probably have ways and means of getting decent bikes from non-high street chains at better prices.<\/p>\n<p>So any ideas on all of that greatly appreciated if you have the time to reply!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I ended up writing a fairly lengthly reply to his question which I imagine is one that many people will be asking this year. \u00a0I&#8217;ve been given permission to post the message here in case it&#8217;s of use to anyone else. So&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>What Bike?<\/h2>\n<p>Now&#8230;business. I&#8217;m not an expert, but I&#8217;ll happily share my many years of varied experiences and what I do know.<\/p>\n<p>First of all&#8230;well done! Deciding to cycle commute, especially a 7-miler, is a big decision, but SUCH a positive one. I really hope you find yourself enjoying it and finding it fun as well as reaping the health, financial and environmental benefits.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a3200 is a fairly limited budget and you&#8217;ll have to make some trade-offs. I think you&#8217;ve already made the wisest decision which is to NOT by a cheap mountain bike. Off-road tires have greater rolling resistance (drag on the road) and any kind of suspension will sap energy.<\/p>\n<p>You then need to ask questions like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>will you need to carry luggage?<\/li>\n<li>will you be wearing cycle-specific clothing, or aiming to ride in ordinary work-wear?<\/li>\n<li>are you cycling for fitness too, or just pootling slowly to get from A-to-B?<\/li>\n<li>how much work might you be willing to put in to maintenance\/renovation?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Those questions will help you decide what to get.<\/p>\n<p>Next tip &#8211; DON&#8217;T go to Halfords. I&#8217;d really recommend going to a local bike shop, tell them what you want, get some advice, try some bikes out, get fitted properly, ask if they&#8217;ll do a deal (they may throw in lights, helmets, locks, etc), and get to know them &#8211; you WILL go back for maintenance and parts, so get to know them.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to pootle and carry luggage then something like a Raleigh Pioneer is a cheap, sturdy workhorse &#8211; they have racks for luggage, mudguards and a good range of gears. They&#8217;ll handle rough tracks as well as tarmac&#8217;ed roads. They seem to have gone up in price since I got mine! &#8211; shop around and you might get one for under \u00a3200.<\/p>\n<p>For something more sporty &#8211; if you&#8217;re planning going fast and getting fit try looking what tend to be called &#8220;Urban&#8221; bikes. These have flat-bars but are mostly upright. Raleigh do something called the &#8220;Venture&#8221; that looks good for slightly over your \u00a3200.<\/p>\n<p>If you really want to go fast, will be carrying light luggage in a rucksack, and will be mostly on tarmac and dressed in cycle gear then you may want a full-on road bike. I&#8217;m assuming this isn&#8217;t the case, but ask me if it is and I&#8217;ll add some more advice.<\/p>\n<p>If you really don&#8217;t mind taking your time and would like to ride in a more gentlemanly manner, then look up &#8220;Classic&#8221; or &#8220;Dutch-style&#8221; bikes. These tend to be sturdy, low-maintenance, all-weather, upright bikes with enclosed hub gears and brakes, dynamo lights, integrated locks, and features like mudguards chain cases and skirt guards to stop your trousers and coat getting dirty. Google &#8220;cycle chic&#8221; and you&#8217;ll see what I mean!<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a sporty, uber-trendy and slightly bonkers hipster type then look into single-speeds or fixies (PLEASE DON&#8217;T GO FIXIE!!!).<\/p>\n<p>Or just look around &#8211; there&#8217;s loads of schizophrenic hybrid &#8220;mashup&#8221; bikes around these days. I quite like the Trek Portland &#8211; sporty drop bars and high-tech road gearing, with mountain bike brakes and a gentlemanly leather-effect look. Not quite sure what it is, but I like it! (Bit expensive though).<\/p>\n<p>If you really can&#8217;t get something for your money then look at second hand &#8211; eBay even! When looking, check important stuff like brakes, chain, the &#8220;headset&#8221; (joins the handlebars to the forks), and check the pedals\/cranks don&#8217;t have any lateral (side-to-side) movement. Oh, and check for buckled wheels too &#8211; they make for uncomfortable and unsafe riding.<\/p>\n<p>There may even be a local bike recycling\/renovating project like this: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.recyke-y-bike.org\/?What_we_do%3ARecycle_Bikes\">http:\/\/www.recyke-y-bike.org\/?What_we_do%3ARecycle_Bikes<\/a> &#8211; check your council and see what they know! (Actually, that&#8217;s a good tip anyway &#8211; look up your council &#8211; they should have lots of info! &#8211; You may have a local cycle campaign group, or cycling information site too, like this one for Bristol: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.betterbybike.info\/\">http:\/\/www.betterbybike.info\/<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>It might be worth asking if your employer has a &#8220;cycle to work&#8221; scheme. This allows you and your employer to get a tax break on a bicycle for cycling to and from work. The employer buys the bike (VAT-free!) and rents it to you for 12 months (income-tax free!) after which you can buy it on the cheap. Well, actually, they changed the rules recently which made buying it at the end of 12 months more expensive, but they&#8217;ve found ways around it. Read about it here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclescheme.co.uk\/employee,faqs.htm\">http:\/\/www.cyclescheme.co.uk\/employee,faqs.htm<\/a><\/p>\n<p>If your employer does this, or if you can convince them to, then you get a tax-free bike and a 12-month interest-free loan!<\/p>\n<p>Technologically, I don&#8217;t know if you have a smart phone but there&#8217;s plenty of &#8220;Apps&#8221; that can help you track your trips, fitness, and carbon and financial savings if you&#8217;re into that. There are mapping and route apps too (look up Bike Hub!) that do a similar kind of thing to h<a href=\"ttp:\/\/cyclestreets.net\/\">ttp:\/\/cyclestreets.net\/<\/a> (which is also worth knowing about).<\/p>\n<p>Finally, you know I blog, and I did a series of &#8220;controversial commute tips&#8221; that are honest about the pros and cons of cycle commuting. I have my own personal style (I don&#8217;t like to go slow!) and everyone&#8217;s experience is different, but it might be worth a read: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/make-and-do\/controversial-cycle-commute-tips\/\">https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/make-and-do\/controversial-cycle-commute-tips\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a lot of stuff to get you started. Hope its helpful. Don&#8217;t hesitate to ask questions &#8211; blog readers, please use the comments below to ask or to add to my own thoughts on the matter.<\/p>\n<p>God bless and happy cycling!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>The weather this spring is good and fuel prices are high, so it&#8217;s the ideal time to consider the question &#8220;Could I cycle to work?&#8221; and, if so, what sort of bike should I get?<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>And a friend of mine is currently asking just that. \u00a0He wrote:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m messaging about your main passion in life &#8211; bikes. I&#8217;m going to start cycling into work from next week, I&#8217;ve decided. It&#8217;s a 7 mile ride one way and I&#8217;ve worked out a route which mostly cuts through parks and quiet roads which I&#8217;m happy about. I don&#8217;t have a bike at the moment. This is where I need your advice.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to borrow a bike for a week to see if I can hack it before I spend any money but I&#8217;m basically looking for a road bike which doesn&#8217;t sit me down too low (so a road-mountain hybrid?) and I&#8217;m not willing to spend a lot of money. I mean something that won&#8217;t fall to bits, will do the job and will last for the next 3 or 4 years or so &#8211; all for under \u00a3200ish (or \u00a3150 pref). What do you think? I&#8217;ve looked on the Halfords website and they had 2 suitable ones but it occurred to me that real bike afficianados such as yourself probably have ways and means of getting decent bikes from non-high street chains at better prices.<\/p>\n<p>So any ideas on all of that greatly appreciated if you have the time to reply!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I ended up writing a fairly lengthly reply to his question which I imagine is one that many people will be asking this year. \u00a0I&#8217;ve been given permission to post the message here in case it&#8217;s of use to anyone else. So&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>What Bike?<\/h2>\n<p>Now&#8230;business. I&#8217;m not an expert, but I&#8217;ll happily share my many years of varied experiences and what I do know.<\/p>\n<p>First of all&#8230;well done! Deciding to cycle commute, especially a 7-miler, is a big decision, but SUCH a positive one. I really hope you find yourself enjoying it and finding it fun as well as reaping the health, financial and environmental benefits.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a3200 is a fairly limited budget and you&#8217;ll have to make some trade-offs. I think you&#8217;ve already made the wisest decision which is to NOT by a cheap mountain bike. Off-road tires have greater rolling resistance (drag on the road) and any kind of suspension will sap energy.<\/p>\n<p>You then need to ask questions like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>will you need to carry luggage?<\/li>\n<li>will you be wearing cycle-specific clothing, or aiming to ride in ordinary work-wear?<\/li>\n<li>are you cycling for fitness too, or just pootling slowly to get from A-to-B?<\/li>\n<li>how much work might you be willing to put in to maintenance\/renovation?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Those questions will help you decide what to get.<\/p>\n<p>Next tip &#8211; DON&#8217;T go to Halfords. I&#8217;d really recommend going to a local bike shop, tell them what you want, get some advice, try some bikes out, get fitted properly, ask if they&#8217;ll do a deal (they may throw in lights, helmets, locks, etc), and get to know them &#8211; you WILL go back for maintenance and parts, so get to know them.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to pootle and carry luggage then something like a Raleigh Pioneer is a cheap, sturdy workhorse &#8211; they have racks for luggage, mudguards and a good range of gears. They&#8217;ll handle rough tracks as well as tarmac&#8217;ed roads. They seem to have gone up in price since I got mine! &#8211; shop around and you might get one for under \u00a3200.<\/p>\n<p>For something more sporty &#8211; if you&#8217;re planning going fast and getting fit try looking what tend to be called &#8220;Urban&#8221; bikes. These have flat-bars but are mostly upright. Raleigh do something called the &#8220;Venture&#8221; that looks good for slightly over your \u00a3200.<\/p>\n<p>If you really want to go fast, will be carrying light luggage in a rucksack, and will be mostly on tarmac and dressed in cycle gear then you may want a full-on road bike. I&#8217;m assuming this isn&#8217;t the case, but ask me if it is and I&#8217;ll add some more advice.<\/p>\n<p>If you really don&#8217;t mind taking your time and would like to ride in a more gentlemanly manner, then look up &#8220;Classic&#8221; or &#8220;Dutch-style&#8221; bikes. These tend to be sturdy, low-maintenance, all-weather, upright bikes with enclosed hub gears and brakes, dynamo lights, integrated locks, and features like mudguards chain cases and skirt guards to stop your trousers and coat getting dirty. Google &#8220;cycle chic&#8221; and you&#8217;ll see what I mean!<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a sporty, uber-trendy and slightly bonkers hipster type then look into single-speeds or fixies (PLEASE DON&#8217;T GO FIXIE!!!).<\/p>\n<p>Or just look around &#8211; there&#8217;s loads of schizophrenic hybrid &#8220;mashup&#8221; bikes around these days. I quite like the Trek Portland &#8211; sporty drop bars and high-tech road gearing, with mountain bike brakes and a gentlemanly leather-effect look. Not quite sure what it is, but I like it! (Bit expensive though).<\/p>\n<p>If you really can&#8217;t get something for your money then look at second hand &#8211; eBay even! When looking, check important stuff like brakes, chain, the &#8220;headset&#8221; (joins the handlebars to the forks), and check the pedals\/cranks don&#8217;t have any lateral (side-to-side) movement. Oh, and check for buckled wheels too &#8211; they make for uncomfortable and unsafe riding.<\/p>\n<p>There may even be a local bike recycling\/renovating project like this: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.recyke-y-bike.org\/?What_we_do%3ARecycle_Bikes\">http:\/\/www.recyke-y-bike.org\/?What_we_do%3ARecycle_Bikes<\/a> &#8211; check your council and see what they know! (Actually, that&#8217;s a good tip anyway &#8211; look up your council &#8211; they should have lots of info! &#8211; You may have a local cycle campaign group, or cycling information site too, like this one for Bristol: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.betterbybike.info\/\">http:\/\/www.betterbybike.info\/<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>It might be worth asking if your employer has a &#8220;cycle to work&#8221; scheme. This allows you and your employer to get a tax break on a bicycle for cycling to and from work. The employer buys the bike (VAT-free!) and rents it to you for 12 months (income-tax free!) after which you can buy it on the cheap. Well, actually, they changed the rules recently which made buying it at the end of 12 months more expensive, but they&#8217;ve found ways around it. Read about it here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclescheme.co.uk\/employee,faqs.htm\">http:\/\/www.cyclescheme.co.uk\/employee,faqs.htm<\/a><\/p>\n<p>If your employer does this, or if you can convince them to, then you get a tax-free bike and a 12-month interest-free loan!<\/p>\n<p>Technologically, I don&#8217;t know if you have a smart phone but there&#8217;s plenty of &#8220;Apps&#8221; that can help you track your trips, fitness, and carbon and financial savings if you&#8217;re into that. There are mapping and route apps too (look up Bike Hub!) that do a similar kind of thing to h<a href=\"ttp:\/\/cyclestreets.net\/\">ttp:\/\/cyclestreets.net\/<\/a> (which is also worth knowing about).<\/p>\n<p>Finally, you know I blog, and I did a series of &#8220;controversial commute tips&#8221; that are honest about the pros and cons of cycle commuting. I have my own personal style (I don&#8217;t like to go slow!) and everyone&#8217;s experience is different, but it might be worth a read: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/make-and-do\/controversial-cycle-commute-tips\/\">https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/make-and-do\/controversial-cycle-commute-tips\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a lot of stuff to get you started. Hope its helpful. Don&#8217;t hesitate to ask questions &#8211; blog readers, please use the comments below to ask or to add to my own thoughts on the matter.<\/p>\n<p>God bless and happy cycling!<\/p>\n",

But it&#8217;s not either of those. I&#8217;m too old to be bothered about such things now and this is merely an observation and a musing on how technology is changing things.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday was my birthday. And, relative to other people i know, I had surprisingly few happy birthday messages. And by messages I mostly mean people writing or commenting on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Some people pointed out that I didn&#8217;t allow others to see when my birthday was. There&#8217;s a whole post that, frankly I don&#8217;t have time to write, about Facebook&#8217;s complicated security settings and the fact that I had no idea that this was the case. I still don&#8217;t actually know if I&#8217;ve fixed that.<\/p>\n<p>And someone else even said: &#8216;I&#8217;m going to write this in my calendar seeing as you&#8217;re keeping this information from Facebook&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>I observe that two things have changed.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The means by which people are reminded about birthdays<\/strong>. People now depend on Facebook for this information &#8211; at least, for the subset of their contacts that are on Facebook and have their privacy set up right.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The means by which people wish each other a happy birthday. <\/strong>For many people a card is no longer necessary. \u00a0This has an up side: you can probably wish many more people a happy birthday than you previously did. \u00a0And a down-side: because it&#8217;s easier to do it somehow &#8211; in my head at least &#8211; has less value.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I&#8217;m torn about whether or not this is a good thing. \u00a0It&#8217;s hugely convenient, but does it de-value the interaction we have with each other over occasions? \u00a0And that&#8217;s a geuine question&#8230;does it? \u00a0In my heart I think it does, but I can&#8217;t think of any real reason why. \u00a0Of course, I&#8217;m delighted that lots of people can now very easily be reminded of my birthday and very easily wish me a happy one. \u00a0And I too make use of that convenience to celebrate other peoples&#8217; special days too.<\/p>\n<p>However, I note this fact&#8230;it now seems that it&#8217;s my responsibility to publish the fact that it&#8217;s my birthday. \u00a0This is a new piece of knowledge to me. \u00a0I&#8217;ve always assumed that people put these things in their calendars anyway. \u00a0That assumption has been challenged.<\/p>\n<p>What other assumptions that I have about the world might have changed because of social media? \u00a0What else don&#8217;t I know that I don&#8217;t know?<\/p>\n",

Me?<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Yes, I know how this will sound. It will sound like the sad complainings of a person with no friends. And it will sound like a &#8216;Hey, look at me&#8217; post too. But it&#8217;s not either of those. I&#8217;m too old to be bothered about such things now and this is merely an observation and a musing on how technology is changing things.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday was my birthday. And, relative to other people i know, I had surprisingly few happy birthday messages. And by messages I mostly mean people writing or commenting on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Some people pointed out that I didn&#8217;t allow others to see when my birthday was. There&#8217;s a whole post that, frankly I don&#8217;t have time to write, about Facebook&#8217;s complicated security settings and the fact that I had no idea that this was the case. I still don&#8217;t actually know if I&#8217;ve fixed that.<\/p>\n<p>And someone else even said: &#8216;I&#8217;m going to write this in my calendar seeing as you&#8217;re keeping this information from Facebook&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>I observe that two things have changed.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The means by which people are reminded about birthdays<\/strong>. People now depend on Facebook for this information &#8211; at least, for the subset of their contacts that are on Facebook and have their privacy set up right.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The means by which people wish each other a happy birthday. <\/strong>For many people a card is no longer necessary. \u00a0This has an up side: you can probably wish many more people a happy birthday than you previously did. \u00a0And a down-side: because it&#8217;s easier to do it somehow &#8211; in my head at least &#8211; has less value.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I&#8217;m torn about whether or not this is a good thing. \u00a0It&#8217;s hugely convenient, but does it de-value the interaction we have with each other over occasions? \u00a0And that&#8217;s a geuine question&#8230;does it? \u00a0In my heart I think it does, but I can&#8217;t think of any real reason why. \u00a0Of course, I&#8217;m delighted that lots of people can now very easily be reminded of my birthday and very easily wish me a happy one. \u00a0And I too make use of that convenience to celebrate other peoples&#8217; special days too.<\/p>\n<p>However, I note this fact&#8230;it now seems that it&#8217;s my responsibility to publish the fact that it&#8217;s my birthday. \u00a0This is a new piece of knowledge to me. \u00a0I&#8217;ve always assumed that people put these things in their calendars anyway. \u00a0That assumption has been challenged.<\/p>\n<p>What other assumptions that I have about the world might have changed because of social media? \u00a0What else don&#8217;t I know that I don&#8217;t know?<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m earning less and working from home, so it&#8217;s time to review \u00a0a few things. \u00a0And one change worthy of mention is my broadband supplier.<\/p>\n<p><!--more-->A long, long time ago I had a dial-up connection using NTL. \u00a0Leaving NTL was one of the biggest administration faffs of my life and I actually ended up losing several month&#8217;s line rental to them. \u00a0I was pretty upset and vowed never to use their services again. \u00a0When Virgin Media took NTL over my resentment was passed on to the new owner.<\/p>\n<p>This resentment has not been helped by Virgin&#8217;s frequent and incessant posting of marketing through our letterbox.<\/p>\n<p>When we moved to Swindon our first, rented house had no aerial so our options for TV were Sky or Virgin, and with past experiences in mind, we signed up to Sky. \u00a0Impressed with the service (especially Sky+, which has transformed our TV viewing), we&#8217;ve taken our Sky to the new house we&#8217;ve bought and gradually taken on more Sky services including phone calls and line rental.<\/p>\n<p>But working from home and being a web developer means I&#8217;m using my internet connection a lot more and doing not only lots of uploads, but some fairly hefty downloads too.<\/p>\n<p>And the only way to get quicker broadband round here is to go for Virgin and use the fibre that&#8217;s in our road.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been asking questions and considering the Virgin option and, with a slight reluctance, have now taken the plunge. \u00a0I&#8217;m ditching Sky and going fibre-optic.<\/p>\n<p>I have to say that this is almost purely a decision based on internet speed. \u00a0I&#8217;m expecting service to be roughly equivalent and cost-wise an equivalent Virgin package is about \u00a35 per month more expensive than Sky. \u00a0Well, it&#8217;s not quite equivalent; it includes HD &#8211; we can&#8217;t use HD as we have an old-skool SD, CRT TV, but where Sky do a cheaper SD option, VM don&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>We also benefit greatly from some Quidco.com cashback (\u00a3150&#8217;s worth!) and \u00a3100 credit on our account &#8211; a pretty nice little bonus.<\/p>\n<p>Sky didn&#8217;t put up much of a fight when I cancelled. \u00a0 No one seems to want to haggle these days! \u00a0I was expecting to be offered a cheaper package, but they didn&#8217;t offer me anything!<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s being installed next Tuesday. \u00a0I&#8217;ll let you know how we get on!<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;d brainstormed what was bad about my old job, what I wanted from my work, and what I might do.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1077\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1077\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1077\" title=\"My Perfect Jop\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"Brainstorm of my perfect job circa June 2010\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148-300x224.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148-150x112.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1077\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brainstorm of my perfect job<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The things I wanted from a job were nothing like what I was stuck doing, and as time passed it became clear that I was stressed and unhappy.<\/p>\n<p>I should also say that I have a Christian faith and I believe that God does guide us, his followers, in what we&#8217;re doing. \u00a0Friends had been praying about my position and their feedback was encouraging. I felt like my God was telling me it was OK to want to get out and that there was something better for me.<\/p>\n<p>More specifically than that, people believed that God was saying &#8220;I will provide. \u00a0There will always be enough&#8221;, and that I would be led through a difficult place, towards the unknown, but there would be something good at the end of the journey.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I was praying too.<\/p>\n<p>And I was keen! \u00a0There were some long evenings and weekends getting my first few Oikos projects done. \u00a0There was some slowness and stress as I got to grips with proper front-end development, cross-browser compatibility issues and the quirks of CSS and \u00a0JavaScript. \u00a0There were difficult questions about how much to charge people and when I really needed to work and when I really needed to stop. \u00a0There was LOTS of patience on behalf of my ever-loving wife.<\/p>\n<p>In November a few things came to a head. \u00a0We had some savings in the bank and I handed my 3-month notice in. \u00a0To my surprise, no one really thought I was mad. \u00a0Many thought that, despite the uncertainty, I&#8217;d made a very good and wise decision. \u00a0I wasn&#8217;t so sure. \u00a0But I was going crazy and had to go.<\/p>\n<p>Oikos quietly churned away in the background while I handed over my work and finished off my time at C&amp;W. \u00a0Everyone was really good to me and I had a great send off. \u00a0I don&#8217;t miss my work, but I miss my team and colleagues. \u00a0They are good people.<\/p>\n<p>And so, in February, I was cut loose. \u00a0I was officially full-time self employed. \u00a0Or, I would have been had I had enough work.<\/p>\n<p>Starting out on your own is never going to be easy. \u00a0You&#8217;re not going to be rolling in cash or rushed off your feet. \u00a0Most people said two years was a good length of time to get going. \u00a0We didn&#8217;t have two years!<\/p>\n<p>But. \u00a0Well. \u00a0Whether you believe in coincidence, luck, hard work, or &#8211; as I do &#8211; that God is true to his work: there was always enough! \u00a0Every time the work dried up a little more came in. \u00a0There were big projects and small projects. I&#8217;m indebted to friends and contacts who gave me work, and recommended me to others.<\/p>\n<p>Some avenues opened. \u00a0Others closed. \u00a0Sometimes I was picky and chose not to take on work because it wasn&#8217;t what I wanted to do. \u00a0For a short time at least, I could afford to pick and choose what I did whilst building up my skills.<\/p>\n<p>And you know what?<\/p>\n<p>Oikos is having a boom. I&#8217;ve made a great contact who&#8217;s passing me a load of work that&#8217;s exactly what I want to be doing in exactly the sector I want to be doing it in. \u00a0And I&#8217;ve got a couple of smaller projects on the go in the background too.<\/p>\n<p>And you know what else?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m LOVING it.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m learning new things. I&#8217;m using my skills for social good in the charity and non-profit sector. I&#8217;ve got the flexibilty of working from home and for myself. I can train myself up and take on new technologies. I can &#8220;make stuff&#8221; &#8211; be creative and innovative. I&#8217;m in control of what I do. I can work with others who have a similar vision. \u00a0I can invest in myself and my work.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m happy. I&#8217;m physically and mentally stronger. I&#8217;ve not been ill (seriously!).<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m probably slightly more geeky and bonkers than I used to be. But that&#8217;s ME. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m like. That&#8217;s what I enjoy. \u00a0My work is hard, but it&#8217;s fun. I&#8217;m sometimes tired (no change there) but I&#8217;m almost always full of enthusiasm and energy for what I&#8217;m doing.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been an added complication of a little Wintle coming along in November. But even the timing of that is perfect. Had it happened a few months earlier I maybe wouldn&#8217;t have left the stability of employment.<\/p>\n<p>It was a risk to quit. It was a risk to pick and choose my work. It was always going to be a challenge to make enough money to live on in the charity sector. It was going to be hard work. It was going to stretch me and my abilities and my relationships.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m so glad I did it, and I&#8217;m so thankful to those that have encouraged me in it and made it possible.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>This is a little late. \u00a0But the reason it&#8217;s late is that I&#8217;ve been really busy at work. \u00a0And this is a good thing. \u00a0As I shall explain.<\/p>\n<p>Back on 18th June was the anniversary of me officially creating Oikos &#8211; my freelance web development and technology consultancy business.<\/p>\n<p>With a good voluntary project on the go I&#8217;d manage to win, though some close contacts, a paid website development gig. \u00a0I needed paying, so I set up a bank account, registered self-employed and so became, in my own unique way, an entrepreneur.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>At the time I was also full-time employed. \u00a0I guess I&#8217;d fallen into my job by mistake really. \u00a0It was a convenience and, over the time I was there, I&#8217;d gotten quite good at it. \u00a0But I&#8217;d spent a lot of time thinking about how to get out, what to move on to.<\/p>\n<p>And Oikos was somewhat pre-meditated. I&#8217;d brainstormed what was bad about my old job, what I wanted from my work, and what I might do.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1077\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1077\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1077\" title=\"My Perfect Jop\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"Brainstorm of my perfect job circa June 2010\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148-300x224.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/07\/IMG_0148-150x112.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1077\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brainstorm of my perfect job<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The things I wanted from a job were nothing like what I was stuck doing, and as time passed it became clear that I was stressed and unhappy.<\/p>\n<p>I should also say that I have a Christian faith and I believe that God does guide us, his followers, in what we&#8217;re doing. \u00a0Friends had been praying about my position and their feedback was encouraging. I felt like my God was telling me it was OK to want to get out and that there was something better for me.<\/p>\n<p>More specifically than that, people believed that God was saying &#8220;I will provide. \u00a0There will always be enough&#8221;, and that I would be led through a difficult place, towards the unknown, but there would be something good at the end of the journey.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I was praying too.<\/p>\n<p>And I was keen! \u00a0There were some long evenings and weekends getting my first few Oikos projects done. \u00a0There was some slowness and stress as I got to grips with proper front-end development, cross-browser compatibility issues and the quirks of CSS and \u00a0JavaScript. \u00a0There were difficult questions about how much to charge people and when I really needed to work and when I really needed to stop. \u00a0There was LOTS of patience on behalf of my ever-loving wife.<\/p>\n<p>In November a few things came to a head. \u00a0We had some savings in the bank and I handed my 3-month notice in. \u00a0To my surprise, no one really thought I was mad. \u00a0Many thought that, despite the uncertainty, I&#8217;d made a very good and wise decision. \u00a0I wasn&#8217;t so sure. \u00a0But I was going crazy and had to go.<\/p>\n<p>Oikos quietly churned away in the background while I handed over my work and finished off my time at C&amp;W. \u00a0Everyone was really good to me and I had a great send off. \u00a0I don&#8217;t miss my work, but I miss my team and colleagues. \u00a0They are good people.<\/p>\n<p>And so, in February, I was cut loose. \u00a0I was officially full-time self employed. \u00a0Or, I would have been had I had enough work.<\/p>\n<p>Starting out on your own is never going to be easy. \u00a0You&#8217;re not going to be rolling in cash or rushed off your feet. \u00a0Most people said two years was a good length of time to get going. \u00a0We didn&#8217;t have two years!<\/p>\n<p>But. \u00a0Well. \u00a0Whether you believe in coincidence, luck, hard work, or &#8211; as I do &#8211; that God is true to his work: there was always enough! \u00a0Every time the work dried up a little more came in. \u00a0There were big projects and small projects. I&#8217;m indebted to friends and contacts who gave me work, and recommended me to others.<\/p>\n<p>Some avenues opened. \u00a0Others closed. \u00a0Sometimes I was picky and chose not to take on work because it wasn&#8217;t what I wanted to do. \u00a0For a short time at least, I could afford to pick and choose what I did whilst building up my skills.<\/p>\n<p>And you know what?<\/p>\n<p>Oikos is having a boom. I&#8217;ve made a great contact who&#8217;s passing me a load of work that&#8217;s exactly what I want to be doing in exactly the sector I want to be doing it in. \u00a0And I&#8217;ve got a couple of smaller projects on the go in the background too.<\/p>\n<p>And you know what else?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m LOVING it.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m learning new things. I&#8217;m using my skills for social good in the charity and non-profit sector. I&#8217;ve got the flexibilty of working from home and for myself. I can train myself up and take on new technologies. I can &#8220;make stuff&#8221; &#8211; be creative and innovative. I&#8217;m in control of what I do. I can work with others who have a similar vision. \u00a0I can invest in myself and my work.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m happy. I&#8217;m physically and mentally stronger. I&#8217;ve not been ill (seriously!).<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m probably slightly more geeky and bonkers than I used to be. But that&#8217;s ME. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m like. That&#8217;s what I enjoy. \u00a0My work is hard, but it&#8217;s fun. I&#8217;m sometimes tired (no change there) but I&#8217;m almost always full of enthusiasm and energy for what I&#8217;m doing.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been an added complication of a little Wintle coming along in November. But even the timing of that is perfect. Had it happened a few months earlier I maybe wouldn&#8217;t have left the stability of employment.<\/p>\n<p>It was a risk to quit. It was a risk to pick and choose my work. It was always going to be a challenge to make enough money to live on in the charity sector. It was going to be hard work. It was going to stretch me and my abilities and my relationships.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m so glad I did it, and I&#8217;m so thankful to those that have encouraged me in it and made it possible.<\/p>\n",

There\u2019s some quite vociferous pro-helmet-choice people and, while I\u2019m not as passionate about the issue as some are, I do find reason not to like this video and it\u2019s worth presenting some additional information alongside it.<\/p>\n<p>1) This video makes cycling look like a dangerous activity and it will probably put some people off cycling. Which is a bad thing!<br \/>\n2) Cycling is, in fact, statistically, an incredibly safe activity. Anyone arguing for cycle helmets should probably also be arguing for pedestrian and driver helmets.<br \/>\n3) Not only is cycling safe, it\u2019s good for your health, and the health benefits of regular cycling far outweigh the risks of potential accidents.<br \/>\n4) Cracknell\u2019s experience is quite extreme. He was cycling across America. Not everyone is going to undertake such an activity, or cycle on the kind of roads that he was cycling on. Yes, for high-speed sports cycling on major roads, or for off-road cycling, your chances of having an accident are increased and helmet-wearing is probably advised.<br \/>\n5) The helmet science is not proven. Research has shown various things including:<br \/>\n\u2013 cars drive closer to people who wear helmets meaning that helmet-wearing makes you more likely to have an accident<br \/>\n\u2013 helmets can make some injuries, such as rotational injuries, worse<br \/>\n6) Cracknell hasn\u2019t proposed such a thing, but it has been shown that introducing compulsory helmet laws will almost certainly result in a large decrease in numbers of cyclists \u2013 and presumably a corresponding increase in car use.<br \/>\n7) A far better approach to cyclist safety would be to reduce the potential for accidents in the first place. Better driver training, better road design, proper, safe cycle infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>Cracknell IS lucky to be alive, his helmet almost certainly saved his life. But he was also lucky. Cycle helmets are not designed to protect you in the event of a collision with a vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to see more people cycling, and I don\u2019t think this video helps with that. There are better ways to improve cycle safety without frightening people off their bikes. Those methods generally involve making roads safer for everyone, not just cyclists, and I\u2019d rather people invested in those methods.<\/p>\n<p>For the record, I use my bike for both fitness and as a means of transport. If I\u2019m out racing myself or the clock, I\u2019m on-road, and yes, I wear a helmet. If I\u2019m pootling around town running errands I tend to stay on cycle paths and quieter routes and I don\u2019t normally wear my helmet.<\/p>\n<p>If anyone wants to find out more about the helmet issue, can I suggest the relatively un-biased and well-written information at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nohelmetlaw.org.uk\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.nohelmetlaw.org.uk\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>I know that Cracknell\u2019s intentions in producing this video, and peoples&#8217; intentions in sharing it, are good, and any attempt to improve cyclist safety should be supported. I hope you don\u2019t mind me contributing a slightly different take on the helmet issue.<\/p>\n<p>With or without a helmet\u2026happy cycling!\u00a0<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/www.irishmark.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nu4QzAIayTU\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nu4QzAIayTU<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

There\u2019s some quite vociferous pro-helmet-choice people and, while I\u2019m not as passionate about the issue as some are, I do find reason not to like this video and it\u2019s worth presenting some additional information alongside it.<\/p>\n<p>1) This video makes cycling look like a dangerous activity and it will probably put some people off cycling. Which is a bad thing!<br \/>\n2) Cycling is, in fact, statistically, an incredibly safe activity. Anyone arguing for cycle helmets should probably also be arguing for pedestrian and driver helmets.<br \/>\n3) Not only is cycling safe, it\u2019s good for your health, and the health benefits of regular cycling far outweigh the risks of potential accidents.<br \/>\n4) Cracknell\u2019s experience is quite extreme. He was cycling across America. Not everyone is going to undertake such an activity, or cycle on the kind of roads that he was cycling on. Yes, for high-speed sports cycling on major roads, or for off-road cycling, your chances of having an accident are increased and helmet-wearing is probably advised.<br \/>\n5) The helmet science is not proven. Research has shown various things including:<br \/>\n\u2013 cars drive closer to people who wear helmets meaning that helmet-wearing makes you more likely to have an accident<br \/>\n\u2013 helmets can make some injuries, such as rotational injuries, worse<br \/>\n6) Cracknell hasn\u2019t proposed such a thing, but it has been shown that introducing compulsory helmet laws will almost certainly result in a large decrease in numbers of cyclists \u2013 and presumably a corresponding increase in car use.<br \/>\n7) A far better approach to cyclist safety would be to reduce the potential for accidents in the first place. Better driver training, better road design, proper, safe cycle infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>Cracknell IS lucky to be alive, his helmet almost certainly saved his life. But he was also lucky. Cycle helmets are not designed to protect you in the event of a collision with a vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to see more people cycling, and I don\u2019t think this video helps with that. There are better ways to improve cycle safety without frightening people off their bikes. Those methods generally involve making roads safer for everyone, not just cyclists, and I\u2019d rather people invested in those methods.<\/p>\n<p>For the record, I use my bike for both fitness and as a means of transport. If I\u2019m out racing myself or the clock, I\u2019m on-road, and yes, I wear a helmet. If I\u2019m pootling around town running errands I tend to stay on cycle paths and quieter routes and I don\u2019t normally wear my helmet.<\/p>\n<p>If anyone wants to find out more about the helmet issue, can I suggest the relatively un-biased and well-written information at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nohelmetlaw.org.uk\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.nohelmetlaw.org.uk\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>I know that Cracknell\u2019s intentions in producing this video, and peoples&#8217; intentions in sharing it, are good, and any attempt to improve cyclist safety should be supported. I hope you don\u2019t mind me contributing a slightly different take on the helmet issue.<\/p>\n<p>With or without a helmet\u2026happy cycling!\u00a0<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/www.irishmark.net\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nu4QzAIayTU\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nu4QzAIayTU<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

There&#8217;s no excuse for illegally cycling on the pavement and scaring pedestrians. BUT&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>We might want to ask WHY cyclists feel a need to do this. Is it because Cricklade Road is narrow and congested, but also a key link in the cycle routes from Stratton into town? Punishing cyclists is all well and good but what&#8217;s being done to make cycling on the roads safer? Are there plans to put an alternative cycle route in? Or to make a decent amount of space on Cricklade Road for cyclists?<\/p>\n<p>We may also want to consider road safety again. The article says there have been no accidents involving bikes. The other day I read this:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In Swindon between summer 2008 and summer 2011, 2,322 cars were in accidents resulting in 10 fatalities and 186 serious injuries.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We might like to consider if it&#8217;s a good use of police time cracking down on the non-existent threat of cyclists and spending some time pulling over some of the shockingly bad motorists who pose a real threat to everyone. People who use mobiles while driving; people who speed; perhaps the guy who overtook me on Croft Road because I&#8217;d slowed down to give a cyclist room.<\/p>\n<p>Finally get get the police to stop putting the burden of road safety on to vulnerable users. It&#8217;s all well and good telling cyclists to wear helmets and hi-viz (which MIGHT protect you somewhat in a collision with a vehicle), but who&#8217;s telling motorists to look out for cyclists, to give cyclists room, to drive carefully in residential areas.<\/p>\n<p>Like so many articles about cycling, this one is ALL backwards, it both blames cyclists for being a threat and tells them that they&#8217;re vulnerable and need to protect themselves using every measure available.<\/p>\n<p>Cycling is a safe, healthy, efficient and clean mode of transport. If you really want safer streets go tackle the real issue of motoring, and make cycling as easy as possible.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;m being kept awake and was catching up on Facebook when I read this ridiculous article:<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk\/news\/9201293.___Cycle_on_the_roads_or_else\/<\/p>\n<p>The Facebook post asked for comments. I wrote this in response:<\/p>\n<p>SO many things wrong with the comments from the police.<\/p>\n<p>First of all I&#8217;m totally with Andy, cyclists should obey the law. There&#8217;s no excuse for illegally cycling on the pavement and scaring pedestrians. BUT&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>We might want to ask WHY cyclists feel a need to do this. Is it because Cricklade Road is narrow and congested, but also a key link in the cycle routes from Stratton into town? Punishing cyclists is all well and good but what&#8217;s being done to make cycling on the roads safer? Are there plans to put an alternative cycle route in? Or to make a decent amount of space on Cricklade Road for cyclists?<\/p>\n<p>We may also want to consider road safety again. The article says there have been no accidents involving bikes. The other day I read this:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In Swindon between summer 2008 and summer 2011, 2,322 cars were in accidents resulting in 10 fatalities and 186 serious injuries.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We might like to consider if it&#8217;s a good use of police time cracking down on the non-existent threat of cyclists and spending some time pulling over some of the shockingly bad motorists who pose a real threat to everyone. People who use mobiles while driving; people who speed; perhaps the guy who overtook me on Croft Road because I&#8217;d slowed down to give a cyclist room.<\/p>\n<p>Finally get get the police to stop putting the burden of road safety on to vulnerable users. It&#8217;s all well and good telling cyclists to wear helmets and hi-viz (which MIGHT protect you somewhat in a collision with a vehicle), but who&#8217;s telling motorists to look out for cyclists, to give cyclists room, to drive carefully in residential areas.<\/p>\n<p>Like so many articles about cycling, this one is ALL backwards, it both blames cyclists for being a threat and tells them that they&#8217;re vulnerable and need to protect themselves using every measure available.<\/p>\n<p>Cycling is a safe, healthy, efficient and clean mode of transport. If you really want safer streets go tackle the real issue of motoring, and make cycling as easy as possible.<\/p>\n",

Says the poem:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Within an hour the gallant band<\/p>\n<p>were charging in on every hand<\/p>\n<p>from Putney, Hackney Downs and Bow<\/p>\n<p>with courage high and hearts a-glow.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Anyway, as I pedalled I put the two ideas together and started recomposing &#8220;Matilda&#8221; in light of 9\/11. \u00a0I got this far&#8230;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Our George he had such thirst for oil<\/p>\n<p>It made his country proud and spoiled<\/p>\n<p>His dad, whose term some years ago<\/p>\n<p>Had kept the price-per-barrel low<\/p>\n<p>Apparently supported him<\/p>\n<p>Their efforts, they changed everything<\/p>\n<p>For once, towards the noon of day<\/p>\n<p>Some terrorists grew tired of play<\/p>\n<p>And finding they were not alone<\/p>\n<p>Went planning terror quite unknown<\/p>\n<p>They hijacked two innocent planes<\/p>\n<p>And took the towers down in flames<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s not quite the tribute to the firemen that I think I set out to produce, but it kinda works.<\/p>\n<p>I think it should end:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>And later, when his troops returned<\/p>\n<p>Our George found all his oil was burned.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Anyone fancy filling in the middle?<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>I had a little jolly to London on Monday and, for once, I found myself with enough time to try out a Boris Bike. \u00a0I&#8217;m sure a thousand and one people have written about Boris Bike experiences, but I think I have some useful insight after my first go on London&#8217;s newest mode of public transport, so I&#8217;m going to share anyway.<\/p>\n<h2><!--more-->First &#8211; Find your Bikes<\/h2>\n<p>I travelled to London by train, arriving at Paddington with plenty of time to cycle to my destination in East London. I&#8217;d used the excellent <a title=\"Cycle Streets Journey Planner\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclestreets.net\/journey\/\">Cycle Streets Journey Planner<\/a> to work out how long it should take.<\/p>\n<p>But Paddington, it turns out, doesn&#8217;t have bike docking stations. \u00a0At least not in\/on the edge of the station.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately I had a few other relevant apps on my iPhone and I not only found out that the docking stations were a short walk away, but also that they had no free bikes.<\/p>\n<p>Time, by this point, was ticking on, so I bailed out of cycling and hopped on the tube.<\/p>\n<p>With time to spare at the other end, I noted that the docking station at Old Street was right outside the station! Though, I note, it wasn&#8217;t signed from inside the station.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 1<\/strong>: Find out where the docking stations are, if you don&#8217;t know already, before you travel.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 2<\/strong>: If you can, use apps to check availability before walking to the dock &#8211; it could save you time.<\/p>\n<h2>Signing Up<\/h2>\n<p>I left enough time on the way home too. MORE time, in fact, than on the way out. So I had another go for the return trip.<\/p>\n<p>Signing up was easy. It cost \u00a31 for a 24 hour pass. \u00a0The only stupid thing was the 34 pages of terms and conditions I was expected to read before taking my first bike.<\/p>\n<h2>Getting a Bike: What they don&#8217;t (seem to) tell you<\/h2>\n<p>Having got my day pass, I checked out my first bike. Or, at least, I tried to. \u00a0The machine printed me a code which I had to type into the little keypad on an individual bicycle&#8217;s docking station. I did this, the light went green and I pulled the bike.<\/p>\n<p>And I pulled the bike.<\/p>\n<p>And I couldn&#8217;t get the bike out.<\/p>\n<p>Guessing that I had limited &#8220;green light&#8221; time, I looked for stickers on the bike and docking station telling me what to do. \u00a0Nothing.<\/p>\n<p>The light went red again.<\/p>\n<p>I tried the code again, to no avail. And then went back to the terminal to get another code. \u00a0But it wouldn&#8217;t give me one.<\/p>\n<p>A quick call to the helpdesk got a nice man talking me through the process. \u00a0The existing code had to time out (10 minutes) and then I could get another code. \u00a0Put this in get the green light and then &#8220;lift the saddle and pull the bike&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 3<\/strong>: LIFT THE SADDLE and pull the bike to get it out.<\/p>\n<h2>The Bike<\/h2>\n<p>The bikes are good. I was a bit wobbly at first &#8211; it was definitely not the fast, upright, road racer that I&#8217;m used to. \u00a0But the ride was smooth, it was well geared (3 gears, but that was enough), and comfortable &#8211; even with a laptop in a bag over my shoulder.<\/p>\n<p>My only real issue was, bizarrely, the lack of a top-tube! Turns out that when I stop I&#8217;m used to resting the bike, by its top tube, on my leg. \u00a0Oh, and the weird limiter on the steering which keeps the turning circle big. When you need to turn around and go back the way you came the limited steering, combined with the weight of the bike, made this quite difficult.<\/p>\n<h2>Finding your Way<\/h2>\n<p>I set off through central London. And I have to say, I LOVED it. Pootling along, taking in the scenery, I felt incredibly free and, astonishingly, pretty safe, despite my lack of helmet and hi-viz. Central London&#8217;s streets are small and crowded and most of the time everyone seemed to be going pretty slowly and paying a lot of attention. I was given plenty of room and didn&#8217;t seem to annoy, or be annoyed by, any drivers.<\/p>\n<p>Navigation, however, was another matter. \u00a0I had a vague idea of where I was going with the wonderful (essential!) <a title=\"Bike Hub iPhone App\" href=\"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/gb\/app\/bike-hub-cycle-journey-planner\/id391782662\">Bike Hub app<\/a>\u00a0for more specific details as and when I need them.<\/p>\n<p>As I set out I was a little disappointed at the lack of signs to places that I knew were kind-of on the way but that was just the start of my problems.<\/p>\n<p>I think, at one point, I ended up in a bus-only bus lane. The buses were remarkably gracious but that was a little hairy for a while. (Must learn to read signs)<\/p>\n<p>What I didn&#8217;t count on was the West-End&#8217;s one-way system. \u00a0Ended up at the junction of Great Russell Street and Bedford Square (<a title=\"Google Maps\" href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=london&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.517549,-0.127158&amp;spn=0.003625,0.010568&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=39.371738,86.572266&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;t=m&amp;z=17\">see map<\/a>) looking at a one way system that seemed to flow south and east, when I wanted to go north and west. ARGH!<\/p>\n<p>I eventually found my way across Tottenham Court Road and somehow ended up on <a title=\"Google Maps: Rathbone Street\" href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=london&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.517549,-0.127158&amp;spn=0.003625,0.010568&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=39.371738,86.572266&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;t=m&amp;z=17\">Rathbone Street<\/a>, which is essentially a big roundabout with the only exit going south to Oxford Street. And I really didn&#8217;t want to go to Oxford Street.<\/p>\n<p>Finally I escaped the maze and found some London Cycle Network signs to Paddington, and was guided by these angelic blue plaques to my destination.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 4<\/strong>: Don&#8217;t assume you can cycle in all bus lanes &#8211; learn and look out for cycle-specific road signs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 5<\/strong>: Plan a route properly and follow it properly. Don&#8217;t rely on a general sense of direction. Don&#8217;t rely on signs. \u00a0And have a map or an app handy to get you out of trouble.<\/p>\n<h2>Coming in to Land<\/h2>\n<p>As I said Paddington&#8217;s docking stations are in the railway station itself, they&#8217;re tucked away on little side streets. It took me a while, and a few looks at my app, to work out where it was.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately there was a space free so I could park the bike, but by this time peak times had kicked in and my train ticket was no longer valid.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 6<\/strong>: Even if you think you&#8217;ve left enough time, leave a little more. Especially if your local knowledge isn&#8217;t so hot.<\/p>\n<h2>The Dangers of the Open Road<\/h2>\n<p>So I had two hours to kill and was enjoying my ride. \u00a0I checked out another bike and headed further west.<\/p>\n<p>Where the narrow, busy streets of central London changed to wider, more open roads where cars want to go quicker and bikes are a minor nuisance. \u00a0Holland Park Road felt a little scary and even the buses were aggressive.<\/p>\n<p>I have heard <a title=\"BBC News: London Cycle Hire Scheme Expands West\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-london-14322923\">rumours of a plan to extend the Boris Bikes to West London<\/a>, but wonder whether I&#8217;d want to cycle around further from the city centre. Shepherd&#8217;s Bush Green anyone?<\/p>\n<h2>Finishing Up<\/h2>\n<p>I (eventually) found the docking station that I knew existed just off Holland Road. My return trip to Paddington was to be on the tube again. \u00a0It had been fun and interesting. I had enjoyed myself and learned a few things too.<\/p>\n<p>Will I do it again? If I&#8217;m not in a hurry then yes, definitely! I think it would be an excellent way to explore London as a tourist. I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d use the bikes to get to a meeting on time.<\/p>\n<p>Boris &#8211; I love your bikes! But cycling in London is still not particularly easy. \u00a0I&#8217;d like more signs and more designated cycle routes. Hiring a bike was pretty straight forward, the bike was good, and I didn&#8217;t feel too unsafe. It was just really hard getting finding my way from A-to-B.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, are these just my experiences? No. I remember that our good friend Sally, aka TownMouse, going to London to try out the cycle hire. <a title=\"Town Mouse: The Streets of London\" href=\"http:\/\/cityexile.wordpress.com\/2010\/10\/26\/the-streets-of-london\/\">Her write up<\/a> contains some amusingly similar anecdotes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>having to talk to the nice man on the help desk and then not being able to get the bike out of the rack (\u2018give it some welly\u2019 the helpdesk man advised)&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>discovering that my memory of London\u2019s geography was rather hazier than I\u2019d hoped&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>my search for a free docking station at my destination had meant not only being late for my lunch date but also over-running the free hire period&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>set off in a wobbly but stately fashion \u2013 it\u2019s actually the only way to ride one&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>most of the traffic (and some of the other bikes) give you a VERY wide berth when they see what you\u2019re riding&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>My legs are aching this morning&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m glad I persisted with my Boris bike and I\u2019d recommend anyone visiting London \u2013 or even living there \u2013 to give it a go.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And while I disagree with just one sentence:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>there have been enough little changes like helpful signs and cut-throughs and counter-flow lanes to mean that a yokel like me could sail along with the straw blowing out of her hair navigating by luck as much as judgement and make it back alive<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I share her top tip!:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Just remember, to get them out of the rack you really do need to give it some welly.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Have you been on the Boris Bikes?

        "content": "<p>I had a little jolly to London on Monday and, for once, I found myself with enough time to try out a Boris Bike. \u00a0I&#8217;m sure a thousand and one people have written about Boris Bike experiences, but I think I have some useful insight after my first go on London&#8217;s newest mode of public transport, so I&#8217;m going to share anyway.<\/p>\n<h2><!--more-->First &#8211; Find your Bikes<\/h2>\n<p>I travelled to London by train, arriving at Paddington with plenty of time to cycle to my destination in East London. I&#8217;d used the excellent <a title=\"Cycle Streets Journey Planner\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclestreets.net\/journey\/\">Cycle Streets Journey Planner<\/a> to work out how long it should take.<\/p>\n<p>But Paddington, it turns out, doesn&#8217;t have bike docking stations. \u00a0At least not in\/on the edge of the station.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately I had a few other relevant apps on my iPhone and I not only found out that the docking stations were a short walk away, but also that they had no free bikes.<\/p>\n<p>Time, by this point, was ticking on, so I bailed out of cycling and hopped on the tube.<\/p>\n<p>With time to spare at the other end, I noted that the docking station at Old Street was right outside the station! Though, I note, it wasn&#8217;t signed from inside the station.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 1<\/strong>: Find out where the docking stations are, if you don&#8217;t know already, before you travel.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 2<\/strong>: If you can, use apps to check availability before walking to the dock &#8211; it could save you time.<\/p>\n<h2>Signing Up<\/h2>\n<p>I left enough time on the way home too. MORE time, in fact, than on the way out. So I had another go for the return trip.<\/p>\n<p>Signing up was easy. It cost \u00a31 for a 24 hour pass. \u00a0The only stupid thing was the 34 pages of terms and conditions I was expected to read before taking my first bike.<\/p>\n<h2>Getting a Bike: What they don&#8217;t (seem to) tell you<\/h2>\n<p>Having got my day pass, I checked out my first bike. Or, at least, I tried to. \u00a0The machine printed me a code which I had to type into the little keypad on an individual bicycle&#8217;s docking station. I did this, the light went green and I pulled the bike.<\/p>\n<p>And I pulled the bike.<\/p>\n<p>And I couldn&#8217;t get the bike out.<\/p>\n<p>Guessing that I had limited &#8220;green light&#8221; time, I looked for stickers on the bike and docking station telling me what to do. \u00a0Nothing.<\/p>\n<p>The light went red again.<\/p>\n<p>I tried the code again, to no avail. And then went back to the terminal to get another code. \u00a0But it wouldn&#8217;t give me one.<\/p>\n<p>A quick call to the helpdesk got a nice man talking me through the process. \u00a0The existing code had to time out (10 minutes) and then I could get another code. \u00a0Put this in get the green light and then &#8220;lift the saddle and pull the bike&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 3<\/strong>: LIFT THE SADDLE and pull the bike to get it out.<\/p>\n<h2>The Bike<\/h2>\n<p>The bikes are good. I was a bit wobbly at first &#8211; it was definitely not the fast, upright, road racer that I&#8217;m used to. \u00a0But the ride was smooth, it was well geared (3 gears, but that was enough), and comfortable &#8211; even with a laptop in a bag over my shoulder.<\/p>\n<p>My only real issue was, bizarrely, the lack of a top-tube! Turns out that when I stop I&#8217;m used to resting the bike, by its top tube, on my leg. \u00a0Oh, and the weird limiter on the steering which keeps the turning circle big. When you need to turn around and go back the way you came the limited steering, combined with the weight of the bike, made this quite difficult.<\/p>\n<h2>Finding your Way<\/h2>\n<p>I set off through central London. And I have to say, I LOVED it. Pootling along, taking in the scenery, I felt incredibly free and, astonishingly, pretty safe, despite my lack of helmet and hi-viz. Central London&#8217;s streets are small and crowded and most of the time everyone seemed to be going pretty slowly and paying a lot of attention. I was given plenty of room and didn&#8217;t seem to annoy, or be annoyed by, any drivers.<\/p>\n<p>Navigation, however, was another matter. \u00a0I had a vague idea of where I was going with the wonderful (essential!) <a title=\"Bike Hub iPhone App\" href=\"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/gb\/app\/bike-hub-cycle-journey-planner\/id391782662\">Bike Hub app<\/a>\u00a0for more specific details as and when I need them.<\/p>\n<p>As I set out I was a little disappointed at the lack of signs to places that I knew were kind-of on the way but that was just the start of my problems.<\/p>\n<p>I think, at one point, I ended up in a bus-only bus lane. The buses were remarkably gracious but that was a little hairy for a while. (Must learn to read signs)<\/p>\n<p>What I didn&#8217;t count on was the West-End&#8217;s one-way system. \u00a0Ended up at the junction of Great Russell Street and Bedford Square (<a title=\"Google Maps\" href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=london&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.517549,-0.127158&amp;spn=0.003625,0.010568&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=39.371738,86.572266&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;t=m&amp;z=17\">see map<\/a>) looking at a one way system that seemed to flow south and east, when I wanted to go north and west. ARGH!<\/p>\n<p>I eventually found my way across Tottenham Court Road and somehow ended up on <a title=\"Google Maps: Rathbone Street\" href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=london&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.517549,-0.127158&amp;spn=0.003625,0.010568&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=39.371738,86.572266&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;t=m&amp;z=17\">Rathbone Street<\/a>, which is essentially a big roundabout with the only exit going south to Oxford Street. And I really didn&#8217;t want to go to Oxford Street.<\/p>\n<p>Finally I escaped the maze and found some London Cycle Network signs to Paddington, and was guided by these angelic blue plaques to my destination.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 4<\/strong>: Don&#8217;t assume you can cycle in all bus lanes &#8211; learn and look out for cycle-specific road signs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 5<\/strong>: Plan a route properly and follow it properly. Don&#8217;t rely on a general sense of direction. Don&#8217;t rely on signs. \u00a0And have a map or an app handy to get you out of trouble.<\/p>\n<h2>Coming in to Land<\/h2>\n<p>As I said Paddington&#8217;s docking stations are in the railway station itself, they&#8217;re tucked away on little side streets. It took me a while, and a few looks at my app, to work out where it was.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately there was a space free so I could park the bike, but by this time peak times had kicked in and my train ticket was no longer valid.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 6<\/strong>: Even if you think you&#8217;ve left enough time, leave a little more. Especially if your local knowledge isn&#8217;t so hot.<\/p>\n<h2>The Dangers of the Open Road<\/h2>\n<p>So I had two hours to kill and was enjoying my ride. \u00a0I checked out another bike and headed further west.<\/p>\n<p>Where the narrow, busy streets of central London changed to wider, more open roads where cars want to go quicker and bikes are a minor nuisance. \u00a0Holland Park Road felt a little scary and even the buses were aggressive.<\/p>\n<p>I have heard <a title=\"BBC News: London Cycle Hire Scheme Expands West\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-london-14322923\">rumours of a plan to extend the Boris Bikes to West London<\/a>, but wonder whether I&#8217;d want to cycle around further from the city centre. Shepherd&#8217;s Bush Green anyone?<\/p>\n<h2>Finishing Up<\/h2>\n<p>I (eventually) found the docking station that I knew existed just off Holland Road. My return trip to Paddington was to be on the tube again. \u00a0It had been fun and interesting. I had enjoyed myself and learned a few things too.<\/p>\n<p>Will I do it again? If I&#8217;m not in a hurry then yes, definitely! I think it would be an excellent way to explore London as a tourist. I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d use the bikes to get to a meeting on time.<\/p>\n<p>Boris &#8211; I love your bikes! But cycling in London is still not particularly easy. \u00a0I&#8217;d like more signs and more designated cycle routes. Hiring a bike was pretty straight forward, the bike was good, and I didn&#8217;t feel too unsafe. It was just really hard getting finding my way from A-to-B.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, are these just my experiences? No. I remember that our good friend Sally, aka TownMouse, going to London to try out the cycle hire. <a title=\"Town Mouse: The Streets of London\" href=\"http:\/\/cityexile.wordpress.com\/2010\/10\/26\/the-streets-of-london\/\">Her write up<\/a> contains some amusingly similar anecdotes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>having to talk to the nice man on the help desk and then not being able to get the bike out of the rack (\u2018give it some welly\u2019 the helpdesk man advised)&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>discovering that my memory of London\u2019s geography was rather hazier than I\u2019d hoped&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>my search for a free docking station at my destination had meant not only being late for my lunch date but also over-running the free hire period&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>set off in a wobbly but stately fashion \u2013 it\u2019s actually the only way to ride one&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>most of the traffic (and some of the other bikes) give you a VERY wide berth when they see what you\u2019re riding&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>My legs are aching this morning&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m glad I persisted with my Boris bike and I\u2019d recommend anyone visiting London \u2013 or even living there \u2013 to give it a go.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And while I disagree with just one sentence:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>there have been enough little changes like helpful signs and cut-throughs and counter-flow lanes to mean that a yokel like me could sail along with the straw blowing out of her hair navigating by luck as much as judgement and make it back alive<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I share her top tip!:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Just remember, to get them out of the rack you really do need to give it some welly.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Have you been on the Boris Bikes?
