I&#8217;m not even convinced that this is a well known, sing-along pop song.  But the chorus is pretty rousing, so worth a go.  I&#8217;ve downloaded from iTunes and the music and words are in one of my books.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of this weel I&#8217;ll have covered three classes of song:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Difficult music and difficult words (Fairytale of New York);<\/li>\n<li>Difficult music and easy words (Angels&#8230;well, the chords were easy but I had to do more work to learn them than the words, which were already firmly in my head);<\/li>\n<li>and Easy music and difficult words (Nothing Ever Happens)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Yes, this week is like memorising poetry.  Sally doesn&#8217;t make life easy!  Chords are C, F, Am, G, with a few others in the musical bridge.<\/p>\n<p>Sally has pledged to learn to play along on the mandolin, which will make it more fun.  Perhaps I should make her learn the words too?<\/p>\n",

Sally doesn&#8217;t make life easy!  Chords are C, F, Am, G, with a few others in the musical bridge.<\/p>\n<p>Sally has pledged to learn to play along on the mandolin, which will make it more fun.

                "rendered": "<p>Last year was a very difficult year for me, health-wise.  Read elsewhere if you don&#8217;t know why.<\/p>\n<p>I know that sometimes I&#8217;ve overreacted, I know that there are plenty of people with much worse things wrong with them.   But I&#8217;ve had more than my fair share of annoying, niggling, painful, exhausting, frustrating things that have kept me from feeling like myself and doing the things I love doing and feel called to do.<\/p>\n<p>As a Christian, one of the big things I have to deal with is the issue of suffering.  If I&#8217;m doing my best to please God and follow Jesus, why do I get persistent failures of health?  Why does God let this happen.  Why doesn&#8217;t God do something about it?<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no simple way to explain why suffering happens.  We just live in a world where things do go wrong &#8211; mostly it&#8217;s our own fault!  But I believe that God tries to use those difficult times and brings good out of them.<\/p>\n<p>Most of what I&#8217;ve been through is, as someone recently stated, &#8220;just stuff&#8221;.  Some of it&#8217;s caused by my own behaviour (e.g. bad posture, or cycling too hard and fast).  Some of it is just being ill &#8211; we get bugs, we fight them off, it happens!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned a lot through the last year.  God really has used it for good.  I&#8217;ve learned how I cope with illness.  How I don&#8217;t like to stop but I NEED to sometimes, and that&#8217;s OK, people don&#8217;t mind (in fact, they positively encourage it!).  I&#8217;ve learned to recognise and deal with stress.  I&#8217;ve learned about some physiology and a lot of psychology too!  It&#8217;s not been wasted suffering.<\/p>\n<p>But I am very frustrated with it and so I&#8217;m taking action.  I&#8217;m going to ask God if he WILL intervene and help me get better.  I think I&#8217;ve had enough and I want to be myself again, and I&#8217;m going to get some good people around me really, persistently, praying for good health for me.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, people have been praying all through the year, and I&#8217;ve had various &#8220;breakthroughs&#8221; as people have done so.  I believe that God does sometime heal miraculously.  I know that most of the time he doesn&#8217;t.  But I&#8217;m going to go and ask him and see what he thinks or says about it.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m not going to stop when I&#8217;m better, I&#8217;m going to get these people to keep praying that I stay well once I am well.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t a sermon on suffering or healing &#8211; I&#8217;m not qualified for that sort of thing.  It&#8217;s a statement about my beliefs and intentions.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get praying properly, let&#8217;s go and nag God a bit, and see what happens!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Last year was a very difficult year for me, health-wise.  Read elsewhere if you don&#8217;t know why.<\/p>\n<p>I know that sometimes I&#8217;ve overreacted, I know that there are plenty of people with much worse things wrong with them.   But I&#8217;ve had more than my fair share of annoying, niggling, painful, exhausting, frustrating things that have kept me from feeling like myself and doing the things I love doing and feel called to do.<\/p>\n<p>As a Christian, one of the big things I have to deal with is the issue of suffering.  If I&#8217;m doing my best to please God and follow Jesus, why do I get persistent failures of health?  Why does God let this happen.  Why doesn&#8217;t God do something about it?<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no simple way to explain why suffering happens.  We just live in a world where things do go wrong &#8211; mostly it&#8217;s our own fault!  But I believe that God tries to use those difficult times and brings good out of them.<\/p>\n<p>Most of what I&#8217;ve been through is, as someone recently stated, &#8220;just stuff&#8221;.  Some of it&#8217;s caused by my own behaviour (e.g. bad posture, or cycling too hard and fast).  Some of it is just being ill &#8211; we get bugs, we fight them off, it happens!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned a lot through the last year.  God really has used it for good.  I&#8217;ve learned how I cope with illness.  How I don&#8217;t like to stop but I NEED to sometimes, and that&#8217;s OK, people don&#8217;t mind (in fact, they positively encourage it!).  I&#8217;ve learned to recognise and deal with stress.  I&#8217;ve learned about some physiology and a lot of psychology too!  It&#8217;s not been wasted suffering.<\/p>\n<p>But I am very frustrated with it and so I&#8217;m taking action.  I&#8217;m going to ask God if he WILL intervene and help me get better.  I think I&#8217;ve had enough and I want to be myself again, and I&#8217;m going to get some good people around me really, persistently, praying for good health for me.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, people have been praying all through the year, and I&#8217;ve had various &#8220;breakthroughs&#8221; as people have done so.  I believe that God does sometime heal miraculously.  I know that most of the time he doesn&#8217;t.  But I&#8217;m going to go and ask him and see what he thinks or says about it.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m not going to stop when I&#8217;m better, I&#8217;m going to get these people to keep praying that I stay well once I am well.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t a sermon on suffering or healing &#8211; I&#8217;m not qualified for that sort of thing.  It&#8217;s a statement about my beliefs and intentions.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get praying properly, let&#8217;s go and nag God a bit, and see what happens!<\/p>\n",

Mostly.  It did in fact end on a high &#8211; but we&#8217;ll have to talk about a few lows before then.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been very excited about the imminent arrival of &#8220;The Felt&#8221; &#8211; my new road bike.<\/p>\n<p>This week, the CycleScheme voucher arrived in the post, and I called the shop and told them to have it ready for me to pick up today.<\/p>\n<p>So I woke up like a kid on Christmas day &#8211; not really able to wait for the short trip to the bike shop to get started.<\/p>\n<p>We ran a few errands in town first.  It was a horrible day, and as I left Sally and headed to the bike shop I began to wonder if I should have taken the car to go and pick it up.  Oh well, I&#8217;d gone so far and I wasn&#8217;t about to bail out.  I&#8217;d have to just get it home in the rain and give it a good wipe-down when I got back.<\/p>\n<p>The bike was waiting and after a brief re-fit I tentatively hopped on, expecting it to handle a bit differently to the cheap, old Raleigh hybrid.  And I was right!!!  Half way home, I fell off.  Turns out that 25mm, semi-slick tyres don&#8217;t like doing 90 degree turns in the pouring rain.<\/p>\n<p>Gutted.<\/p>\n<p>I tore a small hole in my waterproof jacket, put the saddle out of alignment, and I think I put the rear wheel out of true slightly &#8211; it was certainly rubbing on the brake pads.<\/p>\n<p>Words can&#8217;t really express my annoyance.  I arrived home, drenched and with a fully-battered sense of pride.<\/p>\n<p>A few photo&#8217;s of the scrapes the poor thing received.  Here&#8217;s the Tiagra rear mech (derailleur) &#8211; which, on inspection, feels pretty sturdy and tough &#8211; maybe a cheaper bike wouldn&#8217;t have survived as well:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R5nrui1YrFI\/AAAAAAAABkE\/-OL8-_ugI4Q\/s1600-h\/IMG_0270.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R5nrui1YrFI\/AAAAAAAABkE\/-OL8-_ugI4Q\/s400\/IMG_0270.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>And here&#8217;s the right brake hood:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R5nrvS1YrGI\/AAAAAAAABkM\/7Uolw5g_Nv8\/s1600-h\/IMG_0271.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R5nrvS1YrGI\/AAAAAAAABkM\/7Uolw5g_Nv8\/s400\/IMG_0271.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>So, a little gutted, I spent some of the day fixing on the lights and computer and making a few adjustments.  While doing this I took advantage of the quick-releases, and whipped the rear wheel out to check it&#8217;s state of trueness.  To do this you have to deflate the tyre to get the&#8221;bulge&#8221; of the tyre between the released brake pads.<\/p>\n<p>Wheel and tyre didn&#8217;t seem too bad, so I refitted them and re-inflated.  Half way through inflation&#8230;.HHHHHIIIISSSSSSSSSSSSssssssssssssbother.<\/p>\n<p>That, my friends, is the sound of what I can only guess was a pinch puncture, and my (fairly censored for the purposes of this post) response.<\/p>\n<p>Generally, it was a bit of a crappy start and I was feeling very dejected.  I was already beginning to wonder if I&#8217;d done the right thing buying it.  Part of me knows that I just need a couple of good rides on it and I&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s the bee&#8217;s knees, but right now, I&#8217;m pretty worried about how much damage I&#8217;ve done.  The puncture is patched and the rear wheel&#8217;s not rubbing the brake pads any more, but it isn&#8217;t straight and I don&#8217;t know how it will ride.<\/p>\n<p>I also know that I&#8217;ve had a REALLY good lesson in road bike handling.  A lesson that I was bound to learn eventually and which was much better learned doing 5mph in town than doing 25mph on a wet country road.  Maybe it was a blessing in disguise!<\/p>\n<p>In between all that, Sally and I tried wallpapering the chimney breast in our lounge.  This was also a fairly spectacular flop and added to the days downcast-ness.  The paper dried up and curled at the corners and shrank so that the gaps between drops got bigger and it was generally disastrous.<\/p>\n<p>We pushed on though.  We resolved to go and buy another roll and try again.  If we failed second time we&#8217;d give up and just paint the darned thing.<\/p>\n<p>So we tried again &#8211; and it was a success!  Or so it seems.  Second time round we followed the instructions to the letter.  Lessons learned about wallpapering:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Sizing&#8221; seems to be a good idea &#8211; use a diluted paste on the wall before you apply the paper.<\/li>\n<li>Use pre-mixed paste.  It&#8217;s more expensive but much more likely to work.  We bought some of this second time around and it was VERY different to the stuff we mixed ourselves.  If you do mix your own, it should be white and of a jelly-like consistency.  Oh and make sure you&#8217;re stirring the water when you add the paste powder and add it gently &#8211; it quickly forms lumps if it&#8217;s not dissolved and mixed properly.<\/li>\n<li>Put LOTS of paste on the paper.  We used to little first time.  We applied quite liberally second time around with much better results.<\/li>\n<li>We&#8217;re not sure about the best way to trim the edges from the paper once it&#8217;s on the wall yet, but it seems to us that wet paper is much harder to trim.  Soggy paper tears and splits easily!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I finished the day by putting up a new light fitting, which included my first experience of cutting a hole in plaster (not much to say about that &#8211; other than it makes a LOT of dust!).<\/p>\n<p>It had been a long, roller-coaster of a day.  Excitement, an accident, dejection and worry, failure, success and, as we stepped back and admired the new living room, great joy.  We&#8217;ve lived a lot today, we&#8217;ve learned a lot today.  Sometimes those set backs test us, and if we push through them we can by much more proud of the results than if it was easy!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>On the New Bike &#8211; Off the New Bike &#8211; Lessons in Wallpapering<\/p>\n<p>Today was supposed to be really exciting &#8211; it turned out to be quite depressing.  Mostly.  It did in fact end on a high &#8211; but we&#8217;ll have to talk about a few lows before then.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been very excited about the imminent arrival of &#8220;The Felt&#8221; &#8211; my new road bike.<\/p>\n<p>This week, the CycleScheme voucher arrived in the post, and I called the shop and told them to have it ready for me to pick up today.<\/p>\n<p>So I woke up like a kid on Christmas day &#8211; not really able to wait for the short trip to the bike shop to get started.<\/p>\n<p>We ran a few errands in town first.  It was a horrible day, and as I left Sally and headed to the bike shop I began to wonder if I should have taken the car to go and pick it up.  Oh well, I&#8217;d gone so far and I wasn&#8217;t about to bail out.  I&#8217;d have to just get it home in the rain and give it a good wipe-down when I got back.<\/p>\n<p>The bike was waiting and after a brief re-fit I tentatively hopped on, expecting it to handle a bit differently to the cheap, old Raleigh hybrid.  And I was right!!!  Half way home, I fell off.  Turns out that 25mm, semi-slick tyres don&#8217;t like doing 90 degree turns in the pouring rain.<\/p>\n<p>Gutted.<\/p>\n<p>I tore a small hole in my waterproof jacket, put the saddle out of alignment, and I think I put the rear wheel out of true slightly &#8211; it was certainly rubbing on the brake pads.<\/p>\n<p>Words can&#8217;t really express my annoyance.  I arrived home, drenched and with a fully-battered sense of pride.<\/p>\n<p>A few photo&#8217;s of the scrapes the poor thing received.  Here&#8217;s the Tiagra rear mech (derailleur) &#8211; which, on inspection, feels pretty sturdy and tough &#8211; maybe a cheaper bike wouldn&#8217;t have survived as well:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R5nrui1YrFI\/AAAAAAAABkE\/-OL8-_ugI4Q\/s1600-h\/IMG_0270.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R5nrui1YrFI\/AAAAAAAABkE\/-OL8-_ugI4Q\/s400\/IMG_0270.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>And here&#8217;s the right brake hood:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R5nrvS1YrGI\/AAAAAAAABkM\/7Uolw5g_Nv8\/s1600-h\/IMG_0271.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R5nrvS1YrGI\/AAAAAAAABkM\/7Uolw5g_Nv8\/s400\/IMG_0271.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>So, a little gutted, I spent some of the day fixing on the lights and computer and making a few adjustments.  While doing this I took advantage of the quick-releases, and whipped the rear wheel out to check it&#8217;s state of trueness.  To do this you have to deflate the tyre to get the&#8221;bulge&#8221; of the tyre between the released brake pads.<\/p>\n<p>Wheel and tyre didn&#8217;t seem too bad, so I refitted them and re-inflated.  Half way through inflation&#8230;.HHHHHIIIISSSSSSSSSSSSssssssssssssbother.<\/p>\n<p>That, my friends, is the sound of what I can only guess was a pinch puncture, and my (fairly censored for the purposes of this post) response.<\/p>\n<p>Generally, it was a bit of a crappy start and I was feeling very dejected.  I was already beginning to wonder if I&#8217;d done the right thing buying it.  Part of me knows that I just need a couple of good rides on it and I&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s the bee&#8217;s knees, but right now, I&#8217;m pretty worried about how much damage I&#8217;ve done.  The puncture is patched and the rear wheel&#8217;s not rubbing the brake pads any more, but it isn&#8217;t straight and I don&#8217;t know how it will ride.<\/p>\n<p>I also know that I&#8217;ve had a REALLY good lesson in road bike handling.  A lesson that I was bound to learn eventually and which was much better learned doing 5mph in town than doing 25mph on a wet country road.  Maybe it was a blessing in disguise!<\/p>\n<p>In between all that, Sally and I tried wallpapering the chimney breast in our lounge.  This was also a fairly spectacular flop and added to the days downcast-ness.  The paper dried up and curled at the corners and shrank so that the gaps between drops got bigger and it was generally disastrous.<\/p>\n<p>We pushed on though.  We resolved to go and buy another roll and try again.  If we failed second time we&#8217;d give up and just paint the darned thing.<\/p>\n<p>So we tried again &#8211; and it was a success!  Or so it seems.  Second time round we followed the instructions to the letter.  Lessons learned about wallpapering:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Sizing&#8221; seems to be a good idea &#8211; use a diluted paste on the wall before you apply the paper.<\/li>\n<li>Use pre-mixed paste.  It&#8217;s more expensive but much more likely to work.  We bought some of this second time around and it was VERY different to the stuff we mixed ourselves.  If you do mix your own, it should be white and of a jelly-like consistency.  Oh and make sure you&#8217;re stirring the water when you add the paste powder and add it gently &#8211; it quickly forms lumps if it&#8217;s not dissolved and mixed properly.<\/li>\n<li>Put LOTS of paste on the paper.  We used to little first time.  We applied quite liberally second time around with much better results.<\/li>\n<li>We&#8217;re not sure about the best way to trim the edges from the paper once it&#8217;s on the wall yet, but it seems to us that wet paper is much harder to trim.  Soggy paper tears and splits easily!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I finished the day by putting up a new light fitting, which included my first experience of cutting a hole in plaster (not much to say about that &#8211; other than it makes a LOT of dust!).<\/p>\n<p>It had been a long, roller-coaster of a day.  Excitement, an accident, dejection and worry, failure, success and, as we stepped back and admired the new living room, great joy.  We&#8217;ve lived a lot today, we&#8217;ve learned a lot today.  Sometimes those set backs test us, and if we push through them we can by much more proud of the results than if it was easy!<\/p>\n",

What&#8217;s it like?<\/p>\n<p>Well.<\/p>\n<p>IT&#8217;S AWESOME.  It&#8217;s so comfortable that it seems to be helping my bad back get better.  It&#8217;s so light.  It&#8217;s so quick.<\/p>\n<p>Actually, it doesn&#8217;t seem to have a higher top-gear than the Raleigh, but the acceleration is so fast and smooth you arrive at top speed very quickly and can much more easily maintain it.<\/p>\n<p>I have had some more learning to do.  I was a bit tentative after my fall on Saturday, but in the dry it does corner OK.  I&#8217;ve yet to push it hard and fast round a corner though and the bike does very much want to go in a straight line.  I&#8217;m wondering if I turned the handlebars too much on Saturday rather than leaning?<\/p>\n<p>The dropped bars are great for the variety of hand positions, but it&#8217;s sometimes a bit shaky getting between them &#8211; especially the one time I actually went down to the drops.  How are you supposed to do this?  One hand at a time knocks your steering off.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also had problems with riding through town.  Braking, changing down and indicating at the same time is much harder on this bike, especially while I&#8217;m nervously preparing to corner too.  The trick with indicating from the brake hoods definitely seems to be to grip tight with the hand on the bars while you do the one-handed thing.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to my little scratches from the weekend I now also have a bit of surface rust (see picture).  I don&#8217;t THINK this is a big deal and I&#8217;m hoping it will disappear just with wear.  But proof that you should definitely dry the chain off properly after a wet ride.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R5nuoi1YrHI\/AAAAAAAABkU\/XrAMBzuhLIA\/s1600-h\/IMG_0268.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R5nuoi1YrHI\/AAAAAAAABkU\/XrAMBzuhLIA\/s400\/IMG_0268.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>In general then, I&#8217;m very glad I invested in a road bike.

        "content": "<p>So&#8230;now it&#8217;s dry I&#8217;ve been able to have a few days commuting on the Felt (which Sally has suggested be called &#8220;Fuzzy&#8221;&#8230;Fuzzy Felt&#8230;geddit?).  What&#8217;s it like?<\/p>\n<p>Well.<\/p>\n<p>IT&#8217;S AWESOME.  It&#8217;s so comfortable that it seems to be helping my bad back get better.  It&#8217;s so light.  It&#8217;s so quick.<\/p>\n<p>Actually, it doesn&#8217;t seem to have a higher top-gear than the Raleigh, but the acceleration is so fast and smooth you arrive at top speed very quickly and can much more easily maintain it.<\/p>\n<p>I have had some more learning to do.  I was a bit tentative after my fall on Saturday, but in the dry it does corner OK.  I&#8217;ve yet to push it hard and fast round a corner though and the bike does very much want to go in a straight line.  I&#8217;m wondering if I turned the handlebars too much on Saturday rather than leaning?<\/p>\n<p>The dropped bars are great for the variety of hand positions, but it&#8217;s sometimes a bit shaky getting between them &#8211; especially the one time I actually went down to the drops.  How are you supposed to do this?  One hand at a time knocks your steering off.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also had problems with riding through town.  Braking, changing down and indicating at the same time is much harder on this bike, especially while I&#8217;m nervously preparing to corner too.  The trick with indicating from the brake hoods definitely seems to be to grip tight with the hand on the bars while you do the one-handed thing.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to my little scratches from the weekend I now also have a bit of surface rust (see picture).  I don&#8217;t THINK this is a big deal and I&#8217;m hoping it will disappear just with wear.  But proof that you should definitely dry the chain off properly after a wet ride.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R5nuoi1YrHI\/AAAAAAAABkU\/XrAMBzuhLIA\/s1600-h\/IMG_0268.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R5nuoi1YrHI\/AAAAAAAABkU\/XrAMBzuhLIA\/s400\/IMG_0268.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>In general then, I&#8217;m very glad I invested in a road bike.

Watch this space for some back-dated things that I didn&#8217;t have time to write about properly when they popped into my head.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Rats<\/p>\n<p><\/span>So, our house now smells, quite pungently, of dead rat.  At least we think it&#8217;s dead rat.  It stinks a bit, but we&#8217;re kinda used to it now.  They ate all the pest-controller&#8217;s poison and he came back and re-baited the place, and they haven&#8217;t eaten any more since that second visit.  Which suggests that they haven&#8217;t eaten anything.  Which suggests that they&#8217;re dead!  We&#8217;ve not heard them for a while either so it&#8217;s all looking good rat-wise.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also been outside and plugged up the holes where we think they were getting in.  So hopefully that&#8217;ll be the last vermin we have to deal with for a while.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Backs<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I mentioned in passing the other week that I had a bad back again.  This all started a couple of days after my post-Christmas &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/wintle.blogspot.com\/2008\/01\/good-ride-today.html\">good ride<\/a>&#8220;.  It started in my middle back, faded after a couple of days, and then came back with a vengeance in my lower back.  Crazy country dancing at the wedding the other week didn&#8217;t help of course.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen the physio twice and all he seems to be able to do is move the pain around, rather than fix it.   Looks like everything from my  hamstrings to my hip flexors is screwed up and tight.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve tried doing a bit of cycling with it (as you will read about elsewhere) and that, oddly, seems to help.  But it&#8217;s not going away and it&#8217;s causing me more pain and frustration.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span>  I had a really low evening mid-week where it all got to me, but I&#8217;ve picked myself up again and have been feeling a bit more myself in the last couple of days.<\/p>\n<p>The real improvement seems to have come by doing nothing &#8211; no stretching, no cycling, just sitting or lying still for as long as possible each day.  I think all the muscles need to just relax themselves.  I&#8217;m learning AGAIN not to throw myself into things too much and that sometimes I just need to stop.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Not Cycling<\/span><\/p>\n<p>NOT cycling is an odd thing for me to be writing about.  But I am not-cycling at the moment because of my back.  Which means I&#8217;m driving to work.  Which is, itself, depressing and frustrating.<\/p>\n<p>Most people in Swindon can&#8217;t live more than a few miles from where they work, yet they insist on sitting in queues of traffic for hours on end looking miserable and angry.  It really bothers me.  Perhaps they&#8217;ve never considered that cycling or walking is an option?  I&#8217;d much rather be moving on two wheels than sat doing nothing in a big box on 4.  Plus, the globe is warming and petrol prices are going sky-high (104.9 at Sainsbury&#8217;s!).  Why drive?  Once I&#8217;m 100% well again I&#8217;m definitely doing as much not-driving as possible!<\/p>\n<p>I wonder what we can do to get people out of there cars more.  It strikes me that if we can&#8217;t do it in a small town with excellent cycle routes like Swindon then where CAN we do it?<\/p>\n",

Watch this space for some back-dated things that I didn&#8217;t have time to write about properly when they popped into my head.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Rats<\/p>\n<p><\/span>So, our house now smells, quite pungently, of dead rat.  At least we think it&#8217;s dead rat.  It stinks a bit, but we&#8217;re kinda used to it now.  They ate all the pest-controller&#8217;s poison and he came back and re-baited the place, and they haven&#8217;t eaten any more since that second visit.  Which suggests that they haven&#8217;t eaten anything.  Which suggests that they&#8217;re dead!  We&#8217;ve not heard them for a while either so it&#8217;s all looking good rat-wise.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also been outside and plugged up the holes where we think they were getting in.  So hopefully that&#8217;ll be the last vermin we have to deal with for a while.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Backs<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I mentioned in passing the other week that I had a bad back again.  This all started a couple of days after my post-Christmas &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/wintle.blogspot.com\/2008\/01\/good-ride-today.html\">good ride<\/a>&#8220;.  It started in my middle back, faded after a couple of days, and then came back with a vengeance in my lower back.  Crazy country dancing at the wedding the other week didn&#8217;t help of course.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen the physio twice and all he seems to be able to do is move the pain around, rather than fix it.   Looks like everything from my  hamstrings to my hip flexors is screwed up and tight.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve tried doing a bit of cycling with it (as you will read about elsewhere) and that, oddly, seems to help.  But it&#8217;s not going away and it&#8217;s causing me more pain and frustration.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span>  I had a really low evening mid-week where it all got to me, but I&#8217;ve picked myself up again and have been feeling a bit more myself in the last couple of days.<\/p>\n<p>The real improvement seems to have come by doing nothing &#8211; no stretching, no cycling, just sitting or lying still for as long as possible each day.  I think all the muscles need to just relax themselves.  I&#8217;m learning AGAIN not to throw myself into things too much and that sometimes I just need to stop.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Not Cycling<\/span><\/p>\n<p>NOT cycling is an odd thing for me to be writing about.  But I am not-cycling at the moment because of my back.  Which means I&#8217;m driving to work.  Which is, itself, depressing and frustrating.<\/p>\n<p>Most people in Swindon can&#8217;t live more than a few miles from where they work, yet they insist on sitting in queues of traffic for hours on end looking miserable and angry.  It really bothers me.  Perhaps they&#8217;ve never considered that cycling or walking is an option?  I&#8217;d much rather be moving on two wheels than sat doing nothing in a big box on 4.  Plus, the globe is warming and petrol prices are going sky-high (104.9 at Sainsbury&#8217;s!).  Why drive?  Once I&#8217;m 100% well again I&#8217;m definitely doing as much not-driving as possible!<\/p>\n<p>I wonder what we can do to get people out of there cars more.  It strikes me that if we can&#8217;t do it in a small town with excellent cycle routes like Swindon then where CAN we do it?<\/p>\n",

Too cluttered and didn&#8217;t really get what it was all about.  Then, a while back, Facebook became popular.  It was a real big thing in 2007 and I became a fully-addicted member in about <a href=\"http:\/\/wintle.blogspot.com\/2007\/05\/sunday-evening-brain-dump.html\">May time<\/a>.  I was a bit skeptical about it. but I&#8217;ve really enjoyed using it to keep up with what&#8217;s going on with my friends.  It DOES have some Friends-Reunited type functionality, but I&#8217;ve rarely spent much time reconnecting with old friends.  I mostly use it to watch the short status updates of my real-world friends, share photos, and to play Scrabulous (clever online version of Scrabble).<\/p>\n<p>More and more on Facebook, the advertising is creeping in, and the small amount of useful functionality is becoming obscured by alerts that I&#8217;d rather not see, and invitations to use pointless applications.<\/p>\n<p>It seems I&#8217;m not the only one with &#8220;Facebook Fatigue&#8221; either, as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theregister.co.uk\/2008\/01\/31\/myspace_fb_comscore_drop\/\">this article<\/a> from The Register suggests.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/p>\n<p>Blogs!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I also enjoy reading other people&#8217;s blogs in order to keep up with them.  This is also a kind of social networking for me.  And, of course, one of my reasons for writing this stuff is so that other people can keep up with me (not many do, but that&#8217;s OK &#8211; there are other reasons to write).<\/p>\n<p>But my blog entries take a lot of time to write and I&#8217;m often a week or so behind where I actually want to be with posts.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;Micro-Blogging&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><\/span>The status updates in Facebook are really a kind of &#8220;micro-blogging&#8221;.  Small statements about what&#8217;s going on with your life to allow others to keep up with you.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve not looked up a definition of &#8220;micro-blogging&#8221; but the concept seems to be a series of small notes that track those smaller updates and thoughts that occur between longer &#8220;macro blog&#8221; entries that people might be publishing about themselves.<\/p>\n<p>I would, in fact, much prefer it if the people I use Facebook to keep up with would do some form of Blogging or &#8220;micro-blogging&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Twitter<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Twitter is a tool that allows this sort of thing.  It&#8217;s stupidly simple.  You can write a status update of 140 characters from the web, your phone (by SMS or mobile web), or using a Google Chat.  These can be read by your &#8220;followers&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>You can also choose to &#8220;follow&#8221; others, and you can choose to get updates from others from the website, by SMS, or through your Google Chat.<\/p>\n<p>So, I have been doing a bit of Twittering to see if anyone follows.<\/p>\n<p>It feels a bit silly and self-indulgent.  But so did Facebook when it started.  I wonder if others would follow me in defecting if they knew what it was and why I was doing it?  I wonder if others are fed up of the constant hassling of Facebook applications and just want to know what&#8217;s going on with their friends and family?<\/p>\n<p>Maybe Twitter gives information overload if you have too many people that you&#8217;re following?  I&#8217;m not sure.  But my future feels like it&#8217;s more with micro-blogging, using whatever tool, than with Facebook.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

Too cluttered and didn&#8217;t really get what it was all about.  Then, a while back, Facebook became popular.  It was a real big thing in 2007 and I became a fully-addicted member in about <a href=\"http:\/\/wintle.blogspot.com\/2007\/05\/sunday-evening-brain-dump.html\">May time<\/a>.  I was a bit skeptical about it. but I&#8217;ve really enjoyed using it to keep up with what&#8217;s going on with my friends.  It DOES have some Friends-Reunited type functionality, but I&#8217;ve rarely spent much time reconnecting with old friends.  I mostly use it to watch the short status updates of my real-world friends, share photos, and to play Scrabulous (clever online version of Scrabble).<\/p>\n<p>More and more on Facebook, the advertising is creeping in, and the small amount of useful functionality is becoming obscured by alerts that I&#8217;d rather not see, and invitations to use pointless applications.<\/p>\n<p>It seems I&#8217;m not the only one with &#8220;Facebook Fatigue&#8221; either, as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theregister.co.uk\/2008\/01\/31\/myspace_fb_comscore_drop\/\">this article<\/a> from The Register suggests.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/p>\n<p>Blogs!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I also enjoy reading other people&#8217;s blogs in order to keep up with them.  This is also a kind of social networking for me.  And, of course, one of my reasons for writing this stuff is so that other people can keep up with me (not many do, but that&#8217;s OK &#8211; there are other reasons to write).<\/p>\n<p>But my blog entries take a lot of time to write and I&#8217;m often a week or so behind where I actually want to be with posts.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&#8220;Micro-Blogging&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><\/span>The status updates in Facebook are really a kind of &#8220;micro-blogging&#8221;.  Small statements about what&#8217;s going on with your life to allow others to keep up with you.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve not looked up a definition of &#8220;micro-blogging&#8221; but the concept seems to be a series of small notes that track those smaller updates and thoughts that occur between longer &#8220;macro blog&#8221; entries that people might be publishing about themselves.<\/p>\n<p>I would, in fact, much prefer it if the people I use Facebook to keep up with would do some form of Blogging or &#8220;micro-blogging&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Twitter<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Twitter is a tool that allows this sort of thing.  It&#8217;s stupidly simple.  You can write a status update of 140 characters from the web, your phone (by SMS or mobile web), or using a Google Chat.  These can be read by your &#8220;followers&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>You can also choose to &#8220;follow&#8221; others, and you can choose to get updates from others from the website, by SMS, or through your Google Chat.<\/p>\n<p>So, I have been doing a bit of Twittering to see if anyone follows.<\/p>\n<p>It feels a bit silly and self-indulgent.  But so did Facebook when it started.  I wonder if others would follow me in defecting if they knew what it was and why I was doing it?  I wonder if others are fed up of the constant hassling of Facebook applications and just want to know what&#8217;s going on with their friends and family?<\/p>\n<p>Maybe Twitter gives information overload if you have too many people that you&#8217;re following?  I&#8217;m not sure.  But my future feels like it&#8217;s more with micro-blogging, using whatever tool, than with Facebook.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",
