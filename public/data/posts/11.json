                "rendered": "\n<p>We had a camping holiday recently &#8211; our first in four years or so. We were blessed with brilliant weather and a great location and we loved the week we had, but, being a thoughtful person, there were a few thoughts I had about the camping experience that I thought I&#8217;d jot down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why don&#8217;t campsites have water boilers?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Seriously. This should be a thing. Campsites have toilets and showers and washing up points. Electrical heaters of various sorts. Some of which made very hot water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I wondered&#8230;why is it that campsites don&#8217;t have those on-demand water boilers? So much gas must be used up boiling water on camping stoves. And we put so much effort into managing our supply of hot water (filling a super-insulated flask with hot water the night before so you don&#8217;t have to wait for your morning cuppa).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d gladly pay a little extra to stay on a campsite that has a boiler I can just walk up to and get boiling water out of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone do this, please?! And make it standard for campsites everywhere!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Campsite life<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I love about campsites is the huge mix of people you get. I find that camping attracts people from a much greater variety of walks of life than hotels and holiday parks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while everyone gets on pretty nicely, there&#8217;s etiquette and both spoken (or write) and unspoken rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do sometimes think it would be good to do a documentary of life on a campsite. An outdoor version of Big Brother with a diary room where people can come in and air their grievances about that thing the people on the pitch next-door did.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or where people get interviewed about why they have come. We met all sorts of interesting people. A woman camping on her own for the first time who was between jobs. An aunt who was taking her nephew and niece camping for the first time, hoping she can be trusted by the parents to do it again. Stuff like that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems everyone has a story and it would be interesting to have it documented.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just not on MY holiday, thank you! ?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Swapping indoor and outdoor time<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As most parents, we have a constant struggle with &#8220;screen time&#8221; with our children. We feel it&#8217;s pretty under control here. We&#8217;ve created some good rules. But seeing how much our kids love being outdoors when camping I wondered&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if we swapped the rule? If we said that they could have as much indoor and screen time as they wanted, but that their outdoor time was limited to an hour a day. Would that make the outdoor time something that they craved?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably not. But maybe an interesting experiment for some time in the future.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>We had a camping holiday recently &#8211; our first in four years or so. We were blessed with brilliant weather and a great location and we loved the week we had, but, being a thoughtful person, there were a few thoughts I had about the camping experience that I thought I&#8217;d jot down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why don&#8217;t campsites have water boilers?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Seriously. This should be a thing. Campsites have toilets and showers and washing up points. Electrical heaters of various sorts. Some of which made very hot water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I wondered&#8230;why is it that campsites don&#8217;t have those on-demand water boilers? So much gas must be used up boiling water on camping stoves. And we put so much effort into managing our supply of hot water (filling a super-insulated flask with hot water the night before so you don&#8217;t have to wait for your morning cuppa).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d gladly pay a little extra to stay on a campsite that has a boiler I can just walk up to and get boiling water out of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone do this, please?! And make it standard for campsites everywhere!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Campsite life<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I love about campsites is the huge mix of people you get. I find that camping attracts people from a much greater variety of walks of life than hotels and holiday parks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while everyone gets on pretty nicely, there&#8217;s etiquette and both spoken (or write) and unspoken rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do sometimes think it would be good to do a documentary of life on a campsite. An outdoor version of Big Brother with a diary room where people can come in and air their grievances about that thing the people on the pitch next-door did.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or where people get interviewed about why they have come. We met all sorts of interesting people. A woman camping on her own for the first time who was between jobs. An aunt who was taking her nephew and niece camping for the first time, hoping she can be trusted by the parents to do it again. Stuff like that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems everyone has a story and it would be interesting to have it documented.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just not on MY holiday, thank you! ?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Swapping indoor and outdoor time<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As most parents, we have a constant struggle with &#8220;screen time&#8221; with our children. We feel it&#8217;s pretty under control here. We&#8217;ve created some good rules. But seeing how much our kids love being outdoors when camping I wondered&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if we swapped the rule? If we said that they could have as much indoor and screen time as they wanted, but that their outdoor time was limited to an hour a day. Would that make the outdoor time something that they craved?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably not. But maybe an interesting experiment for some time in the future.<\/p>\n",

I don&#8217;t follow a lot of it directly, but some of the detail has come to me indirectly. It&#8217;s horrible for all sorts of reasons I won&#8217;t go into here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;I want to point out that this drama is a tiny-but-highly-visible portion of what goes on in tech communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week I got some amazing help from one of the communities I chat with. Free technical help from 4 or 5 people who wanted nothing in return, and when I offered they suggested I gave to charity, which I willingly did this morning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what&#8217;s happening underneath all the drama all the time. In WordPress. In Laravel. In Statamic. In whatever places you hang out there will be good stuff happening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People helping each other and looking out for one another. People teaming up for support. People being friends and virtual co-workers. People busy answering forum questions. People building cool free (as in both beer and speech) stuff that makes our lives easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, we need to tackle what&#8217;s bad in these communities. That&#8217;s SUPER important. But let&#8217;s also elevate, promote, shout about the good stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Promote an <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/BinaryMoon\/wp-toolbelt\/\">open source project<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/timnash.co.uk\/blog\/\">blog<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/worknotes.co.uk\/\">resource<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/\">podcast<\/a>.<\/li><li>Give <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet\/?text=Thank%20you%20%3Cinsert%20persons%20name%20here%3E...%20!%20You're%20awesome%20because%20you%20%3Cinsert%20awesome%20thing%20they%20did%3E!\">thanks online for the help you get<\/a>.<\/li><li>Offer to actually buy a coffee or beer (use <a href=\"https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/\">Ko-fi.com<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/paypal.me\">paypal.me<\/a> if helpful) or give to charity when someone gives you help and saves you time\/money.<\/li><li>Support people who do good work.<\/li><li>Collaborate with your competitors.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s so much good stuff going on.

I don&#8217;t follow a lot of it directly, but some of the detail has come to me indirectly. It&#8217;s horrible for all sorts of reasons I won&#8217;t go into here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;I want to point out that this drama is a tiny-but-highly-visible portion of what goes on in tech communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week I got some amazing help from one of the communities I chat with. Free technical help from 4 or 5 people who wanted nothing in return, and when I offered they suggested I gave to charity, which I willingly did this morning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what&#8217;s happening underneath all the drama all the time. In WordPress. In Laravel. In Statamic. In whatever places you hang out there will be good stuff happening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People helping each other and looking out for one another. People teaming up for support. People being friends and virtual co-workers. People busy answering forum questions. People building cool free (as in both beer and speech) stuff that makes our lives easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, we need to tackle what&#8217;s bad in these communities. That&#8217;s SUPER important.

At the start of the long summer holiday I was thinking how this was a LONG time and would really drag, but gosh it&#8217;s flown by. But we&#8217;re about to return to the regular routine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been doing hosting stuff, development stuff, and other stuff. Which is pretty much my life. Side projects are taking a bit of a back seat while I focus on some things that need to be done for students going back to school or university. Things with proper hard deadlines!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve always said I would HATE to be a construction company building schools because the deadlines are so fixed. I&#8217;ve built things like advent calendars and new-year projects. But I tend to avoid projects with super-hard deadlines UNLESS the client seems to show a real understanding of the process involved and possible compromises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Made some big additions to a clever <strong>WordPress<\/strong> thing I&#8217;m making for a client. It&#8217;s a simple-but-effective tool using some simple <strong>JavaScript<\/strong>, <strong>AJAX<\/strong> and <strong>custom tables<\/strong> to link things together. Oh, and there&#8217;s a <strong>custom CSV import<\/strong> too. There was a dilemma about using custom tables or custom post types, but I had to deliver quickly and relatively cheaply so I just had to make a decision and go with it. I think I got it right.<\/li><li>Progressed a <strong>WordPress micro-site build<\/strong> I&#8217;m doing for a big charity, including building my first <strong>ACF-powered Gutenberg block<\/strong>!<\/li><li>Did a bunch of changes to a site I&#8217;m looking after for a smaller charity. This is an interesting one because the theme is quite fixed and they are wanting to make frequent changes to it. The current layout tools aren&#8217;t working, so I&#8217;m hoping to help them break free of the current constraints at some point and make it a bit more flexible.<\/li><li>A new <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/petitions\/269157\"><strong>government petition<\/strong><\/a> went crazy for a while so I became temporary government petitions expert for a short time, because I run <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/269157\"><strong>a service that tracks petition growth<\/strong><\/a>. This one hasn&#8217;t quite blown up like the <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/241584\">article 50 petition<\/a> did.<\/li><li>I recorded an informal &#8220;fireside chat&#8221; with <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/keithdevon\/\">Keith Devon<\/a> that may or may not become an edition of his EXCELLENT <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/\">Pricing WordPress<\/a> podcast. Watch that space (not this one).<\/li><li>The week ended with me <strong>supporting a small community group<\/strong> doing a 10 mile walk\/run. <strong>I was bike marshall<\/strong>, and yes, it was just an excuse to clock up some decent bike miles (and vertical metres too!). But I was handing out Jelly Babies and encouragement and keeping track of everyone as well.

And we sometimes visit beaches and need to carry all the 3- and 7-year old beach paraphernalia with us.  And we now have an Aldi supermarket <em>literally<\/em> at the end of our road now. So <strong>I&#8217;ve been thinking for a while about buying a big camping trolley<\/strong>, as we could use it for camping and days out, but also for doing big shopping trips without driving the car to literally-the-end-of-our-street.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a bit of research I found what appeared to be a good balance of value, functionality, capacity, and foldability in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Kampa-Trucker-Trolley\/dp\/B00IF61YHO\">K<strong>ampa Trucker<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a heavy thing of its own, but this is because it&#8217;s a beast of a thing that will take 100kg of stuff. It&#8217;s great. We didn&#8217;t actually take it on our recent camping holiday as it wouldn&#8217;t fit in the car (not sure how to solve that one). But the kids love it for the shopping trips and I do too! <strong>Highly recommended if&#8230;err&#8230;you have a supermarket at the end of your street.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_9723-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"My two kids sat in the Kampa Trucker Trolley\" class=\"wp-image-8586\" width=\"576\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_9723-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_9723-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time Machine<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/beatthestreet.me\/\"><strong>Beat the Street<\/strong><\/a><strong> is returning to Swindon<\/strong>.

        "content": "\n<p>Wow &#8211; so school is back this week!! At the start of the long summer holiday I was thinking how this was a LONG time and would really drag, but gosh it&#8217;s flown by. But we&#8217;re about to return to the regular routine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been doing hosting stuff, development stuff, and other stuff. Which is pretty much my life. Side projects are taking a bit of a back seat while I focus on some things that need to be done for students going back to school or university. Things with proper hard deadlines!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve always said I would HATE to be a construction company building schools because the deadlines are so fixed. I&#8217;ve built things like advent calendars and new-year projects. But I tend to avoid projects with super-hard deadlines UNLESS the client seems to show a real understanding of the process involved and possible compromises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Made some big additions to a clever <strong>WordPress<\/strong> thing I&#8217;m making for a client. It&#8217;s a simple-but-effective tool using some simple <strong>JavaScript<\/strong>, <strong>AJAX<\/strong> and <strong>custom tables<\/strong> to link things together. Oh, and there&#8217;s a <strong>custom CSV import<\/strong> too. There was a dilemma about using custom tables or custom post types, but I had to deliver quickly and relatively cheaply so I just had to make a decision and go with it. I think I got it right.<\/li><li>Progressed a <strong>WordPress micro-site build<\/strong> I&#8217;m doing for a big charity, including building my first <strong>ACF-powered Gutenberg block<\/strong>!<\/li><li>Did a bunch of changes to a site I&#8217;m looking after for a smaller charity. This is an interesting one because the theme is quite fixed and they are wanting to make frequent changes to it. The current layout tools aren&#8217;t working, so I&#8217;m hoping to help them break free of the current constraints at some point and make it a bit more flexible.<\/li><li>A new <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/petitions\/269157\"><strong>government petition<\/strong><\/a> went crazy for a while so I became temporary government petitions expert for a short time, because I run <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/269157\"><strong>a service that tracks petition growth<\/strong><\/a>. This one hasn&#8217;t quite blown up like the <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/241584\">article 50 petition<\/a> did.<\/li><li>I recorded an informal &#8220;fireside chat&#8221; with <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/keithdevon\/\">Keith Devon<\/a> that may or may not become an edition of his EXCELLENT <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/\">Pricing WordPress<\/a> podcast. Watch that space (not this one).<\/li><li>The week ended with me <strong>supporting a small community group<\/strong> doing a 10 mile walk\/run. <strong>I was bike marshall<\/strong>, and yes, it was just an excuse to clock up some decent bike miles (and vertical metres too!). But I was handing out Jelly Babies and encouragement and keeping track of everyone as well.

So <strong>I&#8217;ve been thinking for a while about buying a big camping trolley<\/strong>, as we could use it for camping and days out, but also for doing big shopping trips without driving the car to literally-the-end-of-our-street.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a bit of research I found what appeared to be a good balance of value, functionality, capacity, and foldability in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Kampa-Trucker-Trolley\/dp\/B00IF61YHO\">K<strong>ampa Trucker<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a heavy thing of its own, but this is because it&#8217;s a beast of a thing that will take 100kg of stuff. It&#8217;s great. We didn&#8217;t actually take it on our recent camping holiday as it wouldn&#8217;t fit in the car (not sure how to solve that one).

                "rendered": "\n<p>Looking around social media, it often looks like everyone else has their life planned down to every last car-refuelling and bathroom-cleaning activity. But it&#8217;s not true!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And after a two-figure number of years of being married, my wife and I have kinda figured out that we can&#8217;t read each other&#8217;s minds! Who knew?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we realised &#8211; probably actually a long time ago, but it crystallized in its practicality recently &#8211; was that we quite often have expectations of what we will get done in a given day, and that we carry these expectations in our heads, totally unspoken.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I might wake up and think: &#8220;I need to mow the lawn, put petrol in the car, and take all that junk I&#8217;ve been piling up to the tip&#8221;. My wife might wake up and think: &#8220;I need to do that long run or I&#8217;ll never make it round the half marathon, I need to put in a couple of hours work to prep for a workshop and I wish Ross would put that stuff back in the loft&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I, kinda on a whim, suggested we get these things out of our heads and on to paper. So I invented the &#8220;Family Brain&#8221;:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/IMG_9835-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Friday Family Brain on the breakfast table\" class=\"wp-image-8578\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/IMG_9835-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/IMG_9835-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/IMG_9835-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is literally just a piece of paper with a column for each person. You start afresh each day and write down what you think needs to happen that day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve done it you might need to actually talk to each other to prioritise and maybe postpone some things. But the Family Brain facilitates this by getting the stuff out of your head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought this was a ridiculous solution, something proper grown up have been doing for years, or simply don&#8217;t need. But I posted the idea in a Facebook thread about anxiety and brain-overwhelm yesterday and it struck a chord:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;omg the family brain sounds amazing!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;That family brain idea is genius.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Family brain is brilliant.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Love the family brain idea.  Funnily enough hubby and I have recently instinctively started doing  something similar. I don\u2019t know why we assume we can read each other\u2019s  minds but it\u2019s SO much easier having it on paper!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So I thought I&#8217;d get the idea out of a closed Facebook group and into the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now go&#8230;share what&#8217;s in your head!<\/p>\n",

Who knew?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we realised &#8211; probably actually a long time ago, but it crystallized in its practicality recently &#8211; was that we quite often have expectations of what we will get done in a given day, and that we carry these expectations in our heads, totally unspoken.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I might wake up and think: &#8220;I need to mow the lawn, put petrol in the car, and take all that junk I&#8217;ve been piling up to the tip&#8221;. My wife might wake up and think: &#8220;I need to do that long run or I&#8217;ll never make it round the half marathon, I need to put in a couple of hours work to prep for a workshop and I wish Ross would put that stuff back in the loft&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I, kinda on a whim, suggested we get these things out of our heads and on to paper. So I invented the &#8220;Family Brain&#8221;:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/IMG_9835-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Friday Family Brain on the breakfast table\" class=\"wp-image-8578\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/IMG_9835-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/IMG_9835-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/IMG_9835-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is literally just a piece of paper with a column for each person. You start afresh each day and write down what you think needs to happen that day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve done it you might need to actually talk to each other to prioritise and maybe postpone some things. But the Family Brain facilitates this by getting the stuff out of your head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought this was a ridiculous solution, something proper grown up have been doing for years, or simply don&#8217;t need. But I posted the idea in a Facebook thread about anxiety and brain-overwhelm yesterday and it struck a chord:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;omg the family brain sounds amazing!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;That family brain idea is genius.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Family brain is brilliant.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Love the family brain idea.  Funnily enough hubby and I have recently instinctively started doing  something similar. I don\u2019t know why we assume we can read each other\u2019s  minds but it\u2019s SO much easier having it on paper!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So I thought I&#8217;d get the idea out of a closed Facebook group and into the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now go&#8230;share what&#8217;s in your head!<\/p>\n",

Partly this is because I wanted to automate the &#8220;Pins&#8221; part of making weeknotes, because it was a right bind to do manually, but also I just dropped the ball.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I love my weeknotes, they&#8217;re useful for me if no one else, and I&#8217;m keen to get going with them again. AND I have hope for a couple of new sections:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>&#8220;<strong>This Week I Learned<\/strong>&#8220;: Some hopefully-hot tip that I picked up this week<\/li><li>&#8220;<strong>Toolbox<\/strong>&#8220;: Highlighting a tool (software or otherwise) that I use in my work or life that may be of interest <\/li><li>&#8220;<strong>The Time Machine<\/strong>&#8220;: Where I&#8217;ll try to resurface old-but-popular content<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I just got back from a week&#8217;s camping in the New Forest with my family, and it&#8217;s all systems go for the last week of the school holidays!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I had two GREAT days of work in there and exciting things are happening &#8211; I even submitted a talk to WordCamp London and will await a response to that nervously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a while, so here&#8217;s some of what I&#8217;ve been working on in the last few months<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I re-launched this site with a quirky new design and some developer-related easter eggs on the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/\">homepage<\/a>! Yay!<\/li><li>I built <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/sync-pinboard\/\">a WordPress plugin to sync Pinboard bookmarks<\/a> to a WordPress custom post type, and built my first Gutenberg block, all using vanilla JS and CSS with no build tools!<\/li><li>Started re-making <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/\">my business website<\/a> in <a href=\"https:\/\/statamic.com\/\">Statamic<\/a>! Also with vanilla JS and CSS and no build tools.<\/li><li>Finishing off (but not yet putting live) a mysterious Laravel project involving some in-depth API work. I also love that this project has a proper test suite &#8211; it&#8217;s not 100% coverage or TDD or anything, but enough to give me some confidence.<\/li><li>Continued working on a secret project that I&#8217;m VERY excited about that&#8217;s for probably my best client ever.<\/li><li>Finishing off and go-live of the new website for my local history project, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rodbournehistory.org\/\">Rodbourne Community History Group<\/a>. It looks like a simple Divi-builder site but there&#8217;s been a LOT of complicated work migrating content in, using custom post types and custom meta fields, ensuring meta-data is as complete as I can get it (extracting content from old HTML into structured data) and stuff like that.<\/li><li>Began and ended a small website build for <a href=\"https:\/\/separatedchild.org\/\">The Separated Child Foundation<\/a>. This was also a Divi-builder project but the key here has been squeezing as much value as possible out for the client &#8211; who were brilliant! I&#8217;ve been trying to work on bigger projects recently, buy I loved this cause and wanted to use my skills to support the foundation, who are really pleased with the result. <\/li><li>Started work on a re-build of a micro-site for a large charity that I&#8217;ve worked with for years. This is quick-turnaround after a long design phase. Should be done pretty soon.<\/li><li>Helped out a new client with a quick support request which turned out to be a permissions issue. But the kind of thing they needed an expert to diagnose and fix as no-one else could.<\/li><li>Cleaning up a (fortunately simple) <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.nintechnet.com\/unauthenticated-option-changes-in-wordpress-simple-301-redirects-addon-bulk-uploader-plugin\/\">malware attack<\/a> for a client who had a plugin installed with a huge (but limited severity) security hole.<\/li><li>Helping a new client review some at-scale hosting proposals they had for their new site &#8211; this required some quite in-depth hosting and security knowledge and the client were really happy with the result.<\/li><li>LOADS of small support requests and changes for existing clients.<\/li><li>Attended and spoke at WordCamp London (the official video of the talk isn&#8217;t ready yet, but you can see it from the LiveStream <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GcibNG6gUjE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3596\">here<\/a> &#8211; I was SO happy with it) and attended WordCamp Bristol.<\/li><li>Was temporarily a Government Petitions Data expert when the Revoke Article 50 petition went live &#8211; all because I <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/\">track petition data<\/a>!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve written a few blog posts since February<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/03\/a-new-look\/\">A new look: What?

Yay!<\/li><li>I built <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/sync-pinboard\/\">a WordPress plugin to sync Pinboard bookmarks<\/a> to a WordPress custom post type, and built my first Gutenberg block, all using vanilla JS and CSS with no build tools!<\/li><li>Started re-making <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/\">my business website<\/a> in <a href=\"https:\/\/statamic.com\/\">Statamic<\/a>! Also with vanilla JS and CSS and no build tools.<\/li><li>Finishing off (but not yet putting live) a mysterious Laravel project involving some in-depth API work. I also love that this project has a proper test suite &#8211; it&#8217;s not 100% coverage or TDD or anything, but enough to give me some confidence.<\/li><li>Continued working on a secret project that I&#8217;m VERY excited about that&#8217;s for probably my best client ever.<\/li><li>Finishing off and go-live of the new website for my local history project, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rodbournehistory.org\/\">Rodbourne Community History Group<\/a>. It looks like a simple Divi-builder site but there&#8217;s been a LOT of complicated work migrating content in, using custom post types and custom meta fields, ensuring meta-data is as complete as I can get it (extracting content from old HTML into structured data) and stuff like that.<\/li><li>Began and ended a small website build for <a href=\"https:\/\/separatedchild.org\/\">The Separated Child Foundation<\/a>. This was also a Divi-builder project but the key here has been squeezing as much value as possible out for the client &#8211; who were brilliant! I&#8217;ve been trying to work on bigger projects recently, buy I loved this cause and wanted to use my skills to support the foundation, who are really pleased with the result. <\/li><li>Started work on a re-build of a micro-site for a large charity that I&#8217;ve worked with for years. This is quick-turnaround after a long design phase. Should be done pretty soon.<\/li><li>Helped out a new client with a quick support request which turned out to be a permissions issue. But the kind of thing they needed an expert to diagnose and fix as no-one else could.<\/li><li>Cleaning up a (fortunately simple) <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.nintechnet.com\/unauthenticated-option-changes-in-wordpress-simple-301-redirects-addon-bulk-uploader-plugin\/\">malware attack<\/a> for a client who had a plugin installed with a huge (but limited severity) security hole.<\/li><li>Helping a new client review some at-scale hosting proposals they had for their new site &#8211; this required some quite in-depth hosting and security knowledge and the client were really happy with the result.<\/li><li>LOADS of small support requests and changes for existing clients.<\/li><li>Attended and spoke at WordCamp London (the official video of the talk isn&#8217;t ready yet, but you can see it from the LiveStream <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GcibNG6gUjE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3596\">here<\/a> &#8211; I was SO happy with it) and attended WordCamp Bristol.<\/li><li>Was temporarily a Government Petitions Data expert when the Revoke Article 50 petition went live &#8211; all because I <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/\">track petition data<\/a>!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve written a few blog posts since February<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/03\/a-new-look\/\">A new look: What?

If only the information was open!!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Recycling data<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our council here in Swindon recently changed the recycling rules. To inform people they produced a leaflet explaining which materials should go in which boxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I could stick the leaflet on my fridge. But&#8230;if I did so there wouldn&#8217;t be room for any cute pictures that my kids drew, or of those stupid ClubCard vouchers that I keep forgetting to spend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9555-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Swindon's new recycling leaflet\" class=\"wp-image-8435\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9555-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9555-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9555-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Swindon&#8217;s new recycling information leaflet<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s HUGE! (I do not have Donald Trump-sized hands!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I saw this I immediately thought: wouldn&#8217;t it be great if there was a simple app or something where I could search for materials to quickly find out if they are recyclable and which bin\/box\/bag they should go in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apps are generally overkill, but I quickly realised you could do this with a simple piece of JavaScript website code. And that I&#8217;d already built <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/javascript30\/06%20-%20Type%20Ahead\/index.html\">a nice filterable list<\/a> as part of a <a href=\"https:\/\/javascript30.com\/\">free coding course<\/a> that a chap called Wes Bos put together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So within about an hour I&#8217;d re-cycled the code from the course, tweaked it, and added some of the recycling information to make a <a href=\"https:\/\/swindon-recycling.netlify.com\/\">quick prototype<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"281\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-09.53.18-281x300.png\" alt=\"Screen shot of prototype filterable recycling list\" class=\"wp-image-8436\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-09.53.18-281x300.png 281w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-09.53.18-768x819.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-09.53.18.png 930w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" \/><figcaption>Try it: <a href=\"https:\/\/swindon-recycling.netlify.com\/\">https:\/\/swindon-recycling.netlify.com\/<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside: Having done this, I thought &#8220;Oh, maybe the council already have a list like this on their website?&#8221;.

To which Jim Robbins replied: &#8220;Swindon Council should be encouraging great citizen engagement like this&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I&#8217;m a bit shy, and the local press (not necessarily this specific journalist) doesn&#8217;t have a great reputation for presenting things accurately. They can make a story out of nothing sometimes &#8211; welcome to <a href=\"https:\/\/apiln.blogspot.com\/\">local journalism<\/a>! So I wasn&#8217;t sure how this would go down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this comment about encouraging citizen engagement was interesting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other reason I&#8217;m hesitant to have a story about this prototype at this point is that&#8230;well&#8230;am I ALLOWED to make something like this? The leaflet has no copyright notice on it so it is copyright by default. The website is explicitly copyrighted by the council.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So can I take this data and re-purpose it? Would I be at risk of hindering the council in doing this, for example, if the list got out of date? Would I be at risk of impersonating the council and making something that looks official even though it definitely isn&#8217;t?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, in the words of my councillor, making a tool like this is &#8220;great citizen engagement&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data reuse and recycling<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve got involved in making tech that aids government and democracy. I made a <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/\">Petition Tracker<\/a> that tracks the signatories on government petitions over time. This blew up recently when the &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/241584\">Revoke Article 50 Petition<\/a>&#8221; took off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was able to make the Petition Tracker because the government petition data is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>available in a structured format called JSON that I can process easily with computer code<\/li><li>&#8220;open&#8221; &#8211; that is, I&#8217;m explicitly and freely allowed to use it under a license called the &#8220;Open Government License&#8221;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This open-data has enabled a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/03\/all-the-brexit-revoke-article-50-government-petition-resources\/\">whole raft of tools<\/a> to pop up analysing the petition data in various ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are other things I&#8217;ve made where I&#8217;ve kind-of re-used data where I&#8217;m not entirely sure I&#8217;m allowed to. My <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hey_schoolbot\">SchoolBot<\/a> (private access only for now), for example, uses term dates and other information from the council and school websites to make that data more easily accessible through an &#8220;intelligent&#8221; Facebook messenger &#8220;bot&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9580-169x300.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8439\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9580-169x300.png 169w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9580-577x1024.png 577w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9580.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px\" \/><figcaption>What ARE the school holiday dates? SchoolBot knows!<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>And after the huge success of &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/beatthestreet.me\/UserPortal\/Default\">Beat the Street<\/a>&#8221; in Swindon last year, I made an experimental &#8220;virtual&#8221; clone of the game, called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zapthemap.com\/\">Zap the Map<\/a>, that you can play with a smartphone. But was I allowed to copy and use the locations of the &#8220;boxes&#8221;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">On Innovation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold that thought &#8211; let&#8217;s talk about innovation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 18 months ago I attended an &#8220;unconference&#8221; on the topic of digital tech in charities, where one of the sessions was about innovation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this discussion were two general opinions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Innovation is hard because it&#8217;s expensive and hard to get sign-off for and it&#8217;s risky and prone to failure and charities don&#8217;t want to waste donors money on it.<\/li><li>Innovation is easy with modern technology, you can try things out quickly at low cost, fail fast if things don&#8217;t work, pick things that work and develop them further and it&#8217;s a route to improving all sorts of things. It&#8217;s actually riskier to embark on a big, long, time-consuming project with an uncertain outcome.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I admit, the reality is that opinion 1 is probably the most realistic right now, and this was the opinion of most of the people who worked for\/in charities in the room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But technology people prototype ideas and run little side projects all the time and are so used to the way of working outlined in the second opinion. And we see the opportunities that this way of working presents. My <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/projects\/\">list of side projects<\/a> is testament to this approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And &#8211; I should add &#8211; I don&#8217;t believe innovation needs to be purely digital. Heck, even Dyson (still) make cardboard prototypes of things to try them out!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>one day I was at a local sawmill and noticed how the sawdust was being  removed from the air by large industrial cyclones. My engineering  instinct kicked in. Could that work on a smaller scale? So I created a  cardboard prototype and strapped it on to my machine. It didn\u2019t look  great, but it picked up more dust. Fifteen years and 5,000 prototypes  later, I had a bagless vacuum cleaner.<\/p><cite>James Dyson in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/culture\/2016\/may\/24\/interview-james-dyson-vacuum-cleaner\">The Guardian<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Opportunities of Innovation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So what if there are some good citizens out there who have interesting ideas about how to use information technology to improve public services, make life better and easier for fellow citizens, help charities and businesses be more effective?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what if those ideas aren&#8217;t being explored because the people who own the data don&#8217;t make it available in usable formats, and allow it to be copied and repurposed?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the data\/information\/content the council owned was more open, could tech-savvy people like me, who want to improve things for themselves and others, at low cost, be empowered to innovate with digital (and non-digital) technology, and allow the council to take the ideas that look like they are working and move them forward to make official tools?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A closing note on the actual risks and issues<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two more things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, I&#8217;m sure there are tech teams working on stuff like this for the council. I&#8217;m sure they are cash-strapped and have limited remits. But I&#8217;m also guessing that they work for huge corporations like Capita. I&#8217;m sure that both the local councils and the IT companies that they employ have lots of red-tape and budgetary constraints and so on. I have experienced some of this first hand through the council&#8217;s procurement processes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I suppose this is my challenge: innovation can&#8217;t work within these kinds of processes. A single freelance web developer like me can take what exists and make something better in a very short space of time at very low cost. Are these ideas at least worth exploring somehow? Is it worth having a framework for innovation that allows ideas like this to be evaluated?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I know this seems like a rosy, utopian view of how local government works or could work. The reality is that you don&#8217;t want people taking data and abusing it, masquerading as the authorities and confusing people, profiting unnecessarily from it, or putting unnecessary burden on the authorities. I understand all that. How real are these risks? I don&#8217;t know. How can they be managed? I&#8217;m not sure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I can&#8217;t help thinking that good citizens like me with useful skills and ideas are prevented from using those skills for the public good. The Petition Tracker and related tools show how open data can be great.  I&#8217;d love to see local governments working more like this.<\/p>\n",

If only the information was open!!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Recycling data<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our council here in Swindon recently changed the recycling rules. To inform people they produced a leaflet explaining which materials should go in which boxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I could stick the leaflet on my fridge. But&#8230;if I did so there wouldn&#8217;t be room for any cute pictures that my kids drew, or of those stupid ClubCard vouchers that I keep forgetting to spend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9555-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Swindon's new recycling leaflet\" class=\"wp-image-8435\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9555-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9555-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9555-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Swindon&#8217;s new recycling information leaflet<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s HUGE! (I do not have Donald Trump-sized hands!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I saw this I immediately thought: wouldn&#8217;t it be great if there was a simple app or something where I could search for materials to quickly find out if they are recyclable and which bin\/box\/bag they should go in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apps are generally overkill, but I quickly realised you could do this with a simple piece of JavaScript website code. And that I&#8217;d already built <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/javascript30\/06%20-%20Type%20Ahead\/index.html\">a nice filterable list<\/a> as part of a <a href=\"https:\/\/javascript30.com\/\">free coding course<\/a> that a chap called Wes Bos put together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So within about an hour I&#8217;d re-cycled the code from the course, tweaked it, and added some of the recycling information to make a <a href=\"https:\/\/swindon-recycling.netlify.com\/\">quick prototype<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"281\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-09.53.18-281x300.png\" alt=\"Screen shot of prototype filterable recycling list\" class=\"wp-image-8436\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-09.53.18-281x300.png 281w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-09.53.18-768x819.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-09.53.18.png 930w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px\" \/><figcaption>Try it: <a href=\"https:\/\/swindon-recycling.netlify.com\/\">https:\/\/swindon-recycling.netlify.com\/<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside: Having done this, I thought &#8220;Oh, maybe the council already have a list like this on their website?&#8221;. They do have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/info\/20015\/bins_rubbish_and_recycling\/138\/recycling_guide\/6\">a full, indexed, A-Z list<\/a>, but it&#8217;s not as good as a filterable one, and adding a filter seems like a relatively simple but very welcome enhancement:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"166\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-10.10.15-166x300.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8437\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-10.10.15-166x300.png 166w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-10.10.15-566x1024.png 566w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Screenshot-2019-07-03-at-10.10.15.png 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 166px) 100vw, 166px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A good citizen?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I did a bit to promote this idea, and it got a little traction and love. My super local councilor, Jim Robbins, did his best to promote it to the powers that be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a few days later a local journalist asked if he could to a story about it to promote it. To which Jim Robbins replied: &#8220;Swindon Council should be encouraging great citizen engagement like this&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I&#8217;m a bit shy, and the local press (not necessarily this specific journalist) doesn&#8217;t have a great reputation for presenting things accurately. They can make a story out of nothing sometimes &#8211; welcome to <a href=\"https:\/\/apiln.blogspot.com\/\">local journalism<\/a>! So I wasn&#8217;t sure how this would go down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this comment about encouraging citizen engagement was interesting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other reason I&#8217;m hesitant to have a story about this prototype at this point is that&#8230;well&#8230;am I ALLOWED to make something like this? The leaflet has no copyright notice on it so it is copyright by default. The website is explicitly copyrighted by the council.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So can I take this data and re-purpose it? Would I be at risk of hindering the council in doing this, for example, if the list got out of date? Would I be at risk of impersonating the council and making something that looks official even though it definitely isn&#8217;t?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, in the words of my councillor, making a tool like this is &#8220;great citizen engagement&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data reuse and recycling<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve got involved in making tech that aids government and democracy. I made a <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/\">Petition Tracker<\/a> that tracks the signatories on government petitions over time. This blew up recently when the &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/241584\">Revoke Article 50 Petition<\/a>&#8221; took off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was able to make the Petition Tracker because the government petition data is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>available in a structured format called JSON that I can process easily with computer code<\/li><li>&#8220;open&#8221; &#8211; that is, I&#8217;m explicitly and freely allowed to use it under a license called the &#8220;Open Government License&#8221;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This open-data has enabled a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/03\/all-the-brexit-revoke-article-50-government-petition-resources\/\">whole raft of tools<\/a> to pop up analysing the petition data in various ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are other things I&#8217;ve made where I&#8217;ve kind-of re-used data where I&#8217;m not entirely sure I&#8217;m allowed to. My <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hey_schoolbot\">SchoolBot<\/a> (private access only for now), for example, uses term dates and other information from the council and school websites to make that data more easily accessible through an &#8220;intelligent&#8221; Facebook messenger &#8220;bot&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9580-169x300.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8439\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9580-169x300.png 169w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9580-577x1024.png 577w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/IMG_9580.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px\" \/><figcaption>What ARE the school holiday dates? SchoolBot knows!<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>And after the huge success of &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/beatthestreet.me\/UserPortal\/Default\">Beat the Street<\/a>&#8221; in Swindon last year, I made an experimental &#8220;virtual&#8221; clone of the game, called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zapthemap.com\/\">Zap the Map<\/a>, that you can play with a smartphone. But was I allowed to copy and use the locations of the &#8220;boxes&#8221;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">On Innovation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold that thought &#8211; let&#8217;s talk about innovation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 18 months ago I attended an &#8220;unconference&#8221; on the topic of digital tech in charities, where one of the sessions was about innovation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this discussion were two general opinions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Innovation is hard because it&#8217;s expensive and hard to get sign-off for and it&#8217;s risky and prone to failure and charities don&#8217;t want to waste donors money on it.<\/li><li>Innovation is easy with modern technology, you can try things out quickly at low cost, fail fast if things don&#8217;t work, pick things that work and develop them further and it&#8217;s a route to improving all sorts of things. It&#8217;s actually riskier to embark on a big, long, time-consuming project with an uncertain outcome.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I admit, the reality is that opinion 1 is probably the most realistic right now, and this was the opinion of most of the people who worked for\/in charities in the room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But technology people prototype ideas and run little side projects all the time and are so used to the way of working outlined in the second opinion. And we see the opportunities that this way of working presents. My <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/projects\/\">list of side projects<\/a> is testament to this approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And &#8211; I should add &#8211; I don&#8217;t believe innovation needs to be purely digital. Heck, even Dyson (still) make cardboard prototypes of things to try them out!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>one day I was at a local sawmill and noticed how the sawdust was being  removed from the air by large industrial cyclones. My engineering  instinct kicked in. Could that work on a smaller scale? So I created a  cardboard prototype and strapped it on to my machine. It didn\u2019t look  great, but it picked up more dust. Fifteen years and 5,000 prototypes  later, I had a bagless vacuum cleaner.<\/p><cite>James Dyson in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/culture\/2016\/may\/24\/interview-james-dyson-vacuum-cleaner\">The Guardian<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Opportunities of Innovation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So what if there are some good citizens out there who have interesting ideas about how to use information technology to improve public services, make life better and easier for fellow citizens, help charities and businesses be more effective?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what if those ideas aren&#8217;t being explored because the people who own the data don&#8217;t make it available in usable formats, and allow it to be copied and repurposed?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the data\/information\/content the council owned was more open, could tech-savvy people like me, who want to improve things for themselves and others, at low cost, be empowered to innovate with digital (and non-digital) technology, and allow the council to take the ideas that look like they are working and move them forward to make official tools?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A closing note on the actual risks and issues<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two more things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, I&#8217;m sure there are tech teams working on stuff like this for the council. I&#8217;m sure they are cash-strapped and have limited remits. But I&#8217;m also guessing that they work for huge corporations like Capita. I&#8217;m sure that both the local councils and the IT companies that they employ have lots of red-tape and budgetary constraints and so on. I have experienced some of this first hand through the council&#8217;s procurement processes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I suppose this is my challenge: innovation can&#8217;t work within these kinds of processes. A single freelance web developer like me can take what exists and make something better in a very short space of time at very low cost. Are these ideas at least worth exploring somehow? Is it worth having a framework for innovation that allows ideas like this to be evaluated?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I know this seems like a rosy, utopian view of how local government works or could work. The reality is that you don&#8217;t want people taking data and abusing it, masquerading as the authorities and confusing people, profiting unnecessarily from it, or putting unnecessary burden on the authorities. I understand all that. How real are these risks? I don&#8217;t know. How can they be managed? I&#8217;m not sure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I can&#8217;t help thinking that good citizens like me with useful skills and ideas are prevented from using those skills for the public good. The Petition Tracker and related tools show how open data can be great.  I&#8217;d love to see local governments working more like this.<\/p>\n",

Like this site it&#8217;s kinda deliberately minimalist because I&#8217;m not a designer, and yes, it&#8217;s better than previous iterations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s so much I don&#8217;t like about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m working, behind the scenes, with <a href=\"https:\/\/statamic.com\/\">Statamic<\/a>, trying to get to a point where I can use it on client projects. I started trying to rebuild my blog on Statamic and I got so far, but there&#8217;s reasons I don&#8217;t think this will work for MY particular blog (that&#8217;s not to say I wouldn&#8217;t use Statamic for other blogs &#8211; it&#8217;s just that my blog is actually a bit more than a blog right now).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My business site, however, is perfect for converting to Statamic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So off I set.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The super-minimal SUCSS approach<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve writing about <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/my-new-css-framework-sucss\/\">my jokingly-named &#8220;SUCSS&#8221; approach to CSS<\/a> before. But the basic premise is that I&#8217;m fed up of node-based build tools and complex frameworks, and CSS now has things like custom properties (i.e. variables) and calc and flexbox that are supported well enough to make them OK to use in vanilla form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my aim is &#8211;  for small sites at least &#8211; to ditch the build process entirely, work in vanilla CSS (and vanilla JS where needed too) and, for my own site, just keep things as small and simple as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a designer and I&#8217;m embracing that with few images and a super-simple design. This will aid page weight and load times and make my site clean, lean and green! Nice!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I confess that my starting point was, for whatever reason, a compiled, vanilla-CSS version of Bootstrap 4. I&#8217;ve ditched 95% of it, but I know the grid and can work easily with the grid, so I&#8217;ve kept that, and used the rest as a &#8220;reset&#8221; and built upon it. This has worked out just fine!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Centre-align is a cheap trick that doesn&#8217;t always work<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At one point I kinda forgot to add <code>text-align: centre<\/code> to a block and when I looked at it it looked better! So I started left-aligning everything and it actually &#8211; I think &#8211; looks neater and smarter. Who&#8217;d have thought &#8211; I was blindly following trends in my own non-designery way, and it turns out that centre-aligning stuff isn&#8217;t always the best way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I&#8217;m still learning. Lots. Every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"853\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30-1024x853.png\" alt=\"Old Oikos site with WordPress and a page builder\" class=\"wp-image-8405\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30-1024x853.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30-300x250.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30-768x640.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30.png 1210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Old Oikos site with WordPress and a page builder<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"860\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20-1024x860.png\" alt=\"New, Statamic-powered, vanilla CSS, site with no page-builder!\" class=\"wp-image-8407\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20-1024x860.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20-300x252.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20-768x645.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20.png 1177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>New, Statamic-powered, vanilla CSS, site with no page-builder!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Results<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, and this is without adding in a navigation, search or my <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\">Kownter analytics<\/a>, I&#8217;ve got the homepage down from 1.74MB over 33 requests to 67.5K over 4 requests.

        "content": "\n<p>I hate my own business website. I built it quickly with a page builder. Like this site it&#8217;s kinda deliberately minimalist because I&#8217;m not a designer, and yes, it&#8217;s better than previous iterations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s so much I don&#8217;t like about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m working, behind the scenes, with <a href=\"https:\/\/statamic.com\/\">Statamic<\/a>, trying to get to a point where I can use it on client projects. I started trying to rebuild my blog on Statamic and I got so far, but there&#8217;s reasons I don&#8217;t think this will work for MY particular blog (that&#8217;s not to say I wouldn&#8217;t use Statamic for other blogs &#8211; it&#8217;s just that my blog is actually a bit more than a blog right now).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My business site, however, is perfect for converting to Statamic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So off I set.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The super-minimal SUCSS approach<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve writing about <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/my-new-css-framework-sucss\/\">my jokingly-named &#8220;SUCSS&#8221; approach to CSS<\/a> before. But the basic premise is that I&#8217;m fed up of node-based build tools and complex frameworks, and CSS now has things like custom properties (i.e. variables) and calc and flexbox that are supported well enough to make them OK to use in vanilla form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my aim is &#8211;  for small sites at least &#8211; to ditch the build process entirely, work in vanilla CSS (and vanilla JS where needed too) and, for my own site, just keep things as small and simple as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a designer and I&#8217;m embracing that with few images and a super-simple design. This will aid page weight and load times and make my site clean, lean and green! Nice!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I confess that my starting point was, for whatever reason, a compiled, vanilla-CSS version of Bootstrap 4. I&#8217;ve ditched 95% of it, but I know the grid and can work easily with the grid, so I&#8217;ve kept that, and used the rest as a &#8220;reset&#8221; and built upon it. This has worked out just fine!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Centre-align is a cheap trick that doesn&#8217;t always work<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At one point I kinda forgot to add <code>text-align: centre<\/code> to a block and when I looked at it it looked better! So I started left-aligning everything and it actually &#8211; I think &#8211; looks neater and smarter. Who&#8217;d have thought &#8211; I was blindly following trends in my own non-designery way, and it turns out that centre-aligning stuff isn&#8217;t always the best way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I&#8217;m still learning. Lots. Every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"853\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30-1024x853.png\" alt=\"Old Oikos site with WordPress and a page builder\" class=\"wp-image-8405\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30-1024x853.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30-300x250.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30-768x640.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.29.30.png 1210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Old Oikos site with WordPress and a page builder<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"860\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20-1024x860.png\" alt=\"New, Statamic-powered, vanilla CSS, site with no page-builder!\" class=\"wp-image-8407\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20-1024x860.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20-300x252.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20-768x645.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Screenshot-2019-06-20-at-10.39.20.png 1177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>New, Statamic-powered, vanilla CSS, site with no page-builder!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Results<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, and this is without adding in a navigation, search or my <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\">Kownter analytics<\/a>, I&#8217;ve got the homepage down from 1.74MB over 33 requests to 67.5K over 4 requests.

                "rendered": "\n<p>Another thing where I feel like: &#8220;I must have done this a hundred times before, but it feels new&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CRUDdy conventions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel apps generally use forms a lot. They don&#8217;t have to, but a lot of the time you need to make some kind of CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) interface for objects, and you so end up needing simple forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Laravel uses &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Convention_over_configuration\">convention over configuration<\/a>&#8221; to determine a lot of things. For example, rather than getting the developer to explicitly say &#8220;The <code>User<\/code> model uses the <code>users<\/code> table&#8221;, the framework assumes a default by convention:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>By convention, the &#8220;snake case&#8221;, plural name of the class will be used as the table name unless another name is explicitly specified<\/p><cite><a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/eloquent#eloquent-model-conventions\">https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/eloquent#eloquent-model-conventions<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is great because once you&#8217;ve learned the conventions, you can get on with coding without having to be explicit about a load of things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Form validation is easy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And Laravel also lets you take a lot of shortcuts with creating forms. Such as the built-in validation. This lets you set a bunch of rules about the data submitted in a request, and the framework:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Applies the rules<\/li><li>Sanitises the inputs<\/li><li>Redirects on failure and&#8230;<\/li><li>&#8230;stores errors in the session.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is great. Under certain circumstances. But you can&#8217;t just set the rules and go. You still need to pay attention to what&#8217;s going on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The wrong error<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One place that this beautifully-automatic system falls down is with error messages. It does its best, but really it needs a little more work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say you have a simple profile-updating form for a company object. You could have an <code>input<\/code> named <code>name<\/code>, but your label for this input is <code>Company Name<\/code>:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;h3&gt;Your company details&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;input-group&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;label for=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Company name&lt;\/label&gt;\n  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; id=&quot;name&quot;&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>You can validate this for, say, required-ness in your controller like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$validatedRequest = $request-&gt;validate(&#x5B;\n  'name' =&gt; 'required'\n]);\n\n\/\/ Do stuff with the request\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>The framework does its best to be clever here if validation fails, and it sill stores an error in the session that you can print in your template. BUT&#8230;the error will say that &#8220;The <strong>name<\/strong> field is required&#8221; (or similar &#8211; emphasis mine) and it will use the input&#8217;s name rather than the label. This is confusing for the user because the label for the input was &#8220;Company name&#8221; so the error should be &#8220;The <strong>Company name<\/strong> field is required&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Custom error messages<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can create custom error messages for validations, but you have to use a more verbose form of validation. This is <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/validation#custom-error-messages\">documented here<\/a>, and I won&#8217;t go into too much detail, but you basically create an array of new messages like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$messages = &#x5B;\n  'name.required' =&gt; 'You must provide a company name',\n];\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>There are various ways to pass this to the validator &#8211; check the docs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this all works nicely. So far so good. But&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A complication<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s a slight complication for my application: I&#8217;m using <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/validation#form-request-validation\">form requests!<\/a> These allow you to group authorisation, validation, and so on into a single class for handling the input, and to have lots of that taken care of for you. Their usage in a controller looks like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function store(CompanyUpdate $request)\n{\n  $validated = $request-&gt;validated();\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve created the <code>CompanyUpdate<\/code> request class here, authorisation is automatic, and validation is taken care of in that single line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But where, then, do I put my custom messages?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The solution<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I confess that custom error messages for form requests <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/validation#customizing-the-error-messages\">ARE documented<\/a>, and I just missed them, which is why I&#8217;ve ended up writing this up for my own sanity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To customise the error messages in your form request you can override the <code>messages<\/code> method in your form request class:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function messages()\n{\n  return &#x5B;\n    'name.required' =&gt; 'You must provide a company name',\n    ];\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Simple. But a kinda-tucked away, done-by-convention feature of form requests that&#8217;s really useful to know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoepfully, like my future self, you&#8217;re now happy that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>you need to customise your form validation messages; and<\/li><li>you can now do this however you are doing your validations&#8230;<\/li><li>&#8230;even if they are within a form request!<\/li><\/ul>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Another thing where I feel like: &#8220;I must have done this a hundred times before, but it feels new&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CRUDdy conventions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel apps generally use forms a lot. They don&#8217;t have to, but a lot of the time you need to make some kind of CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) interface for objects, and you so end up needing simple forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Laravel uses &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Convention_over_configuration\">convention over configuration<\/a>&#8221; to determine a lot of things. For example, rather than getting the developer to explicitly say &#8220;The <code>User<\/code> model uses the <code>users<\/code> table&#8221;, the framework assumes a default by convention:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>By convention, the &#8220;snake case&#8221;, plural name of the class will be used as the table name unless another name is explicitly specified<\/p><cite><a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/eloquent#eloquent-model-conventions\">https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/eloquent#eloquent-model-conventions<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is great because once you&#8217;ve learned the conventions, you can get on with coding without having to be explicit about a load of things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Form validation is easy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And Laravel also lets you take a lot of shortcuts with creating forms. Such as the built-in validation. This lets you set a bunch of rules about the data submitted in a request, and the framework:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Applies the rules<\/li><li>Sanitises the inputs<\/li><li>Redirects on failure and&#8230;<\/li><li>&#8230;stores errors in the session.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is great. Under certain circumstances. But you can&#8217;t just set the rules and go. You still need to pay attention to what&#8217;s going on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The wrong error<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One place that this beautifully-automatic system falls down is with error messages. It does its best, but really it needs a little more work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say you have a simple profile-updating form for a company object. You could have an <code>input<\/code> named <code>name<\/code>, but your label for this input is <code>Company Name<\/code>:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;h3&gt;Your company details&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;input-group&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;label for=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Company name&lt;\/label&gt;\n  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; id=&quot;name&quot;&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>You can validate this for, say, required-ness in your controller like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$validatedRequest = $request-&gt;validate(&#x5B;\n  'name' =&gt; 'required'\n]);\n\n\/\/ Do stuff with the request\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>The framework does its best to be clever here if validation fails, and it sill stores an error in the session that you can print in your template. BUT&#8230;the error will say that &#8220;The <strong>name<\/strong> field is required&#8221; (or similar &#8211; emphasis mine) and it will use the input&#8217;s name rather than the label. This is confusing for the user because the label for the input was &#8220;Company name&#8221; so the error should be &#8220;The <strong>Company name<\/strong> field is required&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Custom error messages<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can create custom error messages for validations, but you have to use a more verbose form of validation. This is <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/validation#custom-error-messages\">documented here<\/a>, and I won&#8217;t go into too much detail, but you basically create an array of new messages like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$messages = &#x5B;\n  'name.required' =&gt; 'You must provide a company name',\n];\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>There are various ways to pass this to the validator &#8211; check the docs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this all works nicely. So far so good. But&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A complication<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s a slight complication for my application: I&#8217;m using <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/validation#form-request-validation\">form requests!<\/a> These allow you to group authorisation, validation, and so on into a single class for handling the input, and to have lots of that taken care of for you. Their usage in a controller looks like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function store(CompanyUpdate $request)\n{\n  $validated = $request-&gt;validated();\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve created the <code>CompanyUpdate<\/code> request class here, authorisation is automatic, and validation is taken care of in that single line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But where, then, do I put my custom messages?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The solution<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I confess that custom error messages for form requests <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/validation#customizing-the-error-messages\">ARE documented<\/a>, and I just missed them, which is why I&#8217;ve ended up writing this up for my own sanity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To customise the error messages in your form request you can override the <code>messages<\/code> method in your form request class:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function messages()\n{\n  return &#x5B;\n    'name.required' =&gt; 'You must provide a company name',\n    ];\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Simple. But a kinda-tucked away, done-by-convention feature of form requests that&#8217;s really useful to know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoepfully, like my future self, you&#8217;re now happy that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>you need to customise your form validation messages; and<\/li><li>you can now do this however you are doing your validations&#8230;<\/li><li>&#8230;even if they are within a form request!<\/li><\/ul>\n",

But this felt new today and is definitely worth remembering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re using forms in Laravel, you sometimes want a &#8220;cancel&#8221; or &#8220;back&#8221; button or link that takes you to where you were before. And Laravel provides a handy <code>url()<\/code> helper that gets a URL builder that you can add a <code>previous()<\/code> method call to get the referring URL:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nurl()-&gt;previous()\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>So you can put this as the <code>href<\/code> of a link and you&#8217;re done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well&#8230;unless&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, if you submit your form with errors, and Laravel&#8217;s validation is being used, your POST request, will result in the form page being reloaded. And the referrer &#8211; and therefore the <code>previous()<\/code> URL &#8211; will be the form page, because that&#8217;s where you came from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you need to remember the original previous URL between loads of the form page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always with Laravel there&#8217;s many ways to skin that cat. But I like this one: put a hidden field in your form to remember the original previous URL.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot;\n       name=&quot;back_to&quot;\n       value=&quot;{{ old('back_to') ?: url()-&gt;previous() }}&quot;&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And then use that in your back\/cancel button link:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;a class=&quot;btn btn-default&quot;\n   href=&quot;{{ old('back_to') ?: url()-&gt;previous() }}&gt;\n  Cancel\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Note the use of the <code>old()<\/code> helper &#8211; because the POST to the form results in a redirect which loses the request data &#8211; so we need to grab it from the session.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s a note to self, but maybe it helped you too.<\/p>\n",

And the referrer &#8211; and therefore the <code>previous()<\/code> URL &#8211; will be the form page, because that&#8217;s where you came from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you need to remember the original previous URL between loads of the form page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always with Laravel there&#8217;s many ways to skin that cat. But I like this one: put a hidden field in your form to remember the original previous URL.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot;\n       name=&quot;back_to&quot;\n       value=&quot;{{ old('back_to') ?: url()-&gt;previous() }}&quot;&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And then use that in your back\/cancel button link:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: xml; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;a class=&quot;btn btn-default&quot;\n   href=&quot;{{ old('back_to') ?: url()-&gt;previous() }}&gt;\n  Cancel\n&lt;\/a&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Note the use of the <code>old()<\/code> helper &#8211; because the POST to the form results in a redirect which loses the request data &#8211; so we need to grab it from the session.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s a note to self, but maybe it helped you too.<\/p>\n",

In this application we are using resource controllers (with typical resource methods like <code>index<\/code>, <code>create<\/code>, <code>store<\/code>, etc) and manually authorizing in the controllers using the controller helper method described in <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/authorization#via-controller-helpers\">the documentation<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$this-&gt;authorize('create', Post::class);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>or, for methods that require authorization for a particular object\/model:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function update(Request $request, Post $post)\n{\n    $this-&gt;authorize('update', $post);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The problem<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem I had here is that in the latter example, it&#8217;s kinda unclear which policy is being used. In the first example above it&#8217;s explicit &#8211; we&#8217;re using using the <code>PostPolicy<\/code> because we passed in <code>Post::class<\/code> to specify which model we are using.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second example the Policy is not specified &#8211; I&#8217;m guessing that the class of the type-hinted <code>Post<\/code> is used to determine which policy is called. But it&#8217;s not clear especially when&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The use case &#8211; and why the problem is a problem<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In my case I&#8217;m authorizing users to edit users, so my controllers looked like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function update(Request $request, User $user)\n{\n    $this-&gt;authorize('update', $user);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>But then I wanted <a href=\"https:\/\/tighten.co\/blog\/extending-models-in-eloquent\">some child classes<\/a> of the <code>User<\/code> model, which look like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nclass SuperAdmin extends User\n{\n    protected $table = 'users';\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Now, if a SuperAdmin is passed to the UserController, which Policy is used? And &#8211; I know I probably shouldn&#8217;t but &#8211; if I wanted to use a specific policy here, what do I do? My only option is to change the type hint, isn&#8217;t it? And I may not want to do that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The solution!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, no. It&#8217;s not the only option. It turns out you can pass an array to the <code>authorize<\/code> helper which seems to let you specify both the object you are trying to authorize for, and a specific class\/policy:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$this-&gt;authorize('update', &#x5B;SuperAdmin::class, $user]);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>So yay! Now, there&#8217;s probably a whole bunch of reasons you wouldn&#8217;t\/shouldn&#8217;t do this, but that&#8217;s not the point. I want to remember that you can choose a policy by specifying a class name. And&#8230;job done!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I&#8217;m working on a Laravel application right now and I got myself in a bit of a tangle about authorization policies because of an undocumented way of using them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Overview of policies<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In Laravel, Policies are a way of specifying who can take particular actions. In this application we are using resource controllers (with typical resource methods like <code>index<\/code>, <code>create<\/code>, <code>store<\/code>, etc) and manually authorizing in the controllers using the controller helper method described in <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/authorization#via-controller-helpers\">the documentation<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$this-&gt;authorize('create', Post::class);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>or, for methods that require authorization for a particular object\/model:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function update(Request $request, Post $post)\n{\n    $this-&gt;authorize('update', $post);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The problem<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem I had here is that in the latter example, it&#8217;s kinda unclear which policy is being used. In the first example above it&#8217;s explicit &#8211; we&#8217;re using using the <code>PostPolicy<\/code> because we passed in <code>Post::class<\/code> to specify which model we are using.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second example the Policy is not specified &#8211; I&#8217;m guessing that the class of the type-hinted <code>Post<\/code> is used to determine which policy is called. But it&#8217;s not clear especially when&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The use case &#8211; and why the problem is a problem<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In my case I&#8217;m authorizing users to edit users, so my controllers looked like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function update(Request $request, User $user)\n{\n    $this-&gt;authorize('update', $user);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>But then I wanted <a href=\"https:\/\/tighten.co\/blog\/extending-models-in-eloquent\">some child classes<\/a> of the <code>User<\/code> model, which look like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nclass SuperAdmin extends User\n{\n    protected $table = 'users';\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Now, if a SuperAdmin is passed to the UserController, which Policy is used? And &#8211; I know I probably shouldn&#8217;t but &#8211; if I wanted to use a specific policy here, what do I do? My only option is to change the type hint, isn&#8217;t it? And I may not want to do that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The solution!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, no. It&#8217;s not the only option. It turns out you can pass an array to the <code>authorize<\/code> helper which seems to let you specify both the object you are trying to authorize for, and a specific class\/policy:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$this-&gt;authorize('update', &#x5B;SuperAdmin::class, $user]);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>So yay! Now, there&#8217;s probably a whole bunch of reasons you wouldn&#8217;t\/shouldn&#8217;t do this, but that&#8217;s not the point. I want to remember that you can choose a policy by specifying a class name. And&#8230;job done!<\/p>\n",
