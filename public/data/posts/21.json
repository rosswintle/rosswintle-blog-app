                "rendered": "<p>Recently someone asked if there was a good tool for dumping lots of stuff that was in their head in a GTD (<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Getting_Things_Done\">Getting Things Done<\/a>) manner.<\/p>\n<p>I use a tool called<a href=\"http:\/\/groups.google.com\/group\/wikidpad\/web\/home?pli=1\"> Wikidpad<\/a> for this. It&#8217;s a desktop Wiki, which enabled you to write short or long notes, and link them together in a variety of ways &#8211; in much the same way as a web-based Wiki.  But it&#8217;s not very well documented and there&#8217;s not tutorial for using it.  So here&#8217;s my own little guide to how I use it.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to cover the basics of Wikis &#8211; you can read about them elsewhere.  Wikidpad uses simple CamelCase as WikiWords that automatically become links to other pages (though you can suppress this for specified words).<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d recommend opening the help Wiki and looking at the pages TextFormatting, TodoItems and WikiDocumentAttributes as a starting point.<\/p>\n<p>For me, what really makes Wikidpad useful is its auto-indexed attributes and todo-type tags.  Not only do your pages appear in a tree showing their location within the Wiki (essentially creating folders of related information), but you can also create hierarchical attributes that are<br \/>indexed and then displayed as a tree in the &#8220;Views&#8221; section.  This is essentially an index of information that you&#8217;ve &#8220;tagged&#8221; with attributes.<\/p>\n<p>For example, I can have a &#8220;Customer&#8221; attribute.  If I put the text &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">[Customer:New Technologies Inc]<\/span>&#8221; on a page, this will create, in the index, a customer folder, containing a New Technologies Inc folder, containing all the pages with that attribute.<\/p>\n<p>This is HUGELY useful because it means I can &#8220;tag&#8221; information in a whole multitude of different ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By customer<\/li>\n<li>By any number of different references that may exist (e.g. a request for change reference).<\/li>\n<li>How&#8217;s about atrtributes by date?  I can effectively create a journal by using attributes like &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">[Diary.2008.10:07]<\/span>&#8221; &#8211; then everything I did on that date is referenced from the index views under 2008 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 07.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Another example is meetings &#8211; I write up meeting notes in my wiki with<br \/>attributes for like:<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:courier new;\">[Diary.2008.18:15]<br \/>[Customer:Random Corp]<br \/>[Meetings.Present:Dave Smith]<br \/>[Meetings.Present:Joe Bloggs]<\/p>\n<p>Thus helping me answer questions like &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that mentioned in a meeting with Dave back in November?&#8221; quickly and easily.<\/p>\n<p>The todo&#8217;s are good too.  I can use keywords like &#8220;action&#8221;, &#8220;todo&#8221;, &#8220;done&#8221;, &#8220;track&#8221; and &#8220;question&#8221; to gather items that need my attention. If I write &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">action: Send documentation to account manager<\/span>&#8220;, this will appear in the index under my actions.  These can also be nested &#8211; so I can classify actions.  e.g. &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">todo.Personal: Book next year&#8217;s holiday<\/span>&#8220;, or &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">action.Objectives:Deliver storage improvement project<\/span>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not entirely clear in on the GTD philosophy &#8211; I know a little &#8211; but this is great, it allows me to group all my meeting actions and todo&#8217;s together, review them in one go, pick off the little ones that can be cleared down easily, and then focus on the bigger ones.<\/p>\n<p>The only thing that this doesn&#8217;t really allow is setting deadlines.  But I&#8217;m sure you could use some combination of todo&#8217;s and attributes to do this.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, it&#8217;s the combination of a page hierarchy (as in a standard Wiki), todos, and attributes, that make this tool powerful and flexible. You can really customise it to how you want to work!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, these&#8217;s a full search facililty, as well as the ability to produce lists of backlinks, rename pages while keeping WikiWords consistent, and you can do neat things like add little icons to your<br \/>hierarchy of pages.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit clunky at first but worth persevering with &#8211; it really has become my second brain (and it&#8217;s backed up to a memory stick FREQUENTLY!).  I also export all the pages to HTML every now and then so that Google Desktop can index them too.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully that&#8217;s of use to someone.  Enjoy!  And if you&#8217;ve any other tips for productivity, let me know!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Recently someone asked if there was a good tool for dumping lots of stuff that was in their head in a GTD (<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Getting_Things_Done\">Getting Things Done<\/a>) manner.<\/p>\n<p>I use a tool called<a href=\"http:\/\/groups.google.com\/group\/wikidpad\/web\/home?pli=1\"> Wikidpad<\/a> for this. It&#8217;s a desktop Wiki, which enabled you to write short or long notes, and link them together in a variety of ways &#8211; in much the same way as a web-based Wiki.  But it&#8217;s not very well documented and there&#8217;s not tutorial for using it.  So here&#8217;s my own little guide to how I use it.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to cover the basics of Wikis &#8211; you can read about them elsewhere.  Wikidpad uses simple CamelCase as WikiWords that automatically become links to other pages (though you can suppress this for specified words).<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d recommend opening the help Wiki and looking at the pages TextFormatting, TodoItems and WikiDocumentAttributes as a starting point.<\/p>\n<p>For me, what really makes Wikidpad useful is its auto-indexed attributes and todo-type tags.  Not only do your pages appear in a tree showing their location within the Wiki (essentially creating folders of related information), but you can also create hierarchical attributes that are<br \/>indexed and then displayed as a tree in the &#8220;Views&#8221; section.  This is essentially an index of information that you&#8217;ve &#8220;tagged&#8221; with attributes.<\/p>\n<p>For example, I can have a &#8220;Customer&#8221; attribute.  If I put the text &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">[Customer:New Technologies Inc]<\/span>&#8221; on a page, this will create, in the index, a customer folder, containing a New Technologies Inc folder, containing all the pages with that attribute.<\/p>\n<p>This is HUGELY useful because it means I can &#8220;tag&#8221; information in a whole multitude of different ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By customer<\/li>\n<li>By any number of different references that may exist (e.g. a request for change reference).<\/li>\n<li>How&#8217;s about atrtributes by date?  I can effectively create a journal by using attributes like &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">[Diary.2008.10:07]<\/span>&#8221; &#8211; then everything I did on that date is referenced from the index views under 2008 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 07.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Another example is meetings &#8211; I write up meeting notes in my wiki with<br \/>attributes for like:<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family:courier new;\">[Diary.2008.18:15]<br \/>[Customer:Random Corp]<br \/>[Meetings.Present:Dave Smith]<br \/>[Meetings.Present:Joe Bloggs]<\/p>\n<p>Thus helping me answer questions like &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that mentioned in a meeting with Dave back in November?&#8221; quickly and easily.<\/p>\n<p>The todo&#8217;s are good too.  I can use keywords like &#8220;action&#8221;, &#8220;todo&#8221;, &#8220;done&#8221;, &#8220;track&#8221; and &#8220;question&#8221; to gather items that need my attention. If I write &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">action: Send documentation to account manager<\/span>&#8220;, this will appear in the index under my actions.  These can also be nested &#8211; so I can classify actions.  e.g. &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">todo.Personal: Book next year&#8217;s holiday<\/span>&#8220;, or &#8220;<span style=\"font-family:courier new;\">action.Objectives:Deliver storage improvement project<\/span>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not entirely clear in on the GTD philosophy &#8211; I know a little &#8211; but this is great, it allows me to group all my meeting actions and todo&#8217;s together, review them in one go, pick off the little ones that can be cleared down easily, and then focus on the bigger ones.<\/p>\n<p>The only thing that this doesn&#8217;t really allow is setting deadlines.  But I&#8217;m sure you could use some combination of todo&#8217;s and attributes to do this.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, it&#8217;s the combination of a page hierarchy (as in a standard Wiki), todos, and attributes, that make this tool powerful and flexible. You can really customise it to how you want to work!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, these&#8217;s a full search facililty, as well as the ability to produce lists of backlinks, rename pages while keeping WikiWords consistent, and you can do neat things like add little icons to your<br \/>hierarchy of pages.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit clunky at first but worth persevering with &#8211; it really has become my second brain (and it&#8217;s backed up to a memory stick FREQUENTLY!).  I also export all the pages to HTML every now and then so that Google Desktop can index them too.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully that&#8217;s of use to someone.  Enjoy!  And if you&#8217;ve any other tips for productivity, let me know!<\/p>\n",

Masses of it.  It&#8217;s awesome!  Everyday, English creatures that exist all around us that you start to notice once you get close to the ground.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Earthworms<\/span>: There are masses of them in our garden.  Hundreds&#8230;probably many thousands.  They&#8217;re brilliantly camouflaged (yes, really, they look like plant roots!), live underground, and help to break down our soil and compost.  Brilliant.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Frogs<\/span>: We don&#8217;t have a pond but we do have lots of clay-y soil and it&#8217;s moisture rich.  There&#8217;s also a large patch of our garden that hasn&#8217;t been weeded and has a thick layer of grass and weeds on it.  This provides ample cover for the little amphibians and there&#8217;s lots of them around.  Also brilliantly camouflaged, they give you a real fright when they unexpectedly hop out of the grass.  You have to be careful not to step on them at night though!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Spiders<\/span>: If you were reading last year you&#8217;ll know I love <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2007\/09\/naturewatch-fat-spider.html\">a good spider<\/a> or two!  And though we&#8217;ve moved house, we have plenty of arachnids in the new neighbourhood.  Amazing co-ordination and web building skills.  Awesome creatures.  And there&#8217;s a surprisingly large amount of them that just scuttle around on the ground too.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Bees: <\/span>I&#8217;m not a huge fan of wasps (of which we&#8217;ve not seen very many this year), but bees are more tolerable.  They seem to defy physics by flying, elegantly drifting from one flower to the next.  They seem to come from far and wide in little teams to visit our plants.  And, of course, we wouldn&#8217;t have our fruits without their pollinating.  Sadly, bees are rumoured to be in decline.  We may well be setting up a little log or something next year to encourage bees to nest in our garden.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Everything else<\/span>: There&#8217;s beetles, ants, slugs and snails, weevils, grubs, caterpillars, centipedes. Really a plethora of different tiny creatures who make up the eco-system that is our garden.  Some of them we love, some of them we hate, but they&#8217;re all important in keeping the ground workable and fertile.<\/p>\n<p>Nature is truly an awesome thing and when you get close to it you start to realise that even more.  We praise God for the amazing things that has made, the detail of each little creature and the incredibly complex way that it all works together to bring us our food.<\/p>\n",

Brilliant.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Frogs<\/span>: We don&#8217;t have a pond but we do have lots of clay-y soil and it&#8217;s moisture rich.  There&#8217;s also a large patch of our garden that hasn&#8217;t been weeded and has a thick layer of grass and weeds on it.  This provides ample cover for the little amphibians and there&#8217;s lots of them around.  Also brilliantly camouflaged, they give you a real fright when they unexpectedly hop out of the grass.  You have to be careful not to step on them at night though!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Spiders<\/span>: If you were reading last year you&#8217;ll know I love <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2007\/09\/naturewatch-fat-spider.html\">a good spider<\/a> or two!  And though we&#8217;ve moved house, we have plenty of arachnids in the new neighbourhood.  Amazing co-ordination and web building skills.  Awesome creatures.  And there&#8217;s a surprisingly large amount of them that just scuttle around on the ground too.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Bees: <\/span>I&#8217;m not a huge fan of wasps (of which we&#8217;ve not seen very many this year), but bees are more tolerable.  They seem to defy physics by flying, elegantly drifting from one flower to the next.  They seem to come from far and wide in little teams to visit our plants.  And, of course, we wouldn&#8217;t have our fruits without their pollinating.  Sadly, bees are rumoured to be in decline.  We may well be setting up a little log or something next year to encourage bees to nest in our garden.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Everything else<\/span>: There&#8217;s beetles, ants, slugs and snails, weevils, grubs, caterpillars, centipedes. Really a plethora of different tiny creatures who make up the eco-system that is our garden.  Some of them we love, some of them we hate, but they&#8217;re all important in keeping the ground workable and fertile.<\/p>\n<p>Nature is truly an awesome thing and when you get close to it you start to realise that even more.  We praise God for the amazing things that has made, the detail of each little creature and the incredibly complex way that it all works together to bring us our food.<\/p>\n",

Changing the world isn&#8217;t easy, but organisations like Tearfund, Christian Aid, and Oxfam provide plenty of good resources to help us badger big businesses, and make our views known to our MPs.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes this feels futile.  If lucky you get a standard letter or email back to your campaigning message and, though we see some token gestures to some of the issues that we raise, it&#8217;s rare that the things that we ask for are actually implemented in full.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of campaigning going on lately regarding a piece of legislation called the climate change bill.  This is going to commit our country to major reductions in carbon emissions.  I&#8217;ve written to several members of parliament and sent postcards and emails about this issue because I really believe that it&#8217;s something we need to do &#8211; and sooner rather than later.<\/p>\n<p>So I was heartened today to read this Guardian article about how, not only has the government included the full emissions reductions in the bill, but it&#8217;s decided to incorporate shipping and aviation emissions as well.  This is exactly what I and many other people have been campaigning for.<\/p>\n<p>I particularly like Thom Yorke&#8217;s encouragement that &#8220;it came about simply because hundreds of thousands of people on the ground hassled their MP, who in turn hassled the government. Amazing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So, if you care about something, find an organisation that can help you campaign about it, and get writing.  Sometimes it really does work!<\/p>\n",

If lucky you get a standard letter or email back to your campaigning message and, though we see some token gestures to some of the issues that we raise, it&#8217;s rare that the things that we ask for are actually implemented in full.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of campaigning going on lately regarding a piece of legislation called the climate change bill.  This is going to commit our country to major reductions in carbon emissions.  I&#8217;ve written to several members of parliament and sent postcards and emails about this issue because I really believe that it&#8217;s something we need to do &#8211; and sooner rather than later.<\/p>\n<p>So I was heartened today to read this Guardian article about how, not only has the government included the full emissions reductions in the bill, but it&#8217;s decided to incorporate shipping and aviation emissions as well.  This is exactly what I and many other people have been campaigning for.<\/p>\n<p>I particularly like Thom Yorke&#8217;s encouragement that &#8220;it came about simply because hundreds of thousands of people on the ground hassled their MP, who in turn hassled the government. Amazing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So, if you care about something, find an organisation that can help you campaign about it, and get writing.  Sometimes it really does work!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>I&#8217;m sure a million people have reviewed the Nintendo Wii, so my comments on the latest addition to our household will be late and fairly insignificant.  Still, having had the Wii for a while, I want to note what I think.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Gaming History and Philosophy in the Wintle Household<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Sally and I aren&#8217;t big gamers.  We have PCs and we play silly online games like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stickcricket.com\/\">Stick Cricket<\/a> (a personal favourite) and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.helicoptergame.net\/\">The Helicopter Game<\/a> but in terms of gaming devices, until early June, the most advanced thing we owned was a cheap, 2nd-hand, Nintendo 64, and three games (only two of which were worth playing (GoldenEye and MarioKart).<\/p>\n<p>The reason we own the N64 is for Multiplayer games.  We use video games as a fun way to spend time with others.<\/p>\n<p>So when I&#8217;d heard much good stuff said about the Wii from my colleagues and had had a go on one round at a friend&#8217;s house, I&#8230;well&#8230;I know I shouldn&#8217;t covet, but, let&#8217;s say, I put buying one of the consoles on my to do list.<\/p>\n<p>All I had to do was convince Sally.  Which is a long story of it&#8217;s own.<\/p>\n<p>So, shortly before our birthdays in June, we treated ourselves and, after some hunting, found a Wii to buy and bought it.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Initial Thoughts<\/span><\/p>\n<p>First reaction?  It&#8217;s a heavy little thing.  A small, elegant white box, but solid-feeling and with quite some weight to it!  But it seems well built, well packaged and it was simple enough to set up.<\/p>\n<p>The basic package included a single wireless remote, and the &#8220;Wii Sports&#8221; game.  It doesn&#8217;t have co-axial output so you need a telly with SCART or RGB inputs (we still have a big CRT TV rather than a modern LCD or Plasma screen, but we had enough SCART sockets for this not to be a problem).  The only thing that felt a bit flimsy was the remote sensor bar, which you sit on top of or below your telly.<\/p>\n<p>The remote seems pretty robust and after the initial throwing-across-the-room accidents now comes with both a handy wrist strap (that the Wii constantly tells you to use!) and a silicon &#8220;jacket&#8221; which gives fairly thick padding to further prevent danger.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the whole health-and-safety thing is a bit overdone with pages and pages of the manual given over to RSI, the dangers of waving remotes around, and how to use your Wii without damaging anyone or anything.  All done, presumably, so that Nintendo can say &#8220;we told you so&#8221; when common-sense-less people try to sue them for damages.  What a sad world we live in.  Still, I appreciate the wrist strap, which is a highly sensible addition.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Channels<\/span><\/p>\n<p>On startup the Wii does a few uninteresting things, like asking you to give it a name, and then presents you with a selection of &#8220;channels&#8221;.  These are the different things that the Wii can do, and all the channels are stored in the small amount of flash memory that the Wii has (I think this is 512MB).<\/p>\n<p>Channels are like little applications, and include a photo viewer (the Wii has an SD memory card slot for your camera or phone&#8217;s memory card to go in), settings pages, news, weather and &#8220;Mii&#8221; channel where you design your own little character with which to appear onscreen.<\/p>\n<p>You can add channels from some games and they are also downloadable if you set up a wireless internet connection.<\/p>\n<p>The only channel not stored in the Wii&#8217;s memory is the disc channel, which is where you access the games that come on DVD-like discs.<\/p>\n<p>The only fiddly thing is that the Wii needs to be left on standby to keep the weather and news up to date, which, of course, doesn&#8217;t appeal to our green sensibilities &#8211; yet they are very useful channels.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Design<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Wii is pretty family-centric, and the look and feel could be said to be childish.  Yet it manages to accomplish this with some element of style.  Yes, the Mii&#8217;s are little cartoon characters, and everything has round edges and things float and bounce around.  But things are smooth and clean, things scroll and zoom nicely, and there are certain whizzy little things that probably shouldn&#8217;t be there but are &#8211; clever touches that grown ups appreciate.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Your first Game: Wii Sports<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Wii Sports comes with the Wii and is one of the big lures. \u00a0It&#8217;s simple but makes astoundingly good use of the Wii&#8217;s remote. \u00a0Tennis is a perennial favourite. \u00a0Easy to pick up, but as you learn that you can use the remote with twist and flick to achieve subtly different shots, the pace picks up.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Bowling is a great game if you&#8217;ve got people round but only have a limited number of remotes. \u00a0Golf is great, but tricky and could do with more depth (only 9 holes which quickly go from being simple to outrageous). \u00a0Baseball divides the Wintle household, I love it, but Sally&#8217;s not a fan. \u00a0The little nuances like waggling the bat while you&#8217;re waiting at the plate are great. \u00a0Shame you don&#8217;t have control over the outfielders though &#8211; the game is probably too much left to chance.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>And then there&#8217;s boxing. \u00a0I put of doing boxing for as long as I could because I thought I&#8217;d look really stupid doing it, but it&#8217;s hugely energetic, and highly addictive. \u00a0Definitely a good way to get rid of some stress at the end of a difficult day.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Summary<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We love our Wii and it&#8217;s a big part of entertainment in our home now. \u00a0We&#8217;ve added Lego Star Wars, Mario Kart and a Wii Fit (and the barely-worth-mentioning Wii Play) to the collection and, at the moment, that&#8217;s all that we need. \u00a0The download of a web-browser channel has made it useful as well as playful. \u00a0I&#8217;ll maybe write about some of these (especially Wii Fit) in the near future.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I love the way that video games have moved on to be more interactive, and especially they way Nintendo are playing with how we interact with the small-screen.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Overall a clever, simple, addicitve, and highly entertaining toy that hasn&#8217;t failed to disappoint.<\/div>\n",

Still, having had the Wii for a while, I want to note what I think.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Gaming History and Philosophy in the Wintle Household<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Sally and I aren&#8217;t big gamers.  We have PCs and we play silly online games like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stickcricket.com\/\">Stick Cricket<\/a> (a personal favourite) and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.helicoptergame.net\/\">The Helicopter Game<\/a> but in terms of gaming devices, until early June, the most advanced thing we owned was a cheap, 2nd-hand, Nintendo 64, and three games (only two of which were worth playing (GoldenEye and MarioKart).<\/p>\n<p>The reason we own the N64 is for Multiplayer games.  We use video games as a fun way to spend time with others.<\/p>\n<p>So when I&#8217;d heard much good stuff said about the Wii from my colleagues and had had a go on one round at a friend&#8217;s house, I&#8230;well&#8230;I know I shouldn&#8217;t covet, but, let&#8217;s say, I put buying one of the consoles on my to do list.<\/p>\n<p>All I had to do was convince Sally.  Which is a long story of it&#8217;s own.<\/p>\n<p>So, shortly before our birthdays in June, we treated ourselves and, after some hunting, found a Wii to buy and bought it.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Initial Thoughts<\/span><\/p>\n<p>First reaction?  It&#8217;s a heavy little thing.  A small, elegant white box, but solid-feeling and with quite some weight to it!  But it seems well built, well packaged and it was simple enough to set up.<\/p>\n<p>The basic package included a single wireless remote, and the &#8220;Wii Sports&#8221; game.  It doesn&#8217;t have co-axial output so you need a telly with SCART or RGB inputs (we still have a big CRT TV rather than a modern LCD or Plasma screen, but we had enough SCART sockets for this not to be a problem).  The only thing that felt a bit flimsy was the remote sensor bar, which you sit on top of or below your telly.<\/p>\n<p>The remote seems pretty robust and after the initial throwing-across-the-room accidents now comes with both a handy wrist strap (that the Wii constantly tells you to use!) and a silicon &#8220;jacket&#8221; which gives fairly thick padding to further prevent danger.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the whole health-and-safety thing is a bit overdone with pages and pages of the manual given over to RSI, the dangers of waving remotes around, and how to use your Wii without damaging anyone or anything.  All done, presumably, so that Nintendo can say &#8220;we told you so&#8221; when common-sense-less people try to sue them for damages.  What a sad world we live in.  Still, I appreciate the wrist strap, which is a highly sensible addition.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Channels<\/span><\/p>\n<p>On startup the Wii does a few uninteresting things, like asking you to give it a name, and then presents you with a selection of &#8220;channels&#8221;.  These are the different things that the Wii can do, and all the channels are stored in the small amount of flash memory that the Wii has (I think this is 512MB).<\/p>\n<p>Channels are like little applications, and include a photo viewer (the Wii has an SD memory card slot for your camera or phone&#8217;s memory card to go in), settings pages, news, weather and &#8220;Mii&#8221; channel where you design your own little character with which to appear onscreen.<\/p>\n<p>You can add channels from some games and they are also downloadable if you set up a wireless internet connection.<\/p>\n<p>The only channel not stored in the Wii&#8217;s memory is the disc channel, which is where you access the games that come on DVD-like discs.<\/p>\n<p>The only fiddly thing is that the Wii needs to be left on standby to keep the weather and news up to date, which, of course, doesn&#8217;t appeal to our green sensibilities &#8211; yet they are very useful channels.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Design<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Wii is pretty family-centric, and the look and feel could be said to be childish.  Yet it manages to accomplish this with some element of style.  Yes, the Mii&#8217;s are little cartoon characters, and everything has round edges and things float and bounce around.  But things are smooth and clean, things scroll and zoom nicely, and there are certain whizzy little things that probably shouldn&#8217;t be there but are &#8211; clever touches that grown ups appreciate.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Your first Game: Wii Sports<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Wii Sports comes with the Wii and is one of the big lures. \u00a0It&#8217;s simple but makes astoundingly good use of the Wii&#8217;s remote. \u00a0Tennis is a perennial favourite. \u00a0Easy to pick up, but as you learn that you can use the remote with twist and flick to achieve subtly different shots, the pace picks up.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Bowling is a great game if you&#8217;ve got people round but only have a limited number of remotes. \u00a0Golf is great, but tricky and could do with more depth (only 9 holes which quickly go from being simple to outrageous). \u00a0Baseball divides the Wintle household, I love it, but Sally&#8217;s not a fan. \u00a0The little nuances like waggling the bat while you&#8217;re waiting at the plate are great. \u00a0Shame you don&#8217;t have control over the outfielders though &#8211; the game is probably too much left to chance.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>And then there&#8217;s boxing. \u00a0I put of doing boxing for as long as I could because I thought I&#8217;d look really stupid doing it, but it&#8217;s hugely energetic, and highly addictive. \u00a0Definitely a good way to get rid of some stress at the end of a difficult day.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Summary<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>We love our Wii and it&#8217;s a big part of entertainment in our home now. \u00a0We&#8217;ve added Lego Star Wars, Mario Kart and a Wii Fit (and the barely-worth-mentioning Wii Play) to the collection and, at the moment, that&#8217;s all that we need. \u00a0The download of a web-browser channel has made it useful as well as playful. \u00a0I&#8217;ll maybe write about some of these (especially Wii Fit) in the near future.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I love the way that video games have moved on to be more interactive, and especially they way Nintendo are playing with how we interact with the small-screen.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Overall a clever, simple, addicitve, and highly entertaining toy that hasn&#8217;t failed to disappoint.<\/div>\n",

Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes? <\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sup\"><\/span>Those who linger over wine, who go to sample bowls of mixed wine. <\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sup\"><\/span>Do not gaze at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly!<span class=\"sup\"> <\/span> In the end it bites like a snake and poisons like a viper.<span class=\"sup\"><\/span> Your eyes will see strange sights and your mind imagine confusing things.<span class=\"sup\"><\/span> You will be like one sleeping on the high seas, lying on top of the rigging.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sup\"><\/span>&#8216;They hit me,&#8217; you will say, &#8216;but I&#8217;m not hurt! They beat me, but I don&#8217;t feel it! When will I wake up so I can find another drink?&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This advice, all highly relevant in our world today, is straight from the Bible, from the book of Proverbs.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s amazing, both that wisdom from thousands of years ago is still relevant today, and that human nature has moved on so little in that time.<\/p>\n",

Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes? <\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sup\"><\/span>Those who linger over wine, who go to sample bowls of mixed wine. <\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sup\"><\/span>Do not gaze at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly!<span class=\"sup\"> <\/span> In the end it bites like a snake and poisons like a viper.<span class=\"sup\"><\/span> Your eyes will see strange sights and your mind imagine confusing things.<span class=\"sup\"><\/span> You will be like one sleeping on the high seas, lying on top of the rigging.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"sup\"><\/span>&#8216;They hit me,&#8217; you will say, &#8216;but I&#8217;m not hurt! They beat me, but I don&#8217;t feel it! When will I wake up so I can find another drink?&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This advice, all highly relevant in our world today, is straight from the Bible, from the book of Proverbs.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s amazing, both that wisdom from thousands of years ago is still relevant today, and that human nature has moved on so little in that time.<\/p>\n",

I wish.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>But I think that it&#8217;s important to promote cycling, make people realise that you don&#8217;t have to fire up your car to do that short journey. \u00a0I&#8217;m aware that not everyone can commute by bike like I can, and that if you have children or luggage then it&#8217;s not really an available option. \u00a0But there are LOTS of journeys that could be done by bike, and there are lots of good reasons to do them by bike!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>This process has been a real challenge to my faith. \u00a0Cycling isn&#8217;t the only good news I believe I have to share. \u00a0I&#8217;m willing to become renowned in my workplace for being a cyclist? \u00a0Am I willing to become renowned for being a follower of Jesus? \u00a0That&#8217;s a whole world more scary.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Somehow, talking about faith is awkward and embarassing. \u00a0Our culture isn&#8217;t one where we talk much about beliefs, especially if they are controversial. \u00a0Talking about cycling, or what music you like, or what football team you support is OK. \u00a0But I wonder what would happen if I decided that I needed to be, not a Lance Armstrong, but a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Billy_Graham\">Billy Graham<\/a>; telling people not about two-wheels, but about hope and joy and goodness. \u00a0What would the reaction be? \u00a0Would it even be acceptable? \u00a0Could I use my sports and social club to help promote a prayer group or to advertise church services and events?<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I just don&#8217;t know, and, at the moment, I don&#8217;t really know how to start finding out. \u00a0But I should take courage (ah&#8230;that&#8217;s where en<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">courage<\/span>ment comes from);\u00a0I&#8217;ve now been an evangelist, it wasn&#8217;t that scary, it got mixed reactions, but the whole cycle challenge experience has given me a new confidence to talk, not just about cycling, but about my faith too.<\/div>\n",

        "content": "<p>I don&#8217;t really like the word &#8220;Evangelist&#8221;. \u00a0It conjurs up visions of shouty men in the middle of town telling people that they&#8217;re all going to hell at the tops of their voices. \u00a0Either that or suit-wearing professional speakers who hold big Christian rallys in stadiums. \u00a0Not me at all, and, despite my strong Christian faith, I don&#8217;t consider myself much of an evangelist.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>However, the word originates in Greek and its original meaning is that of a &#8220;bringer of good news&#8221;, and the word is also used to denote someone who is enthusiastic about a cause. \u00a0And that&#8217;s what I was for a few weeks earlier this year!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>A man called <a href=\"http:\/\/getmorepeoplecycling.com\/\">Tom<\/a> launched a thing called the &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.swindoncyclechallenge.org.uk\/\">Swindon Cycle Challenge<\/a>&#8220;. \u00a0This was a friendly competition, with lots of prizes, that got companies across Swindon trying to get their staff riding bicycles. \u00a0As a slight aside, I thought that this was a GREAT way to promote cycling. \u00a0The organisation provided lots of promotional material and incentives for people, as well as having a good webstie, updated often, with associated email updates too. \u00a0They did everything but provide the bikes!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Anyway, as a member of the little sports and social committee at work I took it upon myself to promote this within my office. \u00a0I truly became a cycling evangelist!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>It was pretty hard work. \u00a0I had to do a lot of haggling and persuading. \u00a0Some people thought I was a bit weird and there were lots of excuses that people gave for not getting out and riding a mile or for 10 minutes on a bike, despite the offer of free cinema tickets, cycle accessories, and entry into prize draws for those that did!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I was even referred to as &#8220;Swindon&#8217;s answer to Lance Armstrong&#8221;. \u00a0Hah! I wish.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>But I think that it&#8217;s important to promote cycling, make people realise that you don&#8217;t have to fire up your car to do that short journey. \u00a0I&#8217;m aware that not everyone can commute by bike like I can, and that if you have children or luggage then it&#8217;s not really an available option. \u00a0But there are LOTS of journeys that could be done by bike, and there are lots of good reasons to do them by bike!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>This process has been a real challenge to my faith. \u00a0Cycling isn&#8217;t the only good news I believe I have to share. \u00a0I&#8217;m willing to become renowned in my workplace for being a cyclist? \u00a0Am I willing to become renowned for being a follower of Jesus? \u00a0That&#8217;s a whole world more scary.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Somehow, talking about faith is awkward and embarassing. \u00a0Our culture isn&#8217;t one where we talk much about beliefs, especially if they are controversial. \u00a0Talking about cycling, or what music you like, or what football team you support is OK. \u00a0But I wonder what would happen if I decided that I needed to be, not a Lance Armstrong, but a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Billy_Graham\">Billy Graham<\/a>; telling people not about two-wheels, but about hope and joy and goodness. \u00a0What would the reaction be? \u00a0Would it even be acceptable? \u00a0Could I use my sports and social club to help promote a prayer group or to advertise church services and events?<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I just don&#8217;t know, and, at the moment, I don&#8217;t really know how to start finding out. \u00a0But I should take courage (ah&#8230;that&#8217;s where en<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">courage<\/span>ment comes from);\u00a0I&#8217;ve now been an evangelist, it wasn&#8217;t that scary, it got mixed reactions, but the whole cycle challenge experience has given me a new confidence to talk, not just about cycling, but about my faith too.<\/div>\n",

                "rendered": "<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Confession<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Having finally, after many months, confessed to having a Wii and telling the world what I think about it.  It&#8217;s time for the next step of my &#8220;coming out&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>We, after a long period of searching, also bought a Wii Fit!<\/p>\n<p>If you have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about then take a look at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nintendo.com\/wiifit\">the Nintendo Site<\/a> about it.  In short, it&#8217;s a balance board.  A small and sturdy (and quite heavy) plinth that you stand on and it works out how much you weight and tracks you as you shift your centre of balance.<\/p>\n<p>They were, at the time, pretty hard to get hold of.  Yet lots of my colleagues at work were raving about them, and the thought of an interactive way to keep fit in your front room sounded pretty good.  And we figured that if the quality of the Wii itself was anything to go by, this should be another more-than-half-decent Nintendo product.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Balance Boards and Body Tests<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The reality turned out to be pretty good too.  The Balance Board is robust and accurate and easy to set up and get going.  The Wii Fit game is good too, after telling it who you are, how old you and, and a few other things (you only do this setup once), you get to do a &#8220;Body Test&#8221;, which weighs you and gives you some balance tests to do.  At the end of the test you are presented (in quite humourous fashion, with your Wii Fit Age.  This is a number between 20 and 99 that represents your &#8216;fitness&#8217;.  Sort of.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;re supposed to repeat the body test daily and the Wii Fit tracks your weight and Wii Fit Age, and you can set targets.  The little animated version of the balance board that talks you through it all, also gives you fitness tips.  These get quite dull after a while and I wish now that there was an option to turn them off.<\/p>\n<p>The Wii Fit also tracks how long you spend on it and rewards you with unlocking extra features as you use it more.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Playing!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The game then allows you to start exercising.  There are four different types of exercise:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yoga &#8211; an onscreen &#8220;instructor&#8221; shows you a pose and you follow.  The Balance Board tracks how well you&#8217;re balancing and the instructor gives you tips or encouragement in response.  At the end you are scored on how well you balanced.<\/li>\n<li>Strength Exercises &#8211; again, the onscreen instructor shows and you follow, with appropriate feedback and scores at the end.<\/li>\n<li>Balance Games &#8211; skiing, snowboarding, riding a bubble, tightrope walking and a &#8216;sitting still&#8217; game.  All good ways to fine tune control of your centre of gravity.  Thought some are much more fun than others.  Again you are scored on how you perform.<\/li>\n<li>Aerobics &#8211; well, hardly.  But you can do jogging on the spot, step classes and a kind of &#8216;boxercise&#8217; type thing.  Some of this is fun, some is pretty pointless in my opinion.  As always, you are given scores for how well you do.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s very easy to get into and the competetive element with scores and tables showing who&#8217;s the best, is a great motivator.  There are exercises in all categories that I don&#8217;t like (the bubble game and the jogging on the spot being two in particular), but I&#8217;ll happily do a bit of each.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">So much potential<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now, I think this is a good product.  BUT, what I really really wish is that it was a GREAT product.  I&#8217;m really happy with the Wii Fit, but I have a load of criticisms that could be easily fixed that would make it SO much better.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It&#8217;s annoying after a while<\/span>.  The talking instructor and animated balance board really need to go away after about 2 weeks.  They&#8217;re good for helping you in but once you know what you&#8217;re doing there really needs to be an option to turn them off.<\/li>\n<li>The competetive element is hampered by the fact that <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">only one person can play at a time<\/span>.  Things like skiing and snowboarding would be much better if you could quickly change between players.  As it is you have to navigate back out to the profile selection screen, and then back in (past the annoying talking balance board) as the next person.  A simple &#8220;Play this as a different user&#8221; option would go far!<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Wii Fit Age is a bit pointless<\/span>.  There&#8217;s one particular balance exercise that I&#8217;m no good at and which gives me an age of about 40.  All the others give me an age between 25 and 35.  But it varies so wildly that it&#8217;s meaningless, and the program&#8217;s critical comments each time I go up are&#8230;yes&#8230;annoying.  This may be related to the fact that&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It doesn&#8217;t cater well for people who are already fit<\/span>.  I expect if you&#8217;re overweight and unfit then this is a great way to ease yourself into some exercise.  But I&#8217;m about the right weight and I&#8217;m pretty healthy and fit.  Yet it demands that I set a target (lose 2lbs this week to aim for your ideal BMI (Body Mass Index), which probably isn&#8217;t really what I need.  Plus it complains if I have a big dinner and put on a couple of lbs.  Big deal.  Now shut up!!!<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It doesn&#8217;t do programs of exercises<\/span>.  I&#8217;d like it to say Monday &#8211; Yoga and Strength work.  Tuesday &#8211; some aerobics.  Wednesday &#8211; Balance Games.  Thursday Aerobics and Strength.  And so on, and to have it guide me through a program of exercies.  As it is you have to select an exercise &#8211; say, a yoga pose &#8211; do it, get scored on it, then go back to the menu and select the next thing.  Occasionally it suggests that you do a yoga pose and a strength exercise together because they complement each other, but you still have to navigate back through the menus to get to the other exercise.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>So, much as I like it, I&#8217;m looking forward to the rumoured other games that are coming out for the balance board.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s made me much fitter, but the balance games are a lot of fun and the Yoga and strength work is great for my posture and core strength, which I need for cycling.<\/p>\n<p>Sally doesn&#8217;t really like the gym, has free time after work and a lower level of fitness and it&#8217;s been a really good way for her to burn some calories and build some strength.<\/p>\n<p>Those last two paragraphs are testimony to the universal appeal of the Wii Fit.  We both get something from it.  It&#8217;s not a replacement for a gym, or for getting outdoors and doing some real exercise, but it&#8217;s a fun way to do some mild exercise.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s hope there&#8217;s a Wii Fit 2 that addresses some of my gripes and really brings the balance board into it&#8217;s own.<\/p>\n<p>Now where&#8217;s my trainers and the TV remote?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Confession<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Having finally, after many months, confessed to having a Wii and telling the world what I think about it.  It&#8217;s time for the next step of my &#8220;coming out&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>We, after a long period of searching, also bought a Wii Fit!<\/p>\n<p>If you have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about then take a look at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nintendo.com\/wiifit\">the Nintendo Site<\/a> about it.  In short, it&#8217;s a balance board.  A small and sturdy (and quite heavy) plinth that you stand on and it works out how much you weight and tracks you as you shift your centre of balance.<\/p>\n<p>They were, at the time, pretty hard to get hold of.  Yet lots of my colleagues at work were raving about them, and the thought of an interactive way to keep fit in your front room sounded pretty good.  And we figured that if the quality of the Wii itself was anything to go by, this should be another more-than-half-decent Nintendo product.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Balance Boards and Body Tests<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The reality turned out to be pretty good too.  The Balance Board is robust and accurate and easy to set up and get going.  The Wii Fit game is good too, after telling it who you are, how old you and, and a few other things (you only do this setup once), you get to do a &#8220;Body Test&#8221;, which weighs you and gives you some balance tests to do.  At the end of the test you are presented (in quite humourous fashion, with your Wii Fit Age.  This is a number between 20 and 99 that represents your &#8216;fitness&#8217;.  Sort of.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;re supposed to repeat the body test daily and the Wii Fit tracks your weight and Wii Fit Age, and you can set targets.  The little animated version of the balance board that talks you through it all, also gives you fitness tips.  These get quite dull after a while and I wish now that there was an option to turn them off.<\/p>\n<p>The Wii Fit also tracks how long you spend on it and rewards you with unlocking extra features as you use it more.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Playing!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The game then allows you to start exercising.  There are four different types of exercise:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yoga &#8211; an onscreen &#8220;instructor&#8221; shows you a pose and you follow.  The Balance Board tracks how well you&#8217;re balancing and the instructor gives you tips or encouragement in response.  At the end you are scored on how well you balanced.<\/li>\n<li>Strength Exercises &#8211; again, the onscreen instructor shows and you follow, with appropriate feedback and scores at the end.<\/li>\n<li>Balance Games &#8211; skiing, snowboarding, riding a bubble, tightrope walking and a &#8216;sitting still&#8217; game.  All good ways to fine tune control of your centre of gravity.  Thought some are much more fun than others.  Again you are scored on how you perform.<\/li>\n<li>Aerobics &#8211; well, hardly.  But you can do jogging on the spot, step classes and a kind of &#8216;boxercise&#8217; type thing.  Some of this is fun, some is pretty pointless in my opinion.  As always, you are given scores for how well you do.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s very easy to get into and the competetive element with scores and tables showing who&#8217;s the best, is a great motivator.  There are exercises in all categories that I don&#8217;t like (the bubble game and the jogging on the spot being two in particular), but I&#8217;ll happily do a bit of each.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">So much potential<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now, I think this is a good product.  BUT, what I really really wish is that it was a GREAT product.  I&#8217;m really happy with the Wii Fit, but I have a load of criticisms that could be easily fixed that would make it SO much better.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It&#8217;s annoying after a while<\/span>.  The talking instructor and animated balance board really need to go away after about 2 weeks.  They&#8217;re good for helping you in but once you know what you&#8217;re doing there really needs to be an option to turn them off.<\/li>\n<li>The competetive element is hampered by the fact that <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">only one person can play at a time<\/span>.  Things like skiing and snowboarding would be much better if you could quickly change between players.  As it is you have to navigate back out to the profile selection screen, and then back in (past the annoying talking balance board) as the next person.  A simple &#8220;Play this as a different user&#8221; option would go far!<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Wii Fit Age is a bit pointless<\/span>.  There&#8217;s one particular balance exercise that I&#8217;m no good at and which gives me an age of about 40.  All the others give me an age between 25 and 35.  But it varies so wildly that it&#8217;s meaningless, and the program&#8217;s critical comments each time I go up are&#8230;yes&#8230;annoying.  This may be related to the fact that&#8230;<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It doesn&#8217;t cater well for people who are already fit<\/span>.  I expect if you&#8217;re overweight and unfit then this is a great way to ease yourself into some exercise.  But I&#8217;m about the right weight and I&#8217;m pretty healthy and fit.  Yet it demands that I set a target (lose 2lbs this week to aim for your ideal BMI (Body Mass Index), which probably isn&#8217;t really what I need.  Plus it complains if I have a big dinner and put on a couple of lbs.  Big deal.  Now shut up!!!<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It doesn&#8217;t do programs of exercises<\/span>.  I&#8217;d like it to say Monday &#8211; Yoga and Strength work.  Tuesday &#8211; some aerobics.  Wednesday &#8211; Balance Games.  Thursday Aerobics and Strength.  And so on, and to have it guide me through a program of exercies.  As it is you have to select an exercise &#8211; say, a yoga pose &#8211; do it, get scored on it, then go back to the menu and select the next thing.  Occasionally it suggests that you do a yoga pose and a strength exercise together because they complement each other, but you still have to navigate back through the menus to get to the other exercise.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>So, much as I like it, I&#8217;m looking forward to the rumoured other games that are coming out for the balance board.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s made me much fitter, but the balance games are a lot of fun and the Yoga and strength work is great for my posture and core strength, which I need for cycling.<\/p>\n<p>Sally doesn&#8217;t really like the gym, has free time after work and a lower level of fitness and it&#8217;s been a really good way for her to burn some calories and build some strength.<\/p>\n<p>Those last two paragraphs are testimony to the universal appeal of the Wii Fit.  We both get something from it.  It&#8217;s not a replacement for a gym, or for getting outdoors and doing some real exercise, but it&#8217;s a fun way to do some mild exercise.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s hope there&#8217;s a Wii Fit 2 that addresses some of my gripes and really brings the balance board into it&#8217;s own.<\/p>\n<p>Now where&#8217;s my trainers and the TV remote?<\/p>\n",

So we&#8217;ve not been at home much.  Weekday evenings have been busy as well.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s been going on:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Getting rid of the rats<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We finally think we&#8217;ve tackled the rat problem.  A while ago the man from the council came out again with his boss &#8211; the head of Pest Control &#8211; for a second opinion.  He worked out that the rats were probably getting in from the old &#8220;Stink Pipe&#8221;.  The vent connected to the sewer.  This isn&#8217;t used as a vent any more, as a new pipe had been put on the side of the house, but the it hasn&#8217;t been blocked up.  This gives the rats a free run from the sewer up the wall cavity to our loft.<\/p>\n<p>So, we hacked a hole in the side of the old back wall (which has been knocked through into the extension) and shoved a load of chicken wire into the cavity.  I&#8217;m sure that we have heard the odd scratching since, but there&#8217;s very little sign of rat activity anywhere and this has been the case for a while now.<\/p>\n<p>Problem is that rats have now started to take refuge in our compost bin.<\/p>\n<p>AARRGRGHHH!!!!<\/p>\n<p>In the mean time the last one to die has stopped smelling and we now have a plague of flies again.  Hopefully out last!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Ikea<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also been having furniture fun.  Try to follow this.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re borrowing some furniture from my sister, who is waiting to sell a house so that she can buy a house.  When she moves in to the new, bigger house we can give her &#8220;loaned&#8221; furniture back.  At that point we&#8217;ll need basically a whole bedroom suite, including a bed and wardrobes.  We&#8217;d also promised a sofa to a friend of ours in Bristol.  So whenever we were going to go to Ikea (in Bristol) to buy the bedroom furniture, we were going to hire a van and take the sofa on the same trip.<\/p>\n<p>However, we found the ideal piece of furniture to replace the sofa in a sale.  So we bought that and had to expedite the sofa-taking trip.  As we had the van we figured we may as well pop to Ikea as well.<\/p>\n<p>Now, our last experience of Ikea was not good.  I mean NOT good.  It was horrible and we got only about half of what we went for.  So we were psyching ourselves up for this trip.<\/p>\n<p>It turned out not so bad and we got about a 90% hit rate.  Unfortunately this meant that the two main bits of furniture (bed and wardrobe) were incomplete.  We had a head- and foot-board for the bed but no sides, and the wardrobe lacks some drawer fronts.<\/p>\n<p>So on our trip round the country we stopped off at Ikea Leeds to pick up some bed sides (which were crammed into the car next to a gracious Sally for several hundred miles), but the drawer fronts aren&#8217;t due in the country at all for about 6 weeks.<\/p>\n<p>What we have learned along the way is that Ikea&#8217;s phone service is pretty good.  You can do automated stock checks and, if something&#8217;s out of stock, you can get the store to text you when it comes back in stock!  Rather clever really.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>It&#8217;s been a busy time for the Wintles!<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had numerous busy weekends, in Devon with my in-laws, on a Tour of the North (Leeds, Durham, and then back home via Cambridge and London), and we&#8217;ll be in London this coming weekend too.  So we&#8217;ve not been at home much.  Weekday evenings have been busy as well.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s been going on:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Getting rid of the rats<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We finally think we&#8217;ve tackled the rat problem.  A while ago the man from the council came out again with his boss &#8211; the head of Pest Control &#8211; for a second opinion.  He worked out that the rats were probably getting in from the old &#8220;Stink Pipe&#8221;.  The vent connected to the sewer.  This isn&#8217;t used as a vent any more, as a new pipe had been put on the side of the house, but the it hasn&#8217;t been blocked up.  This gives the rats a free run from the sewer up the wall cavity to our loft.<\/p>\n<p>So, we hacked a hole in the side of the old back wall (which has been knocked through into the extension) and shoved a load of chicken wire into the cavity.  I&#8217;m sure that we have heard the odd scratching since, but there&#8217;s very little sign of rat activity anywhere and this has been the case for a while now.<\/p>\n<p>Problem is that rats have now started to take refuge in our compost bin.<\/p>\n<p>AARRGRGHHH!!!!<\/p>\n<p>In the mean time the last one to die has stopped smelling and we now have a plague of flies again.  Hopefully out last!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Ikea<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also been having furniture fun.  Try to follow this.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re borrowing some furniture from my sister, who is waiting to sell a house so that she can buy a house.  When she moves in to the new, bigger house we can give her &#8220;loaned&#8221; furniture back.  At that point we&#8217;ll need basically a whole bedroom suite, including a bed and wardrobes.  We&#8217;d also promised a sofa to a friend of ours in Bristol.  So whenever we were going to go to Ikea (in Bristol) to buy the bedroom furniture, we were going to hire a van and take the sofa on the same trip.<\/p>\n<p>However, we found the ideal piece of furniture to replace the sofa in a sale.  So we bought that and had to expedite the sofa-taking trip.  As we had the van we figured we may as well pop to Ikea as well.<\/p>\n<p>Now, our last experience of Ikea was not good.  I mean NOT good.  It was horrible and we got only about half of what we went for.  So we were psyching ourselves up for this trip.<\/p>\n<p>It turned out not so bad and we got about a 90% hit rate.  Unfortunately this meant that the two main bits of furniture (bed and wardrobe) were incomplete.  We had a head- and foot-board for the bed but no sides, and the wardrobe lacks some drawer fronts.<\/p>\n<p>So on our trip round the country we stopped off at Ikea Leeds to pick up some bed sides (which were crammed into the car next to a gracious Sally for several hundred miles), but the drawer fronts aren&#8217;t due in the country at all for about 6 weeks.<\/p>\n<p>What we have learned along the way is that Ikea&#8217;s phone service is pretty good.  You can do automated stock checks and, if something&#8217;s out of stock, you can get the store to text you when it comes back in stock!  Rather clever really.<\/p>\n",
