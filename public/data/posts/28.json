I must have written it prior to leaving my old job in February 2011, but it says last edited in September of that year.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Anyway, I didn&#8217;t publish this at the time because it didn&#8217;t seem fair to give my thoughts on a place I&#8217;d just left, and it was probably bad form to post personal emails (even highly edited ones) I&#8217;d exchanged with a colleague.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Several years have passed and enough water has gone under the bridge that I think it serves OK as an honest and slightly humorous reflection on how I felt at the time I left. I post it with apologies both to the colleague in question, and to the brilliant team of people I used to work with: this reflection does not apply to them.]<\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve really had it with my dog,&#8221; said the first guy to his neighbor. &#8220;He&#8217;ll chase anyone on a bicycle&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Hmmm, that is a problem,&#8221; said the neighbor. &#8220;What are you thinking of doing about it?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Guess the only answer is to confiscate his bike!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Aaah, cyclist humour. How very drole.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s probably become clear that I&#8217;m leaving my job and I had a vagely amusing email exchange with a cyclist colleague of mine the other day that&#8217;s worth saving &#8211; highly edited to avoid saying too much, but you&#8217;ll get the idea:<\/p>\n<p>Colleague:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230;sorry that you&#8217;ve leaving us but all the best in your new job&#8230;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Me:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Thanks, I need to find the new job first!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Colleague:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m surprised\u2026you&#8217;d never sell your current bike before buying a new one \ud83d\ude09<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Me:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>If it was a piece of junk hanging around in the garage and making me dream of a shiny new drop-bar&#8217;ed racer? I think I&#8217;d take it to the tip and save up for something new.<\/p>\n<p>The alternative being to invest in some new parts, but that&#8217;d probably end up costing more &#8211; in the short term at least.<\/p>\n<p>How far would you like to stretch this metaphor?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Colleague:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Yeah, I see where you&#8217;re going with this. Sometimes the old bike just takes up valuable space in the hall, is a trip hazard, gets oil on your trousers whenever you try to brush past it, often cutting you with its sharp rusty edges. You try to ignore it for too long, but it gets in the way of buying a new bike and the very sight of it is a call to action. So the tip it is then\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Happy shopping for the dream racer!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Me:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Hehe. Yup, that&#8217;s about it. It&#8217;s sad &#8211; it served me well for many years. Perhaps someone else with more patience than I can make it roadworthy again and get good use from it, but as for me, I need something new.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\" style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;\">sorry that you&#8217;ve leaving us but all the best in your new job<\/span>&#8230;sorry that you&#8217;ve leaving us but all the best in your new job&#8230;<\/div>\n",

                "rendered": "<p><em>[Note: I just found this sat in my drafts. For some reason I bailed out of posting it when I wrote it back in November 2011. I don&#8217;t know why. To my knowledge, I&#8217;ve not cycled this roundabout since &#8211; and it&#8217;s still a bit scary to drive!]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Those who follow me on Twitter, or who have been reading for a while, may know I go by the alias &#8220;magicroundabout&#8221; sometimes. This is a name I acquired long ago, for good reason at the time, and it&#8217;s stuck.<\/p>\n<p>I chose the name, not after the children&#8217;s cartoon, but after the junction in my home town, and current place of residence: Swindon. If you&#8217;re not familiar with the junction perhaps a video demonstrates best:<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/kiZtGSwv1no?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Now, the Magic Roundabout has a bad reputation. &#8220;Complicated&#8221;, \u00a0&#8220;scary&#8221;, &#8220;designed by traffic planners in the 70&#8217;s while on acid&#8221; are all things you&#8217;ll commonly hear. \u00a0But it&#8217;s actually really good and I&#8217;ve never felt unsafe in all my hundreds and thousands of crossings on it.<\/p>\n<p>No.<\/p>\n<p>The real danger is almost at the end of my road: Bruce Street Bridges. \u00a0Where I just suffered my second &#8220;assassination\u00a0attempt&#8221; (to coin a phrase from <a href=\"http:\/\/karlmccracken.sweat365.com\/\">Karl<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Take a look on <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.co.uk\/?ll=51.568504,-1.801468&amp;spn=0.002331,0.006539&amp;hnear=Swindon+SN2+2HG,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=h&amp;z=18&amp;vpsrc=6\">Google Maps<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve now TWICE had drivers charge at me whilst cycling this roundabout. \u00a0I think today&#8217;s was a low-sunlight-induced &#8220;Sorry Mate I Didn&#8217;t See You&#8221;, but my opinion would be that if the sun&#8217;s in your eyes you slow down and look twice. And then look again! Not speed up!<\/p>\n<p>The previous incident had no such excuse.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fine. But finding this junction increasingly dangerous, even in a car. \u00a0More and more people coast towards the give way lines, stopping is the second thing on their mind. \u00a0I confess, I&#8217;m probably guilty too.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there&#8217;s never any excuse for bad driving, but I think bad driving is encouraged by the design of the junction:<\/p>\n<p>1) It&#8217;s really busy but I don&#8217;t think it has an even-enough flow of traffic. \u00a0There are places where, at peak times, it&#8217;s impossible to join the flow of traffic because it&#8217;s all coming from one side.<\/p>\n<p>2) I think there&#8217;s too many lanes. Here&#8217;s an image of the approach to the location of my first assassination attempt (<a title=\"Bruce Street Bridges on Google Street View\" href=\"http:\/\/g.co\/maps\/5uz58\">explore for yourself<\/a>). There&#8217;s three lanes here on the approach from the left, and visibility approaching the roundabout from that direction is poor &#8211; people in the second and third lanes won&#8217;t be able to see much of what&#8217;s coming (but still want to coast in order to join the traffic flow).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/bruce-street.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1252\" title=\"bruce-street\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/bruce-street-1024x585.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/bruce-street-1024x585.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/bruce-street-300x171.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/bruce-street-150x85.png 150w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/bruce-street.png 1218w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>3) Because it&#8217;s a complicated junction there&#8217;s also lots of street furniture. That big sign on the left is important, but probably hinders visibility too.<\/p>\n<p>4) It&#8217;s non-standard. \u00a0Standard two-lane approach to a roundabout is: left lane for turning left or straight on; right lane for turning right or straight on (<a title=\"Highway Code Roundabout Rules\" href=\"http:\/\/www.direct.gov.uk\/en\/TravelAndTransport\/Highwaycode\/DG_070338\">Rule 186!<\/a>). But most of the roundabouts here have non-standard approaches. \u00a0Three lanes, or left-lane only for turning left. It causes lots of confusion and last-minute lane-changes.<\/p>\n<p>5) Cycle\/pedestrian infrastructure exists, but is incomplete. There are toucan and pedestrian paths and crossings, but they seem to only cover 3\/4 of the junction. And it certainly feels like pedestrians and cyclists are impeded and low priority. I guess they&#8217;ve made it as safe as they can given it&#8217;s awkward, under-the-railway location and the busy-ness of the place.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s definitely driving issues too though. These aren&#8217;t huge roundabouts, you should be able to safely cycle them. But actually, I feel unsafe in a CAR on this junction. \u00a0I often find myself in a situation where I&#8217;m on the roundabout and cars are coasting towards me not looking like they&#8217;re going to stop. I slow down. They slow down but still don&#8217;t look like they want to stop. I slow down more. \u00a0 I even got honked for doing this one day, like my own caution was causing an issue to the person whose place it was to give way.<\/p>\n<p>This morning, that stuff, combined with some hideous overtaking didn&#8217;t make my first bike ride in a week particularly pleasant.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve debriefed with Sally. I&#8217;m not cycling Bruce Street again. My life is too precious. I&#8217;ll stop and use the half-baked pedestrian\/shared infrastructure. \u00a0Cycling feels dangerous. But I know that risks to my health are greater if I DON&#8217;T cycle. Especially now I&#8217;m a work-from-home freelancer.<\/p>\n<p>There are<a title=\"Plans for Great Western Way Improvements\" href=\"http:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/cd\/cd-consultations\/cd-consultations-current\/Documents\/greatwesternwayhighwayimprovements.pdf\"> plans to improve Great Western Way from Bruce Street right through to Transfer Bridges (PDF)<\/a>. I&#8217;ve not made it along to the exhibitions about this. But a quick scan of the plans makes me thing that they&#8217;ll fix some things, and break others. I guess there&#8217;s no silver bullet for a complex and busy junction like this.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><em>[Note: I just found this sat in my drafts. For some reason I bailed out of posting it when I wrote it back in November 2011. I don&#8217;t know why. To my knowledge, I&#8217;ve not cycled this roundabout since &#8211; and it&#8217;s still a bit scary to drive!]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Those who follow me on Twitter, or who have been reading for a while, may know I go by the alias &#8220;magicroundabout&#8221; sometimes. This is a name I acquired long ago, for good reason at the time, and it&#8217;s stuck.<\/p>\n<p>I chose the name, not after the children&#8217;s cartoon, but after the junction in my home town, and current place of residence: Swindon. If you&#8217;re not familiar with the junction perhaps a video demonstrates best:<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/kiZtGSwv1no?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Now, the Magic Roundabout has a bad reputation. &#8220;Complicated&#8221;, \u00a0&#8220;scary&#8221;, &#8220;designed by traffic planners in the 70&#8217;s while on acid&#8221; are all things you&#8217;ll commonly hear. \u00a0But it&#8217;s actually really good and I&#8217;ve never felt unsafe in all my hundreds and thousands of crossings on it.<\/p>\n<p>No.<\/p>\n<p>The real danger is almost at the end of my road: Bruce Street Bridges. \u00a0Where I just suffered my second &#8220;assassination\u00a0attempt&#8221; (to coin a phrase from <a href=\"http:\/\/karlmccracken.sweat365.com\/\">Karl<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Take a look on <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.co.uk\/?ll=51.568504,-1.801468&amp;spn=0.002331,0.006539&amp;hnear=Swindon+SN2+2HG,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=h&amp;z=18&amp;vpsrc=6\">Google Maps<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve now TWICE had drivers charge at me whilst cycling this roundabout. \u00a0I think today&#8217;s was a low-sunlight-induced &#8220;Sorry Mate I Didn&#8217;t See You&#8221;, but my opinion would be that if the sun&#8217;s in your eyes you slow down and look twice. And then look again! Not speed up!<\/p>\n<p>The previous incident had no such excuse.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fine. But finding this junction increasingly dangerous, even in a car. \u00a0More and more people coast towards the give way lines, stopping is the second thing on their mind. \u00a0I confess, I&#8217;m probably guilty too.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there&#8217;s never any excuse for bad driving, but I think bad driving is encouraged by the design of the junction:<\/p>\n<p>1) It&#8217;s really busy but I don&#8217;t think it has an even-enough flow of traffic. \u00a0There are places where, at peak times, it&#8217;s impossible to join the flow of traffic because it&#8217;s all coming from one side.<\/p>\n<p>2) I think there&#8217;s too many lanes. Here&#8217;s an image of the approach to the location of my first assassination attempt (<a title=\"Bruce Street Bridges on Google Street View\" href=\"http:\/\/g.co\/maps\/5uz58\">explore for yourself<\/a>). There&#8217;s three lanes here on the approach from the left, and visibility approaching the roundabout from that direction is poor &#8211; people in the second and third lanes won&#8217;t be able to see much of what&#8217;s coming (but still want to coast in order to join the traffic flow).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/bruce-street.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1252\" title=\"bruce-street\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/bruce-street-1024x585.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/bruce-street-1024x585.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/bruce-street-300x171.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/bruce-street-150x85.png 150w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/bruce-street.png 1218w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>3) Because it&#8217;s a complicated junction there&#8217;s also lots of street furniture. That big sign on the left is important, but probably hinders visibility too.<\/p>\n<p>4) It&#8217;s non-standard. \u00a0Standard two-lane approach to a roundabout is: left lane for turning left or straight on; right lane for turning right or straight on (<a title=\"Highway Code Roundabout Rules\" href=\"http:\/\/www.direct.gov.uk\/en\/TravelAndTransport\/Highwaycode\/DG_070338\">Rule 186!<\/a>). But most of the roundabouts here have non-standard approaches. \u00a0Three lanes, or left-lane only for turning left. It causes lots of confusion and last-minute lane-changes.<\/p>\n<p>5) Cycle\/pedestrian infrastructure exists, but is incomplete. There are toucan and pedestrian paths and crossings, but they seem to only cover 3\/4 of the junction. And it certainly feels like pedestrians and cyclists are impeded and low priority. I guess they&#8217;ve made it as safe as they can given it&#8217;s awkward, under-the-railway location and the busy-ness of the place.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s definitely driving issues too though. These aren&#8217;t huge roundabouts, you should be able to safely cycle them. But actually, I feel unsafe in a CAR on this junction. \u00a0I often find myself in a situation where I&#8217;m on the roundabout and cars are coasting towards me not looking like they&#8217;re going to stop. I slow down. They slow down but still don&#8217;t look like they want to stop. I slow down more. \u00a0 I even got honked for doing this one day, like my own caution was causing an issue to the person whose place it was to give way.<\/p>\n<p>This morning, that stuff, combined with some hideous overtaking didn&#8217;t make my first bike ride in a week particularly pleasant.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve debriefed with Sally. I&#8217;m not cycling Bruce Street again. My life is too precious. I&#8217;ll stop and use the half-baked pedestrian\/shared infrastructure. \u00a0Cycling feels dangerous. But I know that risks to my health are greater if I DON&#8217;T cycle. Especially now I&#8217;m a work-from-home freelancer.<\/p>\n<p>There are<a title=\"Plans for Great Western Way Improvements\" href=\"http:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/cd\/cd-consultations\/cd-consultations-current\/Documents\/greatwesternwayhighwayimprovements.pdf\"> plans to improve Great Western Way from Bruce Street right through to Transfer Bridges (PDF)<\/a>. I&#8217;ve not made it along to the exhibitions about this. But a quick scan of the plans makes me thing that they&#8217;ll fix some things, and break others. I guess there&#8217;s no silver bullet for a complex and busy junction like this.<\/p>\n",

Yes, yes, this is another or Ross&#8217;s grand blogging ideas that will fail spectacularly after about 3 posts, but I&#8217;ll try. \u00a0But before all of that: some history.<\/p>\n<h2>Art School<\/h2>\n<p>School was a funny time for me. I suppose I was pretty academic, and good at some stuff: maths and science in particular. But I was an introvert and didn&#8217;t really like the classroom as a place to learn.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have many strong memories of school actually, but there were some particularly bad English and music classes that stand out.<\/p>\n<p>And art. I hated art. I remember crying over art homework.<\/p>\n<p>But actually, I liked drawing. In later school years, in design and technology, we got to to technical drawing. Drawing boards, set squares, rulers, pens, and H pencils (not B pencils, they left too much of a mark). Orthographic projections, oblique projections, perspective, hatching, scales, and mm-perfect accuracy. I loved it!<\/p>\n<p>And I remember my final GCSE art teacher. He embraced this and got me doing final projects with lots of detail, and using the tools I had bought for design and tech. He was brilliant, and helped me to a C grade and some drawing I was proud of.<\/p>\n<p>But art wasn&#8217;t my thing.<\/p>\n<h2>An aside: guitars<\/h2>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t musical at school either. Or at home.<\/p>\n<p>We had a piano at home and my parents helped me have cornet lessons, but it didn&#8217;t last long.<\/p>\n<p>At university I got into listening to music, but how it was made was a pretty mysterious thing.<\/p>\n<p>Soon after graduation, I had this odd moment where I decided that, if I put my mind to it and worked hard, I could do anything. So I bought a guitar and a songbook.<\/p>\n<p>My patient, patient housemate I was sharing with put up with my initial playing. And I&#8217;m now a pretty competent rhythm guitarist.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1793\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1793\" style=\"width: 248px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1793 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/2012-09-05-09.06.58-1-e1403554264311-248x300.jpg\" alt=\"Ross and Isaac playing guitar\" width=\"248\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/2012-09-05-09.06.58-1-e1403554264311-248x300.jpg 248w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/2012-09-05-09.06.58-1-e1403554264311.jpg 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 248px) 100vw, 248px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1793\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pretty\u00a0competent!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>I&#8217;ve not had another &#8220;I can do anything moment&#8221;&#8230;well&#8230;perhaps&#8230;not until recently.<\/p>\n<h2>Sketching<\/h2>\n<p>I do all this web development, but I&#8217;m not a designer. I&#8217;ve tried to do design, and I&#8217;m just not a designer. I know what looks good and what doesn&#8217;t, and I understand user interaction and colour theory and grid systems and typography, but I just can&#8217;t do visual design. So it&#8217;s maybe a bit odd that when I read an article called &#8220;<a title=\"Why I Sketch Every Day - Medium\" href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@tchurch\/why-i-sketch-every-day-f5174a2b2c6e\">Why I Sketch Every Day<\/a>&#8221; I was inspired to try to take up sketching. \u00a0But actually, quotes from that article like<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);\">Learning to sketch in a meaningful way hasn\u2019t come easily to me, but it\u2019s been worth the effort many times over.&#8221;<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>and<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);\">&#8220;Sketching has made visible my thought process and has opened it up to feedback instantaneously (at least from myself.) It has made me a much more effective communicator.&#8221;<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>should get a lot of us thinking about learning to sketch. I bought a copy of <a title=\"Drawing Ideas - Amazon.com\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Drawing-Ideas-Hand-Drawn-Approach-Better\/dp\/0385344627\">Drawing Ideas<\/a> which has also been inspiring in its introductory sections. I&#8217;m pretty excited, actually, about learning to draw!<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1791\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1791\" style=\"width: 225px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1791\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/2014-06-20-08.42.08-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing Ideas book cover\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/2014-06-20-08.42.08-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/2014-06-20-08.42.08-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1791\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Drawing Ideas<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>Throwing myself at it<\/h2>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve thrown myself at this task.

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;ve decided to try and learn to sketch. And (yes, boring I know), I&#8217;m going to tell you why and to describe my thoughts as I go. Yes, yes, this is another or Ross&#8217;s grand blogging ideas that will fail spectacularly after about 3 posts, but I&#8217;ll try. \u00a0But before all of that: some history.<\/p>\n<h2>Art School<\/h2>\n<p>School was a funny time for me. I suppose I was pretty academic, and good at some stuff: maths and science in particular. But I was an introvert and didn&#8217;t really like the classroom as a place to learn.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have many strong memories of school actually, but there were some particularly bad English and music classes that stand out.<\/p>\n<p>And art. I hated art. I remember crying over art homework.<\/p>\n<p>But actually, I liked drawing. In later school years, in design and technology, we got to to technical drawing. Drawing boards, set squares, rulers, pens, and H pencils (not B pencils, they left too much of a mark). Orthographic projections, oblique projections, perspective, hatching, scales, and mm-perfect accuracy. I loved it!<\/p>\n<p>And I remember my final GCSE art teacher. He embraced this and got me doing final projects with lots of detail, and using the tools I had bought for design and tech. He was brilliant, and helped me to a C grade and some drawing I was proud of.<\/p>\n<p>But art wasn&#8217;t my thing.<\/p>\n<h2>An aside: guitars<\/h2>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t musical at school either. Or at home.<\/p>\n<p>We had a piano at home and my parents helped me have cornet lessons, but it didn&#8217;t last long.<\/p>\n<p>At university I got into listening to music, but how it was made was a pretty mysterious thing.<\/p>\n<p>Soon after graduation, I had this odd moment where I decided that, if I put my mind to it and worked hard, I could do anything. So I bought a guitar and a songbook.<\/p>\n<p>My patient, patient housemate I was sharing with put up with my initial playing. And I&#8217;m now a pretty competent rhythm guitarist.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1793\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1793\" style=\"width: 248px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1793 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/2012-09-05-09.06.58-1-e1403554264311-248x300.jpg\" alt=\"Ross and Isaac playing guitar\" width=\"248\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/2012-09-05-09.06.58-1-e1403554264311-248x300.jpg 248w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/2012-09-05-09.06.58-1-e1403554264311.jpg 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 248px) 100vw, 248px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1793\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pretty\u00a0competent!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>I&#8217;ve not had another &#8220;I can do anything moment&#8221;&#8230;well&#8230;perhaps&#8230;not until recently.<\/p>\n<h2>Sketching<\/h2>\n<p>I do all this web development, but I&#8217;m not a designer. I&#8217;ve tried to do design, and I&#8217;m just not a designer. I know what looks good and what doesn&#8217;t, and I understand user interaction and colour theory and grid systems and typography, but I just can&#8217;t do visual design. So it&#8217;s maybe a bit odd that when I read an article called &#8220;<a title=\"Why I Sketch Every Day - Medium\" href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@tchurch\/why-i-sketch-every-day-f5174a2b2c6e\">Why I Sketch Every Day<\/a>&#8221; I was inspired to try to take up sketching. \u00a0But actually, quotes from that article like<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);\">Learning to sketch in a meaningful way hasn\u2019t come easily to me, but it\u2019s been worth the effort many times over.&#8221;<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>and<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);\">&#8220;Sketching has made visible my thought process and has opened it up to feedback instantaneously (at least from myself.) It has made me a much more effective communicator.&#8221;<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>should get a lot of us thinking about learning to sketch. I bought a copy of <a title=\"Drawing Ideas - Amazon.com\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Drawing-Ideas-Hand-Drawn-Approach-Better\/dp\/0385344627\">Drawing Ideas<\/a> which has also been inspiring in its introductory sections. I&#8217;m pretty excited, actually, about learning to draw!<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1791\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1791\" style=\"width: 225px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1791\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/2014-06-20-08.42.08-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing Ideas book cover\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/2014-06-20-08.42.08-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/2014-06-20-08.42.08-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1791\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Drawing Ideas<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>Throwing myself at it<\/h2>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve thrown myself at this task.

I&#8217;ve been kitting myself up with some nice stationary as inspiration (new toys!!!) and I&#8217;ll be trying to document my learning process and thoughts as I go.<\/p>\n<p>Look out for Tweets, photos of kit and sketches, and more posts as we go.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and some of my sketching might have another purpose too. \u00a0Watch out for that!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>I don&#8217;t write much about parenting and Isaac. This isn&#8217;t a parenting blog. But something has happened recently which has been quite monumental and I think it&#8217;s worth writing about.<\/p>\n<h2>Background<\/h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s a bit of background needed here.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing is that we&#8217;ve taken an approach to parenting that fits a lot of the criteria of an approach called &#8220;Attachment Parenting&#8221;. Attachment parenting is more of a philosophy than a set of rules but is generally seen to include practical things such as breastfeeding, co-sleeping, baby wearing, baby-led weaning and then in general giving your child a whole lot of respect and choice.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve done a lot of these &#8211; some to more of a degree than others. Plus we&#8217;ve had the enormous privilege of Sally taking a long maternity and then working part time, and me taking half a day a week to look after Isaac, as well as working from home and so generally being around a lot.<\/p>\n<p>Other practical out-workings of this approach for us have been things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Isaac doesn&#8217;t really have a comforter: he doesn&#8217;t have a dummy (we tried! he hated it), or suck his thumb. He&#8217;s had a cuddly toy dog which has worked quite well, and more recently has gone to sleep holding toy trains.<\/li>\n<li>Isaac gets around under his own steam&#8230;a LOT! He&#8217;s not spent much time in a buggy at all. Isaac has mostly preferred walking or being carried in a sling, and we&#8217;ve all enjoyed that! (Of course, he loves going on a bike too! Hooray!)<\/li>\n<li>We try hard not to use external motivations to get Isaac to do things. We don&#8217;t use rewards such as sticker charts, to the extent that when we took Isaac to the dentist and the dentist gave him a sticker for &#8220;being good&#8221;, he was totally baffled.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>(I want, at this point, to point out that these are just statements of what we&#8217;ve done. I make no moral judgements. It&#8217;s the path we&#8217;ve chosen, it&#8217;s been flippin&#8217; hard at times, and there are somethings that I wish we had done, or that had just been, different. \u00a0If you don&#8217;t subscribe to the attachment parenting philosophy then that&#8217;s fine, there have, in fact, been times when I&#8217;ve wanted to utterly reject it too! But it&#8217;s the path that we&#8217;ve chosen.)<\/p>\n<p>And (and I&#8217;m not sure if this is related to parenting style or not) we&#8217;ve had real sleep issues.<\/p>\n<p>And, more recently, Isaac has become more and more attached to and demanding of his mum at bedtime and first thing in the morning. \u00a0With any requests to &#8220;go to sleep with Daddy?&#8221;, or &#8220;go downstairs with Daddy?&#8221; met with quite fierce protestations and cries of &#8220;Want mummy. Want MUMMY!! \u00a0WANT HER!!!!&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Toddler says &#8220;NO&#8221;!<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve found this day-by-day rejection of my presence and involvement highly stressful and emotional. \u00a0I&#8217;d already conceded that I wasn&#8217;t wanted overnight and I was fairly determined not to give in over being involved at morning and bedtime. \u00a0And this led to mornings and bedtimes being emotional and stressful for all of us as Isaac and I had our little stand-off arguments about whether or not I was going to be involved, hoping that he would &#8220;learn&#8221; something eventually.<\/p>\n<h2>Letting Go<\/h2>\n<p>After one particularly traumatic bedtime which I suppose represented the peak of frustration for all of us, I gave in. I would ask if I could be involved, but if he wanted mummy, I wouldn&#8217;t fight, and mummy would just have to get involved and take over at that point.<\/p>\n<p>I felt pretty rubbish about this. I felt like I&#8217;d lost a battle with my 2.5 year old son. \u00a0I felt incompetent. I felt like I&#8217;d let myself and Sally down, and I wondered what we&#8217;d done wrong to get into that situation.<\/p>\n<h2>Transformation<\/h2>\n<p>That was, what, two weeks ago?<\/p>\n<p>Let me just tell you what happened tonight. \u00a0Sally went out for the evening and I put Isaac to sleep. \u00a0In fact, this is the third night in a row that I&#8217;ve put Isaac to sleep.<\/p>\n<p>Let me tell you what else. \u00a0Isaac LOVES spending time with me. \u00a0He asks for me to be involved in things, requests my presence at or help with activities. Yes, he did these things before, but there has been a marked increase in his desire to spend time with his daddy. He even bashed his head today and rejected Sally&#8217;s comfort and requested mine.<\/p>\n<p>It turns out that me fighting with him, trying to mould him to my own expectations and desires, trying to get him to spend time with me, was actually the cause of him rejecting me.<\/p>\n<p>In hindsight, and from his point of view, this makes complete sense. I was making unnecessary demands of him, and blowing into something between a mild strop and a complete rage when he stated that he wanted something else. He didn&#8217;t want to spend time with me because, frankly, I was a grumpy bully.<\/p>\n<p>It sounds bonkers, but the way to get Isaac to do what I wanted him to do, was to let him do the thing that he wanted to do.<\/p>\n<h2>Sleep<\/h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ll come back to our other big struggle &#8211; sleep &#8211; in a minute. \u00a0First a quick-but-relevant aside.<\/p>\n<p>Sally follows and reads articles by lots of people who are proponents of the attachment parenting philosophy. \u00a0One of these people, who Sally raves about, is &#8220;<a title=\"Lulastic and the Hippy Shake\" href=\"http:\/\/lulastic.co.uk\/\">Lulastic<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p>A few days ago Lulastic posted an article about <a title=\"Attachment parenting and good mental health\" href=\"http:\/\/lulastic.co.uk\/parenting\/attachment-parenting-cult-motherhood-world-change\/\">Parenting and Mental Health<\/a>. I was intrigued by it, probably mostly because I desperately need to be better at looking after myself, which the article talks about. But also because it referenced something that was termed &#8220;co-parenting&#8221;, described as &#8220;ensuring a fair split between two parents&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Now, my experience has mostly been that attachment parenting in the early years leads to the child being very attached to the mother. \u00a0So I struggled to see how attachment parenting and co-parenting could fit: how can you share the work if the child is more attached to one parent? \u00a0You can see how that worked out in the comments on that post. \u00a0I still don&#8217;t think I have an answer, but everyone was very nice about my struggles anyway.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, what happened next was Lulastic wrote <a title=\"Could the concept of \u201cadultism\u201d transform relationships between adults and children?\" href=\"http:\/\/lulastic.co.uk\/parenting\/could-the-concept-of-adultism-transform-relationships-between-adults-and-children\/\">a post about treating children as equals<\/a>. \u00a0Something I&#8217;ve been realising more and more is needed in my parenting. It really resonated with me.<\/p>\n<p>She then wrote <a title=\"A day in the life of a family challenging adultism\" href=\"http:\/\/lulastic.co.uk\/parenting\/day-life-family-challenging-adultism\/\">this follow-up day-in-the-life-of article<\/a> showing how she tries to, and sometimes struggles to, treat her children as she would any adult. \u00a0And I was both surprised and proud as I read to be nodding my head thinking &#8220;we do that&#8221;, and &#8220;Isaac does that&#8221; a lot. It would seem we&#8217;re doing pretty well.<\/p>\n<p>And then I hit the bit about 8pm: &#8220;Ramona has always just asked to go to bed when she is tired \u2013 is it possibly because we have never enforced bed time? Funnily enough it is nearly always around 7:30pm these days \u2013 classic bed time!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And I swore to myself, in my head. And then I think I welled up and nearly cried.<\/p>\n<p>You see, bedtime is one of Isaac&#8217;s most vulnerable times: He&#8217;s tired; \u00a0he&#8217;s not very good at sleeping; and I don&#8217;t think he likes being left alone really.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, despite it being a time of great vulnerability, it&#8217;s been a &#8220;battle&#8221; of one form or another for as long as I can remember. It&#8217;s been a time of parent-enforced routine:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;We do bath, and then teeth, and then stories, and then prayers, and then bed.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;You MUST clean your teeth!&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;You can have THREE books. We only have three books before bed.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;We don&#8217;t take trains to bed now do we Isaac?&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I don&#8217;t swear an awful lot &#8211; this will sort of be the second time in a single blog post \u00a0&#8211; but&#8230; WHAT THE **** ARE WE DOING?!?!<\/p>\n<p>The idea that Isaac might want his own bedtime routine has never really occurred to me. Yes, when he was younger and understood less and could communicate less, a routine was helpful in getting him to bed. But he&#8217;s his own man now. He&#8217;s a little person in a big world and he wants to learn to do things himself, and make his own choices. \u00a0I&#8217;d never tell Sally what order to do things in, or how many books to read before bed. Why should I determine those things for Sally? And why should I determine them for Isaac?<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, the whole sleep problem, is because, actually, Isaac hates going to sleep and being asleep, because sleep is a parent-enforced thing &#8211; a time of day when he has relatively little choice about what happens.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, if we let go of our own pre\/misconceptions about bedtime, and sleeping and let him choose what he does and when, he&#8217;ll just get on with it himself because he knows how to sleep and he knows when he&#8217;s tired and he just doesn&#8217;t want to fight us.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Letting go&#8221; has, for me personally, been a revelation. Sally says, almost with a tear in her eye, that it&#8217;s transformed my relationship with Isaac. I don&#8217;t know what the rules are any more. Or if there are any. I&#8217;ve thrown them out and started again.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what bedtime looks like any more.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m actually hopeful that in the near future it&#8217;ll look a whole lot nicer than it does now!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I don&#8217;t write much about parenting and Isaac. This isn&#8217;t a parenting blog. But something has happened recently which has been quite monumental and I think it&#8217;s worth writing about.<\/p>\n<h2>Background<\/h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s a bit of background needed here.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing is that we&#8217;ve taken an approach to parenting that fits a lot of the criteria of an approach called &#8220;Attachment Parenting&#8221;. Attachment parenting is more of a philosophy than a set of rules but is generally seen to include practical things such as breastfeeding, co-sleeping, baby wearing, baby-led weaning and then in general giving your child a whole lot of respect and choice.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve done a lot of these &#8211; some to more of a degree than others. Plus we&#8217;ve had the enormous privilege of Sally taking a long maternity and then working part time, and me taking half a day a week to look after Isaac, as well as working from home and so generally being around a lot.<\/p>\n<p>Other practical out-workings of this approach for us have been things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Isaac doesn&#8217;t really have a comforter: he doesn&#8217;t have a dummy (we tried! he hated it), or suck his thumb. He&#8217;s had a cuddly toy dog which has worked quite well, and more recently has gone to sleep holding toy trains.<\/li>\n<li>Isaac gets around under his own steam&#8230;a LOT! He&#8217;s not spent much time in a buggy at all. Isaac has mostly preferred walking or being carried in a sling, and we&#8217;ve all enjoyed that! (Of course, he loves going on a bike too! Hooray!)<\/li>\n<li>We try hard not to use external motivations to get Isaac to do things. We don&#8217;t use rewards such as sticker charts, to the extent that when we took Isaac to the dentist and the dentist gave him a sticker for &#8220;being good&#8221;, he was totally baffled.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>(I want, at this point, to point out that these are just statements of what we&#8217;ve done. I make no moral judgements. It&#8217;s the path we&#8217;ve chosen, it&#8217;s been flippin&#8217; hard at times, and there are somethings that I wish we had done, or that had just been, different. \u00a0If you don&#8217;t subscribe to the attachment parenting philosophy then that&#8217;s fine, there have, in fact, been times when I&#8217;ve wanted to utterly reject it too! But it&#8217;s the path that we&#8217;ve chosen.)<\/p>\n<p>And (and I&#8217;m not sure if this is related to parenting style or not) we&#8217;ve had real sleep issues.<\/p>\n<p>And, more recently, Isaac has become more and more attached to and demanding of his mum at bedtime and first thing in the morning. \u00a0With any requests to &#8220;go to sleep with Daddy?&#8221;, or &#8220;go downstairs with Daddy?&#8221; met with quite fierce protestations and cries of &#8220;Want mummy. Want MUMMY!! \u00a0WANT HER!!!!&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Toddler says &#8220;NO&#8221;!<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve found this day-by-day rejection of my presence and involvement highly stressful and emotional. \u00a0I&#8217;d already conceded that I wasn&#8217;t wanted overnight and I was fairly determined not to give in over being involved at morning and bedtime. \u00a0And this led to mornings and bedtimes being emotional and stressful for all of us as Isaac and I had our little stand-off arguments about whether or not I was going to be involved, hoping that he would &#8220;learn&#8221; something eventually.<\/p>\n<h2>Letting Go<\/h2>\n<p>After one particularly traumatic bedtime which I suppose represented the peak of frustration for all of us, I gave in. I would ask if I could be involved, but if he wanted mummy, I wouldn&#8217;t fight, and mummy would just have to get involved and take over at that point.<\/p>\n<p>I felt pretty rubbish about this. I felt like I&#8217;d lost a battle with my 2.5 year old son. \u00a0I felt incompetent. I felt like I&#8217;d let myself and Sally down, and I wondered what we&#8217;d done wrong to get into that situation.<\/p>\n<h2>Transformation<\/h2>\n<p>That was, what, two weeks ago?<\/p>\n<p>Let me just tell you what happened tonight. \u00a0Sally went out for the evening and I put Isaac to sleep. \u00a0In fact, this is the third night in a row that I&#8217;ve put Isaac to sleep.<\/p>\n<p>Let me tell you what else. \u00a0Isaac LOVES spending time with me. \u00a0He asks for me to be involved in things, requests my presence at or help with activities. Yes, he did these things before, but there has been a marked increase in his desire to spend time with his daddy. He even bashed his head today and rejected Sally&#8217;s comfort and requested mine.<\/p>\n<p>It turns out that me fighting with him, trying to mould him to my own expectations and desires, trying to get him to spend time with me, was actually the cause of him rejecting me.<\/p>\n<p>In hindsight, and from his point of view, this makes complete sense. I was making unnecessary demands of him, and blowing into something between a mild strop and a complete rage when he stated that he wanted something else. He didn&#8217;t want to spend time with me because, frankly, I was a grumpy bully.<\/p>\n<p>It sounds bonkers, but the way to get Isaac to do what I wanted him to do, was to let him do the thing that he wanted to do.<\/p>\n<h2>Sleep<\/h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ll come back to our other big struggle &#8211; sleep &#8211; in a minute. \u00a0First a quick-but-relevant aside.<\/p>\n<p>Sally follows and reads articles by lots of people who are proponents of the attachment parenting philosophy. \u00a0One of these people, who Sally raves about, is &#8220;<a title=\"Lulastic and the Hippy Shake\" href=\"http:\/\/lulastic.co.uk\/\">Lulastic<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p>A few days ago Lulastic posted an article about <a title=\"Attachment parenting and good mental health\" href=\"http:\/\/lulastic.co.uk\/parenting\/attachment-parenting-cult-motherhood-world-change\/\">Parenting and Mental Health<\/a>. I was intrigued by it, probably mostly because I desperately need to be better at looking after myself, which the article talks about. But also because it referenced something that was termed &#8220;co-parenting&#8221;, described as &#8220;ensuring a fair split between two parents&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Now, my experience has mostly been that attachment parenting in the early years leads to the child being very attached to the mother. \u00a0So I struggled to see how attachment parenting and co-parenting could fit: how can you share the work if the child is more attached to one parent? \u00a0You can see how that worked out in the comments on that post. \u00a0I still don&#8217;t think I have an answer, but everyone was very nice about my struggles anyway.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, what happened next was Lulastic wrote <a title=\"Could the concept of \u201cadultism\u201d transform relationships between adults and children?\" href=\"http:\/\/lulastic.co.uk\/parenting\/could-the-concept-of-adultism-transform-relationships-between-adults-and-children\/\">a post about treating children as equals<\/a>. \u00a0Something I&#8217;ve been realising more and more is needed in my parenting. It really resonated with me.<\/p>\n<p>She then wrote <a title=\"A day in the life of a family challenging adultism\" href=\"http:\/\/lulastic.co.uk\/parenting\/day-life-family-challenging-adultism\/\">this follow-up day-in-the-life-of article<\/a> showing how she tries to, and sometimes struggles to, treat her children as she would any adult. \u00a0And I was both surprised and proud as I read to be nodding my head thinking &#8220;we do that&#8221;, and &#8220;Isaac does that&#8221; a lot. It would seem we&#8217;re doing pretty well.<\/p>\n<p>And then I hit the bit about 8pm: &#8220;Ramona has always just asked to go to bed when she is tired \u2013 is it possibly because we have never enforced bed time? Funnily enough it is nearly always around 7:30pm these days \u2013 classic bed time!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And I swore to myself, in my head. And then I think I welled up and nearly cried.<\/p>\n<p>You see, bedtime is one of Isaac&#8217;s most vulnerable times: He&#8217;s tired; \u00a0he&#8217;s not very good at sleeping; and I don&#8217;t think he likes being left alone really.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, despite it being a time of great vulnerability, it&#8217;s been a &#8220;battle&#8221; of one form or another for as long as I can remember. It&#8217;s been a time of parent-enforced routine:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;We do bath, and then teeth, and then stories, and then prayers, and then bed.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;You MUST clean your teeth!&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;You can have THREE books. We only have three books before bed.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;We don&#8217;t take trains to bed now do we Isaac?&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I don&#8217;t swear an awful lot &#8211; this will sort of be the second time in a single blog post \u00a0&#8211; but&#8230; WHAT THE **** ARE WE DOING?!?!<\/p>\n<p>The idea that Isaac might want his own bedtime routine has never really occurred to me. Yes, when he was younger and understood less and could communicate less, a routine was helpful in getting him to bed. But he&#8217;s his own man now. He&#8217;s a little person in a big world and he wants to learn to do things himself, and make his own choices. \u00a0I&#8217;d never tell Sally what order to do things in, or how many books to read before bed. Why should I determine those things for Sally? And why should I determine them for Isaac?<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, the whole sleep problem, is because, actually, Isaac hates going to sleep and being asleep, because sleep is a parent-enforced thing &#8211; a time of day when he has relatively little choice about what happens.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, if we let go of our own pre\/misconceptions about bedtime, and sleeping and let him choose what he does and when, he&#8217;ll just get on with it himself because he knows how to sleep and he knows when he&#8217;s tired and he just doesn&#8217;t want to fight us.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Letting go&#8221; has, for me personally, been a revelation. Sally says, almost with a tear in her eye, that it&#8217;s transformed my relationship with Isaac. I don&#8217;t know what the rules are any more. Or if there are any. I&#8217;ve thrown them out and started again.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what bedtime looks like any more.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m actually hopeful that in the near future it&#8217;ll look a whole lot nicer than it does now!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>My last blog post was all about how I was going to attempt 40 Acts over lent and write about it as I went.<\/p>\n<p>That kinda never happened and I got stuck at act 2.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to have a massive guilt trip about this, but it is quite a disappointment. But it&#8217;s also got me thinking about a word\/concept which keeps coming up, both in work and personal situations: &#8220;Friction&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Friction is something that I&#8217;ve come across both in website user interfaces (Facebook talk about &#8220;frictionless sharing&#8221;, for example), but also in psychology. I saw an interesting article (I don&#8217;t think it was <a title=\"How Incredibly Lazy People Can Form Productive Habits - Fast Company\" href=\"http:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3021820\/work-smart\/how-incredibly-lazy-people-can-form-productive-habits\">this one<\/a>, but it&#8217;ll do) about this recently. I use an app called &#8220;Lift&#8221; (available for <a title=\"Lift - Daily motivation - for iOS\" href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/gb\/app\/lift-daily-motivation\/id530911645?mt=8\">iOS<\/a>, <a title=\"Lift - Daily motivation - for Android\" href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.liftworldwide.lift\">Android<\/a>) to try and build positive, daily habits into my routine, and I&#8217;m astounded by how rubbish I am at doing positive, simple tasks on a daily basis. And I&#8217;m convinced that &#8220;friction&#8221; is the problem.<\/p>\n<p>In A&#8217; Level physics I learned that the <a title=\"Friction - WikiPedia\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Friction#Static_friction\">coefficient of static friction<\/a>\u00a0(the force required to get a stationary object moving) is often greater than the coefficient of dynamic friction (the force required to accelerate an already-moving object). Once moving, and object is easier to get moving more!<\/p>\n<p>I think that the same is true with people and habits.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the causes of friction that stopped me doing 40 Acts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work &#8211; and being busy and dedicated to my work<\/li>\n<li>Family &#8211; having a feisty and demanding toddler who I love to bits<\/li>\n<li>Travel &#8211; daily habits are hard to keep when you travel or go on holiday and your routines get messed up &#8211; we had a long weekend away just after starting Lent which got me off to a bad start<\/li>\n<li>Weather &#8211; sounds odd, but I think the weather, and the changing seasons, change my behaviour a lot<\/li>\n<li>Distraction &#8211; the dreaded mobile phone and all the many forms of communication that constantly seek our attention in a highly digitally-literate household<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I still have the 40 Acts emails stored up. I may, possibly, still try to work through them and write about them. \u00a0But to do so means removing, or overcoming those friction points.<\/p>\n<p>We shall see.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>My last blog post was all about how I was going to attempt 40 Acts over lent and write about it as I went.<\/p>\n<p>That kinda never happened and I got stuck at act 2.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to have a massive guilt trip about this, but it is quite a disappointment. But it&#8217;s also got me thinking about a word\/concept which keeps coming up, both in work and personal situations: &#8220;Friction&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Friction is something that I&#8217;ve come across both in website user interfaces (Facebook talk about &#8220;frictionless sharing&#8221;, for example), but also in psychology. I saw an interesting article (I don&#8217;t think it was <a title=\"How Incredibly Lazy People Can Form Productive Habits - Fast Company\" href=\"http:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3021820\/work-smart\/how-incredibly-lazy-people-can-form-productive-habits\">this one<\/a>, but it&#8217;ll do) about this recently. I use an app called &#8220;Lift&#8221; (available for <a title=\"Lift - Daily motivation - for iOS\" href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/gb\/app\/lift-daily-motivation\/id530911645?mt=8\">iOS<\/a>, <a title=\"Lift - Daily motivation - for Android\" href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.liftworldwide.lift\">Android<\/a>) to try and build positive, daily habits into my routine, and I&#8217;m astounded by how rubbish I am at doing positive, simple tasks on a daily basis. And I&#8217;m convinced that &#8220;friction&#8221; is the problem.<\/p>\n<p>In A&#8217; Level physics I learned that the <a title=\"Friction - WikiPedia\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Friction#Static_friction\">coefficient of static friction<\/a>\u00a0(the force required to get a stationary object moving) is often greater than the coefficient of dynamic friction (the force required to accelerate an already-moving object). Once moving, and object is easier to get moving more!<\/p>\n<p>I think that the same is true with people and habits.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the causes of friction that stopped me doing 40 Acts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work &#8211; and being busy and dedicated to my work<\/li>\n<li>Family &#8211; having a feisty and demanding toddler who I love to bits<\/li>\n<li>Travel &#8211; daily habits are hard to keep when you travel or go on holiday and your routines get messed up &#8211; we had a long weekend away just after starting Lent which got me off to a bad start<\/li>\n<li>Weather &#8211; sounds odd, but I think the weather, and the changing seasons, change my behaviour a lot<\/li>\n<li>Distraction &#8211; the dreaded mobile phone and all the many forms of communication that constantly seek our attention in a highly digitally-literate household<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I still have the 40 Acts emails stored up. I may, possibly, still try to work through them and write about them. \u00a0But to do so means removing, or overcoming those friction points.<\/p>\n<p>We shall see.<\/p>\n",

I can&#8217;t really escape it, and the choice of activities and tools is brilliant. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been crazy busy preparing this new website and haven&#8217;t really had to choose something to do for lent. But at some point I seem to have signed up to do Stewardship&#8217;s 40 acts, and the first of those is to create a journal. <\/p>\n<p>I figure that this blog serves that purpose, and blogging more often is also a habit I want to develop, so here we are.<br \/>\nI&#8217;m not sure if it will continue this way in public.

Proclaiming our acts from the modern-day street corner may defeat the point of lenten disciplines. But we shall see. I don&#8217;t know what the activities will be yet. <\/p>\n<p>Today I&#8217;m to write a list of things that I&#8217;m thankful for.

                "rendered": "<p>OK. Really old. And REALLY boring now. Oh, and brief disclaimer:\u00a0<em>Heck, what do I know? I&#8217;m not a politician, economist, climate scientist, or anything, I&#8217;m just a guy with a few half-baked ideas<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Labour. Well, let&#8217;s really start with the Conservatives. I&#8217;m not a fan really. Austerity possibly has some merits as a means of fixing the economy. But their constant anti-Robin-Hood, take-from-the-poor-and-give-to-the-rich kind of policies, and the constant bashing of those on benefits without understand those on benefits, is pretty shocking.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, some big Labour politicians came to Swindon today. And all I could really see (on Twitter) them talking about was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/swindonlabour\/status\/421976523688919040\">the price of energy<\/a>, and the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dempsey4labour\/status\/421945129029865472\">price of train fares<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a bit baffled by the energy thing. Energy seems to be provided by a load of companies who compete against one another for customers. And yet, they all seem to raise prices at the same times. Which seems odd. And no one really seems to be doing the under-cutting. They&#8217;re all much of a much-ness, and their prices seem to mostly be influenced by the wholesale cost of energy and the taxes and levies imposed by government. They may well make lots of profit, and that&#8217;s not great from companies that provide public services. I&#8217;m as annoyed as anyone about increasing energy company profits. But that&#8217;s what companies do.<\/p>\n<p>My question then is HOW will Labour go about freezing energy prices. Energy prices are controlled by business, not by government.<\/p>\n<p>I visited their website to find out and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/action.labour.org.uk\/page\/s\/energy-calculator\">it wasn&#8217;t massively helpful<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And anyway. There are problems with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I think global warming is real and that we should be cutting energy costs. If prices go down in real terms then won&#8217;t that discourage us from saving energy?<\/li>\n<li>I think that energy security is a much bigger issue. The cost is irrelevant if there is no supply.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;d much rather see a long-term focus on sustainability, efficiency and reduced use, and energy-security. We&#8217;d have much better control of energy prices in this country if we used less of it, and had our own clean, efficient supply with a surplus we could export. That would be good for health, prices, industry, transport, and the world at large.<\/p>\n<p>Magically fixing train fares and energy costs seem to me to be populist electioneering policies. There are bigger things we need to do that will help both of these issues in the long term. Who&#8217;s going to tackle those things for us?!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>OK. Really old. And REALLY boring now. Oh, and brief disclaimer:\u00a0<em>Heck, what do I know? I&#8217;m not a politician, economist, climate scientist, or anything, I&#8217;m just a guy with a few half-baked ideas<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Labour. Well, let&#8217;s really start with the Conservatives. I&#8217;m not a fan really. Austerity possibly has some merits as a means of fixing the economy. But their constant anti-Robin-Hood, take-from-the-poor-and-give-to-the-rich kind of policies, and the constant bashing of those on benefits without understand those on benefits, is pretty shocking.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, some big Labour politicians came to Swindon today. And all I could really see (on Twitter) them talking about was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/swindonlabour\/status\/421976523688919040\">the price of energy<\/a>, and the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dempsey4labour\/status\/421945129029865472\">price of train fares<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a bit baffled by the energy thing. Energy seems to be provided by a load of companies who compete against one another for customers. And yet, they all seem to raise prices at the same times. Which seems odd. And no one really seems to be doing the under-cutting. They&#8217;re all much of a much-ness, and their prices seem to mostly be influenced by the wholesale cost of energy and the taxes and levies imposed by government. They may well make lots of profit, and that&#8217;s not great from companies that provide public services. I&#8217;m as annoyed as anyone about increasing energy company profits. But that&#8217;s what companies do.<\/p>\n<p>My question then is HOW will Labour go about freezing energy prices. Energy prices are controlled by business, not by government.<\/p>\n<p>I visited their website to find out and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/action.labour.org.uk\/page\/s\/energy-calculator\">it wasn&#8217;t massively helpful<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And anyway. There are problems with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I think global warming is real and that we should be cutting energy costs. If prices go down in real terms then won&#8217;t that discourage us from saving energy?<\/li>\n<li>I think that energy security is a much bigger issue. The cost is irrelevant if there is no supply.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;d much rather see a long-term focus on sustainability, efficiency and reduced use, and energy-security. We&#8217;d have much better control of energy prices in this country if we used less of it, and had our own clean, efficient supply with a surplus we could export. That would be good for health, prices, industry, transport, and the world at large.<\/p>\n<p>Magically fixing train fares and energy costs seem to me to be populist electioneering policies. There are bigger things we need to do that will help both of these issues in the long term. Who&#8217;s going to tackle those things for us?!<\/p>\n",

Perhaps you should just feel fortunate that I am a person that genuinely tries to engage with the political process.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, Sally and I had an interesting conversation about the fact that The House of Lords seem to be being pretty useful at the moment. Not only are some peers\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-25671064\">getting something done<\/a>\u00a0about the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-24823829\">rubbish lobbying bill<\/a>, but they&#8217;ve also made the entirely sensible decision that\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-25648019\">it shouldn&#8217;t be against the law to be &#8220;annoying&#8221;<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>We were then discussing our dismay with the political process and the fact that it seems to be the House of Lords that are doing the sensible things right now. (Yes, I am well aware that these are just two of a multitude of things that will be passing through the Lords at the moment, I know). And we wondered whether the fact that they were unelected, and therefore not needing to engage in populist politics needed to secure their positions, that they are more likely to do things that are good for the people at large, and in the longer term.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, as @timalmond points out on Twitter:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-cards=\"hidden\" data-partner=\"tweetdeck\">\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\">@magicroundabout<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Anjelica1956\">@Anjelica1956<\/a> But unelected people also have undemocratic power that they can abuse against the people.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Tim Almond (@timalmond) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/timalmond\/statuses\/422006729786683392\">January 11, 2014<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>And he&#8217;s dead right. I&#8217;m not suggesting that a wholly unelected and undemocratic system would work either. But, I don&#8217;t know, it just seems to be bringing some sensibility to proceedings of late!<\/p>\n",

Perhaps you should just feel fortunate that I am a person that genuinely tries to engage with the political process.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, Sally and I had an interesting conversation about the fact that The House of Lords seem to be being pretty useful at the moment. Not only are some peers\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-25671064\">getting something done<\/a>\u00a0about the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-24823829\">rubbish lobbying bill<\/a>, but they&#8217;ve also made the entirely sensible decision that\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-25648019\">it shouldn&#8217;t be against the law to be &#8220;annoying&#8221;<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>We were then discussing our dismay with the political process and the fact that it seems to be the House of Lords that are doing the sensible things right now. (Yes, I am well aware that these are just two of a multitude of things that will be passing through the Lords at the moment, I know). And we wondered whether the fact that they were unelected, and therefore not needing to engage in populist politics needed to secure their positions, that they are more likely to do things that are good for the people at large, and in the longer term.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, as @timalmond points out on Twitter:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-cards=\"hidden\" data-partner=\"tweetdeck\">\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\">@magicroundabout<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Anjelica1956\">@Anjelica1956<\/a> But unelected people also have undemocratic power that they can abuse against the people.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Tim Almond (@timalmond) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/timalmond\/statuses\/422006729786683392\">January 11, 2014<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>And he&#8217;s dead right. I&#8217;m not suggesting that a wholly unelected and undemocratic system would work either. But, I don&#8217;t know, it just seems to be bringing some sensibility to proceedings of late!<\/p>\n",
