But something has unexpectedly come into my life that has been quite complicated and caused me to have to explore some new things: a pair of headphones!<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Prize Management Waffle<\/h3>\n<p>I was on a training course last week put on by one of my software suppliers, and each day there was a prize draw.  The first two days the prize was a little iPod shuffle&#8230;something I would have quite appreciated.<\/p>\n<p>But on the final day the prize was some headphones.<\/p>\n<p>To win, you had to write something about how you would use the supplier&#8217;s software to enhance your business, or something like that.  I wrote some buzz-word packed drivel about &#8220;application services&#8221; and &#8220;increased revenue&#8221; and, somehow won (as a side note, I&#8217;m slightly concerned about my ability to use management-speak!).<\/p>\n<h3>What have I won?<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-433\" title=\"Bose Headphones\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/3688579278_056052e4b2_b.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"Bose Headphones\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3688579278_056052e4b2_b.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3688579278_056052e4b2_b-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/>I resisted opening the box on the train on the way home, waiting, instead, until I got home to unbox them, plug them into my iPod, and mosey around the house with them on testing out the &#8216;phones&#8217; (that&#8217;s not in quotes &#8211; it just has two apostrophes) noise-cancelling abilities.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, these weren&#8217;t just any old headphones.  They were <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bose.co.uk\/GB\/en\/home-entertainment\/personal-audio\/headphones\/acoustic-noise-cancelling-headphones\/qc2\/index.jsp\">Bose Quiet Comfort 2, Noise-Cancelleing, over-ear headphones<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>And jolly good they were too.  But not really my thing.  I like music, and appreciate quality in products, but I&#8217;m not really into wearing big &#8220;cans&#8221; in public, and as I don&#8217;t travel much the noise-cancelling properties wouldn&#8217;t be put to much use.<\/p>\n<h3>What to do?<\/h3>\n<p>My initial thoughts were that these were probably worth about \u00a370 or \u00a380 &#8211; a search on Amazon showed them turning up second hand for around this sort of prise &#8211; and that, as I&#8217;d got them for free and didn&#8217;t really need them, I would sell them and give the proceeds to charity.<\/p>\n<p>However, after a few chats with other people who know their hi-fi gear better than I, I discovered that they were worth a whopping \u00a3250 and probably aren&#8217;t the sort of thing that you&#8217;d sell to your mates.<\/p>\n<p>So, these are for a specialist market that I couldn&#8217;t easily reach and selling them on eBay was looking like the best option.<\/p>\n<p>Did I then want to donate the whole \u00a3150 that I was likely to get for them to charity?  Well, that was a quandry, and I&#8217;ve settled on giving some away and keeping some for myself as a treat (more on thsi later).<\/p>\n<h3>eBay<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-432\" title=\"Bose Headphones with Box\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/3687771303_a3168401ac_b.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Bose Headphones with Box\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3687771303_a3168401ac_b.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3687771303_a3168401ac_b-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>I&#8217;ve never sold on eBay before.  I&#8217;ve bought a couple of things in the past, but I&#8217;m not a big user.  So I took some nice pictures on the dining room table and got cracking with adding my listing.<\/p>\n<p>Only, first, I had to check my PayPal account was still working after years of neglect.  And it was, but I needed to add a valid card and have it upgraded to a &#8220;Premier&#8221; account, which didn&#8217;t seem to cost anything but meant accepting that they would take a slice of anything paid to me.<\/p>\n<p>And then I had to have my eBay account verified.  This involved a weird disembodied voiced phoning my landline and telling me a code that had to be typed back in to the website.<\/p>\n<p>And then I had to check the postage costs.<\/p>\n<p>And I had to decide on an initial price, how many photos to upload, did I want a reserve, where could I ship to, would I offer insurance.<\/p>\n<p>Argh!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve an odd feeling that, once you&#8217;ve done this a few times, it&#8217;s easy.  But it took me most of an evening to list a single item properly.<\/p>\n<p>And it costs too.  Three photos, with a reserve price, cost around \u00a33.50 to list, and they&#8217;ll take 10% of the selling price.  And PayPay will take 2% as well, or something.  Will there be any left for me after all that effort?<\/p>\n<h3>Sitting, waiting, wishing<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s a ten-day listing, so I probably shouldn&#8217;t panic, but as yet I have no bids and an enquiry about how much it would cost to ship to Portugal.<\/p>\n<p>Is this normal?  Is my &#8220;0% positive feedback&#8221; (HEY!  I&#8217;ve never sold anything!!!) not helping?  Have I put the initial bid too high?  Should I have had a lower reserve?  Or a higher one?<\/p>\n<p>We shall wait and see.  I guess that people are bidding on items closer to ending, so next week I can expect a flurry of activity, but in the meantime all is quiet.<\/p>\n<h3>An unexpected treat<\/h3>\n<p>So I&#8217;m not ungrateful, really I&#8217;m not.  And I&#8217;m hoping to spend the proceeds on something that I would rather have won.<\/p>\n<p>Initially I was thinking of an iPod touch, but I worry that this will just make me covet a full-on, ridiculously expensive, iPhone.  If I can&#8217;t use the web broswer and apps wherever I go, is there much point in having them?  It MIGHT help consolidate my current electronic organiser with my portable media player, but I don&#8217;t know how good the organiser functions on the iPod Touch are, and internet opinion seems to be divided.<\/p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s still a possibility, but a better idea would be to upgrade my mobile to a touch-screen, smart phone of some kind.  I really dislike Nokias, can&#8217;t afford &#8211; or rather refuse to afford &#8211; Apple, and so am contemplating Google&#8217;s Android as a platform.  But at what cost I&#8217;ve yet to find out.<\/p>\n<p>So, this small, prize-winning event has unfurled a whole load of other questions and discoveries.  Who&#8217;d have thought that a bit of management speak could cause so much excitement?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I don&#8217;t mean to blow my own trumpet here&#8230;or to sound ungrateful.  But something has unexpectedly come into my life that has been quite complicated and caused me to have to explore some new things: a pair of headphones!<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Prize Management Waffle<\/h3>\n<p>I was on a training course last week put on by one of my software suppliers, and each day there was a prize draw.  The first two days the prize was a little iPod shuffle&#8230;something I would have quite appreciated.<\/p>\n<p>But on the final day the prize was some headphones.<\/p>\n<p>To win, you had to write something about how you would use the supplier&#8217;s software to enhance your business, or something like that.  I wrote some buzz-word packed drivel about &#8220;application services&#8221; and &#8220;increased revenue&#8221; and, somehow won (as a side note, I&#8217;m slightly concerned about my ability to use management-speak!).<\/p>\n<h3>What have I won?<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-433\" title=\"Bose Headphones\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/3688579278_056052e4b2_b.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"Bose Headphones\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3688579278_056052e4b2_b.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3688579278_056052e4b2_b-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/>I resisted opening the box on the train on the way home, waiting, instead, until I got home to unbox them, plug them into my iPod, and mosey around the house with them on testing out the &#8216;phones&#8217; (that&#8217;s not in quotes &#8211; it just has two apostrophes) noise-cancelling abilities.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, these weren&#8217;t just any old headphones.  They were <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bose.co.uk\/GB\/en\/home-entertainment\/personal-audio\/headphones\/acoustic-noise-cancelling-headphones\/qc2\/index.jsp\">Bose Quiet Comfort 2, Noise-Cancelleing, over-ear headphones<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>And jolly good they were too.  But not really my thing.  I like music, and appreciate quality in products, but I&#8217;m not really into wearing big &#8220;cans&#8221; in public, and as I don&#8217;t travel much the noise-cancelling properties wouldn&#8217;t be put to much use.<\/p>\n<h3>What to do?<\/h3>\n<p>My initial thoughts were that these were probably worth about \u00a370 or \u00a380 &#8211; a search on Amazon showed them turning up second hand for around this sort of prise &#8211; and that, as I&#8217;d got them for free and didn&#8217;t really need them, I would sell them and give the proceeds to charity.<\/p>\n<p>However, after a few chats with other people who know their hi-fi gear better than I, I discovered that they were worth a whopping \u00a3250 and probably aren&#8217;t the sort of thing that you&#8217;d sell to your mates.<\/p>\n<p>So, these are for a specialist market that I couldn&#8217;t easily reach and selling them on eBay was looking like the best option.<\/p>\n<p>Did I then want to donate the whole \u00a3150 that I was likely to get for them to charity?  Well, that was a quandry, and I&#8217;ve settled on giving some away and keeping some for myself as a treat (more on thsi later).<\/p>\n<h3>eBay<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-432\" title=\"Bose Headphones with Box\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/3687771303_a3168401ac_b.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Bose Headphones with Box\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3687771303_a3168401ac_b.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3687771303_a3168401ac_b-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>I&#8217;ve never sold on eBay before.  I&#8217;ve bought a couple of things in the past, but I&#8217;m not a big user.  So I took some nice pictures on the dining room table and got cracking with adding my listing.<\/p>\n<p>Only, first, I had to check my PayPal account was still working after years of neglect.  And it was, but I needed to add a valid card and have it upgraded to a &#8220;Premier&#8221; account, which didn&#8217;t seem to cost anything but meant accepting that they would take a slice of anything paid to me.<\/p>\n<p>And then I had to have my eBay account verified.  This involved a weird disembodied voiced phoning my landline and telling me a code that had to be typed back in to the website.<\/p>\n<p>And then I had to check the postage costs.<\/p>\n<p>And I had to decide on an initial price, how many photos to upload, did I want a reserve, where could I ship to, would I offer insurance.<\/p>\n<p>Argh!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve an odd feeling that, once you&#8217;ve done this a few times, it&#8217;s easy.  But it took me most of an evening to list a single item properly.<\/p>\n<p>And it costs too.  Three photos, with a reserve price, cost around \u00a33.50 to list, and they&#8217;ll take 10% of the selling price.  And PayPay will take 2% as well, or something.  Will there be any left for me after all that effort?<\/p>\n<h3>Sitting, waiting, wishing<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s a ten-day listing, so I probably shouldn&#8217;t panic, but as yet I have no bids and an enquiry about how much it would cost to ship to Portugal.<\/p>\n<p>Is this normal?  Is my &#8220;0% positive feedback&#8221; (HEY!  I&#8217;ve never sold anything!!!) not helping?  Have I put the initial bid too high?  Should I have had a lower reserve?  Or a higher one?<\/p>\n<p>We shall wait and see.  I guess that people are bidding on items closer to ending, so next week I can expect a flurry of activity, but in the meantime all is quiet.<\/p>\n<h3>An unexpected treat<\/h3>\n<p>So I&#8217;m not ungrateful, really I&#8217;m not.  And I&#8217;m hoping to spend the proceeds on something that I would rather have won.<\/p>\n<p>Initially I was thinking of an iPod touch, but I worry that this will just make me covet a full-on, ridiculously expensive, iPhone.  If I can&#8217;t use the web broswer and apps wherever I go, is there much point in having them?  It MIGHT help consolidate my current electronic organiser with my portable media player, but I don&#8217;t know how good the organiser functions on the iPod Touch are, and internet opinion seems to be divided.<\/p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s still a possibility, but a better idea would be to upgrade my mobile to a touch-screen, smart phone of some kind.  I really dislike Nokias, can&#8217;t afford &#8211; or rather refuse to afford &#8211; Apple, and so am contemplating Google&#8217;s Android as a platform.  But at what cost I&#8217;ve yet to find out.<\/p>\n<p>So, this small, prize-winning event has unfurled a whole load of other questions and discoveries.  Who&#8217;d have thought that a bit of management speak could cause so much excitement?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>What a crazy life we lead.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a few things ticking away in the background that need to be mentioned prior to what I really want to say here.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Cycle Campaigning<\/h3>\n<p>I wrote a while back about my desire to get involved in some cycle promotion and campaigning.\u00a0 I think there&#8217;s strength in numbers, so I&#8217;ve contacted our local &#8220;cycle champion&#8221; and hope to be meeting up soon to work out how I might be able to help her out.<\/p>\n<h3>Travel Plans<\/h3>\n<p>I work for a small company on a business park and the management company that run the park recently put out an invitation for representatives from each company to attend a meeting about a travel plan that thay are trying to put together.\u00a0 The basis is a travel plan is that you survey how people travel, put together a strategy for changing that, implement the strategy, re-survey to see if you&#8217;ve had an effect and then repeat.<\/p>\n<p>So I volunteered and went along.\u00a0 The travel plan is a great idea and I met some interesting people.\u00a0 I hope it will be the start of the companies on the business park coming together a bit more and I have other ideas about how this might be useful.<\/p>\n<h3>Wichelstowe<\/h3>\n<p>Worthy of a post of its own, the Wichelstowe Community Project is starting to take off, and some form of Christian worship will follow.\u00a0 The minister and her family have moved in, and we shall be helping them to get started.<\/p>\n<p>The Wichelstowe development was\/is controvertial as it&#8217;s on greenbelt land (and for a whole load of other reasons), but our view is that it&#8217;s happening, and will continue to happen, so we&#8217;re going to make the best of it by building a decent community.<\/p>\n<p>We also want to respect that the development is on greenbelt and engage with that, educating the community on what wildlife is there, how it&#8217;s being protected, how people can connect with the nature and wildlife of the area.<\/p>\n<p>This has, kind of accidentally, become part of a slightly different piece of work that lovely wife and I are doing, and so we&#8217;ve met with a man from the council who runs the &#8220;Great Western Community Forest&#8221;, and we&#8217;ve also been in contact with the Wiltshire Wildlife Trust.<\/p>\n<p>The bigger project has also bought me into contact with someone who&#8217;s responsible for developing transport strategy.<\/p>\n<h3>The Tangled Web<\/h3>\n<p>And so we find ourselves entering this crazy network of people.\u00a0 Through various diffeent entry points we&#8217;ve found that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The cycle champ knows the transport strategy people we had contact with through Wichelstowe.<\/li>\n<li>The transport strategy woman is helping out with the Travel Plan.<\/li>\n<li>The Great Western Community Forest man knows the cycle champion.<\/li>\n<li>The Wiltshire Wildlife Trust guy works closely with the Great Western Community Forest guy.<\/li>\n<li>Some of these people also know other people who&#8217;ve already been working with the Wichelstowe project.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s all a bit weird.\u00a0 It seems that a lot of our council services are run by a small bunch of very busy people.\u00a0 What&#8217;s a shame is that the council funding for sustainability projects is being cut, so most of these teams are also shrinking.<\/p>\n<p>These people need all the help they can get, and they&#8217;re involved in all sorts of things that are of interest to lovely wife and I.\u00a0 The question is, will we have time to get involved in much of what they&#8217;re doing and help them out?\u00a0 We&#8217;d certainly like to!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>Despite being a highly non-confrontational, easy-going kind of chap, who takes the middle ground with cycling, I find myself frequently at odds with lots of other cycling folks.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, I&#8217;m not a mountain biker, I&#8217;m not a long-distance tourer, I&#8217;m not a suit-wearing commuter, I&#8217;m not a triathlete. If anything I&#8217;m closest to being a roadie, yet I don&#8217;t race and I&#8217;m not in a club &#8211; heck I&#8217;ve even got a bike that&#8217;s mostly made of metal, rather than carbon fibre.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But I am highly pro-cycling, both as a form of fitness and as a form of general transport. I ride to work every day and encourage others out of their cars at every opportunity. Yet I find myself thinking what feel like &#8220;dirty thoughts&#8221;. Things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>cycling is actually quite dangerous sometimes;<\/li>\n<li>I should wear a helmet;<\/li>\n<li>commuting is a big faff;<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;d rather be seen and safe than look stylish;<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;d rather be comfortable than look cool;<\/li>\n<li>it would be easier to drive today.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been cycle commuting my 3.5 miles a day for nearly three years now, and it&#8217;s brilliant and I&#8217;d recommend it to anyone and everyone who lives close enough to their workplace to do it.<\/p>\n<p>But cycling, it turns out, is sometimes &#8211; SOMETIMES &#8211; the opposite of all the things I want it to be, and that the pro-cycling people (including myself) advertise it as being.  It&#8217;s tiring, it makes me angry, it&#8217;s complicated, it&#8217;s hampered by the weather, it&#8217;s dangerous, it&#8217;s expensive&#8230;SOMETIMES!<\/p>\n<p>Some of these things are my own fault and are due to <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/03\/11\/my-kind-of-cycling\/\">the way that I am as a cyclist<\/a>, the routes I take, the way that I am as a person. But some are, I believe facts of life as a cycle commuter.<\/p>\n<p>But commuting has got easier over time. I&#8217;ve learnt things, I&#8217;ve got more confident on the roads, I&#8217;ve established a routine, I&#8217;ve bought a better bike and decent gear.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;ve not been very good at sustaining series of posts, but I hope to run at least a few entries here detailing some of what I&#8217;ve experienced and learned. It&#8217;ll be an insight into how I organise that 7 miles a day in the saddle, in all weathers, and arrive in the office ready for a days work. And I hope it will be helpful to others.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want this all to be taken negatively, and I hope I don&#8217;t put anyone off &#8211; far from it! I hope to be real about what life on two wheels is like, and to make suggestions that will lighten the load a little.<\/p>\n<p>Controversial? Possibly. But leaving the car at home is always going to go against the grain in this day and age &#8211; perhaps I&#8217;m just used to doing things differently.<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Controversial Commute Tips &#8211; Introduction",
        "content": "<p>Despite being a highly non-confrontational, easy-going kind of chap, who takes the middle ground with cycling, I find myself frequently at odds with lots of other cycling folks.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, I&#8217;m not a mountain biker, I&#8217;m not a long-distance tourer, I&#8217;m not a suit-wearing commuter, I&#8217;m not a triathlete. If anything I&#8217;m closest to being a roadie, yet I don&#8217;t race and I&#8217;m not in a club &#8211; heck I&#8217;ve even got a bike that&#8217;s mostly made of metal, rather than carbon fibre.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But I am highly pro-cycling, both as a form of fitness and as a form of general transport. I ride to work every day and encourage others out of their cars at every opportunity. Yet I find myself thinking what feel like &#8220;dirty thoughts&#8221;. Things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>cycling is actually quite dangerous sometimes;<\/li>\n<li>I should wear a helmet;<\/li>\n<li>commuting is a big faff;<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;d rather be seen and safe than look stylish;<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;d rather be comfortable than look cool;<\/li>\n<li>it would be easier to drive today.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been cycle commuting my 3.5 miles a day for nearly three years now, and it&#8217;s brilliant and I&#8217;d recommend it to anyone and everyone who lives close enough to their workplace to do it.<\/p>\n<p>But cycling, it turns out, is sometimes &#8211; SOMETIMES &#8211; the opposite of all the things I want it to be, and that the pro-cycling people (including myself) advertise it as being.  It&#8217;s tiring, it makes me angry, it&#8217;s complicated, it&#8217;s hampered by the weather, it&#8217;s dangerous, it&#8217;s expensive&#8230;SOMETIMES!<\/p>\n<p>Some of these things are my own fault and are due to <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/03\/11\/my-kind-of-cycling\/\">the way that I am as a cyclist<\/a>, the routes I take, the way that I am as a person. But some are, I believe facts of life as a cycle commuter.<\/p>\n<p>But commuting has got easier over time. I&#8217;ve learnt things, I&#8217;ve got more confident on the roads, I&#8217;ve established a routine, I&#8217;ve bought a better bike and decent gear.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;ve not been very good at sustaining series of posts, but I hope to run at least a few entries here detailing some of what I&#8217;ve experienced and learned. It&#8217;ll be an insight into how I organise that 7 miles a day in the saddle, in all weathers, and arrive in the office ready for a days work. And I hope it will be helpful to others.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want this all to be taken negatively, and I hope I don&#8217;t put anyone off &#8211; far from it! I hope to be real about what life on two wheels is like, and to make suggestions that will lighten the load a little.<\/p>\n<p>Controversial? Possibly. But leaving the car at home is always going to go against the grain in this day and age &#8211; perhaps I&#8217;m just used to doing things differently.<\/p>\n",

Just do it!  Find a bike, leave the car at home, and ride to work.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Seriously.  If you live within about 5 miles of where you work, there&#8217;s very little excuse.  Give it a go!<\/p>\n<p>I remember my first time.  A fine, early-Autumn day, I woke up early, encouraged by a friend who consistently gets to work an hour before I do.  I shoved some clothes into my paniers, donned some stupid-looking shorts, took my shiny new Raleigh hybrid bike from the shed, and rode through town, along the old fit track (a well-used cycle route that runs alongside a dual carriageway), and arrived, quickly and easily, at the office on the edge of town.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t say it was a particularly momentous occasion, I guess it felt quite freeing not to have to use the car, but I don&#8217;t remember being that excited about it.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;d done it.  I&#8217;d shown that I could get to work on two wheels and it wasn&#8217;t difficult.  In some senses it was easier than using the car.  There were good cycle routes, and having a friend who knew the way helped.  There was really nothing not to like.<\/p>\n<p>But this tip also applies to those already commuting by bike.  Keep doing it!  One of the best ways to learn the ups and downs is to get practice and experience.  Try new routes, try someone else&#8217;s bike, try finding innovative solutions to the problems that you face as a cycle commuter.<\/p>\n<p>And if you do&#8230;let me know how it went!<\/p>\n",

Just do it!  Find a bike, leave the car at home, and ride to work.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Seriously.  If you live within about 5 miles of where you work, there&#8217;s very little excuse.  Give it a go!<\/p>\n<p>I remember my first time.  A fine, early-Autumn day, I woke up early, encouraged by a friend who consistently gets to work an hour before I do.  I shoved some clothes into my paniers, donned some stupid-looking shorts, took my shiny new Raleigh hybrid bike from the shed, and rode through town, along the old fit track (a well-used cycle route that runs alongside a dual carriageway), and arrived, quickly and easily, at the office on the edge of town.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t say it was a particularly momentous occasion, I guess it felt quite freeing not to have to use the car, but I don&#8217;t remember being that excited about it.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;d done it.  I&#8217;d shown that I could get to work on two wheels and it wasn&#8217;t difficult.  In some senses it was easier than using the car.  There were good cycle routes, and having a friend who knew the way helped.  There was really nothing not to like.<\/p>\n<p>But this tip also applies to those already commuting by bike.  Keep doing it!  One of the best ways to learn the ups and downs is to get practice and experience.  Try new routes, try someone else&#8217;s bike, try finding innovative solutions to the problems that you face as a cycle commuter.<\/p>\n<p>And if you do&#8230;let me know how it went!<\/p>\n",

Hey, I&#8217;m easing myself into it!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really just to point out that once you start cycling, you&#8217;re not alone, and there&#8217;s lots of help out there from friendly cyclists who have lots of experience.  You&#8217;re reading this, for one thing &#8211; whether or not that&#8217;s a good start I&#8217;m not sure.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s some ideas for where to get help:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local knowledge: find someone in your workplace, or neighbourhood, who cycles.  Find out from them where the cycle routes are (they&#8217;re not always obvious), which places to avoid, and what tips they have that are specific to your town, or workplace.<\/li>\n<li>Your council: though the state of the cycling infrastructure may not show it, you council almost certainly have targets for getting people to use sustainable transport and will have lots of help and resources to get you going.  Our council have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/roadstransport\/cycling.htm\">some online resources<\/a> and a great <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/swindoncycle1.pdf\">cycle routes map<\/a>, and I know the person that writes transport plans in Swindon, and she&#8217;s very helpful.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tfl.gov.uk\/cycling\">Transport for London<\/a> also have some good cycling stuff!<\/li>\n<li>Training: Some towns will have cycle training on offer.  You had driving lessons, so why not riding lessons?  I&#8217;ve not done one, but I&#8217;m certain it would be great for someone new to cycling on the road.  Could start by looking up <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ctc.org.uk\/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=5116\">CTC&#8217;s training page<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Books: Highly recommended is John Franklin&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclecraft.co.uk\/\">Cyclecraft<\/a> &#8211; a hugely respected guide to cycling safely.<\/li>\n<li>The Internet: Don&#8217;t believe everything you read, and you will come across some real cycle geeks who can identify a chain link at 50 yards and clean their spokes with cotton buds, but there&#8217;s a huge community of friendly people who are more than willing to help on the Internet.  Try the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/forums\">forums at BikeRadar<\/a> for starters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Or post a comment here, and see if I or any of my tiny readership can help.<\/p>\n",

You&#8217;re reading this, for one thing &#8211; whether or not that&#8217;s a good start I&#8217;m not sure.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s some ideas for where to get help:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local knowledge: find someone in your workplace, or neighbourhood, who cycles.  Find out from them where the cycle routes are (they&#8217;re not always obvious), which places to avoid, and what tips they have that are specific to your town, or workplace.<\/li>\n<li>Your council: though the state of the cycling infrastructure may not show it, you council almost certainly have targets for getting people to use sustainable transport and will have lots of help and resources to get you going.  Our council have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/roadstransport\/cycling.htm\">some online resources<\/a> and a great <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/swindoncycle1.pdf\">cycle routes map<\/a>, and I know the person that writes transport plans in Swindon, and she&#8217;s very helpful.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tfl.gov.uk\/cycling\">Transport for London<\/a> also have some good cycling stuff!<\/li>\n<li>Training: Some towns will have cycle training on offer.  You had driving lessons, so why not riding lessons?  I&#8217;ve not done one, but I&#8217;m certain it would be great for someone new to cycling on the road.  Could start by looking up <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ctc.org.uk\/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=5116\">CTC&#8217;s training page<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Books: Highly recommended is John Franklin&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclecraft.co.uk\/\">Cyclecraft<\/a> &#8211; a hugely respected guide to cycling safely.<\/li>\n<li>The Internet: Don&#8217;t believe everything you read, and you will come across some real cycle geeks who can identify a chain link at 50 yards and clean their spokes with cotton buds, but there&#8217;s a huge community of friendly people who are more than willing to help on the Internet.  Try the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/forums\">forums at BikeRadar<\/a> for starters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Or post a comment here, and see if I or any of my tiny readership can help.<\/p>\n",

If you can afford it, buy yourself a decent bike.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Of course, it doesn&#8217;t REALLY matter.  I&#8217;d rather you rode a knackered (but SAFE, of course) old steed than nothing at all.  But a decent, fit-for-purpose, well-maintained bike makes the whole experience so much better.<\/p>\n<p>Type of bike is, I think, important.  I KNOW that mountain bikes are cool status symbols, but you&#8217;ll mostly be riding on tarmac (unless you have, and choose to use, offroad routes), so get a bike that suited to the road &#8211; a road bike, tourer, or hybrid.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve never regretted buying a not-quite-bottom-of-the-range road bike &#8211; it&#8217;s improved my commuting experience no end.  I bought it for fitness but I love riding it now and it&#8217;s become the workhorse too.  The curved, drop handlebars allow me to get out of the wind, it&#8217;s light and fast, and it flies up hills.<\/p>\n<p>Get mudguards &#8211; you&#8217;ll be riding in the rain too right?  If you need to take luggage (future tips will show how you can reduce the need to carry stuff), then make sure you&#8217;ve got racks, or the screw holes need to attach them.<\/p>\n<p>At the very least, if you insist on using a mountain bike, get some road tyres.  A friend at work announced with great glee this week, that he&#8217;d swapped his knobbly off-road tyres for slicks and, I think the word &#8220;awesome&#8221; was used.  He pedalled, and he went somewhere &#8211; the difference was dramatic!<\/p>\n<p>If a new bike looks expensive then help might be at hand.  If your employer runs a Cycle-to-Work scheme you can get a bike to ride to work on for almost half price and with a 12-month interest free loan. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclescheme.co.uk\/\">CycleScheme Site<\/a> is pretty handy at explaining this &#8211; check it out!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>[If you haven&#8217;t already, and are wondering why my cycle commuting tips might be controversial, please read <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/13\/controversial-commute-tips-introduction\/\">the introduction!<\/a>]<\/p>\n<p>OK, now a REAL controversial tip.  If you can afford it, buy yourself a decent bike.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Of course, it doesn&#8217;t REALLY matter.  I&#8217;d rather you rode a knackered (but SAFE, of course) old steed than nothing at all.  But a decent, fit-for-purpose, well-maintained bike makes the whole experience so much better.<\/p>\n<p>Type of bike is, I think, important.  I KNOW that mountain bikes are cool status symbols, but you&#8217;ll mostly be riding on tarmac (unless you have, and choose to use, offroad routes), so get a bike that suited to the road &#8211; a road bike, tourer, or hybrid.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve never regretted buying a not-quite-bottom-of-the-range road bike &#8211; it&#8217;s improved my commuting experience no end.  I bought it for fitness but I love riding it now and it&#8217;s become the workhorse too.  The curved, drop handlebars allow me to get out of the wind, it&#8217;s light and fast, and it flies up hills.<\/p>\n<p>Get mudguards &#8211; you&#8217;ll be riding in the rain too right?  If you need to take luggage (future tips will show how you can reduce the need to carry stuff), then make sure you&#8217;ve got racks, or the screw holes need to attach them.<\/p>\n<p>At the very least, if you insist on using a mountain bike, get some road tyres.  A friend at work announced with great glee this week, that he&#8217;d swapped his knobbly off-road tyres for slicks and, I think the word &#8220;awesome&#8221; was used.  He pedalled, and he went somewhere &#8211; the difference was dramatic!<\/p>\n<p>If a new bike looks expensive then help might be at hand.  If your employer runs a Cycle-to-Work scheme you can get a bike to ride to work on for almost half price and with a 12-month interest free loan. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclescheme.co.uk\/\">CycleScheme Site<\/a> is pretty handy at explaining this &#8211; check it out!<\/p>\n",

even though it&#8217;s a Walkman-branded phone, it&#8217;s a lousy media player, and it&#8217;s not an organiser.<\/li>\n<li>My 5th Generation iPod Video is a great media player, but rubbish at doing everything else.<\/li>\n<li>My PalmTungsten (which has had a broken touch-screen for years now) is a great organiser, book reader and note-taker, but again, is rubbish at media and it&#8217;s not a phone.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Maybe some of these really expensive new devices do do ALL of these things well, but I don&#8217;t want to pay \u00a3350+ until I KNOW what I&#8217;m getting.<\/p>\n<h3>Plan&#8230;err&#8230;A?<\/h3>\n<p>So&#8230;I&#8217;ve fallen back to plan A: the iPod Touch.\u00a0 I THINK it will converge as a media player and organiser.\u00a0 It will <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/mobile\/products\/sync.html#p=apple\">sync with Google<\/a>, I can get my study bibles on it (only when online currently, but there&#8217;s an offline app in the pipeline).\u00a0 It will let me browse the web from home and, sometimes, on the move.\u00a0 And rather than spend an extra \u00a3200 on the &#8220;phone&#8221; in &#8220;iPhone&#8221;, my W810 will keep me properly connected when on the go on a \u00a315 tarrif with unlimited 2.5G internet.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an odd choice given that media and games are things I don&#8217;t care about, but I reckon I can make good use of it.<\/p>\n<p>And most of all, it will be really nice to finally get to play with the iPod Touch\/iPhone interface.\u00a0 For me, it&#8217;s not just a useful gadget, but a great <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">toy<\/span>&#8230;and just what I would have liked to have won as a prize!<\/p>\n<h3>A Rotten Apple<\/h3>\n<p>Having decided (and got permission) to buy an iTouch, I went online to get a good deal.\u00a0 Actually, it seems that prices are much of a muchness so, for no real reason other than to try them out, I decided to buy from the Apple Store.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly&#8230;Apple&#8217;s shopping experience isn&#8217;t as good as their user experience.\u00a0 OK, so, the shop is fine, and the device was dispatched quickly&#8230;I guess I can&#8217;t blame Apple.<\/p>\n<p>But they shipped using UPS.\u00a0 And UPS seem to have the WORST distribution network of any courier I&#8217;ve come across in the UK.\u00a0 Our nearest depots are Bristol, Gloucester and Reading&#8230;all about 40 miles away.<\/p>\n<p>Annoyingly, I decided to have this delivered to my home address and, several days later, I&#8217;m still waiting to rendezvous with my new toy, which has been clocking up the miles between Bristol and Swindon.\u00a0 Despite having seen a UPS van leaving my office on Tuesday morning&#8230;probably carrying my parcel!<\/p>\n<p>I shalln&#8217;t be shopping at the Apple Store again!\u00a0 I should just have popped to Asda at lunch and bought one.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well.\u00a0 Hopefully my treat will arrive tomorrow &#8211; expect me to tell you all about it soon!<\/p>\n",

even though it&#8217;s a Walkman-branded phone, it&#8217;s a lousy media player, and it&#8217;s not an organiser.<\/li>\n<li>My 5th Generation iPod Video is a great media player, but rubbish at doing everything else.<\/li>\n<li>My PalmTungsten (which has had a broken touch-screen for years now) is a great organiser, book reader and note-taker, but again, is rubbish at media and it&#8217;s not a phone.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Maybe some of these really expensive new devices do do ALL of these things well, but I don&#8217;t want to pay \u00a3350+ until I KNOW what I&#8217;m getting.<\/p>\n<h3>Plan&#8230;err&#8230;A?<\/h3>\n<p>So&#8230;I&#8217;ve fallen back to plan A: the iPod Touch.\u00a0 I THINK it will converge as a media player and organiser.\u00a0 It will <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/mobile\/products\/sync.html#p=apple\">sync with Google<\/a>, I can get my study bibles on it (only when online currently, but there&#8217;s an offline app in the pipeline).\u00a0 It will let me browse the web from home and, sometimes, on the move.\u00a0 And rather than spend an extra \u00a3200 on the &#8220;phone&#8221; in &#8220;iPhone&#8221;, my W810 will keep me properly connected when on the go on a \u00a315 tarrif with unlimited 2.5G internet.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an odd choice given that media and games are things I don&#8217;t care about, but I reckon I can make good use of it.<\/p>\n<p>And most of all, it will be really nice to finally get to play with the iPod Touch\/iPhone interface.\u00a0 For me, it&#8217;s not just a useful gadget, but a great <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">toy<\/span>&#8230;and just what I would have liked to have won as a prize!<\/p>\n<h3>A Rotten Apple<\/h3>\n<p>Having decided (and got permission) to buy an iTouch, I went online to get a good deal.\u00a0 Actually, it seems that prices are much of a muchness so, for no real reason other than to try them out, I decided to buy from the Apple Store.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly&#8230;Apple&#8217;s shopping experience isn&#8217;t as good as their user experience.\u00a0 OK, so, the shop is fine, and the device was dispatched quickly&#8230;I guess I can&#8217;t blame Apple.<\/p>\n<p>But they shipped using UPS.\u00a0 And UPS seem to have the WORST distribution network of any courier I&#8217;ve come across in the UK.\u00a0 Our nearest depots are Bristol, Gloucester and Reading&#8230;all about 40 miles away.<\/p>\n<p>Annoyingly, I decided to have this delivered to my home address and, several days later, I&#8217;m still waiting to rendezvous with my new toy, which has been clocking up the miles between Bristol and Swindon.\u00a0 Despite having seen a UPS van leaving my office on Tuesday morning&#8230;probably carrying my parcel!<\/p>\n<p>I shalln&#8217;t be shopping at the Apple Store again!\u00a0 I should just have popped to Asda at lunch and bought one.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well.\u00a0 Hopefully my treat will arrive tomorrow &#8211; expect me to tell you all about it soon!<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m fortunate enough to have a locker &#8211; depending on what facilities you have this may or may not be practical, but I leave bigger items of clothing at work overnight, change them regularly but not every day, and I have spares in case I get out of routine (see the next post for more on this).  I have a pair of shoes that stays at work.<\/li>\n<li>Where&#8217;s lunch coming from?  We have a small local supermarket where I stock up on fruit and snacks occasionally.  I bring in my main lunch (sandwich, pasta, salad and so on) each day, but other less perishable items are bought in bulk and stored in my drawer.<\/li>\n<li>Duplicates.  If there&#8217;s something that you take to work often, and if you can afford it, buy a duplicate and leave it there.  I do this with things like hay-fever remedies, and sports shoes.<\/li>\n<p>I used to take paniers, but over time, leaving these things at my destination has meant that all I have to carry are a few smaller bits of clothing, a small lunch, and some small valuables, which all fits easily into a small rucksack.<\/p>\n<p>Bag tips: make sure it&#8217;s waterproof and visible!  I use a rucksack cover in a downpour.  These fold up into a tiny size &#8211; but make sure it&#8217;ll make you visible.  &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.respro.com\/products\/urban-commuting\/hi-visibility\/hiviz_hump\/\">Humps<\/a>&#8221; are good for this, they look a bit daft, but I&#8217;d rather look a little silly than get knocked off on a dark, wet night.<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s an area of constant innovation.  Rucksacks, messenger bags, paniers, baskets, even trailers exist.<\/p>\n<p>But I think the key to an easier commute is to reduce the amount that you have to carry.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leave a lock at work.  Locks are heavy.  If you regularly ride to the same place, leave a lock there.<\/li>\n<li>Store spare clothes.  I&#8217;m fortunate enough to have a locker &#8211; depending on what facilities you have this may or may not be practical, but I leave bigger items of clothing at work overnight, change them regularly but not every day, and I have spares in case I get out of routine (see the next post for more on this).  I have a pair of shoes that stays at work.<\/li>\n<li>Where&#8217;s lunch coming from?  We have a small local supermarket where I stock up on fruit and snacks occasionally.  I bring in my main lunch (sandwich, pasta, salad and so on) each day, but other less perishable items are bought in bulk and stored in my drawer.<\/li>\n<li>Duplicates.  If there&#8217;s something that you take to work often, and if you can afford it, buy a duplicate and leave it there.  I do this with things like hay-fever remedies, and sports shoes.<\/li>\n<p>I used to take paniers, but over time, leaving these things at my destination has meant that all I have to carry are a few smaller bits of clothing, a small lunch, and some small valuables, which all fits easily into a small rucksack.<\/p>\n<p>Bag tips: make sure it&#8217;s waterproof and visible!  I use a rucksack cover in a downpour.  These fold up into a tiny size &#8211; but make sure it&#8217;ll make you visible.  &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.respro.com\/products\/urban-commuting\/hi-visibility\/hiviz_hump\/\">Humps<\/a>&#8221; are good for this, they look a bit daft, but I&#8217;d rather look a little silly than get knocked off on a dark, wet night.<\/p>\n",

In some ways my <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/17\/controversial-commute-tips-4-lighten-the-load\/\">last tip<\/a> about leaving some things at work complicates matters because you need to remember what&#8217;s at work and what isn&#8217;t, what needs changing, and so on.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>At first, I&#8217;d often get this wrong, but over time I&#8217;ve developed a routine.  I know what needs to go in my bag on what days.  Some things stay in my bag.   Some things are changed every day, some are changed every week.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;ll need a bit of thought, but with practice &#8220;<em>The Routine<\/em>&#8221; becomes second nature&#8230;until you get an out-of-routine day.  A trip away from the office; a day off on leave, a day working from home.  All of these put you out of step with where things are.<\/p>\n<p>I also recently had a phase of bad Mondays.  Traditionally, Wednesday is my least favourite day of the week (it&#8217;s the furthest point from a weekend), but for a few weeks Mondays were pretty bad.  The things with Monday is lots of weekly things get changed over, and I&#8217;m often thinking too hard about them and forget the daily things.<\/p>\n<p>But establishing a routine is good, will come as you work at it, and makes life easier in the end.<\/p>\n",

In some ways my <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/17\/controversial-commute-tips-4-lighten-the-load\/\">last tip<\/a> about leaving some things at work complicates matters because you need to remember what&#8217;s at work and what isn&#8217;t, what needs changing, and so on.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>At first, I&#8217;d often get this wrong, but over time I&#8217;ve developed a routine.  I know what needs to go in my bag on what days.  Some things stay in my bag.   Some things are changed every day, some are changed every week.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;ll need a bit of thought, but with practice &#8220;<em>The Routine<\/em>&#8221; becomes second nature&#8230;until you get an out-of-routine day.  A trip away from the office; a day off on leave, a day working from home.  All of these put you out of step with where things are.<\/p>\n<p>I also recently had a phase of bad Mondays.  Traditionally, Wednesday is my least favourite day of the week (it&#8217;s the furthest point from a weekend), but for a few weeks Mondays were pretty bad.  The things with Monday is lots of weekly things get changed over, and I&#8217;m often thinking too hard about them and forget the daily things.<\/p>\n<p>But establishing a routine is good, will come as you work at it, and makes life easier in the end.<\/p>\n",
