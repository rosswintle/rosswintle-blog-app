                "rendered": "<p>[If you haven&#8217;t already, and are wondering why my cycle commuting tips might be controversial, please read <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/13\/controversial-commute-tips-introduction\/\">the introduction!<\/a>]<\/p>\n<p>Yes, yes, yes.  You can cycle in jeans, T-shirts, skirts (though, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/environment\/ethicallivingblog\/2009\/jul\/07\/cycling-skirts\">The Guardian&#8217;s own tips on this<\/a>), suits&#8230;in fact, some would argue that <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_Naked_Bike_Ride\">clothing is optional<\/a> for cycling!<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But as regular readers will know, I think that, like a decent bike, some decent cycle clothing makes the whole experience much nicer.  And here&#8217;s why:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sweat &amp; Changing.  Yes, I&#8217;m fortunate to have showers at my workplace, so I can shower and change when I arrive.  Which is actually pretty good because I sweat quite a lot.  But even a warm glow isn&#8217;t particularly pleasant to be in when you arrive at work, so a change of clothes is usually welcome.  And if you&#8217;re going to change anyway, why not change into\/out of some cycle specific clothing.<\/li>\n<li>Comfort.  Cycling involves things like leaning forward and flexing your knees a lot, along with a repetitive up-down motion of your legs, which is not really normal, and everyday clothes aren&#8217;t really cut for that sort of thing. You don&#8217;t wear a jumper when it&#8217;s sunny, or shorts in the snow.  Actually, perhaps you do&#8230;but you get my point.  We&#8217;ve been clever enough to develop different clothes for different seasons and activities.  Cycle-specific clothing is just more comfortable to cycle in.  As for padded pants (my term for cycling shorts)? Well, try them.  They&#8217;re not for everyone, I admit, but I won&#8217;t be going back.<\/li>\n<li>Safety.  It&#8217;s actually the combination of cyclist and driver in me that think this: cyclists should be visible!  Wear something bright so that you stand out from the road.  And when it&#8217;s dark, wear something reflective.  Those lights are great, but they&#8217;re just the start as far as I&#8217;m concerned.<\/li>\n<li>Rain.  You may have noticed the wet stuff that falls from the sky&#8230;it really mucks up a commute.  But don&#8217;t be put off!  With the right kit you can arrive at work with, well, pretty much everything dry but your face.<\/li>\n<li>Wind.  It may seem odd, but I actually prefer cycling in a downpour to cycling in a gale.  Wind can get to you in lots of ways. And my <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/11\/ill-get-my-coat\/\">Gore Windstopper Jacket<\/a> has improved my cycling comfort levels a LOT!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Now, buying all this gear can be expensive right?<\/p>\n<p>Well, yes.  But relative to running a car?  I mean, we&#8217;ve just had the anniversary of buying our car, which means Insurance (\u00a3250), MoT (\u00a3120 with a new exhaust), Service (+ cam belt this time round &#8211; \u00a3400), and then there&#8217;s Vehicle Excise Duty (\u00a3145), depreciation, and consumables (washing, de-icer, washer fluid, etc).  And that&#8217;s before petrol (I reckon I save at least \u00a3250 per year).<\/p>\n<p>If you can afford to do all of that, then, not everyone, I know, but most people with a car can surely afford a decent visible, waterproof jacket?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>[If you haven&#8217;t already, and are wondering why my cycle commuting tips might be controversial, please read <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/13\/controversial-commute-tips-introduction\/\">the introduction!<\/a>]<\/p>\n<p>Yes, yes, yes.  You can cycle in jeans, T-shirts, skirts (though, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/environment\/ethicallivingblog\/2009\/jul\/07\/cycling-skirts\">The Guardian&#8217;s own tips on this<\/a>), suits&#8230;in fact, some would argue that <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_Naked_Bike_Ride\">clothing is optional<\/a> for cycling!<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But as regular readers will know, I think that, like a decent bike, some decent cycle clothing makes the whole experience much nicer.  And here&#8217;s why:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sweat &amp; Changing.  Yes, I&#8217;m fortunate to have showers at my workplace, so I can shower and change when I arrive.  Which is actually pretty good because I sweat quite a lot.  But even a warm glow isn&#8217;t particularly pleasant to be in when you arrive at work, so a change of clothes is usually welcome.  And if you&#8217;re going to change anyway, why not change into\/out of some cycle specific clothing.<\/li>\n<li>Comfort.  Cycling involves things like leaning forward and flexing your knees a lot, along with a repetitive up-down motion of your legs, which is not really normal, and everyday clothes aren&#8217;t really cut for that sort of thing. You don&#8217;t wear a jumper when it&#8217;s sunny, or shorts in the snow.  Actually, perhaps you do&#8230;but you get my point.  We&#8217;ve been clever enough to develop different clothes for different seasons and activities.  Cycle-specific clothing is just more comfortable to cycle in.  As for padded pants (my term for cycling shorts)? Well, try them.  They&#8217;re not for everyone, I admit, but I won&#8217;t be going back.<\/li>\n<li>Safety.  It&#8217;s actually the combination of cyclist and driver in me that think this: cyclists should be visible!  Wear something bright so that you stand out from the road.  And when it&#8217;s dark, wear something reflective.  Those lights are great, but they&#8217;re just the start as far as I&#8217;m concerned.<\/li>\n<li>Rain.  You may have noticed the wet stuff that falls from the sky&#8230;it really mucks up a commute.  But don&#8217;t be put off!  With the right kit you can arrive at work with, well, pretty much everything dry but your face.<\/li>\n<li>Wind.  It may seem odd, but I actually prefer cycling in a downpour to cycling in a gale.  Wind can get to you in lots of ways. And my <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/11\/ill-get-my-coat\/\">Gore Windstopper Jacket<\/a> has improved my cycling comfort levels a LOT!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Now, buying all this gear can be expensive right?<\/p>\n<p>Well, yes.  But relative to running a car?  I mean, we&#8217;ve just had the anniversary of buying our car, which means Insurance (\u00a3250), MoT (\u00a3120 with a new exhaust), Service (+ cam belt this time round &#8211; \u00a3400), and then there&#8217;s Vehicle Excise Duty (\u00a3145), depreciation, and consumables (washing, de-icer, washer fluid, etc).  And that&#8217;s before petrol (I reckon I save at least \u00a3250 per year).<\/p>\n<p>If you can afford to do all of that, then, not everyone, I know, but most people with a car can surely afford a decent visible, waterproof jacket?<\/p>\n",

And while I would never advocate any form of road-rage, any inciting of road-rage or anything along those lines, I think it&#8217;s important to be confident on the road as a cyclist and to stand your ground a bit.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Confidence is not something that I can give you tips about.  It&#8217;s something that you&#8217;ll grow into as you do more cycling on the roads.  As you grow in confidence perhaps you can start to try some of what I suggest below.<\/p>\n<p>I should probably point out that the things I mention here are my own style of cycling, and you adopt any of my &#8220;tips&#8221; at your own risk&#8230;very much as you adopt cycling in general at your own risk.  And, of course, I defer to the Highway Code and the road laws of the UK in all matters.<\/p>\n<p>My aim, in &#8220;standing firm&#8221;, is to make sure that other road users around me are aware of my presence, and my rights as a cyclist AS I&#8217;m cycling.<\/p>\n<p>I mostly do this by riding the &#8220;primary position&#8221;.  Not all of the time, but when it&#8217;s appropriate.  This means I&#8217;m not hugging the left-hand kerb, but I&#8217;m a couple or three feet from it.<\/p>\n<p>But there are other occasions too.  At junctions and &#8220;pinch points&#8221; &#8211; where the road narrows or lanes merge &#8211; I do a LOT of looking over my shoulder.  Establishing eye contact with the driver behind says &#8220;I&#8217;m here&#8230;I&#8217;m allowed to be here&#8230;please give me room&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>These techniques should always be combined with obeying the rules of the road and especially with clear signalling well in advance of what you intend to do.<\/p>\n<p>One good example is on my way home there&#8217;s a place where there&#8217;s a nasty sunken drain cover just before a roundabout.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<figure id=\"attachment_470\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-470\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-470 \" title=\"nasty-drain-cover-1\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Location of nasty drain cover\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-1.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-1-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-470\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Location of nasty drain cover<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_471\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-471\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-471\" title=\"nasty-drain-cover-2\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-2.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Nasty Drain Cover - worse than it looks with a nasty sharp back edge.\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-2.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-2-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-471\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nasty Drain Cover - worse than it looks with a nasty sharp back edge.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>To go over it is horrid.  To go left of it forces you down a narrow gap close to the kerb, to go right of it means, pretty much, cycling in the middle of the road.  So I look behind, check for space, and pull into the middle really early on.\u00a0 (I tend not to indicate here as I&#8217;m not turning right at the roundabout&#8230;not sure what I should actually be doing?!). Moving out gives me a pretty good line over the roundabout too!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there are two dangers with the &#8220;Stand Firm&#8221; approach:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The driver ignores you and refuses to give you room<\/strong>.  I only cycle the primary position, or move out if I know it&#8217;s safe.  If something&#8217;s in my way &#8211; or if I&#8217;m in something&#8217;s way &#8211; then I keep well clear, and with experience you&#8217;ll learn to listen and hear what the vehicle behind you might be about to do.  A revving engine as you approach a roundabout means &#8220;get out the way, I&#8217;m coming through!&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Being annoying<\/strong>.  This happens far less than you think. Much as a few bad cyclists get the general cycling population a bad press, so a few bad drivers give the driving population a bad press.\u00a0 Most drivers seem to respond well to cues and signals that I give.\n<p>But standing firm must also be tempered with grace.  Give people room, let people through, acknowledge that cars can go faster than you and let them.  A good example: Temporary traffic lights on a country road.  I&#8217;ve reached them first and stopped and a few cars are behind me.  Pulling away first means that they all want to overtake me on a section of road reduced to one lane.  So I just stop and wave them past.  No dangerous overtaking, no annoyed cyclist, no annoyed drivers.  Everyone wins!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You&#8217;re allowed to be on the road!  If you&#8217;re confident, and if it&#8217;s safe to do so, make sure that others are aware of that.  But be aware that others are on the road too and sometimes, a little give and take works wonders.<\/p>\n<p>[Update &#8211; after writing this I read <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/environment\/ethicallivingblog\/2009\/jul\/11\/bike-blog-road-safety\">an article written by a 12-year-old<\/a> who, after some cycle training, &#8220;managed to make [a double decker bus] that was so much bigger than me slow down while I moved across its path&#8221;.  It seems that my approach &#8211; at least the road positioning, signalling and asserting yourself parts &#8211; is advocated as a part of basic training!]<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>[If you haven&#8217;t already, and are wondering why my cycle commuting tips might be controversial, please read <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/13\/controversial-commute-tips-introduction\/\">the introduction!<\/a>]<\/p>\n<p>This is a tip about cycling character.  And while I would never advocate any form of road-rage, any inciting of road-rage or anything along those lines, I think it&#8217;s important to be confident on the road as a cyclist and to stand your ground a bit.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Confidence is not something that I can give you tips about.  It&#8217;s something that you&#8217;ll grow into as you do more cycling on the roads.  As you grow in confidence perhaps you can start to try some of what I suggest below.<\/p>\n<p>I should probably point out that the things I mention here are my own style of cycling, and you adopt any of my &#8220;tips&#8221; at your own risk&#8230;very much as you adopt cycling in general at your own risk.  And, of course, I defer to the Highway Code and the road laws of the UK in all matters.<\/p>\n<p>My aim, in &#8220;standing firm&#8221;, is to make sure that other road users around me are aware of my presence, and my rights as a cyclist AS I&#8217;m cycling.<\/p>\n<p>I mostly do this by riding the &#8220;primary position&#8221;.  Not all of the time, but when it&#8217;s appropriate.  This means I&#8217;m not hugging the left-hand kerb, but I&#8217;m a couple or three feet from it.<\/p>\n<p>But there are other occasions too.  At junctions and &#8220;pinch points&#8221; &#8211; where the road narrows or lanes merge &#8211; I do a LOT of looking over my shoulder.  Establishing eye contact with the driver behind says &#8220;I&#8217;m here&#8230;I&#8217;m allowed to be here&#8230;please give me room&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>These techniques should always be combined with obeying the rules of the road and especially with clear signalling well in advance of what you intend to do.<\/p>\n<p>One good example is on my way home there&#8217;s a place where there&#8217;s a nasty sunken drain cover just before a roundabout.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<figure id=\"attachment_470\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-470\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-470 \" title=\"nasty-drain-cover-1\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Location of nasty drain cover\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-1.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-1-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-470\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Location of nasty drain cover<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_471\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-471\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-471\" title=\"nasty-drain-cover-2\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-2.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Nasty Drain Cover - worse than it looks with a nasty sharp back edge.\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-2.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/nasty-drain-cover-2-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-471\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nasty Drain Cover - worse than it looks with a nasty sharp back edge.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>To go over it is horrid.  To go left of it forces you down a narrow gap close to the kerb, to go right of it means, pretty much, cycling in the middle of the road.  So I look behind, check for space, and pull into the middle really early on.\u00a0 (I tend not to indicate here as I&#8217;m not turning right at the roundabout&#8230;not sure what I should actually be doing?!). Moving out gives me a pretty good line over the roundabout too!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there are two dangers with the &#8220;Stand Firm&#8221; approach:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The driver ignores you and refuses to give you room<\/strong>.  I only cycle the primary position, or move out if I know it&#8217;s safe.  If something&#8217;s in my way &#8211; or if I&#8217;m in something&#8217;s way &#8211; then I keep well clear, and with experience you&#8217;ll learn to listen and hear what the vehicle behind you might be about to do.  A revving engine as you approach a roundabout means &#8220;get out the way, I&#8217;m coming through!&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Being annoying<\/strong>.  This happens far less than you think. Much as a few bad cyclists get the general cycling population a bad press, so a few bad drivers give the driving population a bad press.\u00a0 Most drivers seem to respond well to cues and signals that I give.\n<p>But standing firm must also be tempered with grace.  Give people room, let people through, acknowledge that cars can go faster than you and let them.  A good example: Temporary traffic lights on a country road.  I&#8217;ve reached them first and stopped and a few cars are behind me.  Pulling away first means that they all want to overtake me on a section of road reduced to one lane.  So I just stop and wave them past.  No dangerous overtaking, no annoyed cyclist, no annoyed drivers.  Everyone wins!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You&#8217;re allowed to be on the road!  If you&#8217;re confident, and if it&#8217;s safe to do so, make sure that others are aware of that.  But be aware that others are on the road too and sometimes, a little give and take works wonders.<\/p>\n<p>[Update &#8211; after writing this I read <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/environment\/ethicallivingblog\/2009\/jul\/11\/bike-blog-road-safety\">an article written by a 12-year-old<\/a> who, after some cycle training, &#8220;managed to make [a double decker bus] that was so much bigger than me slow down while I moved across its path&#8221;.  It seems that my approach &#8211; at least the road positioning, signalling and asserting yourself parts &#8211; is advocated as a part of basic training!]<\/p>\n",

I don&#8217;t know if anyone&#8217;s ever understood my &#8220;glare, frown and nearly-pinched thumb and forefinger&#8221; gesture to be the intended message of &#8220;that gap was too small&#8221;, but trying can&#8217;t be a bad thing&#8230;can it?<\/p>\n<p>[Perhaps someone out there has a dictionary of standard cycling gestures?\u00a0 Perhaps someone should make one?]<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve never given anyone a talking to about their driving, but if I did so it would be informative rather than angry.\u00a0 Compare:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Sorry mate, but you overtook a bit close there, and it was pretty dangerous for me.\u00a0 Can you leave cyclists a bit more room in future please?&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>with (remember this is a family blog now&#8230;):<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You stupid idiot! What the heck do you think you were doing? I had no space and you nearly hit me!\u00a0 Take some driving lessons or something!!!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I suppose the closest I came was writing an email to the Library service after nearly being hit by the mobile library.\u00a0 The response to my polite email was, as hoped, apologetic and informed, rather than confrontational.\u00a0 Hopefully something was learned!<\/p>\n<h3>In the Car<\/h3>\n<p>Being in a car is a good place to learn and to teach about cycle safety too.\u00a0 A close relative of mine, who I love my  to bits, has a 4&#215;4, and I&#8217;ve had to tell him more than once, when a passenger in his big car, that he passed a cyclist WAY to close for comfort.\u00a0 He doesn&#8217;t realise, yet, how dangerous it is.\u00a0 I ensure that he&#8217;s learning that bikes need as much space as cars.<\/p>\n<p>My tip would be to try and do the following when  driving or being driven:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Point out cyclists to others and make sure that you\/they give room.<\/li>\n<li>Note stupid\/dangerous cycling behaviour and remember not to do those things when you&#8217;re on two wheels.<\/li>\n<li>Set the standard &#8211; do the things that you would have drivers do, and tell your passengers why you&#8217;re doing them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Sharing Experiences<\/h3>\n<p>Again&#8230;communicate what&#8217;s good, and what&#8217;s bad.\u00a0 Writing a blog is a bit extreme, but yes, part of my writing about cycling is to try to communicate with both cyclists and drivers about what it&#8217;s like to be a cyclist on the roads of Swindon.<\/p>\n<p>But how about talking with friends, family, colleagues, about your experiences?\u00a0 If I have a close shave, I&#8217;ll quite often chat about it in the office and make sure people know that overtaking and then turning left or overtaking at a junction or whatever is dangerous for the cyclist.<\/p>\n<p>Those incidents can serve as practical examples for others.<\/p>\n<p>Talk about the good stuff too&#8230;&#8221;everyone gave me lots of room on the way in today, it made my ride so much safer&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps talking about your cycling, telling your stories from two wheels and sharing your experiences will make the roads a little bit safer.\u00a0 Tony Blair&#8217;s theme was &#8220;Thiiiiings can only get betteeeeerrrrrr&#8221;.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s hope they do!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>As Tony Blair (remember him?) announced his three priorites for his government were &#8220;Education, Education, Education&#8221;, so I offer this as an important policy for cyclists too.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Education happens both on and off the bike, and is as much about &#8220;me&#8221; learning, as others learning.<\/p>\n<h3>In-Flight Education<\/h3>\n<p>On the bike I usome of the techniques to those described in <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/21\/controversial-commute-tips-7-stand-firm\/\" target=\"_blank\">my previous post<\/a> to demonstrate to people that cyclists need room.\u00a0 My hope is that sometimes, communicating with a driver with some eye contact or road positioning will not just say &#8220;I&#8217;m here&#8221;, but will say, &#8220;Look out for me next time too!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Waving to say thanks to those that do leave plenty of room, or hold back rather than make a dangerous overtaking manoevure, is also good.\u00a0 We should acknowledge and reinforce good driving behaviour as well as inform about what&#8217;s bad.<\/p>\n<h3>Dealing with Near Misses<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m very much against road rage, so kicking or hitting cars (and buses and vans) is noted as being both dangerous and stupid.\u00a0 It&#8217;s also unhelpful.<\/p>\n<p>I tend to use (polite!) gestures and stern looks to make sure people know that they need to leave more room next time. I don&#8217;t know if anyone&#8217;s ever understood my &#8220;glare, frown and nearly-pinched thumb and forefinger&#8221; gesture to be the intended message of &#8220;that gap was too small&#8221;, but trying can&#8217;t be a bad thing&#8230;can it?<\/p>\n<p>[Perhaps someone out there has a dictionary of standard cycling gestures?\u00a0 Perhaps someone should make one?]<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve never given anyone a talking to about their driving, but if I did so it would be informative rather than angry.\u00a0 Compare:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Sorry mate, but you overtook a bit close there, and it was pretty dangerous for me.\u00a0 Can you leave cyclists a bit more room in future please?&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>with (remember this is a family blog now&#8230;):<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You stupid idiot! What the heck do you think you were doing? I had no space and you nearly hit me!\u00a0 Take some driving lessons or something!!!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I suppose the closest I came was writing an email to the Library service after nearly being hit by the mobile library.\u00a0 The response to my polite email was, as hoped, apologetic and informed, rather than confrontational.\u00a0 Hopefully something was learned!<\/p>\n<h3>In the Car<\/h3>\n<p>Being in a car is a good place to learn and to teach about cycle safety too.\u00a0 A close relative of mine, who I love my  to bits, has a 4&#215;4, and I&#8217;ve had to tell him more than once, when a passenger in his big car, that he passed a cyclist WAY to close for comfort.\u00a0 He doesn&#8217;t realise, yet, how dangerous it is.\u00a0 I ensure that he&#8217;s learning that bikes need as much space as cars.<\/p>\n<p>My tip would be to try and do the following when  driving or being driven:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Point out cyclists to others and make sure that you\/they give room.<\/li>\n<li>Note stupid\/dangerous cycling behaviour and remember not to do those things when you&#8217;re on two wheels.<\/li>\n<li>Set the standard &#8211; do the things that you would have drivers do, and tell your passengers why you&#8217;re doing them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Sharing Experiences<\/h3>\n<p>Again&#8230;communicate what&#8217;s good, and what&#8217;s bad.\u00a0 Writing a blog is a bit extreme, but yes, part of my writing about cycling is to try to communicate with both cyclists and drivers about what it&#8217;s like to be a cyclist on the roads of Swindon.<\/p>\n<p>But how about talking with friends, family, colleagues, about your experiences?\u00a0 If I have a close shave, I&#8217;ll quite often chat about it in the office and make sure people know that overtaking and then turning left or overtaking at a junction or whatever is dangerous for the cyclist.<\/p>\n<p>Those incidents can serve as practical examples for others.<\/p>\n<p>Talk about the good stuff too&#8230;&#8221;everyone gave me lots of room on the way in today, it made my ride so much safer&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps talking about your cycling, telling your stories from two wheels and sharing your experiences will make the roads a little bit safer.\u00a0 Tony Blair&#8217;s theme was &#8220;Thiiiiings can only get betteeeeerrrrrr&#8221;.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s hope they do!<\/p>\n",

Bother&#8230;now I need to find more interesting things to say!]<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve said a lot over the last week-and-a-bit about the nitty-gritty of getting around this town of mine on two wheels, how I deal with it, and what I&#8217;ve learned that might be useful to others.<\/p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s the biggest and best tip of all.\u00a0 Despite all that I&#8217;ve said, despite the rain and wind and bad driving and darkness and sweat and punctures and buying expensive bikes and gear and potholes and messing up the routine to find you arrive at work with two shirts but no underwear&#8230;despite all that&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>ENJOY IT!!!<\/p>\n<p>Yes, cycling is <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">sometimes<\/span> lots of bad things, and I hope that my &#8220;tips&#8221; and experiences might help some of you deal with that.<\/p>\n<p>But mostly, cycling is an exhilarating, fun, healthy, life-enhancing, life-lengthening, sociable, environmentally friendly, fast, cheap, and trendy way to travel.<\/p>\n<p>Can I make it even more good than that?\u00a0 Here&#8217;s some final tips:<\/p>\n<p>Be nice to people: greet other cyclists, encourage and acknowledge good driving.<\/p>\n<p>Be &#8220;good&#8221;: obey the law, be gracious, give others room as well as expecting it.<\/p>\n<p>Be safe: keep your bike in good nick, make sure you&#8217;re visible, get training and advice &#8211; it&#8217;s not expensive, don&#8217;t deliberately put yourself in danger because a motorist is gonna hate himself if he hits you.<\/p>\n<p>Smile: show that you&#8217;re enjoying yourself &#8211; maybe you&#8217;ll get a smile back sometimes!<\/p>\n<p>And, as my first tip said, just do it: get on your bike, get good at cycling, have fun, and share your love of it.\u00a0 The more of us there are they better it will be.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>So, as I think I&#8217;ve said, April through to July has been pretty darned busy. I made my way on to several rotas at church, had a busy time at work several weekends away and a week-long holiday. Finally some more &#8220;free&#8221; time is here &#8211; hence the recent blog activity.<\/p>\n<p>I wanted to take a quick look back at the last few months&#8217; cycling. There are some thoughts that I&#8217;ve not had a chance to jot down.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>March Mileage<\/h3>\n<p>In March, which was a relatively quiet month, I set myself the target of cycling 300 miles. I&#8217;m sure some of you think that&#8217;s not very much, just 10 miles a day when I&#8217;m already commuting 7 anyway.  My previous monthy max was around 250 miles, so it should only have taken a little extra work to  get an extra 50 in.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, it was strangely difficult. I did just about achieve it by doing extended commutes and developing some &#8216;urban loops&#8217; which allowed me to clock up extra miles on well-lit roads during the dark nights. But I was hindered by needing to carry extra luggage to and from work a couple of times, requiring me to drive.<\/p>\n<p>I got a lot fitter and really enjoyed the challenge, but doing it with the shorter days was tough.<\/p>\n<p>The aim was to develop some good routines of doing longer rides and getting out at lunchtime too, but the summer has so far been too busy to keep those routines up. In fact, I don&#8217;t remember the last time I did an extended ride.<\/p>\n<p>I only ride for fun and fitness, but my hope was to put some much bigger rides in when the days got longer. I&#8217;ve no idea how my fitness is now, but hopefully I&#8217;ll get to test myself next week. But that really depends on&#8230;<\/p>\n<h3>Fuzzy&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>&#8230;whose fitness is also in question. For those wondering, Fuzzy is the name given to my Felt Z90 road bike, and, truth be told, he&#8217;s been a bit neglected of late.<\/p>\n<p>He got some new bar tape and brake pads, both rather needed, and which I was quite chuffed to fit myself.\u00a0 But he&#8217;s in desperate need of a clean and there&#8217;s some odd rattling\/clanking noises &#8211; one of which turned out to be the saddle being slightly loose, and the other seems to be emanating from the rear wheel.\u00a0 Bearings maybe?<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s odd, I know I&#8217;ve heard that specific clanking before, and I know it turned out to be something really simple, so either it IS something really simple and I&#8217;ve forgotten what, or it&#8217;s a differnt clanking to what I remember.\u00a0 Either way, he needs a good clean, then a trip to the bike shop&#8230;which I&#8217;ve not gotten around to.<\/p>\n<p>Fuzzy also had a first birthday which has, so far, been unrecorded.\u00a0 Next year I will try to find a more appropriate celebration, but for this year I&#8217;ll just record that he&#8217;s been a brilliant machine, survived all weathers, clocked nearly 2000 miles (well over that now of course!), and been not just my speedy training wheels, but my commuting workhorse too.<\/p>\n<h3>Not Another Bike?<\/h3>\n<p>Fuzzy&#8217;s first meant that I&#8217;d paid off my 12-months of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclescheme.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\">CycleScheme<\/a> hire and this month I became eligible to enroll again.\u00a0 But, oddly, I find myself not needing another bike&#8230;and not very much wanting one.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d considered getting a decent audax\/touring bike, something between Fuzzy&#8217;s sportiness and the more practical hybrid that I own but no longer ride, but I&#8217;m just not excited about it.\u00a0 I considered for a while that I was actually delusional, but I think I&#8217;m just content with what I have at the moment &#8211; it serves my needs.\u00a0 Maybe next time.<\/p>\n<h3>Campaigning<\/h3>\n<p>I mentioned a while ago about getting involved in some <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/02\/08\/cycle-campaigning\/\" target=\"_blank\">cycle campaigning<\/a>, fighting for cyclists rights, ensuring cycle infrastructure is maintained and growing, and encouraging others give cycling a try.\u00a0 I have contacted my local CTC cycle champion, but we&#8217;ve yet to actually both have time to meet, in the meantime various other things are happening as I&#8217;m getting involved with some travel plans and a local community project where sustainability is important.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also trying to plug together various parties from across the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/12\/the-tangled-web\/\" target=\"_blank\">tangled web<\/a> of people that we&#8217;ve been getting to know.\u00a0 There will be some interesting changes in our lives this summer and part of that will probably mean that the focus of our busy-ness changes and we start picking up some of these contacts and working with them in various ways.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, I must get Fuzzy sorted out, take my own advice and start enjoying cycling again, and get my monthly milage up!\u00a0 Autumn already looms.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s make the best of the summer weeks we have left.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>So, as I think I&#8217;ve said, April through to July has been pretty darned busy. I made my way on to several rotas at church, had a busy time at work several weekends away and a week-long holiday. Finally some more &#8220;free&#8221; time is here &#8211; hence the recent blog activity.<\/p>\n<p>I wanted to take a quick look back at the last few months&#8217; cycling. There are some thoughts that I&#8217;ve not had a chance to jot down.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>March Mileage<\/h3>\n<p>In March, which was a relatively quiet month, I set myself the target of cycling 300 miles. I&#8217;m sure some of you think that&#8217;s not very much, just 10 miles a day when I&#8217;m already commuting 7 anyway.  My previous monthy max was around 250 miles, so it should only have taken a little extra work to  get an extra 50 in.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, it was strangely difficult. I did just about achieve it by doing extended commutes and developing some &#8216;urban loops&#8217; which allowed me to clock up extra miles on well-lit roads during the dark nights. But I was hindered by needing to carry extra luggage to and from work a couple of times, requiring me to drive.<\/p>\n<p>I got a lot fitter and really enjoyed the challenge, but doing it with the shorter days was tough.<\/p>\n<p>The aim was to develop some good routines of doing longer rides and getting out at lunchtime too, but the summer has so far been too busy to keep those routines up. In fact, I don&#8217;t remember the last time I did an extended ride.<\/p>\n<p>I only ride for fun and fitness, but my hope was to put some much bigger rides in when the days got longer. I&#8217;ve no idea how my fitness is now, but hopefully I&#8217;ll get to test myself next week. But that really depends on&#8230;<\/p>\n<h3>Fuzzy&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>&#8230;whose fitness is also in question. For those wondering, Fuzzy is the name given to my Felt Z90 road bike, and, truth be told, he&#8217;s been a bit neglected of late.<\/p>\n<p>He got some new bar tape and brake pads, both rather needed, and which I was quite chuffed to fit myself.\u00a0 But he&#8217;s in desperate need of a clean and there&#8217;s some odd rattling\/clanking noises &#8211; one of which turned out to be the saddle being slightly loose, and the other seems to be emanating from the rear wheel.\u00a0 Bearings maybe?<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s odd, I know I&#8217;ve heard that specific clanking before, and I know it turned out to be something really simple, so either it IS something really simple and I&#8217;ve forgotten what, or it&#8217;s a differnt clanking to what I remember.\u00a0 Either way, he needs a good clean, then a trip to the bike shop&#8230;which I&#8217;ve not gotten around to.<\/p>\n<p>Fuzzy also had a first birthday which has, so far, been unrecorded.\u00a0 Next year I will try to find a more appropriate celebration, but for this year I&#8217;ll just record that he&#8217;s been a brilliant machine, survived all weathers, clocked nearly 2000 miles (well over that now of course!), and been not just my speedy training wheels, but my commuting workhorse too.<\/p>\n<h3>Not Another Bike?<\/h3>\n<p>Fuzzy&#8217;s first meant that I&#8217;d paid off my 12-months of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclescheme.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\">CycleScheme<\/a> hire and this month I became eligible to enroll again.\u00a0 But, oddly, I find myself not needing another bike&#8230;and not very much wanting one.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d considered getting a decent audax\/touring bike, something between Fuzzy&#8217;s sportiness and the more practical hybrid that I own but no longer ride, but I&#8217;m just not excited about it.\u00a0 I considered for a while that I was actually delusional, but I think I&#8217;m just content with what I have at the moment &#8211; it serves my needs.\u00a0 Maybe next time.<\/p>\n<h3>Campaigning<\/h3>\n<p>I mentioned a while ago about getting involved in some <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/02\/08\/cycle-campaigning\/\" target=\"_blank\">cycle campaigning<\/a>, fighting for cyclists rights, ensuring cycle infrastructure is maintained and growing, and encouraging others give cycling a try.\u00a0 I have contacted my local CTC cycle champion, but we&#8217;ve yet to actually both have time to meet, in the meantime various other things are happening as I&#8217;m getting involved with some travel plans and a local community project where sustainability is important.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also trying to plug together various parties from across the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/12\/the-tangled-web\/\" target=\"_blank\">tangled web<\/a> of people that we&#8217;ve been getting to know.\u00a0 There will be some interesting changes in our lives this summer and part of that will probably mean that the focus of our busy-ness changes and we start picking up some of these contacts and working with them in various ways.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, I must get Fuzzy sorted out, take my own advice and start enjoying cycling again, and get my monthly milage up!\u00a0 Autumn already looms.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s make the best of the summer weeks we have left.<\/p>\n",
