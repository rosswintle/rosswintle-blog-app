                "rendered": "<p>You may have noticed a couple of &#8220;random&#8221; photos on this blog recently. \u00a0This is because I&#8217;ve been trying out a&#8230;hmm&#8230;clever?&#8230;service called <a title=\"PressGram\" href=\"http:\/\/pressgr.am\/\">PressGram<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>PressGram is a service and iOS app that was Kickstarter-funded and that attempts to mimic the features of something like Instagram, but with automatic posting to WordPress blogs, and a policy of NOT own or use your photos. By which I think they mean wanting to use them in any other way than for the purpose of running the PressGram &#8220;social network&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>While I&#8217;m not a hugely visual person, I like the idea of Instagram, but I don&#8217;t like the fact that it&#8217;s owned by Facebook (a service that I have a minimal presence on) and I don&#8217;t like what they might do with my photos; Facebooks terms allow your images to be used in adverts, for example. And, I believe, they don&#8217;t just have these permissions, but they actively do these kinds of things.<\/p>\n<p>You can read about PressGram in their <a title=\"About - PressGram\" href=\"http:\/\/blog.pressgr.am\/about\/\">about page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While I <em>kind-of<\/em> get the PressGram mission and objectives and I support the notion of an app like this, a few things have bothered me about it.<\/p>\n<h3>Understanding<\/h3>\n<p>I confess that I didn&#8217;t back PressGram on KickStarter because I didn&#8217;t quite understand what it did. \u00a0Was it just an app that published photos to WordPress and had nice filters? Or did it do something more?<\/p>\n<p>Now that PressGram is out (and has been around for a while), I understand that it&#8217;s a social network based around your photos, with discovery, liking, commenting, etc. \u00a0So it&#8217;s more than just an upload-to-WordPress app.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s also not clear where your photos end up. \u00a0Or why you&#8217;d need to publish them to WordPress if they&#8217;re also on the PressGram network.<\/p>\n<p>I think that what PressGram is, and why it&#8217;s needed, is proving hard to communicate succinctly. \u00a0I&#8217;d certainly struggle to be an advocate for it. I think it does too many things and is confusing as a result.<\/p>\n<h3>Terms<\/h3>\n<p>PressGram, and it&#8217;s creator, has a great goal in letting you maintain ownership, control, and page-views of\/for your content: your photos! \u00a0But, this is confused by its terms of service which grant PressGram &#8220;a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>This is pretty standard terminology and I guess it&#8217;s required for any service that is publishing your content on the web using an app. You MUST grant this right in order for something like PressGram to serve its most basic purposes. And the term is clarified as being &#8220;solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting your Content in the app&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>But this section of the terms jars a little when you&#8217;re signing up for a service that&#8217;s main selling point is that it lets you keep ownership of your content. I truly believe that they let you keep your content, and won&#8217;t sell it, or use it for any other purposes than making the app work, but the legal words they need to use to achieve that still give them great power.<\/p>\n<p>Plus: &#8220;Pressgram reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any part of this Agreement. It is your responsibility to check this Agreement periodically for changes.&#8221; For a service that prides itself on it&#8217;s legal rules, this also seems a little unfair.<\/p>\n<h3>Sustainability<\/h3>\n<p>I was surprised to find that PressGram didn&#8217;t use MY web hosting to display my images. \u00a0From what I gather they are first uploaded from the phone app to Amazon S3 cloud-based storage, and then from there to my WordPress blog(s). \u00a0And a copy is kept on the Amazon storage.<\/p>\n<p>This means that John Saddington, PressGram&#8217;s founder and creator, is paying to store all of the PressGram images on Amazon S3. \u00a0And that number of images will grow and grow over time. What I don&#8217;t understand is how PressGram will sustain itself. There&#8217;s talk of getting some kind of funding, and of in-app purchases. And John is aware of this business problem. But I&#8217;m not convinced that he&#8217;s solved it or got a sustainable business plan. I do find myself wondering if PressGram will last<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, John&#8217;s done a great job of building the app and the community &#8211; it&#8217;s a huge achievement and his heart is totally in the right place, and I&#8217;ll probably up my usage of the PressGram app because it&#8217;s a brilliant way to post simple images to this blog (look out for more photos!). But I not convinced, yet, about what PressGram is, why it&#8217;s needed, and how long it will last.<\/p>\n<p>Is anyone else using it? What do you think?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>You may have noticed a couple of &#8220;random&#8221; photos on this blog recently. \u00a0This is because I&#8217;ve been trying out a&#8230;hmm&#8230;clever?&#8230;service called <a title=\"PressGram\" href=\"http:\/\/pressgr.am\/\">PressGram<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>PressGram is a service and iOS app that was Kickstarter-funded and that attempts to mimic the features of something like Instagram, but with automatic posting to WordPress blogs, and a policy of NOT own or use your photos. By which I think they mean wanting to use them in any other way than for the purpose of running the PressGram &#8220;social network&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>While I&#8217;m not a hugely visual person, I like the idea of Instagram, but I don&#8217;t like the fact that it&#8217;s owned by Facebook (a service that I have a minimal presence on) and I don&#8217;t like what they might do with my photos; Facebooks terms allow your images to be used in adverts, for example. And, I believe, they don&#8217;t just have these permissions, but they actively do these kinds of things.<\/p>\n<p>You can read about PressGram in their <a title=\"About - PressGram\" href=\"http:\/\/blog.pressgr.am\/about\/\">about page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While I <em>kind-of<\/em> get the PressGram mission and objectives and I support the notion of an app like this, a few things have bothered me about it.<\/p>\n<h3>Understanding<\/h3>\n<p>I confess that I didn&#8217;t back PressGram on KickStarter because I didn&#8217;t quite understand what it did. \u00a0Was it just an app that published photos to WordPress and had nice filters? Or did it do something more?<\/p>\n<p>Now that PressGram is out (and has been around for a while), I understand that it&#8217;s a social network based around your photos, with discovery, liking, commenting, etc. \u00a0So it&#8217;s more than just an upload-to-WordPress app.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s also not clear where your photos end up. \u00a0Or why you&#8217;d need to publish them to WordPress if they&#8217;re also on the PressGram network.<\/p>\n<p>I think that what PressGram is, and why it&#8217;s needed, is proving hard to communicate succinctly. \u00a0I&#8217;d certainly struggle to be an advocate for it. I think it does too many things and is confusing as a result.<\/p>\n<h3>Terms<\/h3>\n<p>PressGram, and it&#8217;s creator, has a great goal in letting you maintain ownership, control, and page-views of\/for your content: your photos! \u00a0But, this is confused by its terms of service which grant PressGram &#8220;a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>This is pretty standard terminology and I guess it&#8217;s required for any service that is publishing your content on the web using an app. You MUST grant this right in order for something like PressGram to serve its most basic purposes. And the term is clarified as being &#8220;solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting your Content in the app&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>But this section of the terms jars a little when you&#8217;re signing up for a service that&#8217;s main selling point is that it lets you keep ownership of your content. I truly believe that they let you keep your content, and won&#8217;t sell it, or use it for any other purposes than making the app work, but the legal words they need to use to achieve that still give them great power.<\/p>\n<p>Plus: &#8220;Pressgram reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any part of this Agreement. It is your responsibility to check this Agreement periodically for changes.&#8221; For a service that prides itself on it&#8217;s legal rules, this also seems a little unfair.<\/p>\n<h3>Sustainability<\/h3>\n<p>I was surprised to find that PressGram didn&#8217;t use MY web hosting to display my images. \u00a0From what I gather they are first uploaded from the phone app to Amazon S3 cloud-based storage, and then from there to my WordPress blog(s). \u00a0And a copy is kept on the Amazon storage.<\/p>\n<p>This means that John Saddington, PressGram&#8217;s founder and creator, is paying to store all of the PressGram images on Amazon S3. \u00a0And that number of images will grow and grow over time. What I don&#8217;t understand is how PressGram will sustain itself. There&#8217;s talk of getting some kind of funding, and of in-app purchases. And John is aware of this business problem. But I&#8217;m not convinced that he&#8217;s solved it or got a sustainable business plan. I do find myself wondering if PressGram will last<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, John&#8217;s done a great job of building the app and the community &#8211; it&#8217;s a huge achievement and his heart is totally in the right place, and I&#8217;ll probably up my usage of the PressGram app because it&#8217;s a brilliant way to post simple images to this blog (look out for more photos!). But I not convinced, yet, about what PressGram is, why it&#8217;s needed, and how long it will last.<\/p>\n<p>Is anyone else using it? What do you think?<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>Oh dear what has it come to. I&#8217;m writing posts that are specifically &#8220;reviews&#8221; of baby products. What have I become?<\/p>\n<p>In justification, let me give the back story.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">About this time last year I posted <\/span><a style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\" title=\"Reusable\/Cloth Nappies: A Plain English Guide for Dads and Dads-to-be\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2012\/10\/reusablecloth-nappies-a-plain-english-guide-for-dads-and-dad-to-bes\/\">my experiences of reusable nappies<\/a><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">. I bigged up the &#8220;bumGenius&#8221; brand as that&#8217;s what I had experience of. It seemed a little unfair to other cloth nappy companies, and the nice folk at Bambino Mio kindly sent some miosolo All-in-One nappies to use (along with some other handy cloth-nappy accessories), on the basis that I post about my experiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Arguably, waiting was good &#8211; I now have a year&#8217;s experience of using the miosolo&#8217;s. But even so, with apologies to Bambino Mio for being a little late (it&#8217;s been a busy year), here are my thoughts.<\/p>\n<h2>The good stuff<\/h2>\n<p>Things I like about the miosolo:<\/p>\n<p>Generally, in terms of quality and use these are definitely on a par with bumGenius, and they share many of the pros and cons of high-quality, all-in-one (or all-in-two) cloth nappies. The following represent where they are different from the bumGenius nappies that we have and love.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The inner part is attached to the outer part so they don&#8217;t get separated. As someone who pairs my socks and spends hours tracking down the missing parts of toys that come in sets, this is very pleasing as you don&#8217;t end up having outers with no inners.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The Velcro waist fastening is good because it gives you more &#8216;granularity&#8217; in the waist size. However, I prefer poppers still (see the related not-so-good thing below)!<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">They have some fancy features that, once you know how to use them make the washing and stuffing process slightly easier. There&#8217;s a little handle for pulling the dirty inner out, and a thing to aid re-stuffing. But&#8230;again, see the downsides of these below.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>The not-so-good stuff<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The Velcro waist fastening, while giving more flexibility with sizing, has some downsides. We find that they are much easier for a curious child to undo than poppers, and they can stick to other things in the wash. The popper\/Velcro thing is probably a matter of personal taste, one isn&#8217;t better than the other, they&#8217;re just different.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The extra bits for stuffing and washing are confusing. To be honest I was baffled by them at first as there aren&#8217;t instructions that say what they are for (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bambinomio.com\/en\/new-to-reusables\/user-guides\">the website user guides<\/a> are helpful). But even once you know what they do they don&#8217;t help an awful lot. The bumGenius nappies come apart in the wash so you don&#8217;t need to pull the inner out, so the miosolo&#8217;s special loop seems to just compensate for that fact that you do need to pull the inner out before washing. The stuffing aid was quite a help once I knew what to do with it.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The inner is one-size which is quite restrictive. bumGenius comes with two different sizes of inner pad, one of which has poppers to vary its length. Plus you can &#8216;double up&#8217; if you want to. The miosolo&#8217;s only have one inner pad and it&#8217;s a fixed length, which means sometimes your pad is too big and the nappy curls up to try to accommodate it, but this isn&#8217;t a big deal and is made up for by the fact that inners and outers are joined and don&#8217;t get separated and lost.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Summing up<\/h2>\n<p>The bumGenius and the miosolo are both good, high quality, well-designed nappies that will save you money, reduce landfill waste and are actually very easy to use. I&#8217;m sure that had we started out with miosolo&#8217;s we&#8217;d have been just as happy as we are with our bumGenius.<\/p>\n<p>The one thing that really stood out was the friendly and generous nature of the Bambino Mio people. They really are there to help and they&#8217;re full of handy hints and tips. Oh, and, unlike bumGenius, they&#8217;re a UK based company &#8211; that alone may make them worth supporting!<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately there&#8217;s not much in it. Take your pick and enjoy the many benefits of reusable, cloth nappies.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Oh dear what has it come to. I&#8217;m writing posts that are specifically &#8220;reviews&#8221; of baby products. What have I become?<\/p>\n<p>In justification, let me give the back story.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">About this time last year I posted <\/span><a style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\" title=\"Reusable\/Cloth Nappies: A Plain English Guide for Dads and Dads-to-be\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2012\/10\/reusablecloth-nappies-a-plain-english-guide-for-dads-and-dad-to-bes\/\">my experiences of reusable nappies<\/a><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">. I bigged up the &#8220;bumGenius&#8221; brand as that&#8217;s what I had experience of. It seemed a little unfair to other cloth nappy companies, and the nice folk at Bambino Mio kindly sent some miosolo All-in-One nappies to use (along with some other handy cloth-nappy accessories), on the basis that I post about my experiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Arguably, waiting was good &#8211; I now have a year&#8217;s experience of using the miosolo&#8217;s. But even so, with apologies to Bambino Mio for being a little late (it&#8217;s been a busy year), here are my thoughts.<\/p>\n<h2>The good stuff<\/h2>\n<p>Things I like about the miosolo:<\/p>\n<p>Generally, in terms of quality and use these are definitely on a par with bumGenius, and they share many of the pros and cons of high-quality, all-in-one (or all-in-two) cloth nappies. The following represent where they are different from the bumGenius nappies that we have and love.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The inner part is attached to the outer part so they don&#8217;t get separated. As someone who pairs my socks and spends hours tracking down the missing parts of toys that come in sets, this is very pleasing as you don&#8217;t end up having outers with no inners.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The Velcro waist fastening is good because it gives you more &#8216;granularity&#8217; in the waist size. However, I prefer poppers still (see the related not-so-good thing below)!<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">They have some fancy features that, once you know how to use them make the washing and stuffing process slightly easier. There&#8217;s a little handle for pulling the dirty inner out, and a thing to aid re-stuffing. But&#8230;again, see the downsides of these below.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>The not-so-good stuff<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The Velcro waist fastening, while giving more flexibility with sizing, has some downsides. We find that they are much easier for a curious child to undo than poppers, and they can stick to other things in the wash. The popper\/Velcro thing is probably a matter of personal taste, one isn&#8217;t better than the other, they&#8217;re just different.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The extra bits for stuffing and washing are confusing. To be honest I was baffled by them at first as there aren&#8217;t instructions that say what they are for (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bambinomio.com\/en\/new-to-reusables\/user-guides\">the website user guides<\/a> are helpful). But even once you know what they do they don&#8217;t help an awful lot. The bumGenius nappies come apart in the wash so you don&#8217;t need to pull the inner out, so the miosolo&#8217;s special loop seems to just compensate for that fact that you do need to pull the inner out before washing. The stuffing aid was quite a help once I knew what to do with it.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The inner is one-size which is quite restrictive. bumGenius comes with two different sizes of inner pad, one of which has poppers to vary its length. Plus you can &#8216;double up&#8217; if you want to. The miosolo&#8217;s only have one inner pad and it&#8217;s a fixed length, which means sometimes your pad is too big and the nappy curls up to try to accommodate it, but this isn&#8217;t a big deal and is made up for by the fact that inners and outers are joined and don&#8217;t get separated and lost.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Summing up<\/h2>\n<p>The bumGenius and the miosolo are both good, high quality, well-designed nappies that will save you money, reduce landfill waste and are actually very easy to use. I&#8217;m sure that had we started out with miosolo&#8217;s we&#8217;d have been just as happy as we are with our bumGenius.<\/p>\n<p>The one thing that really stood out was the friendly and generous nature of the Bambino Mio people. They really are there to help and they&#8217;re full of handy hints and tips. Oh, and, unlike bumGenius, they&#8217;re a UK based company &#8211; that alone may make them worth supporting!<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately there&#8217;s not much in it. Take your pick and enjoy the many benefits of reusable, cloth nappies.<\/p>\n",

It involved a family, of which I&#8217;ve met the mother once. The father had died; suddenly and way before his time.<\/p>\n<p>I desperately don&#8217;t want to make some kind of political point out of this tragedy. But I do want to tell you what subsequently happened this morning, and how I felt about it. \u00a0I&#8217;m not going to say what I think should be done. You can make your own minds up.<\/p>\n<p>Because of that news, I approached the morning with a renewed sense of the preciousness of life, and of the importance of keeping myself, Isaac, and Sally safe. I&#8217;d already nearly shed a tear or two. My emotions were on edge before the day had properly started.<\/p>\n<p>Despite grey clouds and a wet seat, I buckled Isaac up and, with helmets and lights on, we cycled, the quietest, safest way we know, to nursery.<\/p>\n<p>On the way home, I confess, I&#8217;m a little cavalier because I don&#8217;t have a kid on the back. By which I mean (&#8230;drum roll&#8230;) I cycle (&#8230;here, it&#8217;s coming&#8230;) ON THE ROAD!<\/p>\n<p>Yes. I know. Perhaps that&#8217;s something I need to change.<\/p>\n<p>And today, while on the road, not one but two cars made dangerous overtaking manoeuvres. One as I navigated a small roundabout that exits on to a blind corner frequented by buses. One at a narrow bit of road as another car was coming the other way.<\/p>\n<p>You could sense that both drivers got half way through the manoeuvre before realising something like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Argh, what&#8217;s coming the other way?<\/li>\n<li>Woah, that cyclist is going a bit quicker than I thought!<\/li>\n<li>Gosh, there actually isn&#8217;t really room\/time to do this safely!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s the slight pause in acceleration, a hesitation long enough for me to know that a decision is being made, then the swerve and pull-away once the driver&#8217;s decided that he may as well finish what he started as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>They were big, posh, expensive cars. A BMW and an Audi. It&#8217;s a gross and wholly unscientific generalisation for which the only data I have is my own recollection of previous incidents, but: they usually are.<\/p>\n<p>I stopped. I physically stopped by the side of the road after the second incident. I considered my route, my clothes, my helmet, my bicycle, my road positioning. I considered whether I should be cycling at all.<\/p>\n<p>I turned left, cycled the last few hundred yards home, opened the door, stepped inside, and cried.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m angry and sad.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want that news to one day be about me.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Gosh I&#8217;m angry. I may regret writing.<\/p>\n<p>This morning, shortly after waking, I heard some news. It wasn&#8217;t about anyone close to me. It involved a family, of which I&#8217;ve met the mother once. The father had died; suddenly and way before his time.<\/p>\n<p>I desperately don&#8217;t want to make some kind of political point out of this tragedy. But I do want to tell you what subsequently happened this morning, and how I felt about it. \u00a0I&#8217;m not going to say what I think should be done. You can make your own minds up.<\/p>\n<p>Because of that news, I approached the morning with a renewed sense of the preciousness of life, and of the importance of keeping myself, Isaac, and Sally safe. I&#8217;d already nearly shed a tear or two. My emotions were on edge before the day had properly started.<\/p>\n<p>Despite grey clouds and a wet seat, I buckled Isaac up and, with helmets and lights on, we cycled, the quietest, safest way we know, to nursery.<\/p>\n<p>On the way home, I confess, I&#8217;m a little cavalier because I don&#8217;t have a kid on the back. By which I mean (&#8230;drum roll&#8230;) I cycle (&#8230;here, it&#8217;s coming&#8230;) ON THE ROAD!<\/p>\n<p>Yes. I know. Perhaps that&#8217;s something I need to change.<\/p>\n<p>And today, while on the road, not one but two cars made dangerous overtaking manoeuvres. One as I navigated a small roundabout that exits on to a blind corner frequented by buses. One at a narrow bit of road as another car was coming the other way.<\/p>\n<p>You could sense that both drivers got half way through the manoeuvre before realising something like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Argh, what&#8217;s coming the other way?<\/li>\n<li>Woah, that cyclist is going a bit quicker than I thought!<\/li>\n<li>Gosh, there actually isn&#8217;t really room\/time to do this safely!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s the slight pause in acceleration, a hesitation long enough for me to know that a decision is being made, then the swerve and pull-away once the driver&#8217;s decided that he may as well finish what he started as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>They were big, posh, expensive cars. A BMW and an Audi. It&#8217;s a gross and wholly unscientific generalisation for which the only data I have is my own recollection of previous incidents, but: they usually are.<\/p>\n<p>I stopped. I physically stopped by the side of the road after the second incident. I considered my route, my clothes, my helmet, my bicycle, my road positioning. I considered whether I should be cycling at all.<\/p>\n<p>I turned left, cycled the last few hundred yards home, opened the door, stepped inside, and cried.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m angry and sad.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want that news to one day be about me.<\/p>\n",

So it&#8217;s quite amazing that its taken so long to get us using bikes as a family to get around.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been several reasons for this.  For one, my &#8216;workhorse&#8217; bike has had a wobbly stem, and for another we&#8217;ve been working out what sort of seat we want to use.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;d been given a bike seat last year, by some friends, but it was a rear-mounted seat and we weren&#8217;t sure if it was particularly good quality, or if we might prefer a front-mounted seat.  We figure that Isaac likes to chat and interact, and he can get quite wriggly and playful in a car seat, so maybe a front seat would be better.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I finally got the stem of my bike fixed, and had a go at mounting the seat that we&#8217;d been given, just to try it out.  And we popped out and bought Isaac a little helmet (or &#8216;hat&#8217;) too.<\/p>\n<p>And so it began.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday I took him up the road and back first, and I confess, I was a bit nervous and worried about wobbling and falling.  But quickly found my way with it. And Isaac seemed to enjoy being in the seat.<\/p>\n<p>So today we went for a family ride. We did 5 miles or so out and back to Shaw Ridge for a coffee there.  Pretty much all off road, so very safe. And it was great!<\/p>\n<p>In fact, we felt safe, free and are really keen to go on our next family ride.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac&#8217;s verdict? In a quick interview once home he declared his ride on the &#8216;bak&#8217; wearing his &#8216;hah&#8217; with &#8216;daddy&#8217; driving using his current favourite word: a load and firmly stated &#8216;Wow!&#8217;<\/p>\n",

So it&#8217;s quite amazing that its taken so long to get us using bikes as a family to get around.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been several reasons for this.  For one, my &#8216;workhorse&#8217; bike has had a wobbly stem, and for another we&#8217;ve been working out what sort of seat we want to use.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;d been given a bike seat last year, by some friends, but it was a rear-mounted seat and we weren&#8217;t sure if it was particularly good quality, or if we might prefer a front-mounted seat.  We figure that Isaac likes to chat and interact, and he can get quite wriggly and playful in a car seat, so maybe a front seat would be better.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I finally got the stem of my bike fixed, and had a go at mounting the seat that we&#8217;d been given, just to try it out.  And we popped out and bought Isaac a little helmet (or &#8216;hat&#8217;) too.<\/p>\n<p>And so it began.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday I took him up the road and back first, and I confess, I was a bit nervous and worried about wobbling and falling.  But quickly found my way with it. And Isaac seemed to enjoy being in the seat.<\/p>\n<p>So today we went for a family ride. We did 5 miles or so out and back to Shaw Ridge for a coffee there.  Pretty much all off road, so very safe. And it was great!<\/p>\n<p>In fact, we felt safe, free and are really keen to go on our next family ride.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac&#8217;s verdict? In a quick interview once home he declared his ride on the &#8216;bak&#8217; wearing his &#8216;hah&#8217; with &#8216;daddy&#8217; driving using his current favourite word: a load and firmly stated &#8216;Wow!&#8217;<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p><em>This is part of a mini-series of posts about &#39;Going Digital&#39;. If you missed it you might want to <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2013\/06\/going-digital-introduction\/\">read the introduction<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Books and Me<\/h2>\n<p>In theory, I love books. I&#39;d love to be the kind of person that finishes a decent book once a week. In reality I&#39;m great at starting reading books, and awful at finishing them. And I just don&#39;t get novels.<\/p>\n<p>That means I&#39;m probably not the best person to be talking about book readers.<\/p>\n<p>But lately I have been reading books on web design and development.<\/p>\n<p>eBooks have always made a lot of sense to me. I think the Kindle is a genius piece of technology.  Why carry heavy books around with you when you can take one, small, electronic device? But, due to the fact that I&#39;m a rubbish reader, I&#39;ve never owned one, and so I&#39;ve never really been an eBook reader.<\/p>\n<p>When I bought an iPad, that all changed. I suddenly had a device that was great for reading long-form content on. It was time to Go Digital!<\/p>\n<h2>Reader Apps<\/h2>\n<p>To go digital with books and an iPad, you need a reader. And, like with music, when I first started looking, there wasn&#39;t an app that did what I wanted.  My needs were:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>runs on iOS &#8211; both iPhone and iPad optimised<\/li>\n<li>synchronises both my library and reading position across devices<\/li>\n<li>allows me to upload my own books (I&#39;ve got some pretty big book files with lots of images)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here&#39;s the main options I looked at:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>iBooks<\/li>\n<li>Kindle<\/li>\n<li>Readmill<\/li>\n<li>and&hellip;recently added&hellip;Google Play Books<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>iBooks<\/h3>\n<p>It&#39;s awful. I hate it. It feels slow and clumsy. It syncs reading position but not books. At least, not always. It confused me. And your options for uploading your own books are severely limited (I think it&#39;s just the iTunes book store or uploading from an iOS device). Don&#39;t bother.<\/p>\n<h3>Kindle<\/h3>\n<p>Kindle is a nice reader, if a little simple. You have the ability to upload up to 5GB of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/gp\/help\/customer\/display.html?nodeId=200767360\">personal documents<\/a> by email, or using an uploader app, and it&#39;s syncs your reading position.<\/p>\n<p>Kindle also has the advantage that it can read Kindle books bought from Amazon&#39;s really rather large library. Something that, to my knowledge, you can&#39;t do with other reader apps.<\/p>\n<h3>Readmill<\/h3>\n<p>I&#39;d not heard of Readmill until I came across a button on a website I was downloading an eBook from. And I love it.<\/p>\n<p>Readmill is an eBook Reader that incorporates the concept of &#39;Social Reading&#39;. This means that other people can see what you&#39;re reading and the &#39;highlights&#39; you&#39;ve made from each book. It tracks how long you&#39;ve been reading and can track your location and tell you where you&#39;ve been reading, so you can observe your own reading habits.<\/p>\n<p>The app is simple, but effective and beautiful. The typography is perfect. Visually it&#39;s my favourite reader app.<\/p>\n<p>You can upload books to Readmill from a web browser and it syncs them, and your reading position and highlights, to your devices.<\/p>\n<p>The downside: it&#39;s iOS only and it accepts a very limited set of book formats.<\/p>\n<h3>Google Play<\/h3>\n<p>As with other things, Google were late to the party here. Their iOS app is acceptable, but not amazing. It does all the syncing you&#39;d expect, and you can upload up to 1000 of your own books\/files to Google Play from the website, as long as they&#39;re smaller than 50MB each.<\/p>\n<h3>Apps verdict<\/h3>\n<p>As an iOS user I&#39;ve adopted a combination of Readmill (for books I can download in the right format) and Kindle (for things bought from Amazon).<\/p>\n<p>I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;d do if I had an Android device. Maybe I&#39;d go Kindle all the way? Or maybe Google Play works better on Android?<\/p>\n<p>Of course, if I had a Kindle, I&#39;d use the Kindle app on other devices for sure.<\/p>\n<h2>So did you &#39;Go Digital&#39;?<\/h2>\n<p>I still have a lot of paper books. And I&#39;ve not bought any books for a long time. And, actually, those that I have have, for various odd reasons, been from Amazon in Kindle format.<\/p>\n<p>And in terms of my web design and development reading, I&#39;m semi-digital. I have bought some digital-only books, but in other cases I&#39;ve wanted the hard copy too. Why?  I think it&#39;s just because the experience of flicking through pages of a book can&#39;t actually be replicated fully on a digital device.<\/p>\n<p>I&#39;d say eBooks were on test.  Maybe I will eventually fully convert and buy new books as eBooks only. But I&#39;m not there yet.<\/p>\n<p>What I do love is Readmill&#39;s social reading idea. It adds something to eBooks that you don&#39;t get with paper. And as someone who struggles to read I think it would be really great to share my reading within a community. I might encourage me to read more!<\/p>\n<p>Do you read eBooks? What devices and apps do you use? What are your frustrations and what works? Do you just buy eBooks or do you still buy paper copies too?  I&#39;d be interested to hear your experiences.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><em>This is part of a mini-series of posts about &#39;Going Digital&#39;. If you missed it you might want to <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2013\/06\/going-digital-introduction\/\">read the introduction<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Books and Me<\/h2>\n<p>In theory, I love books. I&#39;d love to be the kind of person that finishes a decent book once a week. In reality I&#39;m great at starting reading books, and awful at finishing them. And I just don&#39;t get novels.<\/p>\n<p>That means I&#39;m probably not the best person to be talking about book readers.<\/p>\n<p>But lately I have been reading books on web design and development.<\/p>\n<p>eBooks have always made a lot of sense to me. I think the Kindle is a genius piece of technology.  Why carry heavy books around with you when you can take one, small, electronic device? But, due to the fact that I&#39;m a rubbish reader, I&#39;ve never owned one, and so I&#39;ve never really been an eBook reader.<\/p>\n<p>When I bought an iPad, that all changed. I suddenly had a device that was great for reading long-form content on. It was time to Go Digital!<\/p>\n<h2>Reader Apps<\/h2>\n<p>To go digital with books and an iPad, you need a reader. And, like with music, when I first started looking, there wasn&#39;t an app that did what I wanted.  My needs were:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>runs on iOS &#8211; both iPhone and iPad optimised<\/li>\n<li>synchronises both my library and reading position across devices<\/li>\n<li>allows me to upload my own books (I&#39;ve got some pretty big book files with lots of images)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here&#39;s the main options I looked at:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>iBooks<\/li>\n<li>Kindle<\/li>\n<li>Readmill<\/li>\n<li>and&hellip;recently added&hellip;Google Play Books<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>iBooks<\/h3>\n<p>It&#39;s awful. I hate it. It feels slow and clumsy. It syncs reading position but not books. At least, not always. It confused me. And your options for uploading your own books are severely limited (I think it&#39;s just the iTunes book store or uploading from an iOS device). Don&#39;t bother.<\/p>\n<h3>Kindle<\/h3>\n<p>Kindle is a nice reader, if a little simple. You have the ability to upload up to 5GB of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/gp\/help\/customer\/display.html?nodeId=200767360\">personal documents<\/a> by email, or using an uploader app, and it&#39;s syncs your reading position.<\/p>\n<p>Kindle also has the advantage that it can read Kindle books bought from Amazon&#39;s really rather large library. Something that, to my knowledge, you can&#39;t do with other reader apps.<\/p>\n<h3>Readmill<\/h3>\n<p>I&#39;d not heard of Readmill until I came across a button on a website I was downloading an eBook from. And I love it.<\/p>\n<p>Readmill is an eBook Reader that incorporates the concept of &#39;Social Reading&#39;. This means that other people can see what you&#39;re reading and the &#39;highlights&#39; you&#39;ve made from each book. It tracks how long you&#39;ve been reading and can track your location and tell you where you&#39;ve been reading, so you can observe your own reading habits.<\/p>\n<p>The app is simple, but effective and beautiful. The typography is perfect. Visually it&#39;s my favourite reader app.<\/p>\n<p>You can upload books to Readmill from a web browser and it syncs them, and your reading position and highlights, to your devices.<\/p>\n<p>The downside: it&#39;s iOS only and it accepts a very limited set of book formats.<\/p>\n<h3>Google Play<\/h3>\n<p>As with other things, Google were late to the party here. Their iOS app is acceptable, but not amazing. It does all the syncing you&#39;d expect, and you can upload up to 1000 of your own books\/files to Google Play from the website, as long as they&#39;re smaller than 50MB each.<\/p>\n<h3>Apps verdict<\/h3>\n<p>As an iOS user I&#39;ve adopted a combination of Readmill (for books I can download in the right format) and Kindle (for things bought from Amazon).<\/p>\n<p>I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;d do if I had an Android device. Maybe I&#39;d go Kindle all the way? Or maybe Google Play works better on Android?<\/p>\n<p>Of course, if I had a Kindle, I&#39;d use the Kindle app on other devices for sure.<\/p>\n<h2>So did you &#39;Go Digital&#39;?<\/h2>\n<p>I still have a lot of paper books. And I&#39;ve not bought any books for a long time. And, actually, those that I have have, for various odd reasons, been from Amazon in Kindle format.<\/p>\n<p>And in terms of my web design and development reading, I&#39;m semi-digital. I have bought some digital-only books, but in other cases I&#39;ve wanted the hard copy too. Why?  I think it&#39;s just because the experience of flicking through pages of a book can&#39;t actually be replicated fully on a digital device.<\/p>\n<p>I&#39;d say eBooks were on test.  Maybe I will eventually fully convert and buy new books as eBooks only. But I&#39;m not there yet.<\/p>\n<p>What I do love is Readmill&#39;s social reading idea. It adds something to eBooks that you don&#39;t get with paper. And as someone who struggles to read I think it would be really great to share my reading within a community. I might encourage me to read more!<\/p>\n<p>Do you read eBooks? What devices and apps do you use? What are your frustrations and what works? Do you just buy eBooks or do you still buy paper copies too?  I&#39;d be interested to hear your experiences.<\/p>\n",

If you missed it you might want to <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2013\/06\/going-digital-introduction\/\">read the introduction<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>My History of Digital Music<\/h2>\n<p>Here&#39;s a little potted history of digital music in my life.<\/p>\n<p>Let me let you in to a little secret: I thought Mini-Discs were <strong>great<\/strong>! But the rest of the world wasn&#39;t so keen and they died out with the advent of MP3s.  Having been bitten by that, I was shy of MP3 players and so have generally been slow on the uptake of digital music.<\/p>\n<p>Digital music software didn&#39;t help. The best software in terms of organising files was iTunes, but it was (and still is) big and slow and clunky. That hindered the process.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, our car has always had a CD player, so we&#39;ve always had CDs, and there is, I suppose, a general nostalgia for physical media and a fear of files disappearing that has contributed to us clinging to music on disc.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually I found myself with an iPhone, which was great for music. But as numbers of apps and photos grew it became impossible to store anything like a decent selection of music.<\/p>\n<p>Conveniently, this was around the time that cloud music services started to become available.  It was time to Go Digital! Or was it?<\/p>\n<p>To go fully digital I&#8217;d need a cloud music service to store my music with and to be able to access it from my computer and mobile devices, and I&#8217;d need to be buying music downloads instead of CDs.<\/p>\n<h2>Cloud Music Services<\/h2>\n<p>Cloud music services either give you access to a vast range of music stored at the music service, usually for a subscription, or they let you upload and store all of the music that you own in &#39;the cloud&#39;.  Some services avoid the need to upload ALL of your music by matching it to music that&#39;s already stored at the music service.<\/p>\n<p>I researched a few cloud music services. I don&#39;t listen to music enough to make a subscription to something like Spotify worthwhile, so it was an upload\/matching service that I needed.<\/p>\n<p>At the time I signed up there were only two services available in the UK: iTunes Match and Amazon Cloud Player.  Google Play Music has since become available in the UK.<\/p>\n<h3>Costs and tracks<\/h3>\n<p>These services limit you to a certain number of tracks.  For Amazon this is 250 for the free service and 250,000 for the paid service.  iTunes only has a paid service and it gives you 25,000 songs. Google&#39;s service is free and allows 20,000 songs.<\/p>\n<p>iTunes Match and Amazon&#39;s upgraded storage for cloud player are both \u00a321.99 per year.<\/p>\n<p>So Google&#39;s service is the best value for money. But does it do what I need?<\/p>\n<h3>Functions and Features<\/h3>\n<p>The services are all pretty similar in what they do, they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>store music in &#39;the cloud&#39;<\/li>\n<li>let you stream it (play it without downloading, which requires a connection) * let you download it to your device<\/li>\n<li>act as a backup of your digital music files<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It should be noted that I&#39;m really not too bothered about sound quality. If you are then there are other factors that might affect your choice.<\/p>\n<h3>Complications<\/h3>\n<p>Actually, from what I can tell, the only exception to the list above is iTunes Match which doesn&#39;t let you stream your music: you have to download it and play. But you can play a track while its downloading.<\/p>\n<p>iTunes Match also only works with Apple devices and though iTunes, whereas the other services can be played on multiple platforms through web apps, or phone\/tablet apps.<\/p>\n<p>Google suffers from not having their own app for Apple devices. Third party apps exist but seem to vary in quality. Plus the web app really doesn&#39;t play well with iOS: I found that playing music in the background while doing other things was unreliable.<\/p>\n<h3>Choosing a service<\/h3>\n<p>So while Google seemed best value, it really didn&#39;t work well for a person with Apple devices.  At the time I evaluated them I <em>think<\/em> Amazon&#39;s service didn&#39;t do track matching, so you had to upload your entire collection, which would have taken a LOOOOONG time. So I ended up opting for iTunes Match for a year.<\/p>\n<p>In reality, I don&#39;t think any of these services is ideal. Google&#39;s service is amazing given that its free. And I think that, if I was paying again I&#39;d opt for Amazon&#39;s service rather than Apple&#39;s &#8211; especially now that Amazon&#39;s service has caught up a bit.<\/p>\n<p>So for the time being I have iTunes Match, but I&#8217;m hoping that there will be a decent iOS app for Google Music by the time my renewal comes up.<\/p>\n<h2>So did you &#39;Go Digital&#39;?<\/h2>\n<p>You know what, I didn&#39;t yet! My music is in the cloud, and it&#39;s really good. But I&#39;m still buying CDs. I&#39;m yet to start buying downloaded music in any great volume.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#39;m not really sure why any more. Is there a good reason to buy a CD? Other than, perhaps, to put in the car? CDs take up space, are actually less safe and reliable and, if you don&#39;t care about quality, there doesn&#39;t seem much reason not to be digital only. So I expect I&#39;ll be buying downloads more in the near future.<\/p>\n<p>Do you still buy CDs or Vinyl? What are your reasons? What stops you going digital?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><em>This is part of a mini-series of posts about &#39;Going Digital&#39;. If you missed it you might want to <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2013\/06\/going-digital-introduction\/\">read the introduction<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>My History of Digital Music<\/h2>\n<p>Here&#39;s a little potted history of digital music in my life.<\/p>\n<p>Let me let you in to a little secret: I thought Mini-Discs were <strong>great<\/strong>! But the rest of the world wasn&#39;t so keen and they died out with the advent of MP3s.  Having been bitten by that, I was shy of MP3 players and so have generally been slow on the uptake of digital music.<\/p>\n<p>Digital music software didn&#39;t help. The best software in terms of organising files was iTunes, but it was (and still is) big and slow and clunky. That hindered the process.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, our car has always had a CD player, so we&#39;ve always had CDs, and there is, I suppose, a general nostalgia for physical media and a fear of files disappearing that has contributed to us clinging to music on disc.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually I found myself with an iPhone, which was great for music. But as numbers of apps and photos grew it became impossible to store anything like a decent selection of music.<\/p>\n<p>Conveniently, this was around the time that cloud music services started to become available.  It was time to Go Digital! Or was it?<\/p>\n<p>To go fully digital I&#8217;d need a cloud music service to store my music with and to be able to access it from my computer and mobile devices, and I&#8217;d need to be buying music downloads instead of CDs.<\/p>\n<h2>Cloud Music Services<\/h2>\n<p>Cloud music services either give you access to a vast range of music stored at the music service, usually for a subscription, or they let you upload and store all of the music that you own in &#39;the cloud&#39;.  Some services avoid the need to upload ALL of your music by matching it to music that&#39;s already stored at the music service.<\/p>\n<p>I researched a few cloud music services. I don&#39;t listen to music enough to make a subscription to something like Spotify worthwhile, so it was an upload\/matching service that I needed.<\/p>\n<p>At the time I signed up there were only two services available in the UK: iTunes Match and Amazon Cloud Player.  Google Play Music has since become available in the UK.<\/p>\n<h3>Costs and tracks<\/h3>\n<p>These services limit you to a certain number of tracks.  For Amazon this is 250 for the free service and 250,000 for the paid service.  iTunes only has a paid service and it gives you 25,000 songs. Google&#39;s service is free and allows 20,000 songs.<\/p>\n<p>iTunes Match and Amazon&#39;s upgraded storage for cloud player are both \u00a321.99 per year.<\/p>\n<p>So Google&#39;s service is the best value for money. But does it do what I need?<\/p>\n<h3>Functions and Features<\/h3>\n<p>The services are all pretty similar in what they do, they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>store music in &#39;the cloud&#39;<\/li>\n<li>let you stream it (play it without downloading, which requires a connection) * let you download it to your device<\/li>\n<li>act as a backup of your digital music files<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It should be noted that I&#39;m really not too bothered about sound quality. If you are then there are other factors that might affect your choice.<\/p>\n<h3>Complications<\/h3>\n<p>Actually, from what I can tell, the only exception to the list above is iTunes Match which doesn&#39;t let you stream your music: you have to download it and play. But you can play a track while its downloading.<\/p>\n<p>iTunes Match also only works with Apple devices and though iTunes, whereas the other services can be played on multiple platforms through web apps, or phone\/tablet apps.<\/p>\n<p>Google suffers from not having their own app for Apple devices. Third party apps exist but seem to vary in quality. Plus the web app really doesn&#39;t play well with iOS: I found that playing music in the background while doing other things was unreliable.<\/p>\n<h3>Choosing a service<\/h3>\n<p>So while Google seemed best value, it really didn&#39;t work well for a person with Apple devices.  At the time I evaluated them I <em>think<\/em> Amazon&#39;s service didn&#39;t do track matching, so you had to upload your entire collection, which would have taken a LOOOOONG time. So I ended up opting for iTunes Match for a year.<\/p>\n<p>In reality, I don&#39;t think any of these services is ideal. Google&#39;s service is amazing given that its free. And I think that, if I was paying again I&#39;d opt for Amazon&#39;s service rather than Apple&#39;s &#8211; especially now that Amazon&#39;s service has caught up a bit.<\/p>\n<p>So for the time being I have iTunes Match, but I&#8217;m hoping that there will be a decent iOS app for Google Music by the time my renewal comes up.<\/p>\n<h2>So did you &#39;Go Digital&#39;?<\/h2>\n<p>You know what, I didn&#39;t yet! My music is in the cloud, and it&#39;s really good. But I&#39;m still buying CDs. I&#39;m yet to start buying downloaded music in any great volume.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#39;m not really sure why any more. Is there a good reason to buy a CD? Other than, perhaps, to put in the car? CDs take up space, are actually less safe and reliable and, if you don&#39;t care about quality, there doesn&#39;t seem much reason not to be digital only. So I expect I&#39;ll be buying downloads more in the near future.<\/p>\n<p>Do you still buy CDs or Vinyl? What are your reasons? What stops you going digital?<\/p>\n",

And it&#8217;s especially not true in the world of entertainment. We barely have HDTV, I&#8217;m not a big gamer, and we still buy most of our music on CD and we purchase real paper books.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve been making forays into digital entertainment and questioning my own desire to have physical media for everything, and also playing with going &#8216;paperless&#8217;. <\/p>\n<p>This is the first in a mini-series of notes about &#8216;Going Digital&#8217;. Each will cover a separate real world thing (books, music, notes) that I&#8217;ve been going digital with, and will evaluate the tools I tried and how close to fully-digital I&#8217;ve become with that thing.<\/p>\n<p>But before tackling the things&#8230;why has Going Digital been so hard, and what changed?<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Not-So-Digital<\/h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;ve been so slow to embrace digital entertainment media. I mean, I&#8217;ve had an MP3 player for years, I now (somewhat ashamedly) have an iPhone and an iPad. I&#8217;ve been on broadband for years too. I&#8217;m generally not an early adopter of technology, but I certainly get in pre-mainstream.<\/p>\n<p>I guess I&#8217;ve been held back by what-ifs. If all my music and books are digital, it seems easier to lose. I need it backed up, and that backup needs to be safe.<\/p>\n<p>Plus we&#8217;ve had cars with CD players, so CDs have remained important. And we&#8217;ve just not had devices suitable for proper reading on.<\/p>\n<h2>What changed?<\/h2>\n<p>For music, the thing that changed was the cloud. Frustrated with only having a small percentage of my music on my mobile devices, I recently tried out cloud music services to keep all my music in &#8216;the cloud&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>For books it was the iPad, which I decided could actually be a decent eBook reader.<\/p>\n<p>The iPad has also made a &#8216;paperless office&#8217; more feasible, so I&#8217;ve been playing with tools that achieve that, and note-taking tools in particular.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve not found going digital easy, the number of services and apps that you could possibly use is huge and finding the tools that work for you needs trial and error. I can see why people stick with what they know in the form of paper and CD&#8217;s!<\/p>\n<p>I hope the posts that follow help you choose tools without needing to try them out, and help ou on your own journey of Going Digital.<\/p>\n",

And it&#8217;s especially not true in the world of entertainment. We barely have HDTV, I&#8217;m not a big gamer, and we still buy most of our music on CD and we purchase real paper books.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve been making forays into digital entertainment and questioning my own desire to have physical media for everything, and also playing with going &#8216;paperless&#8217;. <\/p>\n<p>This is the first in a mini-series of notes about &#8216;Going Digital&#8217;. Each will cover a separate real world thing (books, music, notes) that I&#8217;ve been going digital with, and will evaluate the tools I tried and how close to fully-digital I&#8217;ve become with that thing.<\/p>\n<p>But before tackling the things&#8230;why has Going Digital been so hard, and what changed?<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Not-So-Digital<\/h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;ve been so slow to embrace digital entertainment media. I mean, I&#8217;ve had an MP3 player for years, I now (somewhat ashamedly) have an iPhone and an iPad. I&#8217;ve been on broadband for years too. I&#8217;m generally not an early adopter of technology, but I certainly get in pre-mainstream.<\/p>\n<p>I guess I&#8217;ve been held back by what-ifs. If all my music and books are digital, it seems easier to lose. I need it backed up, and that backup needs to be safe.<\/p>\n<p>Plus we&#8217;ve had cars with CD players, so CDs have remained important. And we&#8217;ve just not had devices suitable for proper reading on.<\/p>\n<h2>What changed?<\/h2>\n<p>For music, the thing that changed was the cloud. Frustrated with only having a small percentage of my music on my mobile devices, I recently tried out cloud music services to keep all my music in &#8216;the cloud&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>For books it was the iPad, which I decided could actually be a decent eBook reader.<\/p>\n<p>The iPad has also made a &#8216;paperless office&#8217; more feasible, so I&#8217;ve been playing with tools that achieve that, and note-taking tools in particular.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve not found going digital easy, the number of services and apps that you could possibly use is huge and finding the tools that work for you needs trial and error. I can see why people stick with what they know in the form of paper and CD&#8217;s!<\/p>\n<p>I hope the posts that follow help you choose tools without needing to try them out, and help ou on your own journey of Going Digital.<\/p>\n",
