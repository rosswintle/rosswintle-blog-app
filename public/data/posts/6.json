                "rendered": "\n<p>Today I visited a local &#8220;Electric Vehicle Roadshow&#8221; where you could get information about eBikes, eCars, eMotorbikes, and stuff from people who sold them and owners clubs and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve long had the idea that our next car might be electric. Our current 13-year-old 1.8l petrol midi-MPV has been a superbly-reliable asset to our family life. But it&#8217;s getting old and tired (despite only 85,000 miles on it).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is that instead of one medium-sized car that we use for everything, we could get a small electric for getting round town and for longer trips where we&#8217;re not taking much luggage. Then for bigger or longer holidays we&#8217;ll just rent a bigger car. There&#8217;s no point owning a particular car because you need it&#8217;s size two or three times a year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for an electric car, charging is an issue. We don&#8217;t have a drive or garage. We have on-street parking. So if we wanted to charge something, we&#8217;d have to somehow park outside our house, and then run a cable out across the pavement!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But today, I think I was tipped over the edge with a realisation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was chatting with a chap about range and different battery capacities. He asked:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What sort of mileage do yo do?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Well, if we use the car a lot in a week it&#8217;s probably 30 miles.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;30 miles a day?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;No. 30 miles a WEEK.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HAaaaaaaannnnng on a mo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the small electric cars have a range of 120 miles. So even if we were busy and using the car a lot, we&#8217;ll charge it about once a month (assuming charge holds well).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason I had it in my head that we&#8217;d be charging this thing every other day. But the truth is that we go for days at a time without using our car. So driving to, say, a relative&#8217;s house and charging overnight every now and then, or finding a fast charger near a cafe occasionally. These are viable solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly the big blocker seems to have gone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NOW&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electric cars are still expensive. There&#8217;s an second-hand market now, which is good. And maybe that would work for us. But there&#8217;s possibly a question of: &#8220;If you&#8217;re only doing 30 miles a week, will it pay for itself? Is it good value?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might even be thinking &#8220;Why own a car at all?&#8221; and the answer really is convenience and the lack of a decent car club. Seriously, if I could borrow a car from a shared pool when I needed one I&#8217;d be on it like a shot. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don&#8217;t think &#8220;will it save us money&#8221; is a relevant question on it&#8217;s own. We don&#8217;t own a car because it&#8217;s cheap. We own a car because it gives us very flexible travel options. And anyway, currently we keep a 1.8l petrol car on the go. \u00a3100&#8217;s in vehicle duty. \u00a3100&#8217;s in servicing. And we only use it&#8217;s size and power a few times a year. Mostly it&#8217;s wasted. It THAT good value?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is wrong thinking then let me know. Really do!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, now I&#8217;m properly looking and researching and I&#8217;m likely to become a complete EV bore. So look forward to that!<\/p>\n",

        "title": "The Electric Car Idea",
        "content": "\n<p>Today I visited a local &#8220;Electric Vehicle Roadshow&#8221; where you could get information about eBikes, eCars, eMotorbikes, and stuff from people who sold them and owners clubs and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve long had the idea that our next car might be electric. Our current 13-year-old 1.8l petrol midi-MPV has been a superbly-reliable asset to our family life. But it&#8217;s getting old and tired (despite only 85,000 miles on it).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is that instead of one medium-sized car that we use for everything, we could get a small electric for getting round town and for longer trips where we&#8217;re not taking much luggage. Then for bigger or longer holidays we&#8217;ll just rent a bigger car. There&#8217;s no point owning a particular car because you need it&#8217;s size two or three times a year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for an electric car, charging is an issue. We don&#8217;t have a drive or garage. We have on-street parking. So if we wanted to charge something, we&#8217;d have to somehow park outside our house, and then run a cable out across the pavement!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But today, I think I was tipped over the edge with a realisation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was chatting with a chap about range and different battery capacities. He asked:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What sort of mileage do yo do?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Well, if we use the car a lot in a week it&#8217;s probably 30 miles.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;30 miles a day?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;No. 30 miles a WEEK.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HAaaaaaaannnnng on a mo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the small electric cars have a range of 120 miles. So even if we were busy and using the car a lot, we&#8217;ll charge it about once a month (assuming charge holds well).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason I had it in my head that we&#8217;d be charging this thing every other day. But the truth is that we go for days at a time without using our car. So driving to, say, a relative&#8217;s house and charging overnight every now and then, or finding a fast charger near a cafe occasionally. These are viable solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly the big blocker seems to have gone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NOW&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electric cars are still expensive. There&#8217;s an second-hand market now, which is good. And maybe that would work for us. But there&#8217;s possibly a question of: &#8220;If you&#8217;re only doing 30 miles a week, will it pay for itself? Is it good value?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might even be thinking &#8220;Why own a car at all?&#8221; and the answer really is convenience and the lack of a decent car club. Seriously, if I could borrow a car from a shared pool when I needed one I&#8217;d be on it like a shot. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don&#8217;t think &#8220;will it save us money&#8221; is a relevant question on it&#8217;s own. We don&#8217;t own a car because it&#8217;s cheap. We own a car because it gives us very flexible travel options. And anyway, currently we keep a 1.8l petrol car on the go. \u00a3100&#8217;s in vehicle duty. \u00a3100&#8217;s in servicing. And we only use it&#8217;s size and power a few times a year. Mostly it&#8217;s wasted. It THAT good value?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is wrong thinking then let me know. Really do!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, now I&#8217;m properly looking and researching and I&#8217;m likely to become a complete EV bore. So look forward to that!<\/p>\n",

If you want to understand why, see thing number 7<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you didn&#8217;t already: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-1\/\">read part 1<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-invest-in-tools-but-only-those-you-actually-need\">6. Invest in tools (but only those you actually need)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a job like mine you spend may hours at a desk, working at a computer, using a mouse and keyboard, looking at a screen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a hobby.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in the same way that a builder or decorator will spend good money buying decent power tools, I learned to see the things on my desk as my tools. And that they were worth spending extra on so that they were reliable, fast, powerful, and long-lasting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT\u2026 you don\u2019t need to go over the top. I see so much \u201cdesk\/setup porn\u201d and it frustrates me because I\u2019m sure so much of this is not actually what many peoples\u2019 desks look like when they work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reckon that only people with really tidy, fancy, expensive setups will share them. You don\u2019t see the less-fancy desks of many, many people who are busy and who are tucked away in the corner of ordinary bedrooms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, invest in good tools, but don\u2019t go overboard just because of what you see on Instagram or what the person who made that expensive video course had. You can waste an awful lot of money on things you don&#8217;t need too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-estimating-isn-t-that-hard-managing-scope-creep-is\">7. Estimating isn\u2019t THAT hard. Managing scope creep is.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I got pretty good at estimating how long it would take to do things I\u2019d been asked to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the things I hadn\u2019t been asked to do that were tricky.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8-freelancers-help-each-other\">8. Freelancers help each other<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019d think people running similar businesses would compete heavily against each other. And I\u2019m sure there are places where this happens. But in general I\u2019ve found freelancers and agency owners to be incredibly helpful and collaborative and supportive of each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess if you run a business you know what it\u2019s like to run a business. If you\u2019re a web developer, you know what it\u2019s like to be a web developer. You understand the struggles. And any reasonable person is going to have empathy and be supportive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, I was amazed at how much cheering on there was, and I like to think I did my bit sharing, mentoring, encouraging and cheering others on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9-niching-is-helpful-at-least-it-was-for-me\">9. Niching is helpful (at least, it was for me!)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s debate about operating your business in a niche, be it in an industry sector or geographic location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I, personally, found it very helpful to have a sector that I worked in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got referrals within that sector. I built up an understanding of the needs of the sector. I attended sector-specific events and joined sector-specific Slack and Facebook groups. I built up a personal profile and contacts in that sector. It meant I could focus a bit, and be especially interested in what my clients were doing, AND be extra helpful when work did come in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"10-people-are-everything\">10. People are EVERYTHING<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, you will work FOR people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will work WITH people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People may work for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will use the things you make (or, if you get it wrong, they may choose not to).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will send you work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will review your work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to be good at people stuff. You have to have empathy. You have to be good at communication. You have to be able to listen. And sometimes lead or take charge of a situation (even when it doesn\u2019t feel like your job to).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\u2019t just be a tech freelancer. People are always at the heart of every project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-part-three\">In part three&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This got really out of hand didn&#8217;t it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m still gonna write more.

If you want to understand why, see thing number 7<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you didn&#8217;t already: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-1\/\">read part 1<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-invest-in-tools-but-only-those-you-actually-need\">6. Invest in tools (but only those you actually need)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a job like mine you spend may hours at a desk, working at a computer, using a mouse and keyboard, looking at a screen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a hobby.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in the same way that a builder or decorator will spend good money buying decent power tools, I learned to see the things on my desk as my tools. And that they were worth spending extra on so that they were reliable, fast, powerful, and long-lasting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT\u2026 you don\u2019t need to go over the top. I see so much \u201cdesk\/setup porn\u201d and it frustrates me because I\u2019m sure so much of this is not actually what many peoples\u2019 desks look like when they work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reckon that only people with really tidy, fancy, expensive setups will share them. You don\u2019t see the less-fancy desks of many, many people who are busy and who are tucked away in the corner of ordinary bedrooms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, invest in good tools, but don\u2019t go overboard just because of what you see on Instagram or what the person who made that expensive video course had. You can waste an awful lot of money on things you don&#8217;t need too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-estimating-isn-t-that-hard-managing-scope-creep-is\">7. Estimating isn\u2019t THAT hard. Managing scope creep is.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I got pretty good at estimating how long it would take to do things I\u2019d been asked to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the things I hadn\u2019t been asked to do that were tricky.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8-freelancers-help-each-other\">8. Freelancers help each other<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019d think people running similar businesses would compete heavily against each other. And I\u2019m sure there are places where this happens. But in general I\u2019ve found freelancers and agency owners to be incredibly helpful and collaborative and supportive of each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess if you run a business you know what it\u2019s like to run a business. If you\u2019re a web developer, you know what it\u2019s like to be a web developer. You understand the struggles. And any reasonable person is going to have empathy and be supportive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, I was amazed at how much cheering on there was, and I like to think I did my bit sharing, mentoring, encouraging and cheering others on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9-niching-is-helpful-at-least-it-was-for-me\">9. Niching is helpful (at least, it was for me!)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s debate about operating your business in a niche, be it in an industry sector or geographic location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I, personally, found it very helpful to have a sector that I worked in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got referrals within that sector. I built up an understanding of the needs of the sector. I attended sector-specific events and joined sector-specific Slack and Facebook groups. I built up a personal profile and contacts in that sector. It meant I could focus a bit, and be especially interested in what my clients were doing, AND be extra helpful when work did come in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"10-people-are-everything\">10. People are EVERYTHING<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, you will work FOR people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will work WITH people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People may work for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will use the things you make (or, if you get it wrong, they may choose not to).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will send you work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will review your work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to be good at people stuff.

But enjoy these learnings&#8230;<\/em> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-2\/\">part 2<\/a> and a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/10\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-part-3\/\">part 3<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a Saturday (when I\u2019m writing &#8211; it will probably take a few days to write and publish this) and I realised yesterday that I have ten working days left of freelancing after more than ten years of working for myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps I should share some &#8220;wisdom&#8221; I&#8217;ve gained in doing this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few caveats\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I\u2019ve occupied a particular space in freelancing where people are really nice to each other and help each other out; where clients pay invoices quickly and people are forgiving of your work situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not sure if this is the ONLY freelancing space out there. Perhaps there is a darker side of it with highly-competitive people who are cut-throat in their approach, stingy with both money and time, and rude and unpleasant? But I\u2019ve not come across it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, if there is more than one freelancing culture, I\u2019m not sure if I landed in this particular freelancing space by chance, or because I subconsciously am drawn to people who operate in the same ways that I try to. Did I engineer where I landed somehow?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of how I got here, here\u2019s some things I learned along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-never-say-never\">1. Never say never<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I always said there are two things I would never do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is move back to home town of Swindon after leaving it aged 18.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the second was work for myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My parents (who still live in Swindon and are the most wonderfully supportive, generous and lovely people) ran a successful business that they loved and put so much into, but I saw how stressful it could be at times. And I didn\u2019t want that stress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT\u2026 it turns out employment can be stressful too. And I ended up leaving it to do my own thing\u2026 shortly after moving back to my home town!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ran my business my own way, I learned lots from my folks, both what works and what doesn\u2019t &#8211; for me at least!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did freelancing and self-employment my own way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at someone else and saying \u201cI don\u2019t want that\u201d is one thing, but ruling out a whole class of things based on a single experience is not really helpful. You can put your own twist on a thing that someone else has done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t say \u201cnever\u201d based on what you see someone else doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(But also, ALWAYS be as kind and generous and supportive as my parents!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-it-doesn-t-have-to-be-forever\">2. It doesn\u2019t have to be forever<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some have asked why I\u2019m stopping freelancing. But to understand that it\u2019s helpful to understand why I started and continued for so long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The world I left was corporate IT world. Corporate IT world was really not for me. I had an amazing boss and immediate team, and it paid well, but leadership higher up seemed very questionable, or, at least, incompatible with my own sensibilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after I left employment we found out we were having our first kid. And a big reason I kept at freelancing was that I wanted the flexibility to spend time with my kids when they were young. And I wanted my wife to continue her career too, as well as being an awesome mum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve taken full advantage of the flexibility of freelance life. I\u2019ve worked part-time-ish. I\u2019ve done the school and nursery run. I\u2019ve been dad a lot!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So two things that have nudged me back into employment:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Now that both kids are at school (pandemic depending! ?) I don\u2019t need the flexibility as much. In fact, it\u2019s arguable that being freelance means I actually get LESS quality time with them now, because I\u2019m often still in work mode once school is finished.<\/li><li>The realisation that not all suitable employment is in corporate IT. There are companies out there that are small, friendly, somewhat flexible, doing great work, successful and that pay well.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve had in my head a (very!) short list of companies that I\u2019d love to work for for a while, and I\u2019ve kinda been winding down the freelancing to a point where I could more easily take a job should the right one come up (take note &#8211; freelancing has lock in!).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when the perfect job description came up at one of these companies, I HAD to give it a punt. And here I am! Contract signed and ready to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s the right job, for the right company, and at the right time for me. All the stars aligned. Hooray!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So freelancing doesn&#8217;t have to be your long term plan. There is probably a ramping-up period, and maybe a ramping-down one too. But you can go back to employment without shame or feeling like a failure. There can be really positive reasons to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-i-don-t-know-what-burnout-is-but-it-s-probably-real\">3. I don\u2019t know what \u201cburnout\u201d is but it\u2019s probably real<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I hear lots of people talking about burnout, but I\u2019ve never heard a succinct definition of it that made sense to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, when I started applying for this dream job, I started thinking about what it would be like to have one client. One person I was ultimately accountable to. One set of communication and project management tools and processes. No leads to find and follow. No proposals to write. No sub-contractors to find and manage. No self-marketing to do. Way less \u201cadmin\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I had this kind of anticipatory relief in my heart. A peace in my soul. An almost physical relaxation in my body at the thought of what it would be like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the feeling made me ask: Am I burned out on freelancing?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is burnout one of those things that you know when you see it. If it looks like burnout and it quacks like burnout, it\u2019s probably burnout?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Note to future boss: I\u2019m under no illusion that \u201cemployment\u201d won\u2019t have its own unique set of challenges, and I\u2019ll still have to do some of the things listed above. It will just be very different! I\u2019m totally ready for it!!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-you-define-success\">4. YOU define success<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is huge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Success doesn\u2019t have to be all about money. Or fame. Or growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think it does then you\u2019re reading the wrong article. You\u2019re not my tribe. Stop wasting your time now. Go read something else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Success can be flexibility. It can be having fun and enjoying your work. It can be choosing who you work for. It can be continuously learning and defining your own career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I\u2019ve not made a ton of money. I\u2019m hardly <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tom_hirst\">Tom Hirst<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jonathanstark\">Jonathan Stark<\/a>. But I kept paying the bills and feeding the family while doing something I enjoy.<\/li><li>I could have worked more paid hours. But I took advantage of the flexibility to spend time with family.<\/li><li>I spent time learning new things and honing my craft as well as working on paid projects. Unpaid side projects have been huge for me to keep me interested and to define the way forward.<\/li><li>I did good work for good clients who respected me and paid me well. I could probably have taken bigger gigs with bigger clients in different sectors, but I liked who I was working with.<\/li><li>I made friends and was able to make a mark on my little online world in my own unique little ways.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Bootstrapping a small, sustainable business that keeps you going, with no debt or investment, with zero employees, with no plans to grow, with revenue that changes according to your circumstances, is fine. Hourly billing is fine. Not building a SaaS or product is fine. Dips in annual revenue are fine (as long as it\u2019s expected and not a trend!). Doing work for free is fine (in some carefully thought through cases).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look at what others are doing and be inspired. Look at what others say to do, and not to do, but don\u2019t blindly follow. Consider advice (even this advice!) and weigh it against your own circumstances and goals. But remember that you are not them. This is your journey. You are unique and your business is unique.

Trust your instincts &#8211; but also: understand business<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Early on I had an enquiry from a person who wanted to make \u201cFacebook for &lt;thing&gt;\u201d. His business model involved selling effectively, stickers, that had links to profiles on Facebook-for-thing. He had no money, and was offering me a share of profits of a non-existent business with what looked like a very iffy business plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years later in I had a conversation with someone that wanted help with a platform that put ads around videos because he thought that he was better at putting ads around videos than YouTube were.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One time I was pitching to a medium-sized-charity client who were getting \u201chelp\u201d from a financial services firm. This firm had put some security requirements in place that were more suited to financial services than to a medium sized charity. We pushed back and pretty much all the requirements were dropped.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, these projects were full of huge red flags. We actually won and delivered the third example, and it was one of my best pieces of work. The point is: I learned to trust my instincts when talking to potential clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think I also learned that I had developed good instincts by having a very basic understanding of business. Perhaps from sitting on my mums lap while she filled in paper-based ledger sheets (think paper-based spreadsheets) all those years ago. Perhaps from being overly obsessed with watching Dragon\u2019s Den on telly. Who knows?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Briefs that are too short. Briefs that are too long. Questions answered with \u201cthat\u2019s just what we\u2019ve decided to do\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s what the boss wants\u201d. Arbitrary hard deadlines (launching an advent calendar on Dec 1st is one thing, launching a new website on January 17th is another). &#8220;We\u2019ll pay you with the profits.&#8221;, &#8220;Our previous developer has stopped working on it.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all red flags.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to ask:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Will there be money to pay me?<\/li><li>Is this idea REALLY viable? Have you REALLY thought it through?<\/li><li>Why is the deadline fixed? And what happens if we&#8217;re heading towards it and aren&#8217;t finished?<\/li><li>Are the requirements really appropriate for the project?<\/li><li>Why did the previous developer stop working on the project?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You learn what to look for. And yes, it\u2019s not only acceptable to say \u201cNo\u201d, you really SHOULD say \u201cNo\u201d if you feel the project isn\u2019t for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"more-to-come\">More to come&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, that&#8217;s part 1 done. You can now <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-2\/\">read part 2<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have some titles for part 2 to tease. And if you&#8217;re mathsy\/computery you may note that I didn&#8217;t state what number base &#8220;10&#8221; is &#8211; there may not be ten learnings here. So hopefully I&#8217;ll soon write about some or all of the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Invest in tools (but only those you actually need)<\/li><li>Freelancers help each other<\/li><li>People are EVERYTHING<\/li><li>Business vs personal branding<\/li><li>You get freedom &#8211; you lose freedom<\/li><li>It\u2019s not for everyone<\/li><li>Curiosity is the superpower<\/li><li>Be a jack of all trades, but a master of one<\/li><\/ul>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>This is part 1. The first five things. I got it written and wanted to post it. I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ll get to write part two. But enjoy these learnings&#8230;<\/em> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-2\/\">part 2<\/a> and a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/10\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-part-3\/\">part 3<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a Saturday (when I\u2019m writing &#8211; it will probably take a few days to write and publish this) and I realised yesterday that I have ten working days left of freelancing after more than ten years of working for myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps I should share some &#8220;wisdom&#8221; I&#8217;ve gained in doing this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few caveats\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I\u2019ve occupied a particular space in freelancing where people are really nice to each other and help each other out; where clients pay invoices quickly and people are forgiving of your work situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not sure if this is the ONLY freelancing space out there. Perhaps there is a darker side of it with highly-competitive people who are cut-throat in their approach, stingy with both money and time, and rude and unpleasant? But I\u2019ve not come across it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, if there is more than one freelancing culture, I\u2019m not sure if I landed in this particular freelancing space by chance, or because I subconsciously am drawn to people who operate in the same ways that I try to. Did I engineer where I landed somehow?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of how I got here, here\u2019s some things I learned along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-never-say-never\">1. Never say never<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I always said there are two things I would never do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is move back to home town of Swindon after leaving it aged 18.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the second was work for myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My parents (who still live in Swindon and are the most wonderfully supportive, generous and lovely people) ran a successful business that they loved and put so much into, but I saw how stressful it could be at times. And I didn\u2019t want that stress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT\u2026 it turns out employment can be stressful too. And I ended up leaving it to do my own thing\u2026 shortly after moving back to my home town!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ran my business my own way, I learned lots from my folks, both what works and what doesn\u2019t &#8211; for me at least!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did freelancing and self-employment my own way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at someone else and saying \u201cI don\u2019t want that\u201d is one thing, but ruling out a whole class of things based on a single experience is not really helpful. You can put your own twist on a thing that someone else has done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t say \u201cnever\u201d based on what you see someone else doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(But also, ALWAYS be as kind and generous and supportive as my parents!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-it-doesn-t-have-to-be-forever\">2. It doesn\u2019t have to be forever<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some have asked why I\u2019m stopping freelancing. But to understand that it\u2019s helpful to understand why I started and continued for so long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The world I left was corporate IT world. Corporate IT world was really not for me. I had an amazing boss and immediate team, and it paid well, but leadership higher up seemed very questionable, or, at least, incompatible with my own sensibilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after I left employment we found out we were having our first kid. And a big reason I kept at freelancing was that I wanted the flexibility to spend time with my kids when they were young. And I wanted my wife to continue her career too, as well as being an awesome mum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve taken full advantage of the flexibility of freelance life. I\u2019ve worked part-time-ish. I\u2019ve done the school and nursery run. I\u2019ve been dad a lot!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So two things that have nudged me back into employment:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Now that both kids are at school (pandemic depending! ?) I don\u2019t need the flexibility as much. In fact, it\u2019s arguable that being freelance means I actually get LESS quality time with them now, because I\u2019m often still in work mode once school is finished.<\/li><li>The realisation that not all suitable employment is in corporate IT. There are companies out there that are small, friendly, somewhat flexible, doing great work, successful and that pay well.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve had in my head a (very!) short list of companies that I\u2019d love to work for for a while, and I\u2019ve kinda been winding down the freelancing to a point where I could more easily take a job should the right one come up (take note &#8211; freelancing has lock in!).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when the perfect job description came up at one of these companies, I HAD to give it a punt. And here I am! Contract signed and ready to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s the right job, for the right company, and at the right time for me. All the stars aligned. Hooray!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So freelancing doesn&#8217;t have to be your long term plan. There is probably a ramping-up period, and maybe a ramping-down one too. But you can go back to employment without shame or feeling like a failure. There can be really positive reasons to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-i-don-t-know-what-burnout-is-but-it-s-probably-real\">3. I don\u2019t know what \u201cburnout\u201d is but it\u2019s probably real<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I hear lots of people talking about burnout, but I\u2019ve never heard a succinct definition of it that made sense to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, when I started applying for this dream job, I started thinking about what it would be like to have one client. One person I was ultimately accountable to. One set of communication and project management tools and processes. No leads to find and follow. No proposals to write. No sub-contractors to find and manage. No self-marketing to do. Way less \u201cadmin\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I had this kind of anticipatory relief in my heart. A peace in my soul. An almost physical relaxation in my body at the thought of what it would be like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the feeling made me ask: Am I burned out on freelancing?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is burnout one of those things that you know when you see it. If it looks like burnout and it quacks like burnout, it\u2019s probably burnout?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Note to future boss: I\u2019m under no illusion that \u201cemployment\u201d won\u2019t have its own unique set of challenges, and I\u2019ll still have to do some of the things listed above. It will just be very different! I\u2019m totally ready for it!!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-you-define-success\">4. YOU define success<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is huge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Success doesn\u2019t have to be all about money. Or fame. Or growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think it does then you\u2019re reading the wrong article. You\u2019re not my tribe. Stop wasting your time now. Go read something else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Success can be flexibility. It can be having fun and enjoying your work. It can be choosing who you work for. It can be continuously learning and defining your own career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I\u2019ve not made a ton of money. I\u2019m hardly <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tom_hirst\">Tom Hirst<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jonathanstark\">Jonathan Stark<\/a>. But I kept paying the bills and feeding the family while doing something I enjoy.<\/li><li>I could have worked more paid hours.

Hourly billing is fine. Not building a SaaS or product is fine. Dips in annual revenue are fine (as long as it\u2019s expected and not a trend!). Doing work for free is fine (in some carefully thought through cases).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look at what others are doing and be inspired. Look at what others say to do, and not to do, but don\u2019t blindly follow. Consider advice (even this advice!) and weigh it against your own circumstances and goals. But remember that you are not them. This is your journey. You are unique and your business is unique.

Trust your instincts &#8211; but also: understand business<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Early on I had an enquiry from a person who wanted to make \u201cFacebook for &lt;thing&gt;\u201d. His business model involved selling effectively, stickers, that had links to profiles on Facebook-for-thing. He had no money, and was offering me a share of profits of a non-existent business with what looked like a very iffy business plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years later in I had a conversation with someone that wanted help with a platform that put ads around videos because he thought that he was better at putting ads around videos than YouTube were.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One time I was pitching to a medium-sized-charity client who were getting \u201chelp\u201d from a financial services firm. This firm had put some security requirements in place that were more suited to financial services than to a medium sized charity. We pushed back and pretty much all the requirements were dropped.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, these projects were full of huge red flags. We actually won and delivered the third example, and it was one of my best pieces of work. The point is: I learned to trust my instincts when talking to potential clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think I also learned that I had developed good instincts by having a very basic understanding of business. Perhaps from sitting on my mums lap while she filled in paper-based ledger sheets (think paper-based spreadsheets) all those years ago. Perhaps from being overly obsessed with watching Dragon\u2019s Den on telly. Who knows?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Briefs that are too short. Briefs that are too long. Questions answered with \u201cthat\u2019s just what we\u2019ve decided to do\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s what the boss wants\u201d. Arbitrary hard deadlines (launching an advent calendar on Dec 1st is one thing, launching a new website on January 17th is another). &#8220;We\u2019ll pay you with the profits.&#8221;, &#8220;Our previous developer has stopped working on it.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all red flags.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to ask:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Will there be money to pay me?<\/li><li>Is this idea REALLY viable? Have you REALLY thought it through?<\/li><li>Why is the deadline fixed? And what happens if we&#8217;re heading towards it and aren&#8217;t finished?<\/li><li>Are the requirements really appropriate for the project?<\/li><li>Why did the previous developer stop working on the project?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You learn what to look for. And yes, it\u2019s not only acceptable to say \u201cNo\u201d, you really SHOULD say \u201cNo\u201d if you feel the project isn\u2019t for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"more-to-come\">More to come&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, that&#8217;s part 1 done. You can now <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-2\/\">read part 2<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have some titles for part 2 to tease.

If you use a tool like Spotlight or Alfred on the Mac, or the command palette in your code editor to get stuff done, then you&#8217;ll appreciate the speed and convenience of navigating WordPress with the keyboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/565100424?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can try it out for free on WordPress sites with <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/turbo-admin\/\">the plugin version<\/a> available in the WordPress.org repository.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The browser extension works on most modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge (and other Chromium-based browsers). But, importantly, NOT on Safari (yet).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why might you want the browser extension version? Simply, it works on (almost) all WordPress sites without needing to install the plugin! It&#8217;s like magic and is always there when you need it. On your own sites, on your client sites, on sites you&#8217;re auditing or supporting. It even supports multisite!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s probably a tool that you don&#8217;t know that you need. But for some people, once you&#8217;ve tried it, there&#8217;s no going back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The extension is $35 (plus local taxes) and that&#8217;s a simple, one-off purchase. You can use the extension in up to 6 different browsers (for example, 2 computers with Firefox, Chrome and Edge on both of them). You can use it for as long as it works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll try to keep it updated &#8211; I use it myself, so that&#8217;s a strong incentive! &#8211; but I&#8217;m not making any guarantees on updates or support. I&#8217;m kinda selling it as-is and keeping things simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to give it some broad permissions in your browser to make it work, but other than collecting the sales information and the license activation, I do not track your usage of it at all. There may be an occasional ping to a server to check your license is still valid but that is it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m anticipating some questions or raised eyebrows about this so here&#8217;s some additional info about how it works and why I&#8217;m using this business model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why a single purchase?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my first software product. I am viewing it as an &#8220;asset&#8221;. Something I&#8217;ve made that I believe has value for other power users like myself. I figured I&#8217;d try selling it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don&#8217;t see it as SO useful that people will want to pay a subscription. Plus, subscriptions come with a much higher expectation of support and ongoing development, which, as a busy solo developer I simply can&#8217;t guarantee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I may, at some point, release a new version of it that is a paid upgrade, or uses a subscription. But let&#8217;s see what people think of v1 and how successful it is. Some ideas for the future roadmap are below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is Cmd\/Ctrl-Alt-Shift-P the default shortcut?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, to avoid clashing with other pre-defined browser shortcuts. I really wanted Cmd-Shift-P, like some text editors use, but this opens a Private Browsing window in Firefox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can set your own keyboard shortcut in the settings for the extension. Just try not to pick something that the browser already uses or it won&#8217;t work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why does the extension need such broad permissions?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I promise this extension does nothing naughty or bad. It needs to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Inspect the page and HTTP request headers to see if this is a site it should add the command palette to.<\/li><li>Add the JavaScript onto the page to make the palette work. (This is done at page-load time in the browser, nothing is saved to your database! I&#8217;m not adding JS to your content!)<\/li><li>Save settings in local storage (local to the extension).<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The extension doesn&#8217;t need keyboard permissions, but the JavaScript that gets injected onto the page does intercept keystrokes, by it&#8217;s very nature, to see when you&#8217;ve pressed the shortcut to activate the palette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How secure is it though?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, all it&#8217;s doing is simulating clicks on menu items. And it&#8217;s only doing that when you ask it to. It&#8217;s just another way of doing things that you are already able to do with the mouse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could another script take control of Turbo Admin and hijack it? Well, yeah. But that same script could just scrape the DOM for links and simulate clicks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future it may simulate other &#8220;events&#8221; on the page, but this will always be doing things that you already have permissions do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s no less safe than what you already have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the &#8220;(almost)&#8221; in &#8220;(almost) all your WordPress sites&#8221; for?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Turbo Admin uses a variety of techniques to detect a WordPress site. But some installs may have removed some of the bits of information that it uses, and so it may not work on all WordPress sites. But it should work on most of them!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does the browser extension do anything that the plugin doesn&#8217;t?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s funny that you ask. Because it does one neat trick that the plugin can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a neat little convenience, and sometimes it doesn&#8217;t quite work properly. But&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the extension can inspect headers, it can sometimes detect a WordPress site when you are not logged in. And it will try to guess the login URL and give you a pop-up login link when you activate the command palette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-1024x538.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of WordPress website with the Turbo Admin overlay showing the Log in link.\" class=\"wp-image-10292\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-1024x538.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-300x158.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-768x403.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-1536x806.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-2048x1075.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It has to guess because, for good security reasons, WordPress sites don&#8217;t generally advertise their login URL&#8217;s. And the code doesn&#8217;t always guess right. So, try it, but it might not work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s on the future roadmap?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are, broadly, two big directions this extension could head off in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. More WordPress admin improvements!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first interesting possibility that Turbo Admin gives us is the ability to enhance ALL your WordPress sites in different ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main thing I want to do is make use of the WordPress REST API so that you can search and access posts, pages and so on, and get directly to editing content from the command palette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I could inject other JavaScript modules to improve the WordPress Dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thought I had was that, rather than using the command palette, you could create keyboard shortcuts for common actions in WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The demo below uses Cmd-Alt-P followed by another key to get to various places. So Cmd-Alt-P then P takes you to the posts list. Cmd-Alt-P then U takes you to users. Cmd-Alt-P then D takes you to the Dashboard. The screen recorder only recorded the Cmd-Alt-P bits, not the secondary key-press.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/565100710?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"342\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption>Keyboard Shortcuts with Turbo Admin<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another feature idea was inspired by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.binarymoon.co.uk\/2021\/06\/take-control-of-wordpress-plugin-and-theme-notifications\/\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a> adding a notifications-tidying system to his excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-toolbelt\/\">Toolbelt plugin<\/a>. I thought &#8220;I can do that with Turbo Admin&#8221;. And promptly put together a little prototype of that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/565103088?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"392\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption>Notification tidying with Turbo Admin<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thought I&#8217;ve had is that you could permanently disable the block editor&#8217;s full-screen mode. Basically, if you can make an admin tweak with just JS and\/or CSS, then there&#8217;s a possibility I can build it into Turbo Admin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember: I can build these into the plugin, but with the browser extension you&#8217;ll get this on ANY WordPress site that you log into!! It really does feel like magic to me, and I made the darned thing!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Turbo Admin for All The Things<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second idea is that this could be a single browser extension that can:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>detect what sort of site you are on using HTTP headers, URLs or some custom function;<\/li><li>inject a command palette script on page load;<\/li><li>include pre-set commands or;<\/li><li>detect available commands by scraping the DOM or by loading a config from a file or API.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is pretty powerful. I&#8217;ve built in the ability to extend it with simple configurations that can work on other applications or sites. It&#8217;s not perfect, but I&#8217;ve had prototypes of this working on cPanel, Laravel Forge, and even for selecting folders in GMail!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Turbo Admin on Laravel Forge\" class=\"wp-image-10293\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-1536x807.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-2048x1076.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Trying out Turbo Admin on Laravel Forge<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"390\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-1024x390.jpg\" alt=\"Turbo Admin prototype working on GMail\" class=\"wp-image-10294\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-1024x390.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-300x114.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-768x292.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-1536x584.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-2048x779.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Trying out Turbo Admin on GMail<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a single extension that speeds up work across a variety of sites seems like a cool thing.

        "content": "\n<p>It took much longer than I thought, but finally, the <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin browser extension<\/a> is here!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives you fast, keyboard-activated access to your WordPress dashboard&#8217;s menu items without needing to install a plugin. If you use a tool like Spotlight or Alfred on the Mac, or the command palette in your code editor to get stuff done, then you&#8217;ll appreciate the speed and convenience of navigating WordPress with the keyboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/565100424?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can try it out for free on WordPress sites with <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/turbo-admin\/\">the plugin version<\/a> available in the WordPress.org repository.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The browser extension works on most modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge (and other Chromium-based browsers). But, importantly, NOT on Safari (yet).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why might you want the browser extension version? Simply, it works on (almost) all WordPress sites without needing to install the plugin! It&#8217;s like magic and is always there when you need it. On your own sites, on your client sites, on sites you&#8217;re auditing or supporting. It even supports multisite!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s probably a tool that you don&#8217;t know that you need. But for some people, once you&#8217;ve tried it, there&#8217;s no going back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The extension is $35 (plus local taxes) and that&#8217;s a simple, one-off purchase. You can use the extension in up to 6 different browsers (for example, 2 computers with Firefox, Chrome and Edge on both of them). You can use it for as long as it works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll try to keep it updated &#8211; I use it myself, so that&#8217;s a strong incentive! &#8211; but I&#8217;m not making any guarantees on updates or support. I&#8217;m kinda selling it as-is and keeping things simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to give it some broad permissions in your browser to make it work, but other than collecting the sales information and the license activation, I do not track your usage of it at all. There may be an occasional ping to a server to check your license is still valid but that is it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m anticipating some questions or raised eyebrows about this so here&#8217;s some additional info about how it works and why I&#8217;m using this business model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why a single purchase?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my first software product. I am viewing it as an &#8220;asset&#8221;. Something I&#8217;ve made that I believe has value for other power users like myself. I figured I&#8217;d try selling it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don&#8217;t see it as SO useful that people will want to pay a subscription. Plus, subscriptions come with a much higher expectation of support and ongoing development, which, as a busy solo developer I simply can&#8217;t guarantee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I may, at some point, release a new version of it that is a paid upgrade, or uses a subscription. But let&#8217;s see what people think of v1 and how successful it is. Some ideas for the future roadmap are below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is Cmd\/Ctrl-Alt-Shift-P the default shortcut?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, to avoid clashing with other pre-defined browser shortcuts. I really wanted Cmd-Shift-P, like some text editors use, but this opens a Private Browsing window in Firefox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can set your own keyboard shortcut in the settings for the extension. Just try not to pick something that the browser already uses or it won&#8217;t work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why does the extension need such broad permissions?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I promise this extension does nothing naughty or bad. It needs to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Inspect the page and HTTP request headers to see if this is a site it should add the command palette to.<\/li><li>Add the JavaScript onto the page to make the palette work. (This is done at page-load time in the browser, nothing is saved to your database! I&#8217;m not adding JS to your content!)<\/li><li>Save settings in local storage (local to the extension).<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The extension doesn&#8217;t need keyboard permissions, but the JavaScript that gets injected onto the page does intercept keystrokes, by it&#8217;s very nature, to see when you&#8217;ve pressed the shortcut to activate the palette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How secure is it though?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, all it&#8217;s doing is simulating clicks on menu items. And it&#8217;s only doing that when you ask it to. It&#8217;s just another way of doing things that you are already able to do with the mouse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could another script take control of Turbo Admin and hijack it? Well, yeah. But that same script could just scrape the DOM for links and simulate clicks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future it may simulate other &#8220;events&#8221; on the page, but this will always be doing things that you already have permissions do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s no less safe than what you already have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the &#8220;(almost)&#8221; in &#8220;(almost) all your WordPress sites&#8221; for?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Turbo Admin uses a variety of techniques to detect a WordPress site. But some installs may have removed some of the bits of information that it uses, and so it may not work on all WordPress sites. But it should work on most of them!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does the browser extension do anything that the plugin doesn&#8217;t?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s funny that you ask. Because it does one neat trick that the plugin can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a neat little convenience, and sometimes it doesn&#8217;t quite work properly. But&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the extension can inspect headers, it can sometimes detect a WordPress site when you are not logged in. And it will try to guess the login URL and give you a pop-up login link when you activate the command palette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-1024x538.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of WordPress website with the Turbo Admin overlay showing the Log in link.\" class=\"wp-image-10292\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-1024x538.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-300x158.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-768x403.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-1536x806.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-2048x1075.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It has to guess because, for good security reasons, WordPress sites don&#8217;t generally advertise their login URL&#8217;s. And the code doesn&#8217;t always guess right. So, try it, but it might not work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s on the future roadmap?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are, broadly, two big directions this extension could head off in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. More WordPress admin improvements!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first interesting possibility that Turbo Admin gives us is the ability to enhance ALL your WordPress sites in different ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main thing I want to do is make use of the WordPress REST API so that you can search and access posts, pages and so on, and get directly to editing content from the command palette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I could inject other JavaScript modules to improve the WordPress Dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thought I had was that, rather than using the command palette, you could create keyboard shortcuts for common actions in WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The demo below uses Cmd-Alt-P followed by another key to get to various places. So Cmd-Alt-P then P takes you to the posts list. Cmd-Alt-P then U takes you to users. Cmd-Alt-P then D takes you to the Dashboard. The screen recorder only recorded the Cmd-Alt-P bits, not the secondary key-press.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/565100710?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"342\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption>Keyboard Shortcuts with Turbo Admin<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another feature idea was inspired by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.binarymoon.co.uk\/2021\/06\/take-control-of-wordpress-plugin-and-theme-notifications\/\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a> adding a notifications-tidying system to his excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-toolbelt\/\">Toolbelt plugin<\/a>. I thought &#8220;I can do that with Turbo Admin&#8221;. And promptly put together a little prototype of that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/565103088?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"392\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption>Notification tidying with Turbo Admin<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thought I&#8217;ve had is that you could permanently disable the block editor&#8217;s full-screen mode. Basically, if you can make an admin tweak with just JS and\/or CSS, then there&#8217;s a possibility I can build it into Turbo Admin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember: I can build these into the plugin, but with the browser extension you&#8217;ll get this on ANY WordPress site that you log into!! It really does feel like magic to me, and I made the darned thing!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Turbo Admin for All The Things<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second idea is that this could be a single browser extension that can:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>detect what sort of site you are on using HTTP headers, URLs or some custom function;<\/li><li>inject a command palette script on page load;<\/li><li>include pre-set commands or;<\/li><li>detect available commands by scraping the DOM or by loading a config from a file or API.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is pretty powerful. I&#8217;ve built in the ability to extend it with simple configurations that can work on other applications or sites. It&#8217;s not perfect, but I&#8217;ve had prototypes of this working on cPanel, Laravel Forge, and even for selecting folders in GMail!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Turbo Admin on Laravel Forge\" class=\"wp-image-10293\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-1536x807.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-2048x1076.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Trying out Turbo Admin on Laravel Forge<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"390\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-1024x390.jpg\" alt=\"Turbo Admin prototype working on GMail\" class=\"wp-image-10294\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-1024x390.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-300x114.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-768x292.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-1536x584.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-2048x779.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Trying out Turbo Admin on GMail<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a single extension that speeds up work across a variety of sites seems like a cool thing. Sites\/applications could even serve up their own config files letting Turbo Admin know what actions were available!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I&#8217;m sold &#8211; how do I buy it?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hooray! I hoped you would be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head to the <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin website<\/a>. You can purchase with a card or PayPal. Once you purchase you will be sent full instructions, the Chrome\/Chromium install link, and the Firefox download.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really hope you enjoy it, get hooked on using it, and tell all your WordPress friends!<\/p>\n",

But while making <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a> I wanted to make a really simple landing page. I wanted to use TailwindCSS, because I can work quickly with that and use <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\">TailwindUI<\/a>. And to use Tailwind properly you kinda need to have &#8220;components&#8221;, or at least &#8220;template partials&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I kinda needed a way to do &#8220;HTML includes&#8221;. Which is a thing that doesn&#8217;t exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I put the feelers out for a SUPER simple solution for doing this. Ideally I wanted to avoid a huge <code>node_modules<\/code> folder, and a tool that would at some point require me to downgrade node by three versions just to update a CSS class or change a hyperlink.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Responses to this were:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>FlightPHP &#8211; Micro-framework. Does routing, but not static output. via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BinaryMoon\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a>.<\/li><li>The <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/objects-in-space\/considering-a-static-site-tool-learn-gulp-2fd5f9821fc4\">Gulp-only approach<\/a> &#8211; Needs Gulp. Will probably break at some point. Also via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BinaryMoon\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a>.<\/li><li>Jekyll &#8211; Tried it before. Didn&#8217;t like it.

This is a basic function of PHP isn&#8217;t it? This is just <code>&lt;?php include('some_partial.php') ?&gt;<\/code>. Can&#8217;t I just run PHP on the command line to transform files? I&#8217;ll probably have PHP installed forever anyway, and it&#8217;s very unlikely to break. Is PHP not the magic I need?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/edwario\/status\/1393275855829274625\">Scott Edward Carver<\/a> backed me up: &#8220;I sometimes use a build process which runs php files in the root directory, outputs to an .html of the same name&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>YES SCOTT!!!! THANK YOU!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ryangjchandler\">Ryan Chandler<\/a> (who is literally one of the most helpful and prolific people on the PHP internet) then chipped in with: <code>extract($data); include __DIR__.'\/path\/to\/view.php; \/\/ ;)<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out Ryan has built a quick-and-dirty vanilla-PHP-based static site generator script in the past. He called his <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ryangjchandler\/mink\">Mink<\/a>, and describes it as: &#8220;It&#8217;s disgusting really. Using globals, you can only call <code>extend()<\/code> at the very end of a template file. You have to define the name of a slot in the <code>stop<\/code> function.&#8221; And he says it&#8217;s &#8220;for educational purposes (obvs)&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it turns out that while Ryan was trying to find where he had a lefotver copy of this script so I could see it, I was already building something VERY similar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, yeah, I guess it is &#8220;disgusting&#8221;. But it works a charm and totally fulfills my criteria:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Super-simple<\/li><li>Constraints that I&#8217;m 100% happy with<\/li><li>Ability to extend a layout template of your choosing, and pass data to it<\/li><li>Ability to include partials and pass data to them<\/li><li>Ability to have &#8220;environment variables&#8221;<\/li><li>Simple build process<\/li><li>Minimal dependencies<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I COULD wrap this up in a fancy command line with <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel-zero.com\/\">Laravel Zero<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/erikaheidi\">Erika Heidi<\/a>&#8216;s <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/minicli\/minicli\">Mini CLI<\/a>. But I don&#8217;t need to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I COULD make this a PHP composer-installable package. But why should I?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m probably not going to update it. It&#8217;s a &#8220;finished&#8221; piece of software as far as I&#8217;m concerned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s unlikely to stop working in the near future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s keep it REALLY simple. Like I did with <a href=\"https:\/\/peekobot.github.io\/peekobot\/\">Peekobot<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just 160-odd lines of PHP in a Gist:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d\">https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take it.

        "content": "\n<p>There&#8217;s a sort-of-joke that there&#8217;s a bunch of things that all developers are supposed to code from scratch at some point in their career. A blog. A to-do list app. The &#8220;canonical&#8221; applications. And one of these is a static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve actually never built any of these things from scratch. But while making <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a> I wanted to make a really simple landing page. I wanted to use TailwindCSS, because I can work quickly with that and use <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\">TailwindUI<\/a>. And to use Tailwind properly you kinda need to have &#8220;components&#8221;, or at least &#8220;template partials&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I kinda needed a way to do &#8220;HTML includes&#8221;. Which is a thing that doesn&#8217;t exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I put the feelers out for a SUPER simple solution for doing this. Ideally I wanted to avoid a huge <code>node_modules<\/code> folder, and a tool that would at some point require me to downgrade node by three versions just to update a CSS class or change a hyperlink.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Responses to this were:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>FlightPHP &#8211; Micro-framework. Does routing, but not static output. via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BinaryMoon\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a>.<\/li><li>The <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/objects-in-space\/considering-a-static-site-tool-learn-gulp-2fd5f9821fc4\">Gulp-only approach<\/a> &#8211; Needs Gulp. Will probably break at some point. Also via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BinaryMoon\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a>.<\/li><li>Jekyll &#8211; Tried it before. Didn&#8217;t like it. Got confused by all the Ruby stuff. Also via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BinaryMoon\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a>.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/codekitapp.com\/help\/kit\/\">CodeKit<\/a> &#8211; Looks good, but needs CodeKit. ALSO via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BinaryMoon\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a>.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.11ty.dev\/\">11ty<\/a> &#8211; Which looks awesome but starts with <code>npm install<\/code>, and then I looked at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.11ty.dev\/docs\/resources\/\">the docs<\/a> and was overwhelmed. So big nope. via Pretty Much Everyone Else.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/mozilla.github.io\/nunjucks\/\">Nunjucks<\/a> &#8211; Which is a &#8220;a more sophisticated templating engine for JavaScript&#8221;, which meets neither my requirement for something super-simple, nor my desire to avoid JavaScript in the build. It probably needs something like Gulp as well. via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/richard_bell\">Richard Bell<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dogwonder\">Rich Holman<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I started to think: &#8220;Hang on a minute. This is a basic function of PHP isn&#8217;t it? This is just <code>&lt;?php include('some_partial.php') ?&gt;<\/code>. Can&#8217;t I just run PHP on the command line to transform files? I&#8217;ll probably have PHP installed forever anyway, and it&#8217;s very unlikely to break. Is PHP not the magic I need?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/edwario\/status\/1393275855829274625\">Scott Edward Carver<\/a> backed me up: &#8220;I sometimes use a build process which runs php files in the root directory, outputs to an .html of the same name&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>YES SCOTT!!!! THANK YOU!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ryangjchandler\">Ryan Chandler<\/a> (who is literally one of the most helpful and prolific people on the PHP internet) then chipped in with: <code>extract($data); include __DIR__.'\/path\/to\/view.php; \/\/ ;)<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out Ryan has built a quick-and-dirty vanilla-PHP-based static site generator script in the past. He called his <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ryangjchandler\/mink\">Mink<\/a>, and describes it as: &#8220;It&#8217;s disgusting really. Using globals, you can only call <code>extend()<\/code> at the very end of a template file. You have to define the name of a slot in the <code>stop<\/code> function.&#8221; And he says it&#8217;s &#8220;for educational purposes (obvs)&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it turns out that while Ryan was trying to find where he had a lefotver copy of this script so I could see it, I was already building something VERY similar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, yeah, I guess it is &#8220;disgusting&#8221;. But it works a charm and totally fulfills my criteria:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Super-simple<\/li><li>Constraints that I&#8217;m 100% happy with<\/li><li>Ability to extend a layout template of your choosing, and pass data to it<\/li><li>Ability to include partials and pass data to them<\/li><li>Ability to have &#8220;environment variables&#8221;<\/li><li>Simple build process<\/li><li>Minimal dependencies<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I COULD wrap this up in a fancy command line with <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel-zero.com\/\">Laravel Zero<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/erikaheidi\">Erika Heidi<\/a>&#8216;s <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/minicli\/minicli\">Mini CLI<\/a>. But I don&#8217;t need to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I COULD make this a PHP composer-installable package. But why should I?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m probably not going to update it. It&#8217;s a &#8220;finished&#8221; piece of software as far as I&#8217;m concerned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s unlikely to stop working in the near future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s keep it REALLY simple. Like I did with <a href=\"https:\/\/peekobot.github.io\/peekobot\/\">Peekobot<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just 160-odd lines of PHP in a Gist:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d\">https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take it. Download it. Use it. Modify it. Make it do what YOU need it to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined with the new <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/installation#using-tailwind-cli\">TailwindCSS CLI<\/a> tool, I can now have simple, static sites, with almost-zero-dependency build processes! Amazing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, I guess I built a static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now&#8230;what&#8217;s next. Todo app?<\/p>\n",

This means that it can be assigned to a variable, as I have done above:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$addToArray = function ($item) use ($a) { ... };\n\n$addToArray(...);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>or it can be used &#8220;inline&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\narray_map( function ($item) use($var) { ... }, $someArray );\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Auto-capturing vs non-auto-capturing<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The short <code>fn()<\/code> syntax is &#8220;auto-capturing&#8221;. This means you don&#8217;t need to use <code>use()<\/code> to import variables from the outer scope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The longer <code>function()<\/code> syntax is not &#8220;auto-capturing&#8221;. You need to manually import variables from the outer scope using <code>use()<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Statement vs expression<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The statement version is the &#8220;multi-line&#8221; version of a function definition. You use the curly braces to define the statement that the function executes. This may or may not return a value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The expression is the shorter &#8220;single-line&#8221; version (though the single expression may actually span multiple lines) and always returns the value of the expression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These three syntax forms allow up to eight different types of function:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Anonymous, auto-capturing statement (which Nuno is proposing)<\/li><li>Anonymous, non-auto-capturing, statement (which exists)<\/li><li>Names, non-auto-capturing, statement (which most people would consider a &#8216;regular&#8217; PHP function)<\/li><li>etc.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all described in the <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.php.net\/rfc\/auto-capture-closure#background\">&#8220;Background&#8221; section of the RFC<\/a> along with reasons why some of them may\/should never exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding the conventions of <code>fn()<\/code> vs <code>function()<\/code>, and  expression vs statement is really helpful in understanding PHP code and what type of function to write when.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ONE MORE THING: Scope!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230; the biggest thing that I learned about PHP closures &#8211; that is all anonymous functions regardless of auto- or non-auto-capturing &#8211; is that the imported variables from the outer scope are imported as VALUES, not REFERENCES&#8230; That is, if you change the value inside the function, the outer scope is not affected:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$a = 2;\n$fn = function() use ($a) {\n  $a = $a + 1;\n}\nvar_dump($a); \/\/ outputs 2\n$fn();\nvar_dump($a); \/\/ outputs 2\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>You can see that at work in <a href=\"https:\/\/web.tinkerwell.app\/#\/snippets\/dd4c777d-233e-4ac3-841e-995484137fe0\">this live snippet<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AND!!\u2026 the function captures that value at the time the function is declared not the time the function is called:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$a = 2;\n$fn = function() use ($a) {\n  var_dump($a); \/\/ outputs 2\n};\n$a++;\nvar_dump($a); \/\/ outputs 3\n$fn();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>You can see that at work in <a href=\"https:\/\/web.tinkerwell.app\/#\/snippets\/a907d9ee-fb50-48fb-9d29-4e94f3fc6b15\">this live snippet<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all VERY different to how closures work in JavaScript and definitely worth knowing if, like me, you&#8217;ve done functional-style programming in JS and want to switch to a similar style in PHP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230; I learned a lot diving into this little RFC. It was fun! I hope you learned something too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Useful reference: <a href=\"https:\/\/stitcher.io\/blog\/short-closures-in-php\">Short Closures in PHP on the Stitcher blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Yesterday I took an interest in PHP internals looking into <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/enunomaduro\">@enunomaduro<\/a>&#8216;s RFC for <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.php.net\/rfc\/auto-capture-closure\">Auto-capturing multi-statement closures<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Have I said before that I loved studying compilers in CS?)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This lead me down some interesting rabbit holes and I wanted to make some notes on what I found.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Short vs Long closures<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a two forms of &#8220;closure&#8221; in PHP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long closures have the form:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$a = &#x5B;1, 2, 3];\n\n$addToArray = function ($item) use ($a) {\n  array_push($a, $item);\n  var_dump($a); \/\/ outputs 1, 2, 3, 4\n};\n\n$addToArray(4);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Short closures have the form:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$a = &#x5B;1, 2, 3];\n\n$addToArray = fn($item) =&gt; var_dump(array_merge($a, &#x5B;$item])); \/\/ outputs 1,2,3,4\n\n$addToArray(4);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Note that short closures (aka &#8220;arrow functions&#8221;):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>use <code>fn()<\/code> instead of <code>function()<\/code><\/li><li>&#8220;auto-capture&#8221; the enclosing scope: you don&#8217;t need to include the <code>use()<\/code><\/li><li>can only execute a single <em>expression<\/em>, and this is what is returned from the closure (which I why I had to wrangle the <code>array_merge<\/code> into there)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposed RFC (which seems to make a lot of sense to me) would allows a multi-line, auto-capturing closure with the syntax:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$a = &#x5B;1, 2, 3];\n\n$addToArray = fn ($item) {\n  array_push($a, $item);\n  var_dump($a); \/\/ outputs 1, 2, 3, 4\n};\n\n$addToArray(4);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">All the different functions and their conventions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three different things going on in the different kinds of function definition:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Anonymous vs named functions<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>A named function has a name and must be declared before use:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction addToArray() { ... }\n\naddToArray(...);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Whereas an anonymous function has no name. This means that it can be assigned to a variable, as I have done above:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$addToArray = function ($item) use ($a) { ... };\n\n$addToArray(...);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>or it can be used &#8220;inline&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\narray_map( function ($item) use($var) { ... }, $someArray );\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Auto-capturing vs non-auto-capturing<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The short <code>fn()<\/code> syntax is &#8220;auto-capturing&#8221;. This means you don&#8217;t need to use <code>use()<\/code> to import variables from the outer scope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The longer <code>function()<\/code> syntax is not &#8220;auto-capturing&#8221;. You need to manually import variables from the outer scope using <code>use()<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Statement vs expression<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The statement version is the &#8220;multi-line&#8221; version of a function definition. You use the curly braces to define the statement that the function executes. This may or may not return a value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The expression is the shorter &#8220;single-line&#8221; version (though the single expression may actually span multiple lines) and always returns the value of the expression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These three syntax forms allow up to eight different types of function:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Anonymous, auto-capturing statement (which Nuno is proposing)<\/li><li>Anonymous, non-auto-capturing, statement (which exists)<\/li><li>Names, non-auto-capturing, statement (which most people would consider a &#8216;regular&#8217; PHP function)<\/li><li>etc.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all described in the <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.php.net\/rfc\/auto-capture-closure#background\">&#8220;Background&#8221; section of the RFC<\/a> along with reasons why some of them may\/should never exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding the conventions of <code>fn()<\/code> vs <code>function()<\/code>, and  expression vs statement is really helpful in understanding PHP code and what type of function to write when.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ONE MORE THING: Scope!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230; the biggest thing that I learned about PHP closures &#8211; that is all anonymous functions regardless of auto- or non-auto-capturing &#8211; is that the imported variables from the outer scope are imported as VALUES, not REFERENCES&#8230; That is, if you change the value inside the function, the outer scope is not affected:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$a = 2;\n$fn = function() use ($a) {\n  $a = $a + 1;\n}\nvar_dump($a); \/\/ outputs 2\n$fn();\nvar_dump($a); \/\/ outputs 2\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>You can see that at work in <a href=\"https:\/\/web.tinkerwell.app\/#\/snippets\/dd4c777d-233e-4ac3-841e-995484137fe0\">this live snippet<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AND!!\u2026 the function captures that value at the time the function is declared not the time the function is called:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$a = 2;\n$fn = function() use ($a) {\n  var_dump($a); \/\/ outputs 2\n};\n$a++;\nvar_dump($a); \/\/ outputs 3\n$fn();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>You can see that at work in <a href=\"https:\/\/web.tinkerwell.app\/#\/snippets\/a907d9ee-fb50-48fb-9d29-4e94f3fc6b15\">this live snippet<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all VERY different to how closures work in JavaScript and definitely worth knowing if, like me, you&#8217;ve done functional-style programming in JS and want to switch to a similar style in PHP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230; I learned a lot diving into this little RFC. It was fun! I hope you learned something too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Useful reference: <a href=\"https:\/\/stitcher.io\/blog\/short-closures-in-php\">Short Closures in PHP on the Stitcher blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ll write more about this (very-involved!) process soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in the last couple of days, I just made the decision to self-host updates for the Firefox version rather than host it on addons.mozilla.org. This post details the steps to do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I have had a version of Turbo Admin approved for addons.mozilla.org (AMO for short), but they only give two options there:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Listed &#8211; AMO host the extension and all updates. It&#8217;s publicly listed. Anyone can find and install it from AMO.<\/li><li>Invisible &#8211; AMO verify and sign the extension, but it&#8217;s not publicly listed, and you self-host the extension and all updates to it.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I really want a third option:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Unlisted &#8211; AMO host the extension and all updates but it&#8217;s NOT publicly listed, people have to have the link to install it.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an option that the Chrome Web Store gives you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess there are some advantages to being on AMO. It could be a marketing and discovery channel. But I feel like finding my extension and immediately seeing that you have to pay for it could be frustrating for users. The AMO listing can show that &#8220;Some features may require payment&#8221; but I&#8217;d just rather people took a different journey to purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-31-at-09.26.15@2x-1024x296.png\" alt=\"Turbo Admin - AMO - Some features may require payment\" class=\"wp-image-10248\" width=\"769\" height=\"222\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-31-at-09.26.15@2x-1024x296.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-31-at-09.26.15@2x-300x87.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-31-at-09.26.15@2x-768x222.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-31-at-09.26.15@2x-1536x444.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-31-at-09.26.15@2x.png 1756w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve completely skipped the whole process of making and bundling the extension. Maybe I&#8217;ll write about that another time. So let&#8217;s get straight to self-hosting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The official docs for self-hosting are actually pretty good. Main links are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/extensionworkshop.com\/documentation\/publish\/submitting-an-add-on\/#self-distribution\">Extension Workshop &#8211; Self Distribution<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/extensionworkshop.com\/documentation\/manage\/updating-your-extension\/\">Extension Workshop &#8211; Updating your Extension<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow those and you should be OK. Other than deciding WHERE to host the extension packages and <code>updates.json<\/code> it&#8217;s not too hard, but there are a few steps, which I&#8217;ll outline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Self-hosting steps<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The main steps (and my tips along the way) are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Bump the version number in <code>manifest.json<\/code>, <code>package.json<\/code> and anywhere else that you need to. <\/li><li>Sign the addon and create the xpi. I use the <code>web-ext<\/code> command-line tool to do this, but you can upload a zip file to Mozilla too. And I have some excluded files that I put in a <code>web-ext-config.js<\/code> file.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><code>web-ext sign --api-key=\"user:XXXXXXXX\" --api-secret=\"&lt;api_key\"&gt;<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>With the CLI tool, this will create the signed xpi file in <code>\/web-ext-artifacts<\/code> (or wherever you specify)<\/li><li>Create the SHA256 hash of this using (on MacOS):<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><code>shasum -a 256 web-ext-artifacts\/&lt;plugin-name>-&lt;version>-an+fx.xpi<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Add the new version and hash to your <code>updates.json<\/code>. You&#8217;ll need to host this somewhere too. It&#8217;s a good idea to validate the JSON formatting before uploading.<\/li><li>Upload the <code>.xpi<\/code> and <code>updates.json<\/code> to wherever you are hosting them.<\/li><li>Test an update (you might want to go to about:config and set <code>extensions.update.interval<\/code> to <code>120<\/code> for a two-minute check. Note that you can see console messages about update checks in Firefox, Tools -> Browser Tools -> Browser Console)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Automation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of this process is ripe for automation. I&#8217;m add this later. Might be a good opportunity to try out GitHub Actions in more depth!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me know if you know of any existing automations for this stuff. I&#8217;ve not even searched yet!<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ll write more about this (very-involved!) process soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in the last couple of days, I just made the decision to self-host updates for the Firefox version rather than host it on addons.mozilla.org. This post details the steps to do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I have had a version of Turbo Admin approved for addons.mozilla.org (AMO for short), but they only give two options there:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Listed &#8211; AMO host the extension and all updates. It&#8217;s publicly listed. Anyone can find and install it from AMO.<\/li><li>Invisible &#8211; AMO verify and sign the extension, but it&#8217;s not publicly listed, and you self-host the extension and all updates to it.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I really want a third option:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Unlisted &#8211; AMO host the extension and all updates but it&#8217;s NOT publicly listed, people have to have the link to install it.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an option that the Chrome Web Store gives you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess there are some advantages to being on AMO. It could be a marketing and discovery channel. But I feel like finding my extension and immediately seeing that you have to pay for it could be frustrating for users. The AMO listing can show that &#8220;Some features may require payment&#8221; but I&#8217;d just rather people took a different journey to purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-31-at-09.26.15@2x-1024x296.png\" alt=\"Turbo Admin - AMO - Some features may require payment\" class=\"wp-image-10248\" width=\"769\" height=\"222\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-31-at-09.26.15@2x-1024x296.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-31-at-09.26.15@2x-300x87.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-31-at-09.26.15@2x-768x222.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-31-at-09.26.15@2x-1536x444.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/CleanShot-2021-05-31-at-09.26.15@2x.png 1756w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve completely skipped the whole process of making and bundling the extension. Maybe I&#8217;ll write about that another time. So let&#8217;s get straight to self-hosting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The official docs for self-hosting are actually pretty good. Main links are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/extensionworkshop.com\/documentation\/publish\/submitting-an-add-on\/#self-distribution\">Extension Workshop &#8211; Self Distribution<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/extensionworkshop.com\/documentation\/manage\/updating-your-extension\/\">Extension Workshop &#8211; Updating your Extension<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow those and you should be OK. Other than deciding WHERE to host the extension packages and <code>updates.json<\/code> it&#8217;s not too hard, but there are a few steps, which I&#8217;ll outline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Self-hosting steps<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The main steps (and my tips along the way) are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Bump the version number in <code>manifest.json<\/code>, <code>package.json<\/code> and anywhere else that you need to. <\/li><li>Sign the addon and create the xpi. I use the <code>web-ext<\/code> command-line tool to do this, but you can upload a zip file to Mozilla too. And I have some excluded files that I put in a <code>web-ext-config.js<\/code> file.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><code>web-ext sign --api-key=\"user:XXXXXXXX\" --api-secret=\"&lt;api_key\"&gt;<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>With the CLI tool, this will create the signed xpi file in <code>\/web-ext-artifacts<\/code> (or wherever you specify)<\/li><li>Create the SHA256 hash of this using (on MacOS):<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><code>shasum -a 256 web-ext-artifacts\/&lt;plugin-name>-&lt;version>-an+fx.xpi<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Add the new version and hash to your <code>updates.json<\/code>. You&#8217;ll need to host this somewhere too. It&#8217;s a good idea to validate the JSON formatting before uploading.<\/li><li>Upload the <code>.xpi<\/code> and <code>updates.json<\/code> to wherever you are hosting them.<\/li><li>Test an update (you might want to go to about:config and set <code>extensions.update.interval<\/code> to <code>120<\/code> for a two-minute check. Note that you can see console messages about update checks in Firefox, Tools -> Browser Tools -> Browser Console)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Automation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of this process is ripe for automation. I&#8217;m add this later. Might be a good opportunity to try out GitHub Actions in more depth!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me know if you know of any existing automations for this stuff. I&#8217;ve not even searched yet!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>It&#8217;s kinda hard to believe that in all my years of writing Laravel I&#8217;ve not come across this before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But today I needed &#8220;belongsToThrough&#8221; in an Eloquent Model and I got myself so confused! Turns out it doesn&#8217;t exist, and the docs are (IMO) confusing and others seem to have even got it backwards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m assuming some knowledge here to keep things brief. You would know what an ORM is and how relationships work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also &#8211; note for pedants &#8211; I&#8217;m using American &#8220;license&#8221; throughout examples for naming consistency, even for the noun which would otherwise be &#8220;licence&#8221;. I know. And I&#8217;m sorry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My use case<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been working on my licensing system for software products I&#8217;m developing. It&#8217;s pretty simple. And it has a data model with Customers, Orders, and Licenses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nLicense        Order             Customer\n--------       -----------       --------\norder_id  --&gt;  customer_id  --&gt;  email\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>In ORM terminology:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A License <code>belongsTo<\/code> an Order<\/li><li>An Order <code>hasMany<\/code> Licenses<\/li><li>An Order <code>belongsTo<\/code> a Customer<\/li><li>A Customer <code>hasMany<\/code> Orders<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all good. But, for reasons I won&#8217;t go into, I wanted to define a relationship between License and Customer through the Orders table. So I could do:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>$license-&gt;customer<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that I could simply do:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>$license-&gt;order-&gt;customer<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>but please, just let me do my thing and assume I have reasons! Thanks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel is a superb framework and often just does what you need. It&#8217;s conventions make sense and you can often guess the name of the thing you need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was vaguely aware of &#8220;hasOneThrough&#8221; (those of you who are ahead of me are already rolling your eyes). And so I attempted to implement it:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function customer()\n{\n  return $this-&gt;hasOneThrough(Customer::class, Order::class);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;this gave me an error saying that the Order table didn&#8217;t have a license_id.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My immediate reaction: WHAT? THAT&#8217;S BACKWARDS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Laravel Docs Example<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Time to consult <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/eloquent-relationships#has-one-through\">the Laravel docs<\/a> where the example given is:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nmechanics\n    id - integer\n    name - string\n\ncars\n    id - integer\n    model - string\n    mechanic_id - integer\n\nowners\n    id - integer\n    name - string\n    car_id - integer\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Now, first of all, this is (in my opinion &#8211; sorry documenters) a poor example data model. It says that an owner can only have one car, but a car can have multiple owners. Which is&#8230;err&#8230;backwards? And a car has one mechanic. And I don&#8217;t understand what real-world use-case this data model is modelling. But let&#8217;s go with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this model:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A Mechanic <code>hasMany<\/code> Cars<\/li><li>A Car <code>belongsTo<\/code> a Mechanic<\/li><li>A Car <code>hasMany<\/code> Owners<\/li><li>An Owner <code>belongsTo<\/code> a Car (?!)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And in the example we want to get the Owner for a given Mechanic (?! &#8211; let&#8217;s go with it!). So you can do:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function carOwner()\n{\n  return $this-&gt;hasOneThrough(Owner::class, Car::class);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know about you but I&#8217;m so confused. (And no, I&#8217;m not going to PR the docs. I&#8217;ve tried this before. It&#8217;s no fun.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this model a Mechanic hasMany Cars and a Car hasMany Owners. So a Mechanic has many, many Owners! And we&#8217;re asking for one of them. And what&#8217;s even more confusing is that the docs don&#8217;t specify which one we will get? The most-recently created? The most-recently updated? A random owner? It&#8217;s just weird.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/8.x\/eloquent-relationships#has-one-of-many\">Laravel docs<\/a> are explicit about this for <code>hasOne<\/code> saying:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Sometimes a model may have many related models, yet you want to easily retrieve the &#8220;latest&#8221; or &#8220;oldest&#8221; related model of the relationship.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>and it defines <code>latestOfMany()<\/code>, <code>oldestOfMany()<\/code> and a generic <code>ofMany()<\/code> modifiers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can see that you might want to use this. For example, you might have <code>Category &lt;- Post &lt;- Comment<\/code> and you might want to get the most recent Comment for a Category? Maybe? This is the kind of thing that <code>hasOneThrough<\/code> seems to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Has and BelongsTo naming&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To get why this is all like it is, you have to properly understand the Has and BelongsTo conventions in ORMs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has\/have is always about having lots of things. You can haveMany. And you can haveOne. But haveOne is actually really haveOneOfMany.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Belongs is sometimes about having one (<code>belongsTo<\/code>) and, confusingly, sometimes about having many (which is called <code>belongsToMany<\/code>). But let&#8217;s just ignore <code>belongToMany<\/code> for now. Belongs is about being related to one of another thing. It&#8217;s the child -&gt; parent relationship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is really confusing. Deal with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enter stage left: belongsToThrough !<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, with the tenacious web-searching that only a persistent nerd like me has, I found a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/staudenmeir\/belongs-to-through\">belongsToThrough<\/a>&#8221; package for Eloquent. And I realised that I had had it wrong all along.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The existence of this package with the relationship named correctly made me realise that I&#8217;d misunderstood <code>hasOneThrough<\/code> and the whole has\/belongs convention. THIS was what I needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My only remaining questions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Is this the best way to do this? Does this not exist for a reason in Laravel core?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>and<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/staudenmeir\/belongs-to-through\/issues\/50\">Why DOESN&#8217;T this exist in Laravel&#8217;s core?<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it seems that this doesn&#8217;t exist in Laravel&#8217;s core because:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>a) There aren&#8217;t good use cases for it (apparently, even though OrderItem -&gt; Order -&gt; Customer seems like a really common use case)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>b) There are other ways of achieving it, such as with an accessor, or just by chaining the relationships (e.g. <code>$license-&gt;order-&gt;customer<\/code>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems that the potential benefits of being able to eager load, or use PHP Reflection on this relationship just aren&#8217;t there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

        "title": "Tech Notes: Laravel hasOneThrough \/ belongsToThrough confusion",
        "content": "\n<p>It&#8217;s kinda hard to believe that in all my years of writing Laravel I&#8217;ve not come across this before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But today I needed &#8220;belongsToThrough&#8221; in an Eloquent Model and I got myself so confused! Turns out it doesn&#8217;t exist, and the docs are (IMO) confusing and others seem to have even got it backwards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m assuming some knowledge here to keep things brief. You would know what an ORM is and how relationships work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also &#8211; note for pedants &#8211; I&#8217;m using American &#8220;license&#8221; throughout examples for naming consistency, even for the noun which would otherwise be &#8220;licence&#8221;. I know. And I&#8217;m sorry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My use case<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been working on my licensing system for software products I&#8217;m developing. It&#8217;s pretty simple. And it has a data model with Customers, Orders, and Licenses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nLicense        Order             Customer\n--------       -----------       --------\norder_id  --&gt;  customer_id  --&gt;  email\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>In ORM terminology:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A License <code>belongsTo<\/code> an Order<\/li><li>An Order <code>hasMany<\/code> Licenses<\/li><li>An Order <code>belongsTo<\/code> a Customer<\/li><li>A Customer <code>hasMany<\/code> Orders<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all good. But, for reasons I won&#8217;t go into, I wanted to define a relationship between License and Customer through the Orders table. So I could do:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>$license-&gt;customer<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that I could simply do:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>$license-&gt;order-&gt;customer<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>but please, just let me do my thing and assume I have reasons! Thanks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel is a superb framework and often just does what you need. It&#8217;s conventions make sense and you can often guess the name of the thing you need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was vaguely aware of &#8220;hasOneThrough&#8221; (those of you who are ahead of me are already rolling your eyes). And so I attempted to implement it:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function customer()\n{\n  return $this-&gt;hasOneThrough(Customer::class, Order::class);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;this gave me an error saying that the Order table didn&#8217;t have a license_id.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My immediate reaction: WHAT? THAT&#8217;S BACKWARDS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Laravel Docs Example<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Time to consult <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/eloquent-relationships#has-one-through\">the Laravel docs<\/a> where the example given is:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nmechanics\n    id - integer\n    name - string\n\ncars\n    id - integer\n    model - string\n    mechanic_id - integer\n\nowners\n    id - integer\n    name - string\n    car_id - integer\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Now, first of all, this is (in my opinion &#8211; sorry documenters) a poor example data model. It says that an owner can only have one car, but a car can have multiple owners. Which is&#8230;err&#8230;backwards? And a car has one mechanic. And I don&#8217;t understand what real-world use-case this data model is modelling. But let&#8217;s go with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this model:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A Mechanic <code>hasMany<\/code> Cars<\/li><li>A Car <code>belongsTo<\/code> a Mechanic<\/li><li>A Car <code>hasMany<\/code> Owners<\/li><li>An Owner <code>belongsTo<\/code> a Car (?!)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And in the example we want to get the Owner for a given Mechanic (?! &#8211; let&#8217;s go with it!). So you can do:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function carOwner()\n{\n  return $this-&gt;hasOneThrough(Owner::class, Car::class);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know about you but I&#8217;m so confused. (And no, I&#8217;m not going to PR the docs. I&#8217;ve tried this before. It&#8217;s no fun.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this model a Mechanic hasMany Cars and a Car hasMany Owners. So a Mechanic has many, many Owners! And we&#8217;re asking for one of them. And what&#8217;s even more confusing is that the docs don&#8217;t specify which one we will get? The most-recently created? The most-recently updated? A random owner? It&#8217;s just weird.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/8.x\/eloquent-relationships#has-one-of-many\">Laravel docs<\/a> are explicit about this for <code>hasOne<\/code> saying:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Sometimes a model may have many related models, yet you want to easily retrieve the &#8220;latest&#8221; or &#8220;oldest&#8221; related model of the relationship.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>and it defines <code>latestOfMany()<\/code>, <code>oldestOfMany()<\/code> and a generic <code>ofMany()<\/code> modifiers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can see that you might want to use this. For example, you might have <code>Category &lt;- Post &lt;- Comment<\/code> and you might want to get the most recent Comment for a Category? Maybe? This is the kind of thing that <code>hasOneThrough<\/code> seems to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Has and BelongsTo naming&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To get why this is all like it is, you have to properly understand the Has and BelongsTo conventions in ORMs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has\/have is always about having lots of things. You can haveMany. And you can haveOne. But haveOne is actually really haveOneOfMany.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Belongs is sometimes about having one (<code>belongsTo<\/code>) and, confusingly, sometimes about having many (which is called <code>belongsToMany<\/code>). But let&#8217;s just ignore <code>belongToMany<\/code> for now. Belongs is about being related to one of another thing. It&#8217;s the child -&gt; parent relationship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is really confusing. Deal with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enter stage left: belongsToThrough !<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, with the tenacious web-searching that only a persistent nerd like me has, I found a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/staudenmeir\/belongs-to-through\">belongsToThrough<\/a>&#8221; package for Eloquent. And I realised that I had had it wrong all along.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The existence of this package with the relationship named correctly made me realise that I&#8217;d misunderstood <code>hasOneThrough<\/code> and the whole has\/belongs convention. THIS was what I needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My only remaining questions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Is this the best way to do this? Does this not exist for a reason in Laravel core?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>and<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/staudenmeir\/belongs-to-through\/issues\/50\">Why DOESN&#8217;T this exist in Laravel&#8217;s core?<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it seems that this doesn&#8217;t exist in Laravel&#8217;s core because:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>a) There aren&#8217;t good use cases for it (apparently, even though OrderItem -&gt; Order -&gt; Customer seems like a really common use case)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>b) There are other ways of achieving it, such as with an accessor, or just by chaining the relationships (e.g. <code>$license-&gt;order-&gt;customer<\/code>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems that the potential benefits of being able to eager load, or use PHP Reflection on this relationship just aren&#8217;t there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

And we don&#8217;t have a common visual language for them.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m spending my Saturday morning &#8220;TV&#8221; time watching the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.tv\/2021\/04\/14\/april-14-2021-fse-demo\/\">WordPress &#8220;Full Site Editing&#8221; demo<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now&#8230; I should say some things up front.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>I&#8217;m an old dude now. I don&#8217;t like change. I&#8217;m also a sensitive person who thinks things through deeply. I doubly don&#8217;t like change. I know this.<\/li><li>I have every respect for the people designing and building the block editor. It&#8217;s a complex piece of software with a complex interface. What they are doing is hard.<\/li><li>I&#8217;m well aware that this is unfinished work.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>But &#8230; I&#8217;m watching this video, and I&#8217;m completely baffled about what is going on. There is lots of talk of refining the UI in the video, of stuff that needs to be done before this is ready. But I&#8217;m so confused. And I&#8217;m an expert at this stuff who is confident with IT and computers and things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is wrong?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m looking at the UI of this thing. The myriad icons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/iconsiconsicons.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10127\" width=\"454\" height=\"196\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/iconsiconsicons.png 712w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/iconsiconsicons-300x129.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary, secondary and tertiary tools for blocks that appear scattered across the inline interface, the pop-up toolbar (which I have hated since day one), and the sidebar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/CleanShot-2021-04-18-at-10.17.40@2x-1024x575.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10128\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/CleanShot-2021-04-18-at-10.17.40@2x-1024x575.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/CleanShot-2021-04-18-at-10.17.40@2x-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/CleanShot-2021-04-18-at-10.17.40@2x-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/CleanShot-2021-04-18-at-10.17.40@2x-1536x863.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/CleanShot-2021-04-18-at-10.17.40@2x-2048x1151.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And I want to be able to understand and use these tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m thinking: why is this so hard. The classic editor was so much easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the classic editor was partly easier because it was simpler. But it was also easier because it was familiar. I could say to people &#8220;It&#8217;s just like Microsoft Word&#8221; and they understood. Because the tools and icons were familiar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we dont have right now is a common visual language for all this block editing interface. And I think that WordPress is forging its own path rather than replicating something that already exists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps WordPress&#8217;s editor will become the new &#8220;standard&#8221; block editor interface. Perhaps, in future, we will say to people &#8220;It&#8217;s just like WordPress&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But right now we are making new things that haven&#8217;t existed before. They are WAY more complex than what we had before. And we lack a known visual language for what we are making. And it&#8217;s VERY confusing.<\/p>\n",

And we don&#8217;t have a common visual language for them.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m spending my Saturday morning &#8220;TV&#8221; time watching the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.tv\/2021\/04\/14\/april-14-2021-fse-demo\/\">WordPress &#8220;Full Site Editing&#8221; demo<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now&#8230; I should say some things up front.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>I&#8217;m an old dude now. I don&#8217;t like change. I&#8217;m also a sensitive person who thinks things through deeply. I doubly don&#8217;t like change. I know this.<\/li><li>I have every respect for the people designing and building the block editor. It&#8217;s a complex piece of software with a complex interface. What they are doing is hard.<\/li><li>I&#8217;m well aware that this is unfinished work.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>But &#8230; I&#8217;m watching this video, and I&#8217;m completely baffled about what is going on. There is lots of talk of refining the UI in the video, of stuff that needs to be done before this is ready. But I&#8217;m so confused. And I&#8217;m an expert at this stuff who is confident with IT and computers and things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is wrong?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m looking at the UI of this thing. The myriad icons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/iconsiconsicons.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10127\" width=\"454\" height=\"196\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/iconsiconsicons.png 712w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/iconsiconsicons-300x129.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary, secondary and tertiary tools for blocks that appear scattered across the inline interface, the pop-up toolbar (which I have hated since day one), and the sidebar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/CleanShot-2021-04-18-at-10.17.40@2x-1024x575.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10128\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/CleanShot-2021-04-18-at-10.17.40@2x-1024x575.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/CleanShot-2021-04-18-at-10.17.40@2x-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/CleanShot-2021-04-18-at-10.17.40@2x-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/CleanShot-2021-04-18-at-10.17.40@2x-1536x863.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/CleanShot-2021-04-18-at-10.17.40@2x-2048x1151.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And I want to be able to understand and use these tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m thinking: why is this so hard. The classic editor was so much easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the classic editor was partly easier because it was simpler. But it was also easier because it was familiar. I could say to people &#8220;It&#8217;s just like Microsoft Word&#8221; and they understood. Because the tools and icons were familiar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we dont have right now is a common visual language for all this block editing interface. And I think that WordPress is forging its own path rather than replicating something that already exists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps WordPress&#8217;s editor will become the new &#8220;standard&#8221; block editor interface. Perhaps, in future, we will say to people &#8220;It&#8217;s just like WordPress&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But right now we are making new things that haven&#8217;t existed before. They are WAY more complex than what we had before. And we lack a known visual language for what we are making. And it&#8217;s VERY confusing.<\/p>\n",
