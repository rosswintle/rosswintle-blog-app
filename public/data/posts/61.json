It&#8217;s a content management system that &#8216;runs on a \u201cflat file\u201d engine based on Markdown and YAML files&#8217;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I took it for a spin the other night and kinda live-Tweeted as I went. Here&#8217;s how that went (click the Twitter icon in the top right, or the date\/time link to see the whole thing:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1064638961325432832\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was really impressed with Statamic. It costs, but it&#8217;s got a lot going for it. But I was left with a niggling feeling about something, and as I&#8217;ve let my brain post-process it over the last couple of days, I&#8217;ve worked out what it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Statamic is still a CMS with a database. Yes, the database is in flat files, but it still &#8211; to some extent &#8211; builds pages on the fly from the data it has rather than being a full-on &#8220;static&#8221; CMS that builds a set of HTML files.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you can static-cache it, and it provides you with the tools for doing that, but it still needs a little extra effort to get the&nbsp;super-speed of a full static CMS. And it still has a control panel with a login, so it doesn&#8217;t have the super-security of a full static CMS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m left with this niggling doubt about performance. Statamic prides itself on &#8220;eliminating the rigid, relational database&#8221; which &#8220;unlocks the ability to create and support any data structures you can imagine&#8221;. Which I kinda get, but also I&#8217;m not sure I can imagine a data structure that would fit into YAML that wouldn&#8217;t work in SQL. And SQL&#8217;s rigidity means you can query it easily using a declarative query language, and you can get great performance from it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not knowing how the caching works in Statamic, it&#8217;s hard to say how it would perform with a large dataset, but my instinct is that, unless it builds indexes of some sort, it really won&#8217;t be as efficient as MySQL. And I&#8217;d feel like I was dependent on the software itself providing me with import\/export ability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that full-on static site generators are MUCH harder to use and really developer-only territory.\u00a0 And I see that Statamic is much more user-friendly than them, while being much more flexible and developer-friendly than something like WordPress. I&#8217;m struggling with this idea of a hybrid static\/dynamic CMS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me be clear, I can see a LOT of benefits to using Statamic:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>easier configuration with easier access to advanced options<\/li><li>built-in form builder<\/li><li>more flexible data structures<\/li><li>good user roles and groups system<\/li><li>simple drag-and-drop page ordering<\/li><li>built-in caching<\/li><li>built-in CLI tool<\/li><li>nice image editing features<\/li><li>built-in upgrade&#8230;and downgrade!&#8230;functionality<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And, biggest of all, the fact that it&#8217;s flat-file means you can store everything: content, configuration, users, the lot(!) in version control and, potentially, roll back and merge and do all the things that version control allows you to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m yet to be convinced that the benefits of a flat file database outweigh the drawbacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. It&#8217;s great. I&#8217;ll almost certainly play with it more and add it as a tool to my kit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And&#8230;HUGE thank you to the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/statamic\">@statamic<\/a> team, who followed along the live tweeting and well-actually&#8217;d me on a few things. They seem like a great bunch and I&#8217;m certain support from them would be superb.<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s a content management system that &#8216;runs on a \u201cflat file\u201d engine based on Markdown and YAML files&#8217;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I took it for a spin the other night and kinda live-Tweeted as I went. Here&#8217;s how that went (click the Twitter icon in the top right, or the date\/time link to see the whole thing:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1064638961325432832\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was really impressed with Statamic. It costs, but it&#8217;s got a lot going for it. But I was left with a niggling feeling about something, and as I&#8217;ve let my brain post-process it over the last couple of days, I&#8217;ve worked out what it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Statamic is still a CMS with a database. Yes, the database is in flat files, but it still &#8211; to some extent &#8211; builds pages on the fly from the data it has rather than being a full-on &#8220;static&#8221; CMS that builds a set of HTML files.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you can static-cache it, and it provides you with the tools for doing that, but it still needs a little extra effort to get the&nbsp;super-speed of a full static CMS. And it still has a control panel with a login, so it doesn&#8217;t have the super-security of a full static CMS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m left with this niggling doubt about performance. Statamic prides itself on &#8220;eliminating the rigid, relational database&#8221; which &#8220;unlocks the ability to create and support any data structures you can imagine&#8221;. Which I kinda get, but also I&#8217;m not sure I can imagine a data structure that would fit into YAML that wouldn&#8217;t work in SQL. And SQL&#8217;s rigidity means you can query it easily using a declarative query language, and you can get great performance from it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not knowing how the caching works in Statamic, it&#8217;s hard to say how it would perform with a large dataset, but my instinct is that, unless it builds indexes of some sort, it really won&#8217;t be as efficient as MySQL. And I&#8217;d feel like I was dependent on the software itself providing me with import\/export ability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that full-on static site generators are MUCH harder to use and really developer-only territory.\u00a0 And I see that Statamic is much more user-friendly than them, while being much more flexible and developer-friendly than something like WordPress. I&#8217;m struggling with this idea of a hybrid static\/dynamic CMS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me be clear, I can see a LOT of benefits to using Statamic:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>easier configuration with easier access to advanced options<\/li><li>built-in form builder<\/li><li>more flexible data structures<\/li><li>good user roles and groups system<\/li><li>simple drag-and-drop page ordering<\/li><li>built-in caching<\/li><li>built-in CLI tool<\/li><li>nice image editing features<\/li><li>built-in upgrade&#8230;and downgrade!&#8230;functionality<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And, biggest of all, the fact that it&#8217;s flat-file means you can store everything: content, configuration, users, the lot(!) in version control and, potentially, roll back and merge and do all the things that version control allows you to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m yet to be convinced that the benefits of a flat file database outweigh the drawbacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. It&#8217;s great. I&#8217;ll almost certainly play with it more and add it as a tool to my kit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And&#8230;HUGE thank you to the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/statamic\">@statamic<\/a> team, who followed along the live tweeting and well-actually&#8217;d me on a few things. They seem like a great bunch and I&#8217;m certain support from them would be superb.<\/p>\n",

            },
            "content": {
                "rendered": "\n<p>As a developer who finds design really hard, I was very much looking forward to the release of Steve Schoger and Adam Wathan&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/refactoringui.com\/book\/\">Refactoring UI<\/a>&#8221; book and kit of resources. Here&#8217;s some thoughts on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: I&#8217;m writing my thoughts in the order I had them. The positive stuff comes later!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Price<br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I heard the quote recently that &#8220;If people complain about the price, you&#8217;re doing it right&#8221;, and I confess, I complained about the price, so maybe they did price it right. I&#8217;d prepared myself for it to be 3 or 4 times the cost of an expensive book. But they priced it at $249 for the digital version of the book (not a physical book!) with all the resources! Yes, there&#8217;s a launch discount of 50%, but even so, this half-priced version was expensive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I get the arguments that a lot of experience and knowledge is in here, and a lot of work has been put in to make it a thing. And I get the argument that this will save me time, and it only has to save me a few hours to pay for itself. But actually, I think owning this book won&#8217;t save me time; it will make me do better design work and spend longer on it! Which is fine. As long as someone wants that and is paying me for it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also can&#8217;t help thinking that if this was half the price then they&#8217;d sell twice as many copies, make just as much money and share their knowledge more widely. And isn&#8217;t this the point of making such a resource: to share your knowledge with people?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A could of years back I&#8217;d been disappointed by Adam&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/adamwathan.me\/refactoring-to-collections\/\">Refactoring to Collections<\/a>&#8221; book which I thought wasn&#8217;t worth the money, and the provided videos in particular weren&#8217;t useful at all. So I was skeptical that this book&#8217;s extra resources would be helpful too &#8211; maybe I should just buy the basic package with the book?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But persuaded by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fullstackradio.com\/103\">Full Stack Radio podcast<\/a> that detailed exactly what was in it, I eventually bit and bought the full Refactoring UI kit.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Format<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from it being a digital-only book, it was PDF format. And I get that they&#8217;ve spent time laying it out and typesetting it, but PDF&#8217;s are still not my favourite eBook format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re also selling it on Gumroad and the Gumroad reader seems to display PDFs at low quality. I&#8217;ve seen complaints on Twitter about the PDF quality and if you download it and open it locally it&#8217;s fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More annoying though is that the component library, colour schemes and font selections are all also in PDF form. Which is annoying because the ability to copy\/paste stuff out of here, see the code, and tinker with it in the browser would have been great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Material\/Content<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, so here&#8217;s the good stuff. Because I&#8217;m not a designer, I can&#8217;t see visual stuff in my head or produce &#8220;nice looking stuff&#8221; out of thin air, I&#8217;m pretty dependent on rules and copying other people&#8217;s ideas to make things I make for the web look nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the book here really delivers. Strategic, rule-based design tips that really suit someone like me. It&#8217;s presented in a really easily digestible format, and has LOADS of very-well-put-together real-life examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see the amount of work that has gone into this in creating the fictional-but-real-looking designs that illustrate the points being made. They&#8217;re done a really great job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s great stuff, well presented, and reading it WILL change my work for the better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I want exercises!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, as well as wanting the component library and things in code, I think it would really benefit from some exercises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The videos are great at explaining the concepts and showing how to transform a bad design into a good one. But I really want to have a go at this myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some exercises a bit like Wes Bos&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/javascript30.com\/\">JavaScript 30<\/a> course would be an amazing addition. Give me the video, the starting design\/code and the ending design\/code, and let me see if I can make some of the changes myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading and watching is all well and good, but I&#8217;m only going to build up the skills and get them into my &#8220;muscle memory&#8221; if I actually DO then.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summary<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I love this kit. It&#8217;s expensive, but it&#8217;s an amazing tool for me. But it does also feel lacking\/incomplete in its current form.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My hope is that Adam and Steve have made so much cash now that they don&#8217;t have to work for a year, and that now the book is out, they can spend some time producing some additional resources for those who have purchased it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n",

        "title": "Refactoring UI",
        "content": "\n<p>As a developer who finds design really hard, I was very much looking forward to the release of Steve Schoger and Adam Wathan&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/refactoringui.com\/book\/\">Refactoring UI<\/a>&#8221; book and kit of resources. Here&#8217;s some thoughts on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: I&#8217;m writing my thoughts in the order I had them. The positive stuff comes later!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Price<br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I heard the quote recently that &#8220;If people complain about the price, you&#8217;re doing it right&#8221;, and I confess, I complained about the price, so maybe they did price it right. I&#8217;d prepared myself for it to be 3 or 4 times the cost of an expensive book. But they priced it at $249 for the digital version of the book (not a physical book!) with all the resources! Yes, there&#8217;s a launch discount of 50%, but even so, this half-priced version was expensive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I get the arguments that a lot of experience and knowledge is in here, and a lot of work has been put in to make it a thing. And I get the argument that this will save me time, and it only has to save me a few hours to pay for itself. But actually, I think owning this book won&#8217;t save me time; it will make me do better design work and spend longer on it! Which is fine. As long as someone wants that and is paying me for it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also can&#8217;t help thinking that if this was half the price then they&#8217;d sell twice as many copies, make just as much money and share their knowledge more widely. And isn&#8217;t this the point of making such a resource: to share your knowledge with people?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A could of years back I&#8217;d been disappointed by Adam&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/adamwathan.me\/refactoring-to-collections\/\">Refactoring to Collections<\/a>&#8221; book which I thought wasn&#8217;t worth the money, and the provided videos in particular weren&#8217;t useful at all. So I was skeptical that this book&#8217;s extra resources would be helpful too &#8211; maybe I should just buy the basic package with the book?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But persuaded by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fullstackradio.com\/103\">Full Stack Radio podcast<\/a> that detailed exactly what was in it, I eventually bit and bought the full Refactoring UI kit.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Format<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from it being a digital-only book, it was PDF format. And I get that they&#8217;ve spent time laying it out and typesetting it, but PDF&#8217;s are still not my favourite eBook format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re also selling it on Gumroad and the Gumroad reader seems to display PDFs at low quality. I&#8217;ve seen complaints on Twitter about the PDF quality and if you download it and open it locally it&#8217;s fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More annoying though is that the component library, colour schemes and font selections are all also in PDF form. Which is annoying because the ability to copy\/paste stuff out of here, see the code, and tinker with it in the browser would have been great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Material\/Content<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, so here&#8217;s the good stuff. Because I&#8217;m not a designer, I can&#8217;t see visual stuff in my head or produce &#8220;nice looking stuff&#8221; out of thin air, I&#8217;m pretty dependent on rules and copying other people&#8217;s ideas to make things I make for the web look nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the book here really delivers. Strategic, rule-based design tips that really suit someone like me. It&#8217;s presented in a really easily digestible format, and has LOADS of very-well-put-together real-life examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see the amount of work that has gone into this in creating the fictional-but-real-looking designs that illustrate the points being made. They&#8217;re done a really great job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s great stuff, well presented, and reading it WILL change my work for the better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I want exercises!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, as well as wanting the component library and things in code, I think it would really benefit from some exercises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The videos are great at explaining the concepts and showing how to transform a bad design into a good one. But I really want to have a go at this myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some exercises a bit like Wes Bos&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/javascript30.com\/\">JavaScript 30<\/a> course would be an amazing addition. Give me the video, the starting design\/code and the ending design\/code, and let me see if I can make some of the changes myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading and watching is all well and good, but I&#8217;m only going to build up the skills and get them into my &#8220;muscle memory&#8221; if I actually DO then.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summary<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I love this kit. It&#8217;s expensive, but it&#8217;s an amazing tool for me. But it does also feel lacking\/incomplete in its current form.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My hope is that Adam and Steve have made so much cash now that they don&#8217;t have to work for a year, and that now the book is out, they can spend some time producing some additional resources for those who have purchased it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n",

Unfortunately this isn\u2019t quite working out as I had hoped: I feel like I\u2019m making progress with deeper JavaScript knowledge, but not so much with the enjoyment\/loving it aspect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Learn to love TypeScript, or learn it Deeply, or something?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So I\u2019ve been wondering about TypeScript and actually installing it and reading through the docs and tutorials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trouble with TypeScript is that it\u2019s a departure from the norm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like the small-to-medium-sized projects that I work on to be easily-hand-on-able.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another developer picking up one of my projects should not have to learn something that they don\u2019t know. The build process and tool-chain should be simple and well-documented (confession: the latter is not always true, for which I apologise to both other dev\u2019s and my future self).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And TypeScript would add another dependency both into the tool-chain and the required knowledge to take on a project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;I wonder if another goal of 2019 is to take on more projects that are more bespoke, more self-contained and less likely to be handed on to other devs. More projects where I am the dev and I make the technical choices and I\u2019m unashamed about picking the right tool for me to accomplish the task with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Go, Go, Go!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a real hankering to learn Go. I don\u2019t know how that will happen, but from what I\u2019ve heard it seems like a language I would enjoy working with. Compilation with compile-time static analysis. Strongly typed. Multi-threaded. There are all Good Things for a grumpy, old-school dev like me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what would I do with it? I don\u2019t work on the kind of projects where Go would be a viable technology choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But again&#8230;maybe I should. Maybe this is where I should be positioning myself this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can you select technology choices before positioning yourself for work?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Or should it happen the other way around? I suspect a bit of both is required. You won\u2019t win the kinds of work you want until you show capability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe that\u2019s the goal for this year &#8211; demonstrate capability for more of this kind of work and see what happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m pretty firmly entrenched in WordPress world. And I\u2019d like that to continue somewhat. So I SHOULD be learning Gutenberg and Blocks and React. But the reasons for not wanting to do that are&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;the subject of another post probably.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I\u2019ve been thinking about technical goals for 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I currently mostly write PHP with both WordPress and Laravel and associated HTML, CSS and bits of JavaScript enhancement, including Vue.js and I\u2019ve been trying to learn React too, without quite getting there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m trying to #LearnToLoveJS, rather than Learn JavaScript Deeply as the WordPress world is trying to do. Unfortunately this isn\u2019t quite working out as I had hoped: I feel like I\u2019m making progress with deeper JavaScript knowledge, but not so much with the enjoyment\/loving it aspect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Learn to love TypeScript, or learn it Deeply, or something?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So I\u2019ve been wondering about TypeScript and actually installing it and reading through the docs and tutorials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trouble with TypeScript is that it\u2019s a departure from the norm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like the small-to-medium-sized projects that I work on to be easily-hand-on-able.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another developer picking up one of my projects should not have to learn something that they don\u2019t know. The build process and tool-chain should be simple and well-documented (confession: the latter is not always true, for which I apologise to both other dev\u2019s and my future self).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And TypeScript would add another dependency both into the tool-chain and the required knowledge to take on a project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;I wonder if another goal of 2019 is to take on more projects that are more bespoke, more self-contained and less likely to be handed on to other devs. More projects where I am the dev and I make the technical choices and I\u2019m unashamed about picking the right tool for me to accomplish the task with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Go, Go, Go!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a real hankering to learn Go. I don\u2019t know how that will happen, but from what I\u2019ve heard it seems like a language I would enjoy working with. Compilation with compile-time static analysis. Strongly typed. Multi-threaded. There are all Good Things for a grumpy, old-school dev like me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what would I do with it? I don\u2019t work on the kind of projects where Go would be a viable technology choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But again&#8230;maybe I should. Maybe this is where I should be positioning myself this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can you select technology choices before positioning yourself for work?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Or should it happen the other way around? I suspect a bit of both is required. You won\u2019t win the kinds of work you want until you show capability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe that\u2019s the goal for this year &#8211; demonstrate capability for more of this kind of work and see what happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m pretty firmly entrenched in WordPress world. And I\u2019d like that to continue somewhat. So I SHOULD be learning Gutenberg and Blocks and React. But the reasons for not wanting to do that are&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;the subject of another post probably.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>2018 seems to have flown by, but actually a LOT has happened and a lot has been achieved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Personal and financial<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally it\u2019s been a mixed year, as they usually are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been a lot of great things: the kids turned two and seven (they\u2019re actually just-turned-seven and very-nearly-three).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eldest has really settled in year 2 and is thriving at school both academically and socially.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Youngest is now much better able to look after herself. She\u2019s very much nearly sleeping through the night every night, which means our sleep routines are approaching something normal. She\u2019s on her way to being potty trained (which is good) and dropping her nap (which is a mixed blessing). She was a bit terrible-two, but really not all that much and I think she\u2019ll be a super-fun three year old.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, family-wise, we\u2019re much more settled and solo double-bedtimes are quite routine now which means its easier for at least one of us to go out of an evening! Yay! Can we have our life back now please?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\u2019s not been without difficulty. My wife broke her ankle in April. It was a pretty simple break, but for 6 weeks I had to do EVERYTHING. People would ask if Sally was doing OK, I would half- (and on half-) jokingly say \u201cShe\u2019s fine. She gets to sit around all day while I do ALL THE THINGS!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds funny. Bit it was actually very stressful and it really pushed me to breaking point. I somehow had to manage to keep my work running while doing all the school runs and shopping trips and cooking and cleaning and gardening and carrying anything that needed carrying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we did it. We got through, and I know people who have endured MUCH worse. But it did leave me in catchup mode for June\/July and then before I knew it we had summer holidays to cover too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financially we\u2019re not struggling, but the ankle-break and my subsequent loss of hours did hit us a bit. We\u2019re both working slightly part time to be able to spend time with our kids in the week, and already pay a financial penalty as a result, so the lost time hit us. I feel like this will be a break-even year, which is OK. But next year will need to be better!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Work<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I didn\u2019t actually do a huge amount of proper technical work. I didn\u2019t launch many large, complete website projects. The few I did were quite long-running things so it&#8217;s not really felt like much both started  and finished within the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did a lot of support and minor updates and smaller, but technically complex changes. Though I\u2019m freelance, I work with a couple of \u201cteams\u201d, and I tend to field the stuff that other people get stuck with, such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>working closely with a hosting company to recover a site that\u2019s been subject to a sophisticated hacking attempt<\/li><li>building a Ninja Forms extension to add clever new fields<\/li><li>tweaking an off-the-shelf SVG world map to correct country boundaries<\/li><li>building proxy APIs to make third-party service integrations more reliable<\/li><li>or figuring out other people\u2019s code to build plugins, integrate with APIs and tweak and fix existing sites.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I did do a few smaller, end-to-end website projects, and I was SUPER proud to have done a some of them entirely under my own steam without even help from a designer!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the year I unexpectedly ended up looking into \u201cproper jobs\u201d, but then subsequently found out that a) it\u2019s currently too hard for me to wind down <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/\">Oikos<\/a> to a place where I can leave it and b) I need to retain flexibility to support some possible future career moves for my wife, while discharging all the parenting duties that we need to fit into a week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It DOES feel like change is afoot, it\u2019s just not going to happen immediately and I don\u2019t yet know when it will happen. I was REALLY encouraged that several people were very interested in employing me for permanent developer roles, and its definitely got me working on simplifying the business so I can make that move at some future point if I want to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOT TOPICS! GDPR and Gutenberg<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be remiss of me to neglect the two Hot Topics of the year in my world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>GDPR got in the way in May just as I was Doing All The Things because of the broken ankle. But I focussed hard on doing the Right Thing for GDPR and I have processes, audits, and documents that should all support my data protection efforts. I was thrilled when a large charity declared that I didn\u2019t have to sign their own data processing agreement because my own legal documentation was more than sufficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg &#8211; the new WordPress editor &#8211; also finally came along in December after a year of debate and discussion. People have claimed it has been a smooth transition, but for small agencies like me and the people that I work closely with we\u2019ve not let many of our clients loose with the new editor yet, so the pain is yet to come. And from a personal point of view I don\u2019t like the new editor, I don\u2019t get what it\u2019s for, it\u2019s going to need to me to re-tool and re-skill somewhat in order to use it properly on projects, and it feels like a change in the direction of WordPress that doesn\u2019t suit me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Learning and Playing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve continued to dig into learning Laravel, I\u2019ve been trying to #LearnToLoveJS (JavaScript), I\u2019ve been practicing with Vue.js a lot and have done a little React and Advanced Gutenberg training too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also dug in to Test Driven Development, which has been on my radar for a while. A couple of my side projects exist mostly to get to grips with TDD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back through my GitHub history I kicked off a LOAD of little side project things. I was sure many were from previous years, but it seems that this year I\u2019ve been churning stuff out in my \u201cspare\u201d time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https:\/\/yet.fyi\">https:\/\/yet.fyi<\/a> &#8211; This is the best domain that I own. I built a very simple app for showing Yes\/No status pages on URLs like <a href=\"https:\/\/hasdaviddavisresigned.yet.fyi\/\">https:\/\/hasdaviddavisresigned.yet.fyi\/<\/a>. This project was my first real-world use of TDD though and it was simple enough to get started.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/kownter.com\">https:\/\/kownter.com<\/a> &#8211; this was also an excuse to do TDD but at a larger scale. Amongst the difficulties of GDPR I decided to see what it would take to build cookie-less, strong-privacy, simple analytics. The basics of it works, but it has fallen off my radar.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/wptolaravel.com\">https:\/\/wptolaravel.com<\/a> &#8211; I finished off the videos and course \u201cplatform\u201d for my free course introducing WP developers to the Laravel framework<\/li><li>SchoolBot (no link &#8211; yet!, but see <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/08\/about-schoolbot\/\">About SchoolBot<\/a>) &#8211; I\u2019m a school parent now and getting access to information I need on a day to day basis can be tricky, so I made a chatbot that sits on top of a parent information database. It super cool. I should probably do better marketing of it.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/zapthemap.com\">https:\/\/zapthemap.com<\/a> &#8211; While the incredibly successful \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/beatthestreet.me\/swindon\">Beat the Street<\/a>\u201d scheme was running in my home town of Swindon, I decided to see if you could make a \u201cvirtual\u201d version of it. It was a great chance to tinker with some mobile browser API\u2019s for location and orientation, practice my Vue.js and Laravel, and to re-learn some trigonometry and maths! <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also really interesting to start a JavaScript channel in the UK WordPress Slack and to find I\u2019m actually more practiced than many with my JavaScript.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Speaking and conferences<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I did less speaking this year. My only conference talk submission was rejected, so I attended WordCamp London as a punter this year, which was actually quite nice for a break. I really wanted to get to either WordCamp Manchester or WordCamp Edinburgh, but the autumn was so chock full of work that I couldn\u2019t. I also bought a ticket to the first UK Laravel conference, Laravel Live, in June but failed to make it because I was still picking up the pieces of the broken ankle saga.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I delivered a talk at the WordPress Bristol People meetup on using developer tools in the browser (<a href=\"https:\/\/wpbristol.co.uk\/developer-tools-tips-tricks-and-social-media-for-business-qa-tues-6th-feb\/\">link<\/a>), I thought I\u2019d also done this at the Cheltenham WordPress Meetup, but it looks like this was back in 2017.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the back of this talk I started making a set of <a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/for-developers\/web-browser-developer-tools\/\">screencasts on using developer tools<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also started recording a <a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/?page_id=642&amp;preview=true\">series on using the command line\/terminal<\/a> right from the very basics of the first Linux commands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general I tried to double down on video as my means of sharing knowledge. It\u2019s great because it doesn\u2019t need as much planning and I don\u2019t need to book travel or accommodation to do it. So in a year where traveling was hard it was great to help people out using this medium and it\u2019s something I hope will continue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Breadmaking is on the rise<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in May, at peak-Ankle-Breaking-Crisis, my good friend Chris brought me a small plastic tub of gloop. This gloop was an apparently-several-year-old sourdough starter. He also brought me a loaf of sourdough bread, and a bag of organic rye flour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Sourdough starter and recipe\" class=\"wp-image-4461\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-945x709.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This may seem like it was a bit of a crazy time to start regularly making slow-proving bread, but actually, I was stuck at home a lot of the time, and I needed a distraction from things. And so making bread became a thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually love the rituals of food and drink. I enjoy the morning coffee-making ritual, for example, be it pour-over filter or more complicated espresso-based drinks. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve always being intrigued by baking &#8211; it seems a good combination of ritual, process, science and art.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve been baking regularly ever since. I did get a bit stuck with loaves getting stuck in the proving baskets &#8211; a problem fixed with a dusting of rice flour &#8211; and the rise is inconsistent, especially with part-wholemeal loaves. But it&#8217;s been great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Sourdough loaf\" class=\"wp-image-4462\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-945x709.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve reduced plastic use: flour in paper bags is delivered (from Shipton Mill) in cardboard boxes and the rest of the process is pretty plastic-free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s somewhat better for you &#8211; apparently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve done some maths and worked out that even with premium flour it&#8217;s actually cheaper than buying bread in the supermarket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we now have our own tub of gloop that&#8217;s been in our house for about 8 months that frequently finds its way into our bread! I&#8217;ll happily take questions on how to make sourdough and share what I know with you. Ask me anything!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What\u2019s up in 2019?!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s been a great year in many ways. My little family is growing up, and this will continue. Business has been a bit lean because I&#8217;ve needed to focus on family. But I&#8217;ve kept busy and feel like I&#8217;m in a good place to focus on the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll try to write about next! So look out for the 2019 plans post!<\/p>\n",

        "title": "2018 Breaking and Making",
        "content": "\n<p>2018 seems to have flown by, but actually a LOT has happened and a lot has been achieved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Personal and financial<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally it\u2019s been a mixed year, as they usually are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been a lot of great things: the kids turned two and seven (they\u2019re actually just-turned-seven and very-nearly-three).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eldest has really settled in year 2 and is thriving at school both academically and socially.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Youngest is now much better able to look after herself. She\u2019s very much nearly sleeping through the night every night, which means our sleep routines are approaching something normal. She\u2019s on her way to being potty trained (which is good) and dropping her nap (which is a mixed blessing). She was a bit terrible-two, but really not all that much and I think she\u2019ll be a super-fun three year old.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, family-wise, we\u2019re much more settled and solo double-bedtimes are quite routine now which means its easier for at least one of us to go out of an evening! Yay! Can we have our life back now please?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\u2019s not been without difficulty. My wife broke her ankle in April. It was a pretty simple break, but for 6 weeks I had to do EVERYTHING. People would ask if Sally was doing OK, I would half- (and on half-) jokingly say \u201cShe\u2019s fine. She gets to sit around all day while I do ALL THE THINGS!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds funny. Bit it was actually very stressful and it really pushed me to breaking point. I somehow had to manage to keep my work running while doing all the school runs and shopping trips and cooking and cleaning and gardening and carrying anything that needed carrying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we did it. We got through, and I know people who have endured MUCH worse. But it did leave me in catchup mode for June\/July and then before I knew it we had summer holidays to cover too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financially we\u2019re not struggling, but the ankle-break and my subsequent loss of hours did hit us a bit. We\u2019re both working slightly part time to be able to spend time with our kids in the week, and already pay a financial penalty as a result, so the lost time hit us. I feel like this will be a break-even year, which is OK. But next year will need to be better!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Work<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I didn\u2019t actually do a huge amount of proper technical work. I didn\u2019t launch many large, complete website projects. The few I did were quite long-running things so it&#8217;s not really felt like much both started  and finished within the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did a lot of support and minor updates and smaller, but technically complex changes. Though I\u2019m freelance, I work with a couple of \u201cteams\u201d, and I tend to field the stuff that other people get stuck with, such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>working closely with a hosting company to recover a site that\u2019s been subject to a sophisticated hacking attempt<\/li><li>building a Ninja Forms extension to add clever new fields<\/li><li>tweaking an off-the-shelf SVG world map to correct country boundaries<\/li><li>building proxy APIs to make third-party service integrations more reliable<\/li><li>or figuring out other people\u2019s code to build plugins, integrate with APIs and tweak and fix existing sites.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I did do a few smaller, end-to-end website projects, and I was SUPER proud to have done a some of them entirely under my own steam without even help from a designer!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the year I unexpectedly ended up looking into \u201cproper jobs\u201d, but then subsequently found out that a) it\u2019s currently too hard for me to wind down <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/\">Oikos<\/a> to a place where I can leave it and b) I need to retain flexibility to support some possible future career moves for my wife, while discharging all the parenting duties that we need to fit into a week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It DOES feel like change is afoot, it\u2019s just not going to happen immediately and I don\u2019t yet know when it will happen. I was REALLY encouraged that several people were very interested in employing me for permanent developer roles, and its definitely got me working on simplifying the business so I can make that move at some future point if I want to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HOT TOPICS! GDPR and Gutenberg<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be remiss of me to neglect the two Hot Topics of the year in my world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>GDPR got in the way in May just as I was Doing All The Things because of the broken ankle. But I focussed hard on doing the Right Thing for GDPR and I have processes, audits, and documents that should all support my data protection efforts. I was thrilled when a large charity declared that I didn\u2019t have to sign their own data processing agreement because my own legal documentation was more than sufficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg &#8211; the new WordPress editor &#8211; also finally came along in December after a year of debate and discussion. People have claimed it has been a smooth transition, but for small agencies like me and the people that I work closely with we\u2019ve not let many of our clients loose with the new editor yet, so the pain is yet to come. And from a personal point of view I don\u2019t like the new editor, I don\u2019t get what it\u2019s for, it\u2019s going to need to me to re-tool and re-skill somewhat in order to use it properly on projects, and it feels like a change in the direction of WordPress that doesn\u2019t suit me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Learning and Playing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve continued to dig into learning Laravel, I\u2019ve been trying to #LearnToLoveJS (JavaScript), I\u2019ve been practicing with Vue.js a lot and have done a little React and Advanced Gutenberg training too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also dug in to Test Driven Development, which has been on my radar for a while. A couple of my side projects exist mostly to get to grips with TDD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back through my GitHub history I kicked off a LOAD of little side project things. I was sure many were from previous years, but it seems that this year I\u2019ve been churning stuff out in my \u201cspare\u201d time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https:\/\/yet.fyi\">https:\/\/yet.fyi<\/a> &#8211; This is the best domain that I own. I built a very simple app for showing Yes\/No status pages on URLs like <a href=\"https:\/\/hasdaviddavisresigned.yet.fyi\/\">https:\/\/hasdaviddavisresigned.yet.fyi\/<\/a>. This project was my first real-world use of TDD though and it was simple enough to get started.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/kownter.com\">https:\/\/kownter.com<\/a> &#8211; this was also an excuse to do TDD but at a larger scale. Amongst the difficulties of GDPR I decided to see what it would take to build cookie-less, strong-privacy, simple analytics. The basics of it works, but it has fallen off my radar.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/wptolaravel.com\">https:\/\/wptolaravel.com<\/a> &#8211; I finished off the videos and course \u201cplatform\u201d for my free course introducing WP developers to the Laravel framework<\/li><li>SchoolBot (no link &#8211; yet!, but see <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/08\/about-schoolbot\/\">About SchoolBot<\/a>) &#8211; I\u2019m a school parent now and getting access to information I need on a day to day basis can be tricky, so I made a chatbot that sits on top of a parent information database. It super cool. I should probably do better marketing of it.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/zapthemap.com\">https:\/\/zapthemap.com<\/a> &#8211; While the incredibly successful \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/beatthestreet.me\/swindon\">Beat the Street<\/a>\u201d scheme was running in my home town of Swindon, I decided to see if you could make a \u201cvirtual\u201d version of it. It was a great chance to tinker with some mobile browser API\u2019s for location and orientation, practice my Vue.js and Laravel, and to re-learn some trigonometry and maths! <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also really interesting to start a JavaScript channel in the UK WordPress Slack and to find I\u2019m actually more practiced than many with my JavaScript.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Speaking and conferences<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I did less speaking this year. My only conference talk submission was rejected, so I attended WordCamp London as a punter this year, which was actually quite nice for a break. I really wanted to get to either WordCamp Manchester or WordCamp Edinburgh, but the autumn was so chock full of work that I couldn\u2019t. I also bought a ticket to the first UK Laravel conference, Laravel Live, in June but failed to make it because I was still picking up the pieces of the broken ankle saga.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I delivered a talk at the WordPress Bristol People meetup on using developer tools in the browser (<a href=\"https:\/\/wpbristol.co.uk\/developer-tools-tips-tricks-and-social-media-for-business-qa-tues-6th-feb\/\">link<\/a>), I thought I\u2019d also done this at the Cheltenham WordPress Meetup, but it looks like this was back in 2017.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the back of this talk I started making a set of <a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/for-developers\/web-browser-developer-tools\/\">screencasts on using developer tools<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also started recording a <a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/?page_id=642&amp;preview=true\">series on using the command line\/terminal<\/a> right from the very basics of the first Linux commands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general I tried to double down on video as my means of sharing knowledge. It\u2019s great because it doesn\u2019t need as much planning and I don\u2019t need to book travel or accommodation to do it. So in a year where traveling was hard it was great to help people out using this medium and it\u2019s something I hope will continue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Breadmaking is on the rise<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in May, at peak-Ankle-Breaking-Crisis, my good friend Chris brought me a small plastic tub of gloop. This gloop was an apparently-several-year-old sourdough starter. He also brought me a loaf of sourdough bread, and a bag of organic rye flour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Sourdough starter and recipe\" class=\"wp-image-4461\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-945x709.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fce-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This may seem like it was a bit of a crazy time to start regularly making slow-proving bread, but actually, I was stuck at home a lot of the time, and I needed a distraction from things. And so making bread became a thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually love the rituals of food and drink. I enjoy the morning coffee-making ritual, for example, be it pour-over filter or more complicated espresso-based drinks. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve always being intrigued by baking &#8211; it seems a good combination of ritual, process, science and art.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve been baking regularly ever since. I did get a bit stuck with loaves getting stuck in the proving baskets &#8211; a problem fixed with a dusting of rice flour &#8211; and the rise is inconsistent, especially with part-wholemeal loaves. But it&#8217;s been great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Sourdough loaf\" class=\"wp-image-4462\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-945x709.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_6fec-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve reduced plastic use: flour in paper bags is delivered (from Shipton Mill) in cardboard boxes and the rest of the process is pretty plastic-free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s somewhat better for you &#8211; apparently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve done some maths and worked out that even with premium flour it&#8217;s actually cheaper than buying bread in the supermarket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we now have our own tub of gloop that&#8217;s been in our house for about 8 months that frequently finds its way into our bread! I&#8217;ll happily take questions on how to make sourdough and share what I know with you. Ask me anything!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What\u2019s up in 2019?!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s been a great year in many ways. My little family is growing up, and this will continue. Business has been a bit lean because I&#8217;ve needed to focus on family. But I&#8217;ve kept busy and feel like I&#8217;m in a good place to focus on the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll try to write about next! So look out for the 2019 plans post!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>The physical <a href=\"https:\/\/beatthestreet.me\/\">Beat the Street<\/a> game had loads of funny sound effects when you tapped a box. So I wanted my virtual clone of it &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/zapthemap.com\/\">Zap the Map<\/a> &#8211; to have them too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article explains a difficulty I had with this because of the Safari browser&#8217;s auto-play policies and a workaround, whilst also detailing a slight mystery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Playing sound in a browser<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theoretically playing a sound in a browser is pretty simple. You create an <code>audio<\/code> element with the <code>src<\/code> attribute set to the URL of your sound, and then when you want to play it, you get the element in your JavaScript and you call the <code>play()<\/code> method:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;audio src=&quot;https:\/\/example.com\/assets\/sounds\/bang.mp3&quot;&gt;&lt;\/audio&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n  const sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n  sound.play();\n&lt;\/script&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Note that audio elements are not displayed by default so the <code>&lt;audio><\/code> is hidden from view.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with playing a sound using JavaScript is that browsers have auto-play policies that demand that a user interaction happen before you can play the sound. So a button click should work fine:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;audio src=&quot;https:\/\/example.com\/assets\/sounds\/bang.mp3&quot;&gt;&lt;\/audio&gt; \n\n&lt;button&gt;Play Sound&lt;\/button&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n  const sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n  const button = document.querySelector('button');\n  button.addEventListener('click', e =&gt; sound.play());\n&lt;\/script&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Note here that <code>sound.play()<\/code> actually returns a <code>Promise<\/code> which is resolved when playback starts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Playing sounds in Vue.js instance methods<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My example that I had problems with was a bit more complex than this. I&#8217;m running inside a Vue.js for a start and the click handler was a method on the application instance:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;button @click=&quot;tap&quot;&gt;Zap!&lt;\/button&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n  var app = new Vue({\n    el: '#app',\n    methods: {\n      tap: function () {\n        response = axios.post('\/api\/v1\/tap', {\n          \/\/ Some data,\n        }).then( e =&gt; {  \n          \/\/ Use arrow function to avoid binding this\n          if (response.data.points &gt; 0) {\n            this.playSound();\n          }\n        });\n      },\n      playSound: function() {\n        let sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n        sound.play();\n      }\n    }\n  });\n&lt;\/script&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Now, this worked fine in Chrome on my desktop, and in Firefox too. And after later testing it seemed to work fine on Chrome in Android as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in Safari, this sound was not playing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve produced a fairly minimal test case that reproduces this here: <a href=\"https:\/\/acoustic-snow.glitch.me\/\">https:\/\/acoustic-snow.glitch.me\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In constructing this case I found that if Vue.js wasn&#8217;t involved everything worked fine everywhere. So there&#8217;s something in Vue that causes some kind of interruption to the call stack when you execute the promise that Safari doesn&#8217;t understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Fix!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that I have a hacky fix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I explored the developer docs and StackOverflow trying to resolve this issue, I read somewhere, in passing, that once you&#8217;ve played the sound once on a user interaction, you can then play it again without further interaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I came up with the idea of setting the volume to zero and playing the sound in the click handler <em>before<\/em> the async operation, to &#8220;initialise&#8221; it, and then, once my async operation is complete, put the volume back up to 1 and play it again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This worked! Hooray!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;button @click=&quot;tap&quot;&gt;Zap!&lt;\/button&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n  var app = new Vue({\n    el: '#app',\n    methods: {\n      tap: function () {\n        this.loadSound();\n        response = axios.post('\/api\/v1\/tap', {\n          \/\/ Some data,\n        }).then( response =&gt; {\n          \/\/ Use arrow function to avoid binding this\n          if (response.data.points &gt; 0) {\n            this.playSound();\n          }\n        });\n      },\n      loadSound: function() {\n        let sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n        sound.volume = 0;\n        sound.play();\n      },\n      playSound: function() {\n        let sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n        sound.volume = 1;\n        sound.play();\n      }\n    }\n  });\n&lt;\/script&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A &#8220;fun&#8221; little mobile Safari bug?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To add to my fun, this application is a walking-around game. So I took it out testing it on my iPhone, and when I did I found that the sound played when it shouldn&#8217;t have!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a bit more digging I found what I can only assume is a proper Mobile Safari bug!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Aside: did you know if you have an iPhone and a Mac you can plug one into the other and use the developer tools in the desktop browser to inspect what is going on on the mobile device? Well if you didn&#8217;t, <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/AppleApplications\/Conceptual\/Safari_Developer_Guide\/GettingStarted\/GettingStarted.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40007874-CH2-SW8\"><em>you do now<\/em><\/a><em>!)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this whole <code>sound.volume = 0<\/code> thing &#8211; this didn&#8217;t work in my test case scenario with Vue.js involved. It seemed that <code>sound.volume<\/code> was read-only. And you can see this in the <a href=\"https:\/\/acoustic-snow.glitch.me\/\">sample test case<\/a> when you click the bottom button on mobile Safari.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.36.32.png\" alt=\"Console screengrab showing sound.volume assignment not working\" class=\"wp-image-4480\" width=\"252\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.36.32.png 410w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.36.32-300x187.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px\" \/><figcaption>Setting sound.volume has no effect on mobile Safari<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of my test case, and in desktop Safari, it&#8217;s fine, of course!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.40.16.png\" alt=\"Console screengrab showing sound.volume assignment working\" class=\"wp-image-4481\" width=\"368\" height=\"207\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.40.16.png 594w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.40.16-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" \/><figcaption>But it&#8217;s fine on desktop Safari!<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, once I&#8217;d tracked this down, I discovered that <code>sound.muted<\/code> worked fine.

        "content": "\n<p>The physical <a href=\"https:\/\/beatthestreet.me\/\">Beat the Street<\/a> game had loads of funny sound effects when you tapped a box. So I wanted my virtual clone of it &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/zapthemap.com\/\">Zap the Map<\/a> &#8211; to have them too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article explains a difficulty I had with this because of the Safari browser&#8217;s auto-play policies and a workaround, whilst also detailing a slight mystery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Playing sound in a browser<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theoretically playing a sound in a browser is pretty simple. You create an <code>audio<\/code> element with the <code>src<\/code> attribute set to the URL of your sound, and then when you want to play it, you get the element in your JavaScript and you call the <code>play()<\/code> method:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;audio src=&quot;https:\/\/example.com\/assets\/sounds\/bang.mp3&quot;&gt;&lt;\/audio&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n  const sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n  sound.play();\n&lt;\/script&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Note that audio elements are not displayed by default so the <code>&lt;audio><\/code> is hidden from view.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with playing a sound using JavaScript is that browsers have auto-play policies that demand that a user interaction happen before you can play the sound. So a button click should work fine:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;audio src=&quot;https:\/\/example.com\/assets\/sounds\/bang.mp3&quot;&gt;&lt;\/audio&gt; \n\n&lt;button&gt;Play Sound&lt;\/button&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n  const sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n  const button = document.querySelector('button');\n  button.addEventListener('click', e =&gt; sound.play());\n&lt;\/script&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Note here that <code>sound.play()<\/code> actually returns a <code>Promise<\/code> which is resolved when playback starts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Playing sounds in Vue.js instance methods<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My example that I had problems with was a bit more complex than this. I&#8217;m running inside a Vue.js for a start and the click handler was a method on the application instance:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;button @click=&quot;tap&quot;&gt;Zap!&lt;\/button&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n  var app = new Vue({\n    el: '#app',\n    methods: {\n      tap: function () {\n        response = axios.post('\/api\/v1\/tap', {\n          \/\/ Some data,\n        }).then( e =&gt; {  \n          \/\/ Use arrow function to avoid binding this\n          if (response.data.points &gt; 0) {\n            this.playSound();\n          }\n        });\n      },\n      playSound: function() {\n        let sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n        sound.play();\n      }\n    }\n  });\n&lt;\/script&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Now, this worked fine in Chrome on my desktop, and in Firefox too. And after later testing it seemed to work fine on Chrome in Android as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in Safari, this sound was not playing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve produced a fairly minimal test case that reproduces this here: <a href=\"https:\/\/acoustic-snow.glitch.me\/\">https:\/\/acoustic-snow.glitch.me\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In constructing this case I found that if Vue.js wasn&#8217;t involved everything worked fine everywhere. So there&#8217;s something in Vue that causes some kind of interruption to the call stack when you execute the promise that Safari doesn&#8217;t understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Fix!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that I have a hacky fix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I explored the developer docs and StackOverflow trying to resolve this issue, I read somewhere, in passing, that once you&#8217;ve played the sound once on a user interaction, you can then play it again without further interaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I came up with the idea of setting the volume to zero and playing the sound in the click handler <em>before<\/em> the async operation, to &#8220;initialise&#8221; it, and then, once my async operation is complete, put the volume back up to 1 and play it again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This worked! Hooray!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: jscript; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;button @click=&quot;tap&quot;&gt;Zap!&lt;\/button&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n  var app = new Vue({\n    el: '#app',\n    methods: {\n      tap: function () {\n        this.loadSound();\n        response = axios.post('\/api\/v1\/tap', {\n          \/\/ Some data,\n        }).then( response =&gt; {\n          \/\/ Use arrow function to avoid binding this\n          if (response.data.points &gt; 0) {\n            this.playSound();\n          }\n        });\n      },\n      loadSound: function() {\n        let sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n        sound.volume = 0;\n        sound.play();\n      },\n      playSound: function() {\n        let sound = document.querySelector('audio');\n        sound.volume = 1;\n        sound.play();\n      }\n    }\n  });\n&lt;\/script&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A &#8220;fun&#8221; little mobile Safari bug?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To add to my fun, this application is a walking-around game. So I took it out testing it on my iPhone, and when I did I found that the sound played when it shouldn&#8217;t have!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a bit more digging I found what I can only assume is a proper Mobile Safari bug!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Aside: did you know if you have an iPhone and a Mac you can plug one into the other and use the developer tools in the desktop browser to inspect what is going on on the mobile device? Well if you didn&#8217;t, <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/AppleApplications\/Conceptual\/Safari_Developer_Guide\/GettingStarted\/GettingStarted.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40007874-CH2-SW8\"><em>you do now<\/em><\/a><em>!)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this whole <code>sound.volume = 0<\/code> thing &#8211; this didn&#8217;t work in my test case scenario with Vue.js involved. It seemed that <code>sound.volume<\/code> was read-only. And you can see this in the <a href=\"https:\/\/acoustic-snow.glitch.me\/\">sample test case<\/a> when you click the bottom button on mobile Safari.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.36.32.png\" alt=\"Console screengrab showing sound.volume assignment not working\" class=\"wp-image-4480\" width=\"252\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.36.32.png 410w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.36.32-300x187.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px\" \/><figcaption>Setting sound.volume has no effect on mobile Safari<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of my test case, and in desktop Safari, it&#8217;s fine, of course!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.40.16.png\" alt=\"Console screengrab showing sound.volume assignment working\" class=\"wp-image-4481\" width=\"368\" height=\"207\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.40.16.png 594w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-22.40.16-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" \/><figcaption>But it&#8217;s fine on desktop Safari!<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, once I&#8217;d tracked this down, I discovered that <code>sound.muted<\/code> worked fine. So now, I just set both. I won&#8217;t post code for that but you can see it in the <a href=\"https:\/\/acoustic-snow.glitch.me\/\">sample test case<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summing up!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>In some odd cases that seem to involve Vue.js (in my case at least) and asynchronous operations, Safari&#8217;s auto-playing media policies seem to prevent playing sounds, when playing them should be OK and when other browsers are fine with playing them.<\/li><li>There is a workaround that involves playing the sound in muted form before the async operation happens.<\/li><li>There is a weird bug in Mobile Safari, I think, that prevents HTTPMediaElement.volume being updated, that almost certainly no one will ever come across.<\/li><li>Playing sounds in web browsers SEEMS easy, but it turns out not to be!<\/li><\/ul>\n",
