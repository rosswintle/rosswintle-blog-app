Singing and playing this song at the same time is really hard.  So I know all the words, and I know all the music, but I can&#8217;t do both at the same time!<\/p>\n<p>Last week was Song 8 and I had a go at learning The Monkees &#8220;Daydream Believer&#8221;.  Another piece that I know all the words to already and so it should just be a case of committing the chords to memory, but again, rhythm got me stuck.  This really isn&#8217;t a guitar song&#8230;at least, not without some major re-arrangement.  So I gave up quite quickly.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve even memorised the chords.  Consider this dropped from the list!<\/p>\n<p>And so I approached song 9.  Leornard Cohen&#8217;s &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221;, which has been covered by many people in many different ways.  I&#8217;m attempting a fairly standard take of it on the accoustic guitar.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been simultaneously looking forward to and dreading this one.  When I mentioned it to Sally she expressed some doubt about it &#8211; it sounded to her like quite a complicated piece.  But I reckoned the chords weren&#8217;t too difficult (I&#8217;m sufficiently musical that I can tell a complicated chord sequence).  But any song that&#8217;s really a melancholy piano piece that will have to be carefully picked on the guitar is gonna be a bit hard.<\/p>\n<p>So I was delighted to find it not all that hard at all.  OK, so I don&#8217;t do it justice &#8211; it&#8217;s a beautiful song and I play it clumsily &#8211; but I can play C, F, G, Em and Am, and get between them, pretty OK.  I&#8217;ve still got some words to learn but most of them are there.  And it&#8217;s been a real joy to do.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m away on holiday next week so the next song may have to wait.  I&#8217;m well behind but have nearly 10 under my belt.  That&#8217;s 10 songs more than I knew by heart three months ago!  Yay!<\/p>\n",

Singing and playing this song at the same time is really hard.  So I know all the words, and I know all the music, but I can&#8217;t do both at the same time!<\/p>\n<p>Last week was Song 8 and I had a go at learning The Monkees &#8220;Daydream Believer&#8221;.  Another piece that I know all the words to already and so it should just be a case of committing the chords to memory, but again, rhythm got me stuck.  This really isn&#8217;t a guitar song&#8230;at least, not without some major re-arrangement.  So I gave up quite quickly.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve even memorised the chords.  Consider this dropped from the list!<\/p>\n<p>And so I approached song 9.  Leornard Cohen&#8217;s &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221;, which has been covered by many people in many different ways.  I&#8217;m attempting a fairly standard take of it on the accoustic guitar.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been simultaneously looking forward to and dreading this one.  When I mentioned it to Sally she expressed some doubt about it &#8211; it sounded to her like quite a complicated piece.  But I reckoned the chords weren&#8217;t too difficult (I&#8217;m sufficiently musical that I can tell a complicated chord sequence).  But any song that&#8217;s really a melancholy piano piece that will have to be carefully picked on the guitar is gonna be a bit hard.<\/p>\n<p>So I was delighted to find it not all that hard at all.  OK, so I don&#8217;t do it justice &#8211; it&#8217;s a beautiful song and I play it clumsily &#8211; but I can play C, F, G, Em and Am, and get between them, pretty OK.  I&#8217;ve still got some words to learn but most of them are there.  And it&#8217;s been a real joy to do.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m away on holiday next week so the next song may have to wait.  I&#8217;m well behind but have nearly 10 under my belt.  That&#8217;s 10 songs more than I knew by heart three months ago!  Yay!<\/p>\n",

But we totally missed it at the cinema.<\/p>\n<p>However, Sally&#8217;s borrowed it from a friend and so we sat down with a curry after a long, hard week, and watched it as light entertainment.<\/p>\n<p>It was a slight disappointment.  Pegg plays a security guard who&#8217;s low in self esteem and fitness.  It&#8217;s 5 years since he chickened out of marrying his pregnant girlfriend and ran off and he&#8217;s trying to get her back.  But she&#8217;s found anther man.  And so the fight is on.<\/p>\n<p>Pegg&#8217;s character trys to redeem himself, and find himself, through running.  The ex&#8217;s boyfriend is running a marathon and Pegg promises lots of people that he will run it.  He has three weeks to go from being able to run half way up the street, to being able to run 26 miles.  Not likely.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t tell you if he makes it (no spoilers here!).  But the file was vaguely entertaining &#8211; Pegg and his fellow actors are high on physical comedy and that alone carried the film for me.  But it was sorely disappointing in other places.  The plot was cheesy and the script pretty awful &#8211; though there were some nice scenes and certain themes that ran through the film worked well.  I felt I should have been more emotionally involved with the characters than I was &#8211; perhaps the comedy got in the way of that.  I didn&#8217;t notice bad acting or direction so maybe it wasn&#8217;t there, but there was nothing startling either.  Oh, and the product placement was pretty blatent!  Grrr.<\/p>\n<p>So, all in all, a mildly funny and entertaining rom-com (the &#8220;run-com&#8221; pun doesn&#8217;t <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">quite<\/span> work), but definitely not Pegg&#8217;s best.<\/p>\n",

But we totally missed it at the cinema.<\/p>\n<p>However, Sally&#8217;s borrowed it from a friend and so we sat down with a curry after a long, hard week, and watched it as light entertainment.<\/p>\n<p>It was a slight disappointment.  Pegg plays a security guard who&#8217;s low in self esteem and fitness.  It&#8217;s 5 years since he chickened out of marrying his pregnant girlfriend and ran off and he&#8217;s trying to get her back.  But she&#8217;s found anther man.  And so the fight is on.<\/p>\n<p>Pegg&#8217;s character trys to redeem himself, and find himself, through running.  The ex&#8217;s boyfriend is running a marathon and Pegg promises lots of people that he will run it.  He has three weeks to go from being able to run half way up the street, to being able to run 26 miles.  Not likely.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t tell you if he makes it (no spoilers here!).  But the file was vaguely entertaining &#8211; Pegg and his fellow actors are high on physical comedy and that alone carried the film for me.  But it was sorely disappointing in other places.  The plot was cheesy and the script pretty awful &#8211; though there were some nice scenes and certain themes that ran through the film worked well.  I felt I should have been more emotionally involved with the characters than I was &#8211; perhaps the comedy got in the way of that.  I didn&#8217;t notice bad acting or direction so maybe it wasn&#8217;t there, but there was nothing startling either.  Oh, and the product placement was pretty blatent!  Grrr.<\/p>\n<p>So, all in all, a mildly funny and entertaining rom-com (the &#8220;run-com&#8221; pun doesn&#8217;t <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">quite<\/span> work), but definitely not Pegg&#8217;s best.<\/p>\n",

I also confess that I&#8217;m strangely prejudiced against Winehouse&#8217;s music because of what I hear about her in the news.<\/p>\n<p>I was surprised, therefore, to find myself thinking that her songs, music and voice were all very good.  Certainly not what I&#8217;d normally listen to, but pretty cool stuff none the less.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll maybe write more when I&#8217;ve heard the album some more.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler: Private Investigations &#8211; The Best Of<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Sally and I went to the cinema a while back and an advert for this &#8220;Best Of&#8221; came on.  At the end of the advert we turned to each other and at the same time said, sheepishly, &#8220;I&#8217;d quite like to get that&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>And so we have a classic Dad-rock album.  A load of tunes that we mostly already know really well but never realised were by Dire Straits.  Some awesome guitar solos, some classic lyrics, and a great variety of music too, from upbeat rock and roll through blues, to some lilting ballads, but all done with great style and a very high level of musical skill.<\/p>\n<p>Oddly, it gets boring quite quickly, but we&#8217;re glad to have it in our collection.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Newton Faulkner: Hand Built By Robots<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re not really very up-to-date with new band and artists.  For some reason that neihter of us could pin down, we  wanted to give Newton Faulkner a try.<\/p>\n<p>And we&#8217;re glad we did!<\/p>\n<p>Mostly low-key, bluesy, indie guitar music, there&#8217;s a lot of variety on this album.  It reminds me, at times, of plently of other artists &#8211; from the swinging accoustic guitar and laid-back melodies of Jack Johnson, to the cheeky pop-rap of Barenaked Ladies.<\/p>\n<p>The album meanders slightly and seems a bit aimless at times, but it&#8217;s a good, summery, feel-good pop record.<\/p>\n",

Certainly not what I&#8217;d normally listen to, but pretty cool stuff none the less.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll maybe write more when I&#8217;ve heard the album some more.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler: Private Investigations &#8211; The Best Of<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Sally and I went to the cinema a while back and an advert for this &#8220;Best Of&#8221; came on.  At the end of the advert we turned to each other and at the same time said, sheepishly, &#8220;I&#8217;d quite like to get that&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>And so we have a classic Dad-rock album.  A load of tunes that we mostly already know really well but never realised were by Dire Straits.  Some awesome guitar solos, some classic lyrics, and a great variety of music too, from upbeat rock and roll through blues, to some lilting ballads, but all done with great style and a very high level of musical skill.<\/p>\n<p>Oddly, it gets boring quite quickly, but we&#8217;re glad to have it in our collection.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Newton Faulkner: Hand Built By Robots<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re not really very up-to-date with new band and artists.  For some reason that neihter of us could pin down, we  wanted to give Newton Faulkner a try.<\/p>\n<p>And we&#8217;re glad we did!<\/p>\n<p>Mostly low-key, bluesy, indie guitar music, there&#8217;s a lot of variety on this album.  It reminds me, at times, of plently of other artists &#8211; from the swinging accoustic guitar and laid-back melodies of Jack Johnson, to the cheeky pop-rap of Barenaked Ladies.<\/p>\n<p>The album meanders slightly and seems a bit aimless at times, but it&#8217;s a good, summery, feel-good pop record.<\/p>\n",

We mostly went because Sally was working on the National Trust stand and she got me a free &#8220;VIP&#8221; ticket.<\/p>\n<p>It was an interesting day with many contrasts.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I got lots of free stuff.  And I bought some expensive technical clothing.<\/li>\n<li>I felt inspired about the Great Outdoors. Yet I felt sad at the trashiness and commercialisation of it all.<\/li>\n<li>I had a fun and interesting day.  I had a long and tiring day.<\/li>\n<li>I could have stayed for many hours.  But I was kinda done and wanted to go home after two or three.<\/li>\n<li>There were some really neat and simple inventions for the outdoors enthusiast.  And there was Ford trying to sell big 4&#215;4&#8217;s.<\/li>\n<li>It was an outdoors show.  It was primarily indoors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>See what I mean?<\/p>\n<p>It was interesting to see how much was on offer.  Holidays, courses, bikes, canoes, volunteering, cars, careers, clothing, gadgets and so on.  I confess that we&#8217;re sucked in slightly to the commercial aspect, but we do also love the outdoors and there are plenty of people trying to make walking\/hiking\/cycling\/etc. accessible and take out some of the difficulties that the Joe Bloggs on the street might have.<\/p>\n<p>I enjoyed it.  But I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d have paid \u00a312 or \u00a316 quid to go + fuel + \u00a38 parking.  Maybe next year I&#8217;ll volunteer to help on the National Trust stand, get in for free, have a good couple of hours to look around and encourage people to give a little back to nature as well as just taking from it.<\/p>\n",

And I bought some expensive technical clothing.<\/li>\n<li>I felt inspired about the Great Outdoors. Yet I felt sad at the trashiness and commercialisation of it all.<\/li>\n<li>I had a fun and interesting day.  I had a long and tiring day.<\/li>\n<li>I could have stayed for many hours.  But I was kinda done and wanted to go home after two or three.<\/li>\n<li>There were some really neat and simple inventions for the outdoors enthusiast.  And there was Ford trying to sell big 4&#215;4&#8217;s.<\/li>\n<li>It was an outdoors show.  It was primarily indoors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>See what I mean?<\/p>\n<p>It was interesting to see how much was on offer.  Holidays, courses, bikes, canoes, volunteering, cars, careers, clothing, gadgets and so on.  I confess that we&#8217;re sucked in slightly to the commercial aspect, but we do also love the outdoors and there are plenty of people trying to make walking\/hiking\/cycling\/etc. accessible and take out some of the difficulties that the Joe Bloggs on the street might have.<\/p>\n<p>I enjoyed it.  But I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d have paid \u00a312 or \u00a316 quid to go + fuel + \u00a38 parking.  Maybe next year I&#8217;ll volunteer to help on the National Trust stand, get in for free, have a good couple of hours to look around and encourage people to give a little back to nature as well as just taking from it.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>Philip Pullman is an author with a reputation.  He is the children&#8217;s Dan Brown.  He&#8217;s known more for the controversy about what he writes than for how he writes.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t like Dan Brown&#8217;s writing.  I read the Da Vinci Code and though I thought it was gripping and exciting, it was also patronising and unbelievable.  I also read the first chapter of &#8220;Angels and Demons&#8221; and decided it was the SAME book!  I won&#8217;t mention Brown&#8217;s weird ideas about history and religion.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, though I approached the Northern Lights with scepticism due to the author&#8217;s reputation for bashing religion and the church, I&#8217;m thinking that Philip Pullman is an excellent author!<\/p>\n<p>I confess that I saw &#8220;The Golden Compass&#8221; &#8211; the film version of &#8220;The Northern Lights&#8221; &#8211; just before Christmas and before I read the book.  It was very much a children&#8217;s film, albeit quite a violent one, but an enjoyable romp with some imaginative scenery and special effects.  The &#8220;daemons&#8221; were entirely believable! Though I thought the compass effect was done about three times too many.<\/p>\n<p>I went to see the film with people who HAD read the book and they said that the book made much more sense.<\/p>\n<p>And it did.  Not only is Pullman an excellent author who provokes the imagination with enchanting descriptions and clever dialogue, he also spins a good yarn.  The world(s) he has created is large, varied and yet coherant.  He draws on reality but uses it flexibly to create somewhere of this world, possibly from another century, but also not of this world. <\/p>\n<p>Does he attack the church?  Well, I think so.  Somewhat.  He&#8217;s certainly very political and implies that the church has lots of influence on the state and indoctrinates children with it&#8217;s nasty ideas.  But he&#8217;s not attacking the church that I know.  I don&#8217;t know his background &#8211; maybe he has issues with the church &#8211; his own &#8220;demon&#8221;, if you like.  But I, as a member of The Church (meaning the body of people who follow Jesus Christ), didn&#8217;t feel particularly put out by it.  Plus, it&#8217;s allegorical, so, unlike the Da Vinci Code that presents itself as almost-factual, you&#8217;re free to see the church as being that of Pullman&#8217;s world, not of our own.<\/p>\n<p>The only REALLY weird thing was the Bible being translated into the context of Pullman&#8217;s world.  Oh, and his interpretation of it.  Most odd and made me feel slightly uneasy.<\/p>\n<p>The film and the book are a little out of synch.  Having seen film 1 and then read book 1 it will be interesting to read book 2 and THEN see film 2 to see how things progress.<\/p>\n<p>I found the book more grown up than the film &#8211; a better place for an adult to be.  I would sincerely hope that children would be reading it too!  The film &#8211; OK for kids but plain confusing for adults.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Philip Pullman is an author with a reputation.  He is the children&#8217;s Dan Brown.  He&#8217;s known more for the controversy about what he writes than for how he writes.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t like Dan Brown&#8217;s writing.  I read the Da Vinci Code and though I thought it was gripping and exciting, it was also patronising and unbelievable.  I also read the first chapter of &#8220;Angels and Demons&#8221; and decided it was the SAME book!  I won&#8217;t mention Brown&#8217;s weird ideas about history and religion.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, though I approached the Northern Lights with scepticism due to the author&#8217;s reputation for bashing religion and the church, I&#8217;m thinking that Philip Pullman is an excellent author!<\/p>\n<p>I confess that I saw &#8220;The Golden Compass&#8221; &#8211; the film version of &#8220;The Northern Lights&#8221; &#8211; just before Christmas and before I read the book.  It was very much a children&#8217;s film, albeit quite a violent one, but an enjoyable romp with some imaginative scenery and special effects.  The &#8220;daemons&#8221; were entirely believable! Though I thought the compass effect was done about three times too many.<\/p>\n<p>I went to see the film with people who HAD read the book and they said that the book made much more sense.<\/p>\n<p>And it did.  Not only is Pullman an excellent author who provokes the imagination with enchanting descriptions and clever dialogue, he also spins a good yarn.  The world(s) he has created is large, varied and yet coherant.  He draws on reality but uses it flexibly to create somewhere of this world, possibly from another century, but also not of this world. <\/p>\n<p>Does he attack the church?  Well, I think so.  Somewhat.  He&#8217;s certainly very political and implies that the church has lots of influence on the state and indoctrinates children with it&#8217;s nasty ideas.  But he&#8217;s not attacking the church that I know.  I don&#8217;t know his background &#8211; maybe he has issues with the church &#8211; his own &#8220;demon&#8221;, if you like.  But I, as a member of The Church (meaning the body of people who follow Jesus Christ), didn&#8217;t feel particularly put out by it.  Plus, it&#8217;s allegorical, so, unlike the Da Vinci Code that presents itself as almost-factual, you&#8217;re free to see the church as being that of Pullman&#8217;s world, not of our own.<\/p>\n<p>The only REALLY weird thing was the Bible being translated into the context of Pullman&#8217;s world.  Oh, and his interpretation of it.  Most odd and made me feel slightly uneasy.<\/p>\n<p>The film and the book are a little out of synch.  Having seen film 1 and then read book 1 it will be interesting to read book 2 and THEN see film 2 to see how things progress.<\/p>\n<p>I found the book more grown up than the film &#8211; a better place for an adult to be.  I would sincerely hope that children would be reading it too!  The film &#8211; OK for kids but plain confusing for adults.<\/p>\n",

As I drove back from the N.E.C. today, via my lovely Grandma&#8217;s for a cuppa, I noticed a Kebab van on the edge of a small town called Malmesbury (famous for it&#8217;s Naked Gardeners).  I think it was in this layby here:<\/p>\n<p>[googlemaps http:\/\/maps.google.co.uk\/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Malmesbury,+Wiltshire&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;s=AARTsJojaaoN-iacqTpehAEMs3OdvQFehA&amp;ll=51.585803,-2.089237&amp;spn=0.001167,0.00228&amp;z=18&amp;output=embed&amp;w=425&amp;h=350]<\/p>\n<p>If the link to Google Maps works you should be able to zoom out and see that this is on a quiet road with&#8230;err&#8230;no houses near it at all.  I imagine that quaint, antique-shoppy Malmesbury&#8217;s market for kebabs is pretty small and most passing cars won&#8217;t know there&#8217;s greasy food and cheap coffee in polystyrene cups available until they&#8217;re passed the damn thing and well on their way to Tetbury anyway.<\/p>\n<p>Can they make ANY money at all?<\/p>\n<p>And yet &#8211; someone had stopped to buy one!<\/p>\n<p>Who?

As I drove back from the N.E.C. today, via my lovely Grandma&#8217;s for a cuppa, I noticed a Kebab van on the edge of a small town called Malmesbury (famous for it&#8217;s Naked Gardeners).  I think it was in this layby here:<\/p>\n<p>[googlemaps http:\/\/maps.google.co.uk\/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Malmesbury,+Wiltshire&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;s=AARTsJojaaoN-iacqTpehAEMs3OdvQFehA&amp;ll=51.585803,-2.089237&amp;spn=0.001167,0.00228&amp;z=18&amp;output=embed&amp;w=425&amp;h=350]<\/p>\n<p>If the link to Google Maps works you should be able to zoom out and see that this is on a quiet road with&#8230;err&#8230;no houses near it at all.  I imagine that quaint, antique-shoppy Malmesbury&#8217;s market for kebabs is pretty small and most passing cars won&#8217;t know there&#8217;s greasy food and cheap coffee in polystyrene cups available until they&#8217;re passed the damn thing and well on their way to Tetbury anyway.<\/p>\n<p>Can they make ANY money at all?<\/p>\n<p>And yet &#8211; someone had stopped to buy one!<\/p>\n<p>Who? And why?<\/p>\n",

But I just think that football players are rude and obnoxious in comparison, there&#8217;s the minority of violent fans, and these external factors often ruin my enjoyment of the game.<\/p>\n<p>Rugby is a game for thugs, but, even in the professional version, they remain polite and respectful throughout and the players are humble and intelligent.  Plus, it&#8217;s MORE beautiful to watch when played well, MORE exciting and MORE entertaining.<\/p>\n<p>Only my opinions of course.<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;without a club to watch (Swindon Supermarine anybody?) I get very excited when the 6 Nations comes around each year and this year has been no exception, especially as England seem to be pulling themselves up a bit after their dismal first half of the World Cup last year.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking recently about the big famous guy &#8211; Jonny Wilkinson.  A while back, after winning the World Cup in 2003, he was injured a LOT and whenever he tried to come back to the game he got injured again.  I was really thinking that his career was over.<\/p>\n<p>And here he is, kicking the points that win games for England again, breaking points records, charging into wince-inducing tackles, and chucking the ball around like gravity doesn&#8217;t exist.  How did he get from there to here?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had a lot of injuries and illness lately and I&#8217;m recovering from that myself.  And, I can tell you, it feels great.  But at the time it was really hard on me and a lot of that was psychological.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that a big part of Wilkinson&#8217;s recovery is psychological.  When he speaks about it, Wilkinson says that his kicking is all about his mental focus and I believe that he applied that to his recovery.  In the same way he pictures the ball going between the posts from 50 metres, he pictures himself being well, recovering and playing again.  And it&#8217;s not just me &#8211; even the 6 Nations commentators have been talking a lot about his incredible &#8220;self belief&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m quite inspired by this.  I know that a lot of my recovery was actually thinking I was better. Yes, I believe that God helped with my psychological process (there&#8217;s a LOT of encouraging words to boost your self-esteem in the Bible), and I hope that I&#8217;m mentally a bit tougher for having gone through it.  But I also see how important it is that we think positively, even when we&#8217;re in pain or distress.<\/p>\n<p>Having said all of that, tomorrow is the final day of this year&#8217;s six nations, and I don&#8217;t think any about of positive thinking on behalf of myself or Jonny Wilkinson will reduce the number of points that Wales and France have.  We&#8217;ve no way to win.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps if I start thinking about 6 Nations 2009 now&#8230;<\/p>\n",

But I just think that football players are rude and obnoxious in comparison, there&#8217;s the minority of violent fans, and these external factors often ruin my enjoyment of the game.<\/p>\n<p>Rugby is a game for thugs, but, even in the professional version, they remain polite and respectful throughout and the players are humble and intelligent.  Plus, it&#8217;s MORE beautiful to watch when played well, MORE exciting and MORE entertaining.<\/p>\n<p>Only my opinions of course.<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;without a club to watch (Swindon Supermarine anybody?) I get very excited when the 6 Nations comes around each year and this year has been no exception, especially as England seem to be pulling themselves up a bit after their dismal first half of the World Cup last year.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking recently about the big famous guy &#8211; Jonny Wilkinson.  A while back, after winning the World Cup in 2003, he was injured a LOT and whenever he tried to come back to the game he got injured again.  I was really thinking that his career was over.<\/p>\n<p>And here he is, kicking the points that win games for England again, breaking points records, charging into wince-inducing tackles, and chucking the ball around like gravity doesn&#8217;t exist.  How did he get from there to here?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had a lot of injuries and illness lately and I&#8217;m recovering from that myself.  And, I can tell you, it feels great.  But at the time it was really hard on me and a lot of that was psychological.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that a big part of Wilkinson&#8217;s recovery is psychological.  When he speaks about it, Wilkinson says that his kicking is all about his mental focus and I believe that he applied that to his recovery.  In the same way he pictures the ball going between the posts from 50 metres, he pictures himself being well, recovering and playing again.  And it&#8217;s not just me &#8211; even the 6 Nations commentators have been talking a lot about his incredible &#8220;self belief&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m quite inspired by this.  I know that a lot of my recovery was actually thinking I was better. Yes, I believe that God helped with my psychological process (there&#8217;s a LOT of encouraging words to boost your self-esteem in the Bible), and I hope that I&#8217;m mentally a bit tougher for having gone through it.  But I also see how important it is that we think positively, even when we&#8217;re in pain or distress.<\/p>\n<p>Having said all of that, tomorrow is the final day of this year&#8217;s six nations, and I don&#8217;t think any about of positive thinking on behalf of myself or Jonny Wilkinson will reduce the number of points that Wales and France have.  We&#8217;ve no way to win.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps if I start thinking about 6 Nations 2009 now&#8230;<\/p>\n",

Well, not locks, but little sliding latches.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Easy&#8221;, I thought.  Jusy buy &#8217;em, from B&amp;Q, fix one bit to the door and another bit to the frame and Bob&#8217;s your uncle!<\/p>\n<p>Not so!  Did you know that there are two types of simple sliding latch?  I didn&#8217;t!<\/p>\n<p>The first one went on fine.  More fluke than anything.<\/p>\n<p>I got the first bit of the second one on and then suddenly realised that it was not going to work.  I had to go and buy another latch of a slightly different type!<\/p>\n<p>A quick explanation.  It all depends on which side of the door you&#8217;re on.  From one side a door closes agains the frame.  I&#8217;ll call this the &#8220;outside&#8221; of the door.  When the door is closed it sits behind a chunk of wood.  In this case you can use a latch which slides into a hole in the frame.  Like this&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-apzUKeIVI\/AAAAAAAAB4o\/fjxGqWpRaw4\/s1600-h\/IMG_0421.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-apzUKeIVI\/AAAAAAAAB4o\/fjxGqWpRaw4\/s400\/IMG_0421.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>If you&#8217;re on the &#8220;inside&#8221; of the door, the door is flush with the frame &#8211; so you don&#8217;t have the chunk of wood to drill a big hole into.  So you have to have a raised &#8220;hole&#8221; for the latch to fit into.  Like this&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-arYUKeIWI\/AAAAAAAAB4w\/0limCbj1p2k\/s1600-h\/IMG_0417.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-arYUKeIWI\/AAAAAAAAB4w\/0limCbj1p2k\/s400\/IMG_0417.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>It WELL confused me for a while.  It all makes perfect sense now but why didn&#8217;t we think of it before?  How am I supposed to know that there&#8217;s two different sorts of latch.<\/p>\n<p>I believe this is what people call &#8220;trial and error&#8221;.  I sense there may be more of this ahead!<\/p>\n",

Well, not locks, but little sliding latches.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Easy&#8221;, I thought.  Jusy buy &#8217;em, from B&amp;Q, fix one bit to the door and another bit to the frame and Bob&#8217;s your uncle!<\/p>\n<p>Not so!  Did you know that there are two types of simple sliding latch?  I didn&#8217;t!<\/p>\n<p>The first one went on fine.  More fluke than anything.<\/p>\n<p>I got the first bit of the second one on and then suddenly realised that it was not going to work.  I had to go and buy another latch of a slightly different type!<\/p>\n<p>A quick explanation.  It all depends on which side of the door you&#8217;re on.  From one side a door closes agains the frame.  I&#8217;ll call this the &#8220;outside&#8221; of the door.  When the door is closed it sits behind a chunk of wood.  In this case you can use a latch which slides into a hole in the frame.

I enjoy the challenge of learning them, and I&#8217;m a bit of a show off at heart (have you noticed?)  so I&#8217;d rather learn something that makes people go &#8220;You know ALL the words to that?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a couple of these on my list &#8211; Nothing Ever Happens turned out to be one!  And here&#8217;s another &#8211; Counting Crows&#8217; &#8220;Mr Jones&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I discovered Counting Crows a bit later than my contemporaries.  Their debut was, I believe, released in the 90&#8217;s but I only found them through Sally&#8217;s record collection a couple of years back.  And they&#8217;re awesome!<\/p>\n<p>A friend of mine who is a very good musician, and who&#8217;s musical opinion I very much respect, has Counting Crows&#8217; &#8220;August and Everything After&#8221; album on his list of top albums of the 90&#8217;s, and I really do agree &#8211; it&#8217;s an album I&#8217;ve listened to again and again and again and never grown bored of.  In fact, I keep finding more and more intricacies to keep me interested.  For example, the song &#8220;Anna Begins&#8221; was usually skipped over at first, but it&#8217;s a true gem that I choose to listen to now.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway &#8211; Mr Jones is a great song.  A poem set to music.  It&#8217;s rousing, thoughtful, interesting, and dynamic.  But it&#8217;s a complicated one.  I HAVE already learned all the words.  I will probably not be able to get them in the right order.  I know that the music contains d-minor&#8217;s &#8211; my least favourite chord.  But it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to learn.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m falling a bit behind again.  This is week 10, so I&#8217;ve skipped 3 songs.  But never mind.  So I really only have until Tuesday to learn this!  Eeek!<\/p>\n",

I enjoy the challenge of learning them, and I&#8217;m a bit of a show off at heart (have you noticed?)  so I&#8217;d rather learn something that makes people go &#8220;You know ALL the words to that?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a couple of these on my list &#8211; Nothing Ever Happens turned out to be one!  And here&#8217;s another &#8211; Counting Crows&#8217; &#8220;Mr Jones&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I discovered Counting Crows a bit later than my contemporaries.  Their debut was, I believe, released in the 90&#8217;s but I only found them through Sally&#8217;s record collection a couple of years back.  And they&#8217;re awesome!<\/p>\n<p>A friend of mine who is a very good musician, and who&#8217;s musical opinion I very much respect, has Counting Crows&#8217; &#8220;August and Everything After&#8221; album on his list of top albums of the 90&#8217;s, and I really do agree &#8211; it&#8217;s an album I&#8217;ve listened to again and again and again and never grown bored of.  In fact, I keep finding more and more intricacies to keep me interested.  For example, the song &#8220;Anna Begins&#8221; was usually skipped over at first, but it&#8217;s a true gem that I choose to listen to now.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway &#8211; Mr Jones is a great song.  A poem set to music.  It&#8217;s rousing, thoughtful, interesting, and dynamic.  But it&#8217;s a complicated one.  I HAVE already learned all the words.  I will probably not be able to get them in the right order.  I know that the music contains d-minor&#8217;s &#8211; my least favourite chord.  But it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to learn.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m falling a bit behind again.  This is week 10, so I&#8217;ve skipped 3 songs.  But never mind.  So I really only have until Tuesday to learn this!  Eeek!<\/p>\n",
