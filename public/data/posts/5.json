Genius.  I&#8217;m forever switching the kettle on, walking off and then forgetting about it (repeat three times before ACTUALLY making a cup of coffee).  It&#8217;s expensive but I reckon it&#8217;d pay for itself quickly (the manufacturer says 2 years) and save loads of energy too!<\/p>\n<p>I also discovered <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikely.com\">Bikely.com<\/a> further to my post about <a href=\"http:\/\/wintle.blogspot.com\/2007\/06\/route-planning-news.html\">route planning<\/a>, Bikely is now my favourite way of doing cycle routes.  It gives gradient profiles, allows you to share routes, downloads routes so that you can do fly-throughs in Google Earth.  The only thing it doesn&#8217;t really do is give you a decent map of a long route.  You can get a crib sheet with vague directions but I would want to do a long ride on roads that I don&#8217;t know with just that.  Recommended!<\/p>\n",

It gives gradient profiles, allows you to share routes, downloads routes so that you can do fly-throughs in Google Earth.  The only thing it doesn&#8217;t really do is give you a decent map of a long route.  You can get a crib sheet with vague directions but I would want to do a long ride on roads that I don&#8217;t know with just that.  Recommended!<\/p>\n",

Once the main upgrade was complete it was supposed to automatically go round and upgrade some components on some remote systems.  Because I don&#8217;t trust this process I was logged on to the remote server and watched it happen.  And I watched it fail.  The process just stopped without doing what it was supposed to do.  I then tried to do the upgrade on the remote system manually and that failed too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">I logged the fault with my software supplier and today they came back to me to say that it had initially failed because a disk was full, and that when I manually tried to re-run it, it failed again because a file was locked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">So, we pay thousands of pounds for this software and they people that develop it can&#8217;t even write:<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">$SUCCESS=open($FILE)<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">if (not $SUCCESS)<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">then<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">  log_error(&#8220;An error occurred while opening $FILE&#8221;)<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">end if<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Admittedly an error like this was written to a (very large and mostly indecipherable) log file, but did it not occur to them that this might be something that the user might like to know about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">I despair sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n",

I then tried to do the upgrade on the remote system manually and that failed too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">I logged the fault with my software supplier and today they came back to me to say that it had initially failed because a disk was full, and that when I manually tried to re-run it, it failed again because a file was locked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">So, we pay thousands of pounds for this software and they people that develop it can&#8217;t even write:<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">$SUCCESS=open($FILE)<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">if (not $SUCCESS)<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">then<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">  log_error(&#8220;An error occurred while opening $FILE&#8221;)<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">end if<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Admittedly an error like this was written to a (very large and mostly indecipherable) log file, but did it not occur to them that this might be something that the user might like to know about?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">I despair sometimes.<\/span><\/p>\n",

So when I buy new &#8220;toys&#8221;, I&#8217;ve generally thought quite hard about it.<\/p>\n<p>I really don&#8217;t intend to start making this a &#8220;Gadget Review Blog&#8221;, but when I buy new &#8220;toys&#8221; I&#8217;ll try and say why I bought them and what I think about them in the hope that my thoughts benefit someone else &#8211; or myself at a later date.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Why buy a little MP3 player?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The background to this is that, after much deliberation, I bought a big-proper 30GB Apple iPod about a year ago.  I&#8217;m very pleased with this and it&#8217;s good for long journeys, by train or car, or to give me a day&#8217;s tunes at work.  But, despite being almost miraculously small for what it does, it&#8217;s too big and too fragile to be used when walking, cycling (on quiet roads only of course), or when at the gym.<\/p>\n<p>So, for a while I&#8217;ve been thinking about a cheap, ultra-small, solid-state music player to go alongside it.  For the less-technical, solid-state means that it has no moving parts.  Given that I like iTunes (for reasons I won&#8217;t go into here), an iPod Shuffle seems like the obvious choice &#8211; as it will easily sync to an iTunes playlist (or smart playlist).  It took a while to come around to the idea of a player without a screen, but I can see how it fulfills the need to just shove something in your pocket full of your favourite tunes, and go.  So a Shuffle has been on my shopping list for a while.<\/p>\n<p>THEN, I discovered <a href=\"http:\/\/ita.sourceforge.net\/\">iTunes Agent<\/a>, which is a far-from perfect piece of software, but one which allows you to sync non-Apple devices with iTunes.  This opens up the possibilities a bit more.<\/p>\n<p>Originally I sync&#8217;ed my Sony Ericsson Walkman mobile phone with it, and took that to the gym a few times.  However, the controls on the walkman phone aren&#8217;t great (they get locked out by the phone&#8217;s &#8220;auto-lock&#8221; feature) but then I found the Creative &#8220;Stone&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Stone&#8221; is Creative&#8217;s equivalent of the iPod Shuffle.  It&#8217;s got 1GB capacity, no display, simple controls and ~8 hours battery life.  At around \u00a323, it&#8217;s about half the price of an iPod Shuffle!  Bargain.<\/p>\n<p>So I got one.  Here it is with headphones, close up, and next to some chewing gum for scale!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwonQOpJI\/AAAAAAAAAWo\/nxhCu3eECII\/s1600-h\/DSC00024.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"cursor:pointer;width:177px;height:132px;margin:5px auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwonQOpJI\/AAAAAAAAAWo\/nxhCu3eECII\/s400\/DSC00024.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>     <a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwwnQOpKI\/AAAAAAAAAWw\/SNRXPb07y1k\/s1600-h\/DSC00025.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"cursor:pointer;width:177px;height:133px;margin:5px auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwwnQOpKI\/AAAAAAAAAWw\/SNRXPb07y1k\/s400\/DSC00025.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>     <a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqxnHQOpMI\/AAAAAAAAAXA\/1F_7TcnEjB0\/s1600-h\/DSC00026.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"cursor:pointer;width:178px;height:133px;margin:5px auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqxnHQOpMI\/AAAAAAAAAXA\/1F_7TcnEjB0\/s400\/DSC00026.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Looks pretty.  Looks TINY!!! But does it do the job?<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m happy to say that yes, it does.  It&#8217;s easy to use, sounds good and does everything that it says it does.  I&#8217;ve not had the battery run out on me yet.  It feels sturdy and has survived many hours in my pocket already without much damage.<\/p>\n<p>I could only pick out three odd things, though these are more observations than annoyances.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It can only be charged from a USB port<\/span>.  It comes with a short mini-USB cable to do this, but other charging options would be nice. Having said that, charging is quick and the battery lasts a good while, particularly as it&#8217;s not a device I&#8217;ll use for LONG periods of time.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It takes a while to start up<\/span>.  When you turns it on there&#8217;s about 20 seconds of silence before it does anything.  My guess is that it&#8217;s scanning the files that you&#8217;ve loaded onto it. Fortunately it only does this after a total shutdown.  You can happily pause and restart music and it will only turn completely off if you leave it paused for a long time.<\/li>\n<li>Unlike the iPod Shuffle, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">it doesn&#8217;t have a &#8220;hold&#8221; switch<\/span> &#8211; used to &#8220;lock&#8221; the controls so that you don&#8217;t make accidental <a href=\"void(0)\"><span><\/span><\/a>button presses when the thing is in your pocket.  However, this isn&#8217;t a problem as the buttons are very nicely set up so that they need too much force to press accidentally, but not so much that you can&#8217;t easily use the controls.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Overall, I like my &#8220;Stone&#8221; and I&#8217;m glad I bought it.  It serves a simple purpose and will make many a trip to the gym with me.  I&#8217;d recommend it to someone that wants a simple, cheap, micro-sized media player, and with iTA, you can sync with iTunes and have a &#8220;Shuffle&#8221; equivalent for half the price.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>As a bit of a techie I like my gadgets.  I&#8217;m not over the top in this respect, but I like it when technology can improve my life or do something useful.  So when I buy new &#8220;toys&#8221;, I&#8217;ve generally thought quite hard about it.<\/p>\n<p>I really don&#8217;t intend to start making this a &#8220;Gadget Review Blog&#8221;, but when I buy new &#8220;toys&#8221; I&#8217;ll try and say why I bought them and what I think about them in the hope that my thoughts benefit someone else &#8211; or myself at a later date.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Why buy a little MP3 player?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The background to this is that, after much deliberation, I bought a big-proper 30GB Apple iPod about a year ago.  I&#8217;m very pleased with this and it&#8217;s good for long journeys, by train or car, or to give me a day&#8217;s tunes at work.  But, despite being almost miraculously small for what it does, it&#8217;s too big and too fragile to be used when walking, cycling (on quiet roads only of course), or when at the gym.<\/p>\n<p>So, for a while I&#8217;ve been thinking about a cheap, ultra-small, solid-state music player to go alongside it.  For the less-technical, solid-state means that it has no moving parts.  Given that I like iTunes (for reasons I won&#8217;t go into here), an iPod Shuffle seems like the obvious choice &#8211; as it will easily sync to an iTunes playlist (or smart playlist).  It took a while to come around to the idea of a player without a screen, but I can see how it fulfills the need to just shove something in your pocket full of your favourite tunes, and go.  So a Shuffle has been on my shopping list for a while.<\/p>\n<p>THEN, I discovered <a href=\"http:\/\/ita.sourceforge.net\/\">iTunes Agent<\/a>, which is a far-from perfect piece of software, but one which allows you to sync non-Apple devices with iTunes.  This opens up the possibilities a bit more.<\/p>\n<p>Originally I sync&#8217;ed my Sony Ericsson Walkman mobile phone with it, and took that to the gym a few times.  However, the controls on the walkman phone aren&#8217;t great (they get locked out by the phone&#8217;s &#8220;auto-lock&#8221; feature) but then I found the Creative &#8220;Stone&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Stone&#8221; is Creative&#8217;s equivalent of the iPod Shuffle.  It&#8217;s got 1GB capacity, no display, simple controls and ~8 hours battery life.  At around \u00a323, it&#8217;s about half the price of an iPod Shuffle!  Bargain.<\/p>\n<p>So I got one.  Here it is with headphones, close up, and next to some chewing gum for scale!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwonQOpJI\/AAAAAAAAAWo\/nxhCu3eECII\/s1600-h\/DSC00024.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"cursor:pointer;width:177px;height:132px;margin:5px auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwonQOpJI\/AAAAAAAAAWo\/nxhCu3eECII\/s400\/DSC00024.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>     <a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwwnQOpKI\/AAAAAAAAAWw\/SNRXPb07y1k\/s1600-h\/DSC00025.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"cursor:pointer;width:177px;height:133px;margin:5px auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwwnQOpKI\/AAAAAAAAAWw\/SNRXPb07y1k\/s400\/DSC00025.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>     <a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqxnHQOpMI\/AAAAAAAAAXA\/1F_7TcnEjB0\/s1600-h\/DSC00026.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"cursor:pointer;width:178px;height:133px;margin:5px auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqxnHQOpMI\/AAAAAAAAAXA\/1F_7TcnEjB0\/s400\/DSC00026.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Looks pretty.  Looks TINY!!! But does it do the job?<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m happy to say that yes, it does.  It&#8217;s easy to use, sounds good and does everything that it says it does.  I&#8217;ve not had the battery run out on me yet.  It feels sturdy and has survived many hours in my pocket already without much damage.<\/p>\n<p>I could only pick out three odd things, though these are more observations than annoyances.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It can only be charged from a USB port<\/span>.  It comes with a short mini-USB cable to do this, but other charging options would be nice. Having said that, charging is quick and the battery lasts a good while, particularly as it&#8217;s not a device I&#8217;ll use for LONG periods of time.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It takes a while to start up<\/span>.  When you turns it on there&#8217;s about 20 seconds of silence before it does anything.  My guess is that it&#8217;s scanning the files that you&#8217;ve loaded onto it. Fortunately it only does this after a total shutdown.  You can happily pause and restart music and it will only turn completely off if you leave it paused for a long time.<\/li>\n<li>Unlike the iPod Shuffle, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">it doesn&#8217;t have a &#8220;hold&#8221; switch<\/span> &#8211; used to &#8220;lock&#8221; the controls so that you don&#8217;t make accidental <a href=\"void(0)\"><span><\/span><\/a>button presses when the thing is in your pocket.  However, this isn&#8217;t a problem as the buttons are very nicely set up so that they need too much force to press accidentally, but not so much that you can&#8217;t easily use the controls.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Overall, I like my &#8220;Stone&#8221; and I&#8217;m glad I bought it.  It serves a simple purpose and will make many a trip to the gym with me.  I&#8217;d recommend it to someone that wants a simple, cheap, micro-sized media player, and with iTA, you can sync with iTunes and have a &#8220;Shuffle&#8221; equivalent for half the price.<\/p>\n",

He suggested the intuitive method (you&#8217;d expect them to be threaded so that they tighten when you pedal) but it doesn&#8217;t work like that.  For reference the RIGHT pedal has a NORMAL thread and the LEFT pedal is backwards.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Unclipping yourself<\/p>\n<p><\/span>I was initially a bit scared of falling off so I went for a ride up and down the alleyway at the back.  Where I learned that I tend to fall off to the left.  So though my brain decided that, because I&#8217;m right footed, I should unclip my right foot first, that also turns out to be counter-intuitive.  Actually, it does make sense if you think about it harder: I use my right foot to &#8220;lead&#8221; when I start pedalling, PLUS, when I stop I normally have the kerb on my left.  So when I stop I naturally remove my left foot and put it down, and I lean left to make that happen.<\/p>\n<p>So, with pedals replaced, brain correctly programmed to unclip left-foot-first, I set out on a short ride and managed not to fall off at all!<\/p>\n<p>My thighs hurt today though &#8211; the action of applying force for the full &#8220;cycle&#8221; of the crank means that you use other muscles&#8230;so more training may be required before I get fully up to speed.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll watch the speeds with interest!<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

So though my brain decided that, because I&#8217;m right footed, I should unclip my right foot first, that also turns out to be counter-intuitive.  Actually, it does make sense if you think about it harder: I use my right foot to &#8220;lead&#8221; when I start pedalling, PLUS, when I stop I normally have the kerb on my left.  So when I stop I naturally remove my left foot and put it down, and I lean left to make that happen.<\/p>\n<p>So, with pedals replaced, brain correctly programmed to unclip left-foot-first, I set out on a short ride and managed not to fall off at all!<\/p>\n<p>My thighs hurt today though &#8211; the action of applying force for the full &#8220;cycle&#8221; of the crank means that you use other muscles&#8230;so more training may be required before I get fully up to speed.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll watch the speeds with interest!<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

We bought a 6-year old Peugeot 206 when we moved to Swindon.  It&#8217;s actually the second car I&#8217;ve owned but the first one was old enough and small enough to be easily repairable and this second purchase has entered me into the realm of the &#8220;modern&#8221; car.<\/p>\n<p>Initially I had BIG regrets about this as it broke down twice, in quite dangerous situations, in the first couple of months.  When I say broke down I mean that the engine just stopped for no apparent reason.<\/p>\n<p>After MUCH work convincing the garage that there really was something wrong, they finally identified that the intermittent fault was an old relay which, when it go too hot, cut out most of the electrics &#8211; including the spark plugs!  We did get it fixed, and the car has been running fine now for some time.<\/p>\n<p>However &#8211; having just reached our first 10,000 miles it, the engine has developed a nasty rattle which the garage want \u00a3200 just to take apart and diagnose (and then another \u00a3200 to put it back together).  What with MOT&#8217;s and insurance and depreciation and servicing, I&#8217;m starting to question the value of owning a car.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m continuing to cycle and this week&#8217;s mini celebration is that the odometer on my cycle computer says that I finally clocked 1,000 miles.  Only took 9 months, which is pretty rubbish really.  Must start upping my distances!<\/p>\n<p>But that milestone also came at a price too as my bottom bracket disintegrated and the batteries on my cycle computer finally got low on power and needed replacing.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been an expensive month!!!<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s actually the second car I&#8217;ve owned but the first one was old enough and small enough to be easily repairable and this second purchase has entered me into the realm of the &#8220;modern&#8221; car.<\/p>\n<p>Initially I had BIG regrets about this as it broke down twice, in quite dangerous situations, in the first couple of months.  When I say broke down I mean that the engine just stopped for no apparent reason.<\/p>\n<p>After MUCH work convincing the garage that there really was something wrong, they finally identified that the intermittent fault was an old relay which, when it go too hot, cut out most of the electrics &#8211; including the spark plugs!  We did get it fixed, and the car has been running fine now for some time.<\/p>\n<p>However &#8211; having just reached our first 10,000 miles it, the engine has developed a nasty rattle which the garage want \u00a3200 just to take apart and diagnose (and then another \u00a3200 to put it back together).  What with MOT&#8217;s and insurance and depreciation and servicing, I&#8217;m starting to question the value of owning a car.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m continuing to cycle and this week&#8217;s mini celebration is that the odometer on my cycle computer says that I finally clocked 1,000 miles.  Only took 9 months, which is pretty rubbish really.  Must start upping my distances!<\/p>\n<p>But that milestone also came at a price too as my bottom bracket disintegrated and the batteries on my cycle computer finally got low on power and needed replacing.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been an expensive month!!!<\/p>\n",
