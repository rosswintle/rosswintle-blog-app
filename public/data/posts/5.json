And then, one day, you turn a little note you have lying around into <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">a midly-interactive single web page<\/a> and it takes off like nothing else before!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve not had a new project posted to Reddit or Hacker News before and I found the interactions and analytics data pretty fascinating. I&#8217;m aware that this post could be considered vanity, but I think I learned from it and I&#8217;m posting it because there are interesting lessons and data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s a few notes on and lessons from how the early days of caniphp.com have been.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The making of <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">caniphp.com<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In my 10+ years of WordPress and Laravel work I&#8217;ve worked on projects that use different versions of PHP. From WordPress plugins that cater for stupidly-old versions of PHP, just in case someone hasn&#8217;t updated their hosting, through to Laravel apps that are 100% under my control and can run the latest-and-greatest version of PHP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP has been evolving in amazingly positive ways. And this is awesome. But it does mean that I&#8217;m sometimes confused about what PHP features are available to me on any given project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And sometimes, because I&#8217;m not regularly using a particular piece of PHP syntax or language feature, I forget what it is or does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been particularly true for the <a href=\"https:\/\/stitcher.io\/blog\/why-we-need-multi-line-short-closures-in-php\">various different flavours of closure<\/a> \/ <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/?s=arrow+functions\">arrow functions<\/a> and all of the new coalescing-type <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/?s=operator\">operators<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/?s=spaceship\">spaceship<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/?s=nullsafe+operator\">nullsafe<\/a> operators which all use various combinations of <code>=<\/code> and <code>?<\/code>. I just never quite got them all into my medium-term memory!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I started keeping <a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\">a Bear note<\/a> with a list of the things that I keep forgetting which version they are in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"902\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-1024x902.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11012\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-1024x902.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-300x264.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-768x676.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-1536x1353.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-2048x1803.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It was always my intention to share this at some point. But it was messy and incomplete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then one day I saw <a href=\"https:\/\/www.caniemail.com\/\">caniemail.com<\/a> being shared. I liked the name and realised that a <a href=\"https:\/\/caniuse.com\/\">caniuse.com<\/a>-like site for PHP versions was what I wanted to make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">caniphp.com<\/a> domain was free, so I leapt on it, and spent a few hours (yeah, that&#8217;s all!) putting together an initial version.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1517409134135717888\">tweeted it to the world<\/a> on the morning of April 22nd. I thought a few people might be interested and find it useful, but what happened next was far beyond my expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My privacy-friendly <a href=\"https:\/\/usefathom.com\/ref\/SVE71E\">Fathom Analytics<\/a> has let me see that there have been three big spikes of traffic so far:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>22nd April: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1517409134135717888\">Twitter<\/a><\/li><li>29th April: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PHP\/comments\/uek2id\/can_i_php_caniusecom_but_for_php_features\/\">Reddit&#8217;s \/r\/php<\/a><\/li><li>5th May: <a href=\"https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=31269686\">Hacker News<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see the traffic chart below. And, as this is my first time having something posted to Reddit and Hacker News, I have thoughts about each of these bits of publicity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"580\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-1024x580.png\" alt=\"Analytics chart of two weeks traffic to caniphp.com\" class=\"wp-image-11013\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-1024x580.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-300x170.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-768x435.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-1536x870.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-2048x1160.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Analytics chart of two weeks traffic to caniphp.com<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Day 1: Twitter<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial Twitter response was pretty amazing. I don&#8217;t know for sure but I think this was probably my best performing Tweet of all time clocking up, to date, over 30,000 impressions and 3,000 engagements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not bad for little old me.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x-958x1024.png\" alt=\"Tweet analytics for the launch tweet\" class=\"wp-image-11014\" width=\"472\" height=\"504\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x-958x1024.png 958w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x-281x300.png 281w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x-768x821.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x.png 1193w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px\" \/><figcaption>Tweet analytics for the launch tweet<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Twitter was overwhelming positive. Sure, lots of people shared and retweeted without comment, and I can&#8217;t read into that. Perhaps people were mocking me? But I don&#8217;t think I see that. And there was not one bit of not-positive feedback.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People say Twitter is a &#8220;hell site&#8221;, but that really wasn&#8217;t the case here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what was Reddit like&#8230;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Day 8: Reddit<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not much of a Reddit user. So this was mostly a new experience for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I first noticed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PHP\/comments\/uek2id\/can_i_php_caniusecom_but_for_php_features\/\">the Reddit post<\/a> when analytics traffic showed a spike and I checked the referrers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PHP\/comments\/uek2id\/can_i_php_caniusecom_but_for_php_features\/\">The post itself<\/a> was totally impartial &#8211; just a link to the site. And I should say that I&#8217;m grateful to the person that shared it! Thank you!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the responses were mixed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually took some constructive stuff away from this. My MVP didn&#8217;t explain itself very well. In describing it as &#8220;caniuse.com for PHP&#8221; people thought it was going to be a much more complete list of PHP functions and features, as caniuse.com is for JavaScript and CSS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I addressed this as quickly as I could, adding explanatory text, and encouraging open source contributions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I did feel some of the comments were overly snarky. And I was somewhat baffled by people saying that it was useless, what was the point?, an IDE can do this, it doesn&#8217;t have any use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s fine if you think that. But it&#8217;s just your opinion. Don&#8217;t write if off as totally useless just because you use a different tool to do the same thing. I made it for me and I think it&#8217;s useful. So there&#8217;s that. No one&#8217;s making you use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Aside: I generally dislike opinions stated as fact. Adding &#8220;I think&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;In my opinion&#8230;&#8221; to a statement of opinion softens it and makes it less aggressive. I OFTEN ask myself if I can add &#8220;in my opinion&#8221; to a Tweet. But I guess some people are looking for a response. <code>\u00af_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af<\/code> )<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I responded with kindness and curiosity, I hope! And over time, the comments on Reddit turned into positivity. But of the three places that caniphp.com was discussed I felt it was the most hostile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Reddit traffic had a fairly sustained spike with most of the nearly 2,000 views happening in around 8 hours after the post. That traffic gradually faded after a couple of days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the one-day chart for the Reddit day:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-1024x340.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11017\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-1024x340.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-300x100.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-768x255.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-1536x510.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-2048x681.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The post got 136 upvotes and 45 comments. Pretty good. And nice to see that the post itself got WAY more upvotes than any of the comments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Day 14: Hacker News<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all the bad things you sometime hear about it, I have to say, I was pretty impressed with <a href=\"https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=31269686\">Hacker News<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/newsguidelines.html\">Their guidelines<\/a> are good &#8211; summed up as &#8220;be kind&#8221;, &#8220;assume good faith&#8221;, &#8220;avoid tangents&#8221; and &#8220;don&#8217;t post shallow dismissals&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with some very useful specifics like &#8220;Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive&#8221; and &#8220;Please don&#8217;t pick the most provocative thing in an article or post to complain about&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The guidelines seem to be enforced, too. An early snarky comment was quickly flagged and disappeared. I don&#8217;t know if this was by the community or mods or what. But I appreciated it and I Was left feeling safe from harm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hacker News algorithm is interesting. When I first started seeng traffic, the post was on page 2. I saw 20 users on the caniphp site, then 30, then 40 and it just kept going up until about 200 were on the site at once. (I know, these are small numbers in the grand scheme of things, but big numbers for anything I&#8217;ve ever made!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure many have written about how the Hacker News algorithm works, but it seems that the rate of upvoting is important and shifts you up the rankings. I maxed out at 6th position on page one. BUT&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My Hacker News traffic was short lived. The algorithm moves you up the ranks quickly, but&#8230; of course&#8230; it moves others up the ranks quickly too. So you can fall fast as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the one-day chart for the Hacker News day. You&#8217;ll see traffic spiked higher (the Hacker News effect is real!) but then tailed off much quicker as the algorithm demoted me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fascinating stuff!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got my 15 minutes of fame (if that!) on the front page of Hacker News. I can tick that off the nerd&#8217;s bucket list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-1024x340.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11018\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-1024x340.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-300x100.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-768x255.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-1536x510.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-2048x681.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The one thing I have totally LOVED about this project is opening it up to contributions on GitHub.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s simple, which makes it an ideal open source project for me. It has a low-burden for me as the maintainer. And the simplicity means contributing is easy too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The PHP feature list is far from complete, and (for reasons I won&#8217;t go into here) is being manually curated. So people coming along and adding features, correcting typos, and even introducing coding standards tools, has been really appreciated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been 10 other contributors so far, and 22 pull requests. I&#8217;m grateful for every one of them. Thank you folks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Looking forward<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">caniphp.com<\/a> is intended to be a resource people bookmark and revisit over time when they need it. So these one-off traffic spikes do not, for me, represent success for this little project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is properly useful then there will be a sustained level of traffic as people come back to it for the information they need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll see if that happens. If not, it&#8217;s a single page of HTML, hosted on CloudFlare pages. It can sit and live there without any input from me (except data updates for new PHP releases).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a really interesting little site launch for me. The data has had me curious. And I&#8217;m grateful to everyone that has tried to make it better.<\/p>\n",

And then, one day, you turn a little note you have lying around into <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">a midly-interactive single web page<\/a> and it takes off like nothing else before!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve not had a new project posted to Reddit or Hacker News before and I found the interactions and analytics data pretty fascinating. I&#8217;m aware that this post could be considered vanity, but I think I learned from it and I&#8217;m posting it because there are interesting lessons and data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s a few notes on and lessons from how the early days of caniphp.com have been.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The making of <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">caniphp.com<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In my 10+ years of WordPress and Laravel work I&#8217;ve worked on projects that use different versions of PHP. From WordPress plugins that cater for stupidly-old versions of PHP, just in case someone hasn&#8217;t updated their hosting, through to Laravel apps that are 100% under my control and can run the latest-and-greatest version of PHP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP has been evolving in amazingly positive ways. And this is awesome. But it does mean that I&#8217;m sometimes confused about what PHP features are available to me on any given project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And sometimes, because I&#8217;m not regularly using a particular piece of PHP syntax or language feature, I forget what it is or does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been particularly true for the <a href=\"https:\/\/stitcher.io\/blog\/why-we-need-multi-line-short-closures-in-php\">various different flavours of closure<\/a> \/ <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/?s=arrow+functions\">arrow functions<\/a> and all of the new coalescing-type <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/?s=operator\">operators<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/?s=spaceship\">spaceship<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/?s=nullsafe+operator\">nullsafe<\/a> operators which all use various combinations of <code>=<\/code> and <code>?<\/code>. I just never quite got them all into my medium-term memory!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I started keeping <a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\">a Bear note<\/a> with a list of the things that I keep forgetting which version they are in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"902\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-1024x902.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11012\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-1024x902.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-300x264.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-768x676.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-1536x1353.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-21.50.26@2x-2048x1803.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It was always my intention to share this at some point. But it was messy and incomplete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then one day I saw <a href=\"https:\/\/www.caniemail.com\/\">caniemail.com<\/a> being shared. I liked the name and realised that a <a href=\"https:\/\/caniuse.com\/\">caniuse.com<\/a>-like site for PHP versions was what I wanted to make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">caniphp.com<\/a> domain was free, so I leapt on it, and spent a few hours (yeah, that&#8217;s all!) putting together an initial version.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1517409134135717888\">tweeted it to the world<\/a> on the morning of April 22nd. I thought a few people might be interested and find it useful, but what happened next was far beyond my expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My privacy-friendly <a href=\"https:\/\/usefathom.com\/ref\/SVE71E\">Fathom Analytics<\/a> has let me see that there have been three big spikes of traffic so far:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>22nd April: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1517409134135717888\">Twitter<\/a><\/li><li>29th April: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PHP\/comments\/uek2id\/can_i_php_caniusecom_but_for_php_features\/\">Reddit&#8217;s \/r\/php<\/a><\/li><li>5th May: <a href=\"https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=31269686\">Hacker News<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see the traffic chart below. And, as this is my first time having something posted to Reddit and Hacker News, I have thoughts about each of these bits of publicity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"580\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-1024x580.png\" alt=\"Analytics chart of two weeks traffic to caniphp.com\" class=\"wp-image-11013\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-1024x580.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-300x170.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-768x435.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-1536x870.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.12.35@2x-2048x1160.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Analytics chart of two weeks traffic to caniphp.com<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Day 1: Twitter<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial Twitter response was pretty amazing. I don&#8217;t know for sure but I think this was probably my best performing Tweet of all time clocking up, to date, over 30,000 impressions and 3,000 engagements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not bad for little old me.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x-958x1024.png\" alt=\"Tweet analytics for the launch tweet\" class=\"wp-image-11014\" width=\"472\" height=\"504\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x-958x1024.png 958w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x-281x300.png 281w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x-768x821.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-06-at-22.23.15@2x.png 1193w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px\" \/><figcaption>Tweet analytics for the launch tweet<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Twitter was overwhelming positive. Sure, lots of people shared and retweeted without comment, and I can&#8217;t read into that. Perhaps people were mocking me? But I don&#8217;t think I see that. And there was not one bit of not-positive feedback.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People say Twitter is a &#8220;hell site&#8221;, but that really wasn&#8217;t the case here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what was Reddit like&#8230;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Day 8: Reddit<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not much of a Reddit user. So this was mostly a new experience for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I first noticed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PHP\/comments\/uek2id\/can_i_php_caniusecom_but_for_php_features\/\">the Reddit post<\/a> when analytics traffic showed a spike and I checked the referrers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PHP\/comments\/uek2id\/can_i_php_caniusecom_but_for_php_features\/\">The post itself<\/a> was totally impartial &#8211; just a link to the site. And I should say that I&#8217;m grateful to the person that shared it! Thank you!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the responses were mixed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually took some constructive stuff away from this. My MVP didn&#8217;t explain itself very well. In describing it as &#8220;caniuse.com for PHP&#8221; people thought it was going to be a much more complete list of PHP functions and features, as caniuse.com is for JavaScript and CSS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I addressed this as quickly as I could, adding explanatory text, and encouraging open source contributions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I did feel some of the comments were overly snarky. And I was somewhat baffled by people saying that it was useless, what was the point?, an IDE can do this, it doesn&#8217;t have any use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s fine if you think that. But it&#8217;s just your opinion. Don&#8217;t write if off as totally useless just because you use a different tool to do the same thing. I made it for me and I think it&#8217;s useful. So there&#8217;s that. No one&#8217;s making you use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Aside: I generally dislike opinions stated as fact. Adding &#8220;I think&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;In my opinion&#8230;&#8221; to a statement of opinion softens it and makes it less aggressive. I OFTEN ask myself if I can add &#8220;in my opinion&#8221; to a Tweet. But I guess some people are looking for a response. <code>\u00af_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af<\/code> )<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I responded with kindness and curiosity, I hope! And over time, the comments on Reddit turned into positivity. But of the three places that caniphp.com was discussed I felt it was the most hostile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Reddit traffic had a fairly sustained spike with most of the nearly 2,000 views happening in around 8 hours after the post. That traffic gradually faded after a couple of days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the one-day chart for the Reddit day:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-1024x340.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11017\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-1024x340.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-300x100.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-768x255.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-1536x510.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.39.51@2x-2048x681.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The post got 136 upvotes and 45 comments. Pretty good. And nice to see that the post itself got WAY more upvotes than any of the comments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Day 14: Hacker News<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all the bad things you sometime hear about it, I have to say, I was pretty impressed with <a href=\"https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=31269686\">Hacker News<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/newsguidelines.html\">Their guidelines<\/a> are good &#8211; summed up as &#8220;be kind&#8221;, &#8220;assume good faith&#8221;, &#8220;avoid tangents&#8221; and &#8220;don&#8217;t post shallow dismissals&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with some very useful specifics like &#8220;Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive&#8221; and &#8220;Please don&#8217;t pick the most provocative thing in an article or post to complain about&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The guidelines seem to be enforced, too. An early snarky comment was quickly flagged and disappeared. I don&#8217;t know if this was by the community or mods or what. But I appreciated it and I Was left feeling safe from harm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hacker News algorithm is interesting. When I first started seeng traffic, the post was on page 2. I saw 20 users on the caniphp site, then 30, then 40 and it just kept going up until about 200 were on the site at once. (I know, these are small numbers in the grand scheme of things, but big numbers for anything I&#8217;ve ever made!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure many have written about how the Hacker News algorithm works, but it seems that the rate of upvoting is important and shifts you up the rankings. I maxed out at 6th position on page one. BUT&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My Hacker News traffic was short lived. The algorithm moves you up the ranks quickly, but&#8230; of course&#8230; it moves others up the ranks quickly too. So you can fall fast as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the one-day chart for the Hacker News day. You&#8217;ll see traffic spiked higher (the Hacker News effect is real!) but then tailed off much quicker as the algorithm demoted me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fascinating stuff!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got my 15 minutes of fame (if that!) on the front page of Hacker News. I can tick that off the nerd&#8217;s bucket list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-1024x340.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11018\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-1024x340.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-300x100.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-768x255.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-1536x510.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/CleanShot-2022-05-07-at-11.41.02@2x-2048x681.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The one thing I have totally LOVED about this project is opening it up to contributions on GitHub.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s simple, which makes it an ideal open source project for me. It has a low-burden for me as the maintainer. And the simplicity means contributing is easy too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The PHP feature list is far from complete, and (for reasons I won&#8217;t go into here) is being manually curated. So people coming along and adding features, correcting typos, and even introducing coding standards tools, has been really appreciated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been 10 other contributors so far, and 22 pull requests. I&#8217;m grateful for every one of them. Thank you folks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Looking forward<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, <a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">caniphp.com<\/a> is intended to be a resource people bookmark and revisit over time when they need it. So these one-off traffic spikes do not, for me, represent success for this little project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is properly useful then there will be a sustained level of traffic as people come back to it for the information they need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll see if that happens. If not, it&#8217;s a single page of HTML, hosted on CloudFlare pages. It can sit and live there without any input from me (except data updates for new PHP releases).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a really interesting little site launch for me. The data has had me curious. And I&#8217;m grateful to everyone that has tried to make it better.<\/p>\n",

Plus <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\/components\/application-ui\/navigation\/command-palettes\">TailwindUI<\/a> added some command palette designs so that other people can add them to their web apps, and <a href=\"https:\/\/kbar.vercel.app\/\">kbar<\/a> is a JS library to help you add them too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This trend is one that I claim I was ahead of the curve on as I made my own <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">command palette tool for WordPress<\/a>, and then played with making that same tool work on other web applications, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1401983433296039943\">Laravel Forge<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1419748068564639749\">Github<\/a> months before they added their own command palettes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"550\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-1024x550.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10982\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-1024x550.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-300x161.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-768x412.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-1536x825.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-2048x1099.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a> is my attempt to bring a command palette to the WordPress Dashboard.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s a problem &#8211; especially with web applications such as Forge, GitHub and Netlify: Each command palette is different! The keyboard shortcut to trigger the palette may be different. The presentation of the commands may be different. The way that search and sub-menus work may be different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There must be a better way! And I think that there could be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Config-driven Turbo Admin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s go back a bit to the inception of my &#8220;Turbo Admin&#8221; command palette for WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had seen &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/philo.dev\/getting-started-with-laravel-spotlight\/\">Laravel Spotlight<\/a>&#8220;, and the moment I saw it my first thought was &#8220;That&#8217;s genius &#8211; why don&#8217;t all web apps have command palettes?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My second thought was &#8220;WordPress should have a command palette!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I set to it, and the easiest way I could come up with to gather up the menu items and commands was, surprisingly, not to hook into the back-end somehow, but to use JavaScript to scrape the menu items and their URLs from the WordPress dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This worked fine as a basic first implementation. But it quickly hit limitations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially I just wanted to add some of my own hard-coded extra commands for things like &#8220;Logout&#8221;, but then I realised that the Logout link was in the admin bar at the top of the WordPress dashboard. So I added the ability to grab that too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I wanted to grab more and more links from throughout the Dashboard I realised I needed some kind of array of things to grab. And this idea eventually evolved into a configuration-based system for injecting items into the Turbo Admin palette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This configuration lets you specify:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The &#8220;type&#8221; of link to discover &#8211; it can be a hard-coded title and URL, or dynamically discovered links using a DOM\/CSS selector<\/li><li>The selector to use (for selector-based links)<\/li><li>Either the title to use, or a function for generating a title from a discovered element<\/li><li>Either the URL to use, or a function for generating a URL from a discovered element<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This probably makes sense with a simple example. This config entry discovers all of the &#8220;New &lt;post type&gt;&#8221; links in the WordPress admin bar, such as &#8220;New Post&#8221;, &#8220;New Page&#8221; and so on:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n{\n  'detectType': 'dom',\n  'detectSelector': '#wp-admin-bar-new-content .ab-submenu a',\n  'itemTitleFunction': (item) =&gt; 'New ' + item.textContent,\n  'itemUrlFunction': (item) =&gt; item.href\n},\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>With this config-driven approach I can specify DOM selectors for non-WordPress applications too &#8211; and this is exactly how my simple palettes for GitHub and Forge came about. (I note that these were just demos, and never made it into public in any way other than teaser videos).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An API for command palettes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With this config driven approach in place, I can seemingly inject a command palette into any* web-based application!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>* &#8211; Not quite any, some use dynamically generated items or randomly generated IDs. What can you do?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I&#8217;ve made here is an API or protocol for defining command palette items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next obvious step is something like: &#8220;What if an application can provide these configurations itself?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if not &#8220;What if standard-format configurations could be user\/community-generated, like <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Userscript\">user scripts<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stylus_(browser_extension)\">user styles<\/a>?&#8221; (Note: use these at your own risk!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there could be any number of command palette browser extensions that sucked in these configs and made the menus for you. Or maybe the browsers could have them built in themselves?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;d have the same interface and the same keyboard shortcut for all your web applications. It would be amazing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An API for menu items in general?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A note to designers and people who love fancy websites with intricate designs: you&#8217;re gonna hate me! I make no apology for that. UI conventions are a thing that can be useful, and I&#8217;m just exploring ideas. Bear with me.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if we have a system for a website or web application to specify command palette items&#8230; well&#8230; aren&#8217;t these just the menu items? So&#8230; umm&#8230; can&#8217;t we also use this API\/protocol for defining the menu items for a website rather than scraping them from the DOM. Use the configuration to ADD them to the DOM? Or just let the browser handle all this for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Items wouldn&#8217;t have to be links. They could be callbacks\/functions that &#8220;do stuff&#8221;. This doesn&#8217;t have to be a restriction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I know it would be really boring if every website had the same menus. We&#8217;d have to figure that out. Perhaps there is some compromise with design?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But look at how applications on your desktop\/laptop work&#8230; the menus are in the same place for most apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-1024x640.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10985\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-768x480.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-1536x961.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-2048x1281.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And those that do things their own way are SUPER annoying (I&#8217;m looking at YOU Warp terminal&#8230;)<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-1024x696.png\" alt=\"Screengrab of Warp terminal app showing their menu on the top-right-hand corner.\" class=\"wp-image-10979\" width=\"604\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-1024x696.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-300x204.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-768x522.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-1536x1045.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-2048x1393.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px\" \/><figcaption>Warp terminal is cool and fast and smart, but I can NEVER find the settings!<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And look at how the MS Office suite and Apple&#8217;s work applications have consistently placed user interface components. Once you have learned one tool, you can easily learn others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>User interface conventions can be helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AND&#8230; as the developer&#8230; building nav menus is flippin hard, and we so often don&#8217;t get interactions and accessibility right. What if this was all handled for us? We just provide the data, and the browser takes care of it, and we get the possibility of command palettes &#8211; and maybe other kinds of interface &#8211; for free?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And why stop at menus? You could define keyboard shortcuts too, thus removing a zillion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How would this work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If this was a thing then we would need a way to get the configuration to the browser or browser extension. It would probably be JSON. I guess. But how would it be delivered\/discovered?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve not thought about this a lot, but there seem to be a few obvious ways to me:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>A file in the root of a site, like robots.txt, or the old standardised favicon location, with a standard name. Maybe &#8220;commands.json&#8221; or something.<\/li><li>Like the above, but with a meta tag in the HTML to specify the file&#8217;s location.<\/li><li>A standardised &#8211; or meta-tag specified &#8211; API route. This would work like the above but could allow options to be passed and deliver dynamic configurations.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So, Ross, this sounds great. Why do you say you &#8220;know nothing&#8221;?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>(<em>This probably is not the question you were asking, but if you were<\/em>&#8230;)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply because it seems so obvious that many people MUST have thought of it before and dismissed it for a hundred and one good reasons that I&#8217;m too stupid to have thought of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they just want to maintain the ability to design menus. In which case, let&#8217;s find that compromise because a standardised, easy-to-develop, accessible-by-default, machine-readable website navigation seems to have a lot of benefits!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve really tried to think of some downsides. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s insecure or open to abuse (though I&#8217;m sure people will tell me I&#8217;m wrong). I&#8217;m sure it can handle translations, sub-menus, mega-menus and some elements of design. You wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about responsive design or RTL languages &#8211; it would all be taken care of for you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could even help Google discover <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/advanced\/appearance\/sitelinks\">site links<\/a> and improve search results!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve had the thought that &#8220;We don&#8217;t have other APIs like this that send config to the browser?&#8221;, but we clearly do! Especially in modern browsers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have all manner of meta headers we can add to control languages and browser features and icons that get displayed and color schemes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/Manifest\">web app manifests<\/a> that specify all sorts of options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have all sorts of APIs for interacting with things like the clipboard, bluetooth devices, browser history, scroll behaviour and standard sharing options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The browser is doing so much for us these days&#8230; why do we continue to handle navigation manually?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why would we not do this? Am I really the first to have thought of it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a browser engineer, or involved in any way at all with the committees that define browser APIs. This just seems like a good idea to me. Perhaps there&#8217;s already an RFC? I really don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said&#8230; I know nothing. So tell me what you know. Why shouldn&#8217;t this happen?<\/p>\n",

Let&#8217;s start somewhere else&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do Github, Laravel Forge, MacOS, VS Code, Sublime Text, JetBrains IDEs like PHPStorm, Google Chrome&#8217;s dev tools, Windows Terminal, the Warp terminal application, and Netlify all have in common?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They all have &#8220;command palettes&#8221; &#8211; as do an increasing number of both native and web-based applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those not familiar, command palettes are pop-up user interfaces that provide keyboard-driven, searchable menus of actions for your application. They take all the things you can do in the application and make them available with a few keystrokes. And some include more advanced features like searching content or files too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"613\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.52.38@2x-1024x613.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10981\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.52.38@2x-1024x613.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.52.38@2x-300x180.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.52.38@2x-768x460.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.52.38@2x-1536x920.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.52.38@2x-2048x1226.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>GitHub&#8217;s command palette &#8211; press Ctrl\/Cmd-K to access!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who love to use their keyboard to navigate their computer, they are valuable tools, allowing keyboard access to application features that goes way beyond keyboard shortcuts, and removing the need to memorise a large number of keyboard shortcuts to be efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And command palettes seem to be a growing trend. All the applications I mentioned above have command palettes, but there&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alfredapp.com\/\">Alfred App<\/a> for MacOS, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.raycast.com\/\">Raycast<\/a>, MacOS&#8217;s own Spotlight. Plus <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\/components\/application-ui\/navigation\/command-palettes\">TailwindUI<\/a> added some command palette designs so that other people can add them to their web apps, and <a href=\"https:\/\/kbar.vercel.app\/\">kbar<\/a> is a JS library to help you add them too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This trend is one that I claim I was ahead of the curve on as I made my own <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">command palette tool for WordPress<\/a>, and then played with making that same tool work on other web applications, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1401983433296039943\">Laravel Forge<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1419748068564639749\">Github<\/a> months before they added their own command palettes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"550\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-1024x550.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10982\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-1024x550.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-300x161.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-768x412.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-1536x825.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Turbo-Admin-Screengrab-2048x1099.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a> is my attempt to bring a command palette to the WordPress Dashboard.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s a problem &#8211; especially with web applications such as Forge, GitHub and Netlify: Each command palette is different! The keyboard shortcut to trigger the palette may be different. The presentation of the commands may be different. The way that search and sub-menus work may be different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There must be a better way! And I think that there could be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Config-driven Turbo Admin<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s go back a bit to the inception of my &#8220;Turbo Admin&#8221; command palette for WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had seen &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/philo.dev\/getting-started-with-laravel-spotlight\/\">Laravel Spotlight<\/a>&#8220;, and the moment I saw it my first thought was &#8220;That&#8217;s genius &#8211; why don&#8217;t all web apps have command palettes?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My second thought was &#8220;WordPress should have a command palette!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I set to it, and the easiest way I could come up with to gather up the menu items and commands was, surprisingly, not to hook into the back-end somehow, but to use JavaScript to scrape the menu items and their URLs from the WordPress dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This worked fine as a basic first implementation. But it quickly hit limitations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially I just wanted to add some of my own hard-coded extra commands for things like &#8220;Logout&#8221;, but then I realised that the Logout link was in the admin bar at the top of the WordPress dashboard. So I added the ability to grab that too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I wanted to grab more and more links from throughout the Dashboard I realised I needed some kind of array of things to grab. And this idea eventually evolved into a configuration-based system for injecting items into the Turbo Admin palette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This configuration lets you specify:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The &#8220;type&#8221; of link to discover &#8211; it can be a hard-coded title and URL, or dynamically discovered links using a DOM\/CSS selector<\/li><li>The selector to use (for selector-based links)<\/li><li>Either the title to use, or a function for generating a title from a discovered element<\/li><li>Either the URL to use, or a function for generating a URL from a discovered element<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This probably makes sense with a simple example. This config entry discovers all of the &#8220;New &lt;post type&gt;&#8221; links in the WordPress admin bar, such as &#8220;New Post&#8221;, &#8220;New Page&#8221; and so on:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n{\n  'detectType': 'dom',\n  'detectSelector': '#wp-admin-bar-new-content .ab-submenu a',\n  'itemTitleFunction': (item) =&gt; 'New ' + item.textContent,\n  'itemUrlFunction': (item) =&gt; item.href\n},\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>With this config-driven approach I can specify DOM selectors for non-WordPress applications too &#8211; and this is exactly how my simple palettes for GitHub and Forge came about. (I note that these were just demos, and never made it into public in any way other than teaser videos).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An API for command palettes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With this config driven approach in place, I can seemingly inject a command palette into any* web-based application!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>* &#8211; Not quite any, some use dynamically generated items or randomly generated IDs. What can you do?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I&#8217;ve made here is an API or protocol for defining command palette items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next obvious step is something like: &#8220;What if an application can provide these configurations itself?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if not &#8220;What if standard-format configurations could be user\/community-generated, like <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Userscript\">user scripts<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stylus_(browser_extension)\">user styles<\/a>?&#8221; (Note: use these at your own risk!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there could be any number of command palette browser extensions that sucked in these configs and made the menus for you. Or maybe the browsers could have them built in themselves?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;d have the same interface and the same keyboard shortcut for all your web applications. It would be amazing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An API for menu items in general?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A note to designers and people who love fancy websites with intricate designs: you&#8217;re gonna hate me! I make no apology for that. UI conventions are a thing that can be useful, and I&#8217;m just exploring ideas. Bear with me.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if we have a system for a website or web application to specify command palette items&#8230; well&#8230; aren&#8217;t these just the menu items? So&#8230; umm&#8230; can&#8217;t we also use this API\/protocol for defining the menu items for a website rather than scraping them from the DOM. Use the configuration to ADD them to the DOM? Or just let the browser handle all this for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Items wouldn&#8217;t have to be links. They could be callbacks\/functions that &#8220;do stuff&#8221;. This doesn&#8217;t have to be a restriction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I know it would be really boring if every website had the same menus. We&#8217;d have to figure that out. Perhaps there is some compromise with design?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But look at how applications on your desktop\/laptop work&#8230; the menus are in the same place for most apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-1024x640.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10985\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-768x480.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-1536x961.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/standard-macos-menus-2048x1281.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And those that do things their own way are SUPER annoying (I&#8217;m looking at YOU Warp terminal&#8230;)<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-1024x696.png\" alt=\"Screengrab of Warp terminal app showing their menu on the top-right-hand corner.\" class=\"wp-image-10979\" width=\"604\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-1024x696.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-300x204.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-768x522.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-1536x1045.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/CleanShot-2022-04-26-at-22.06.54@2x-2048x1393.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px\" \/><figcaption>Warp terminal is cool and fast and smart, but I can NEVER find the settings!<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And look at how the MS Office suite and Apple&#8217;s work applications have consistently placed user interface components. Once you have learned one tool, you can easily learn others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>User interface conventions can be helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AND&#8230; as the developer&#8230; building nav menus is flippin hard, and we so often don&#8217;t get interactions and accessibility right. What if this was all handled for us? We just provide the data, and the browser takes care of it, and we get the possibility of command palettes &#8211; and maybe other kinds of interface &#8211; for free?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And why stop at menus? You could define keyboard shortcuts too, thus removing a zillion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How would this work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If this was a thing then we would need a way to get the configuration to the browser or browser extension. It would probably be JSON. I guess. But how would it be delivered\/discovered?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve not thought about this a lot, but there seem to be a few obvious ways to me:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>A file in the root of a site, like robots.txt, or the old standardised favicon location, with a standard name. Maybe &#8220;commands.json&#8221; or something.<\/li><li>Like the above, but with a meta tag in the HTML to specify the file&#8217;s location.<\/li><li>A standardised &#8211; or meta-tag specified &#8211; API route. This would work like the above but could allow options to be passed and deliver dynamic configurations.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So, Ross, this sounds great. Why do you say you &#8220;know nothing&#8221;?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>(<em>This probably is not the question you were asking, but if you were<\/em>&#8230;)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply because it seems so obvious that many people MUST have thought of it before and dismissed it for a hundred and one good reasons that I&#8217;m too stupid to have thought of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they just want to maintain the ability to design menus. In which case, let&#8217;s find that compromise because a standardised, easy-to-develop, accessible-by-default, machine-readable website navigation seems to have a lot of benefits!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve really tried to think of some downsides. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s insecure or open to abuse (though I&#8217;m sure people will tell me I&#8217;m wrong). I&#8217;m sure it can handle translations, sub-menus, mega-menus and some elements of design. You wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about responsive design or RTL languages &#8211; it would all be taken care of for you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could even help Google discover <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/advanced\/appearance\/sitelinks\">site links<\/a> and improve search results!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve had the thought that &#8220;We don&#8217;t have other APIs like this that send config to the browser?&#8221;, but we clearly do! Especially in modern browsers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have all manner of meta headers we can add to control languages and browser features and icons that get displayed and color schemes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/Manifest\">web app manifests<\/a> that specify all sorts of options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have all sorts of APIs for interacting with things like the clipboard, bluetooth devices, browser history, scroll behaviour and standard sharing options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The browser is doing so much for us these days&#8230; why do we continue to handle navigation manually?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why would we not do this? Am I really the first to have thought of it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a browser engineer, or involved in any way at all with the committees that define browser APIs. This just seems like a good idea to me. Perhaps there&#8217;s already an RFC? I really don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said&#8230; I know nothing. So tell me what you know. Why shouldn&#8217;t this happen?<\/p>\n",

And it&#8217;s fine as a game in principle. But it&#8217;s REALLY hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can play at <a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/\">https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/<\/a> &#8211; I but I warn you, you need to be a proper back-end WordPress geek to be anything like any good!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Behind the scenes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to write some notes about the behind the scenes, how I made this work stuff. And, because I&#8217;m a geek, I got all curious about WordPress function names: how long they are; how common the different name parts are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s dig in!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding all the function names<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The game is based on 4-part function names. &#8220;Parts&#8221; are separated by underscores. So <code>get_attachment_image_url<\/code> is a good example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I needed to find all the global function names, count their &#8220;parts&#8221;, and filter them. So I needed to do some pre-processing of the WordPress code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got all the function names from the <code><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/php-stubs\/wordpress-stubs\">wordpress-stubs<\/a><\/code> package. This is a package used for static analysis that contains all the class, and function signatures throughout WordPress core, but without the actual function\/class code. All the function\/method bodies are empty. And they are all concatenated into <a href=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/php-stubs\/wordpress-stubs\/master\/wordpress-stubs.php\">one file<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used a combination of <code>grep<\/code> and <code>cut<\/code> commands to get all the function names from this file. Because the regex filtered out any functions with <code>public<\/code>\/<code>protected<\/code>\/<code>private<\/code> visibility specified, this should have ignored most class methods, and only given my globally available functions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the command I used:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\negrep '^\\s+function\\s+(&#x5B;^ \\(]+)' wordpress-stubs.php | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f6 | cut -d &quot;(&quot; -f 1 &gt; wpfuncs.txt\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I then opened <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2020\/01\/tinkerwell-for-wordpress-developers\/\">Tinkerwell<\/a> to mess about with the data I had using my PHP skills. This just seemed like the quickest way to get to some interesting answers about the function names.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing I really wanted to know was how many function names had 3, 4 or 5 parts, as this would influence the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t clean, well-engineered code, but it does the job. I&#8217;m gonna use it once and throw it away so I&#8217;m not thinking too hard.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n\/\/ Read in all the function names.\n$funcs = file_get_contents('wpfuncs.txt');\n\n\/\/ Keep counts of number of function name parts\n$lengths = &#x5B;];\n\nforeach (explode(&quot;\\n&quot;, $funcs) as $func) {\n  if (! empty(trim($func))) {\n    \/\/ Split the function name at _'s\n    $parts = explode ('_', $func);\n    \/\/ Discard empty parts\n    $parts = array_filter( $parts, function ($a) { return ! empty($a); } );\n    $parts = count($parts);\n\n    \/\/ Update the count in the array\n    if (isset($lengths&#x5B;$parts])) {\n      $lengths&#x5B;$parts]++;\n    } else {\n      $lengths&#x5B;$parts] = 1;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\/\/ Sort the array by number of function parts\nksort($lengths);\n\nvar_dump($lengths);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>At the time of writing, this gives us:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&#x5B;\n     0 =&gt; 1, \n     1 =&gt; 42,\n     2 =&gt; 576,\n     3 =&gt; 1196,\n     4 =&gt; 1004,\n     5 =&gt; 420,\n     6 =&gt; 182,\n     7 =&gt; 62,\n     8 =&gt; 18,\n     9 =&gt; 4,\n     10 =&gt; 2,\n     11 =&gt; 1,\n   ]\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>From the point of view of making the game, we see that 3-part functions give us the greatest number of functions with 1196 function names. This isn&#8217;t necessarily good though as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Guessing more parts means we more quickly rule words in or out of the function name<\/li><li>So guessing fewer parts each time AND having more functions to guess makes the game harder.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The 420 5-part functions seemed too small though. So I decided to go with the 1004 4-part functions for the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out this is STILL a very hard game!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stats, functions and &#8220;fun&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This section has no real value at all.

Here we go:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$funcs = file_get_contents('wpfuncs.txt');\n\n$wordUses = &#x5B;];\n\nforeach (explode(&quot;\\n&quot;, $funcs) as $func) {\n  if (! empty(trim($func))) {\n    $parts = explode('_', $func);\n    $parts = array_filter( $parts, function ($a) { return ! empty($a); } );\n  \tforeach($parts as $part) {\n      $wordUses&#x5B;$part] = isset($wordUses&#x5B;$part]) ? $wordUses&#x5B;$part] + 1 : 1;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nasort($wordUses);\nvar_dump($wordUses);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Sorting this way around (ascending order of use) isn&#8217;t particularly revealing. We just get all the words\/parts that are only used in one function. Of which there are a LOT!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, there are 1434 distinct words used in WordPress core global functions. And 563 (nearly 40%) of those words are only used in one function name! No wonder WordlePress is so hard! Perhaps we can analyse just the 4-part functions in a moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick <code>array_reverse()<\/code> gives us the most-used words\/parts. And it&#8217;s no surprise that <code>wp<\/code> leads the way, appearing in 1245 functions. More than a third of all functions have <code>wp<\/code> in!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re playing WordlePress you&#8217;ll want the top-ten for starter words. So these are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>wp<\/code> (1245 instances)<\/li><li><code>get<\/code> (firmly second with a massive 762 instances!)<\/li><li><code>post<\/code> (third with 308 instances)<\/li><li><code>block<\/code> (fast upcoming in 4th place with 217 instances)<\/li><li><code>link<\/code> (166 instances)<\/li><li><code>is<\/code> (156 instances)<\/li><li><code>core<\/code> (144 instances)<\/li><li><code>update<\/code> (138 instances)<\/li><li><code>the<\/code> (133 instances)<\/li><li><code>add<\/code> (124 instances)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordlePress words\/parts<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So is <code>wp_get_post_block<\/code> the best opener for WordlePress?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember we&#8217;re only using 4-part functions. Is the analysis any different?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s a little different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best WordlePress opening guess is <code>wp_get_post_link<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>wp<\/code> remains strongest by far. It&#8217;s in 482 of the 1004 4-part function names. Close to 50%!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>core<\/code> and <code>block<\/code> get demoted a bit. <code>update<\/code> drops down the rankings. And <code>ajax<\/code>, <code>image<\/code> and <code>register<\/code> climb into the top ten:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>wp<\/code> (482 instances)<\/li><li><code>get<\/code> (300 instances)<\/li><li><code>post<\/code> (115 instances)<\/li><li><code>link<\/code> (62 instances)<\/li><li><code>ajax<\/code> (54 instances)<\/li><li><code>block<\/code> (52 instances)<\/li><li><code>is<\/code> (45 instances)<\/li><li><code>the<\/code> (43 instances)<\/li><li><code>image<\/code> (41 instances)<\/li><li><code>register<\/code> (36 instances)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s still 763 words to choose from! Which is one of the reasons WordlePress is so hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully this new knowledge will help you play. Or maybe I&#8217;ll use it to refine the game to make it easier in future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, this was kinda fun weekend tinkering. I hope you learned something!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Given all the &#8220;Wordle&#8221; hype these days, I think I was one of the first (of many) people to wonder about what &#8220;WordlePress&#8221; might look like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here\u2019s an idea for someone: An open source system for self publishing your word puzzle results\u2026 ? <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/ygijlbHnE0\">pic.twitter.com\/ygijlbHnE0<\/a><\/p>&mdash; Ross Wintle (@magicroundabout) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1478999708228108293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 6, 2022<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Not long after, Taco Verdo did buy the domain, with the aim of preserving it for the good of the WordPress community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I have <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/oNmgelSNll\">https:\/\/t.co\/oNmgelSNll<\/a>, but no time to turn it into a game.<\/p>&mdash; Taco Verdo (@TacoVerdo) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TacoVerdo\/status\/1490612545484378112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 7, 2022<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, one bored weekend, I came up with the idea of making <a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/\">a Wordle-style game<\/a> where you had to guess a WordPress core function name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prototype took a couple of hours to make. And it&#8217;s fine as a game in principle. But it&#8217;s REALLY hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can play at <a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/\">https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/<\/a> &#8211; I but I warn you, you need to be a proper back-end WordPress geek to be anything like any good!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Behind the scenes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to write some notes about the behind the scenes, how I made this work stuff. And, because I&#8217;m a geek, I got all curious about WordPress function names: how long they are; how common the different name parts are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s dig in!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding all the function names<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The game is based on 4-part function names. &#8220;Parts&#8221; are separated by underscores. So <code>get_attachment_image_url<\/code> is a good example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I needed to find all the global function names, count their &#8220;parts&#8221;, and filter them. So I needed to do some pre-processing of the WordPress code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got all the function names from the <code><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/php-stubs\/wordpress-stubs\">wordpress-stubs<\/a><\/code> package. This is a package used for static analysis that contains all the class, and function signatures throughout WordPress core, but without the actual function\/class code. All the function\/method bodies are empty. And they are all concatenated into <a href=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/php-stubs\/wordpress-stubs\/master\/wordpress-stubs.php\">one file<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used a combination of <code>grep<\/code> and <code>cut<\/code> commands to get all the function names from this file. Because the regex filtered out any functions with <code>public<\/code>\/<code>protected<\/code>\/<code>private<\/code> visibility specified, this should have ignored most class methods, and only given my globally available functions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the command I used:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\negrep '^\\s+function\\s+(&#x5B;^ \\(]+)' wordpress-stubs.php | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f6 | cut -d &quot;(&quot; -f 1 &gt; wpfuncs.txt\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I then opened <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2020\/01\/tinkerwell-for-wordpress-developers\/\">Tinkerwell<\/a> to mess about with the data I had using my PHP skills. This just seemed like the quickest way to get to some interesting answers about the function names.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing I really wanted to know was how many function names had 3, 4 or 5 parts, as this would influence the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t clean, well-engineered code, but it does the job. I&#8217;m gonna use it once and throw it away so I&#8217;m not thinking too hard.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n\/\/ Read in all the function names.\n$funcs = file_get_contents('wpfuncs.txt');\n\n\/\/ Keep counts of number of function name parts\n$lengths = &#x5B;];\n\nforeach (explode(&quot;\\n&quot;, $funcs) as $func) {\n  if (! empty(trim($func))) {\n    \/\/ Split the function name at _'s\n    $parts = explode ('_', $func);\n    \/\/ Discard empty parts\n    $parts = array_filter( $parts, function ($a) { return ! empty($a); } );\n    $parts = count($parts);\n\n    \/\/ Update the count in the array\n    if (isset($lengths&#x5B;$parts])) {\n      $lengths&#x5B;$parts]++;\n    } else {\n      $lengths&#x5B;$parts] = 1;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\/\/ Sort the array by number of function parts\nksort($lengths);\n\nvar_dump($lengths);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>At the time of writing, this gives us:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&#x5B;\n     0 =&gt; 1, \n     1 =&gt; 42,\n     2 =&gt; 576,\n     3 =&gt; 1196,\n     4 =&gt; 1004,\n     5 =&gt; 420,\n     6 =&gt; 182,\n     7 =&gt; 62,\n     8 =&gt; 18,\n     9 =&gt; 4,\n     10 =&gt; 2,\n     11 =&gt; 1,\n   ]\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>From the point of view of making the game, we see that 3-part functions give us the greatest number of functions with 1196 function names. This isn&#8217;t necessarily good though as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Guessing more parts means we more quickly rule words in or out of the function name<\/li><li>So guessing fewer parts each time AND having more functions to guess makes the game harder.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The 420 5-part functions seemed too small though. So I decided to go with the 1004 4-part functions for the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out this is STILL a very hard game!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stats, functions and &#8220;fun&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This section has no real value at all. But I was curious about some of the numbers and functions here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How many global functions are there?<\/li><li>What are the shortest and longest function names?<\/li><li>What are the most common &#8220;parts&#8221;\/&#8221;words&#8221; in function names (apart from <code>wp_<\/code>)?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s dig in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Total global functions<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to this analysis there are 3508 global functions in WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s quite a lot!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Longest and shortest function names<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of function name parts\/words, we can easily see:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>There&#8217;s a function with ZERO WORDS? Bear in mind that underscores themselves don&#8217;t count. Maybe you can guess it? If not, head to <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/__\/\">the docs<\/a>.<\/li><li>There are thirty-four 1-word functions. Perhaps you&#8217;ve used <code>dbdelta<\/code>, <code>trailingslashit<\/code>, <code>mysql2date<\/code>, <code>absint<\/code>, <code>bloginfo<\/code>, <code>selected<\/code> or <code>checked<\/code>? But what about <code><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/saveDomDocument\/\">saveDomDocument<\/a><\/code>, <code><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/zeroise\/\">zeroise<\/a><\/code> (curious in its non-US English spelling), or <code><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/antispambot\/\">antispambot<\/a><\/code>?<\/li><li>There are 2 10-part function. Hands up if you&#8217;ve used <code><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/reference\/functions\/wp_add_trashed_suffix_to_post_name_for_trashed_posts\/\">wp_add_trashed_suffix_to_post_name_for_trashed_posts<\/a><\/code> or the undocumented <code>_delete_site_logo_on_remove_custom_logo_on_setup_theme<\/code>?<\/li><li>And there is just one 11-part function. Bonus points if you&#8217;ve ever called <code>block_core_calendar_update_has_published_post_on_transition_post_status<\/code> for some reason (it&#8217;s also undocumented).<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Most common words\/parts<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll need to add some new code to analyse this. Here we go:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$funcs = file_get_contents('wpfuncs.txt');\n\n$wordUses = &#x5B;];\n\nforeach (explode(&quot;\\n&quot;, $funcs) as $func) {\n  if (! empty(trim($func))) {\n    $parts = explode('_', $func);\n    $parts = array_filter( $parts, function ($a) { return ! empty($a); } );\n  \tforeach($parts as $part) {\n      $wordUses&#x5B;$part] = isset($wordUses&#x5B;$part]) ? $wordUses&#x5B;$part] + 1 : 1;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nasort($wordUses);\nvar_dump($wordUses);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Sorting this way around (ascending order of use) isn&#8217;t particularly revealing. We just get all the words\/parts that are only used in one function. Of which there are a LOT!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, there are 1434 distinct words used in WordPress core global functions. And 563 (nearly 40%) of those words are only used in one function name! No wonder WordlePress is so hard! Perhaps we can analyse just the 4-part functions in a moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick <code>array_reverse()<\/code> gives us the most-used words\/parts. And it&#8217;s no surprise that <code>wp<\/code> leads the way, appearing in 1245 functions. More than a third of all functions have <code>wp<\/code> in!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re playing WordlePress you&#8217;ll want the top-ten for starter words. So these are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>wp<\/code> (1245 instances)<\/li><li><code>get<\/code> (firmly second with a massive 762 instances!)<\/li><li><code>post<\/code> (third with 308 instances)<\/li><li><code>block<\/code> (fast upcoming in 4th place with 217 instances)<\/li><li><code>link<\/code> (166 instances)<\/li><li><code>is<\/code> (156 instances)<\/li><li><code>core<\/code> (144 instances)<\/li><li><code>update<\/code> (138 instances)<\/li><li><code>the<\/code> (133 instances)<\/li><li><code>add<\/code> (124 instances)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordlePress words\/parts<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So is <code>wp_get_post_block<\/code> the best opener for WordlePress?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember we&#8217;re only using 4-part functions. Is the analysis any different?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s a little different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best WordlePress opening guess is <code>wp_get_post_link<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>wp<\/code> remains strongest by far. It&#8217;s in 482 of the 1004 4-part function names. Close to 50%!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>core<\/code> and <code>block<\/code> get demoted a bit. <code>update<\/code> drops down the rankings. And <code>ajax<\/code>, <code>image<\/code> and <code>register<\/code> climb into the top ten:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>wp<\/code> (482 instances)<\/li><li><code>get<\/code> (300 instances)<\/li><li><code>post<\/code> (115 instances)<\/li><li><code>link<\/code> (62 instances)<\/li><li><code>ajax<\/code> (54 instances)<\/li><li><code>block<\/code> (52 instances)<\/li><li><code>is<\/code> (45 instances)<\/li><li><code>the<\/code> (43 instances)<\/li><li><code>image<\/code> (41 instances)<\/li><li><code>register<\/code> (36 instances)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s still 763 words to choose from! Which is one of the reasons WordlePress is so hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully this new knowledge will help you play. Or maybe I&#8217;ll use it to refine the game to make it easier in future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, this was kinda fun weekend tinkering. I hope you learned something!<\/p>\n",

I hate marketing. I&#8217;m a total newbie. And <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a> &#8211; a browser extension that improves your WordPress Dashboard experience on ALL your sites&#8230; WHAT? &#8211; is a pretty unconventional product too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have no &#8220;tips&#8221; or &#8220;advice&#8221;.

So sharing a bit about what I&#8217;m doing and why and how seems like a good thing to do. If nothing else, to set the expectations of other people who may be in a similar position to myself.

So off I went!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u201cEasily\u201d was a bad assumption<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the difficulty was related specifically to the process of selling browser extensions. But there\u2019s also just the huge hassle of bundling releases, shipping stuff, marketing it, maintaining docs, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Documentation and automation are key here. I have a documented release process and some shell scripts that do some of the work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pricing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t want to be bothered with subscriptions. I didn\u2019t think there was THAT much value in it anyway. So I put a reasonable (in my opinion) price tag on it, and was sure to offer no guaranteed support (after all, it should \u201cjust work\u201d) and updates for the life of v1. But all without <em>promising<\/em> anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives me the option of making a v2 with a different pricing model if I want to. But doesn\u2019t commit me to doing ANYTHING. Though, in reality, v1 has grown a LOT and I&#8217;ve been supporting people when needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Marketing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve mostly marketed by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TurboAdmn\/status\/1501598332002738182\">\u201cteasing\u201d features on Twitter<\/a>. I have a reasonable following with a good number of WordPress developer \u201cinfluencers\u201d on the list. And announcing releases too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve taken the approach that every new feature or release is an excuse to talk about it, to the extent that I\u2019m quite worried my followers are getting bored\/annoyed (sorry!). I\u2019ve also used self-promotion channels in places like Slack groups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>More marketing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My product is HARD to market, because people aren\u2019t necessarily searching for it. But people that do find it love it (see <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/03\/turbo-admin-wordpress-command-palette-free-trial\/\">the testimonials on this post!<\/a>). So I\u2019ve relied a lot on word of mouth, recommendations, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is HARD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve done a bit of SEO work, and have been featured by Chris Coyier (on Twitter), on the WP Builds podcast\/stream (Nathan Wrigley) and a few other places.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s helped. But I need more of it and don&#8217;t know how to get it. I&#8217;ve done NO paid ads or anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Free trial\/more pricing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I only recently <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/03\/turbo-admin-wordpress-command-palette-free-trial\/\">implemented a free trial<\/a>. Initially I didn\u2019t want the support burden of a heap of free users. And I used <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/turbo-admin\/\">the plugin version<\/a> as the gateway\/trial of the main features. But arguably you don\u2019t see the full benefit of my product from that. So the price tag was a kinda deliberate barrier to entry. You had to want it!<br><br>Plus, at first, I only thought about time-limited trials. But I didn\u2019t want to do that for various reasons. But then I realised I could do a site-limited trial and that would work better. So I implemented that. (And have had ZERO sales since doing so! ( ? \/ ? ) )<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Riding media waves<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my features is notice hiding, so I tried to take advantage of the <a href=\"https:\/\/wptavern.com\/clarity-ad-blocker-for-wordpress-announced-receives-mixed-reactions\">recent debate around notice hiding\/ad blocking<\/a> and plug that feature a lot. There was a small bump in sales from this, but the impact wasn&#8217;t huge (other than this is how Nathan Wrigley picked it up).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sales and Software Licensing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, doing software licensing is HARD. I evaluated <a href=\"https:\/\/paddle.com\/\">Paddle<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/freemius.com\/\">Freemius<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/gumroad.com\/\">Gumroad<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/payhip.com\/\">PayHip<\/a>, and even started building my own solution, before settling on the very new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lemonsqueezy.com\/\">Lemon Squeezy<\/a> platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been great, but if I was new to it their pricing model wouldn\u2019t work for my kind of sales volumes (I\u2019m locked into a good deal as I was a beta tester).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DO use a \u201cmerchant of record\u201d to avoid all the tax faffing though. It\u2019s worth every penny of the fees you pay. And test out the licensing APIs thoroughly. They may look the same, but they are not!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>SHIP IT!<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I maybe have an advantage here in that my product won\u2019t do anything bad on your site. Really: It injects some JavaScript to scrape and manipulate the DOM. That\u2019s it. It handles no data or anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I\u2019ve very much taken the approach of \u201cit\u2019s good enough &#8211; ship it!\u201c to keep the releases and features coming and to keep it interesting. I actually do a lot of testing myself, and I can always fix things up later. I&#8217;ve aimed for &#8220;done&#8221; not &#8220;perfect&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Have fun. Don\u2019t burn out<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a day job with the wonderful <a href=\"https:\/\/deliciousbrains.com\/\">Delicious Brains<\/a>. So I&#8217;ve been doing this all in my &#8220;spare&#8221; time. I\u2019ve had \u201csprints\u201d on this where I barely talk to my family in the evenings to get stuff done. It\u2019s fun. But it\u2019s also not sustainable. Keep tabs on that. Don\u2019t burn yourself out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Deals and Freebies<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve avoided sales because I think people should pay what it\u2019s worth, I think the price is fair, and because I hate scarcity marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I\u2019ve done this I\u2019ve tried to have fun and do something a bit different (putting discount codes on the website as \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1465411502723248131\">easter eggs<\/a>\u201d for people to find, for example).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\u2019ve given out free licenses to some influential people with big followings in the hope that they will like it and promote it. This hasn&#8217;t done a huge amount (some people haven&#8217;t even used their coupons) but it seems like a good tactic that will maybe one day pay off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Social media is fickle<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Algorithms suck. I had a really good suggestion from someone to use more links to the product website in my Tweets about it. But honestly, Tweets with links seem to tank in the algorithm. Tweets with images and videos seem to do well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. Someone out there knows this better than I do. But try, learn, fail, try again, and figure it out as you go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Aim low. Be prepared for failure<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My basic goal was VERY low: I wanted 10 sales to be happy. If I had a stretch goal, it was 100 sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to know how it&#8217;s done? Really?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, here&#8217;s some numbers so you can get a feel for how it\u2019s done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>v1 released: 28th June 2021<\/li><li>Active plugin installs: 100+<\/li><li>Total paid browser extension sales: 65<\/li><li>Total revenue: nearly $2,500 (before fees)<\/li><li>Chrome extension installs: 111<\/li><li>5-star reviews: 7 &#8211; and there are ONLY 5-star reviews!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty chuffed with that. It&#8217;s not taken the world by storm. That&#8217;s OK. But people use it and love it. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s important. I\u2019m still hopeful I\u2019ll hit my stretch goal within the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m convinced I&#8217;m onto something that&#8217;s clever, unique and useful. But I&#8217;ve also had moments where I&#8217;ve done a big release and there&#8217;s been crickets. It feels futile sometimes. If it wasn&#8217;t enjoyable and interesting I&#8217;d have given up a long time ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But sales are great. Sometimes I\u2019m out and about and I get a sale notification on my phone and I smile because it paid for a meal out or a day trip with the kids. I work hard at it. But it is occasional passive income.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And writing posts like this? Yes. That&#8217;s totally part of the strategy. So <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">find out more<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/try.html\">try it for free<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/#the-deal\">buy a license to support me<\/a>. You could be buying my family dinner tonight!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Someone asked me today if and how I had had any success marketing Turbo Admin, as they were developing a software product of their own and wanted to hear some experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the truth is that I have no idea what I&#8217;m doing. I hate marketing. I&#8217;m a total newbie. And <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a> &#8211; a browser extension that improves your WordPress Dashboard experience on ALL your sites&#8230; WHAT? &#8211; is a pretty unconventional product too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have no &#8220;tips&#8221; or &#8220;advice&#8221;. But I do have stories and experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to build in the open a bit and be transparent. So sharing a bit about what I&#8217;m doing and why and how seems like a good thing to do. If nothing else, to set the expectations of other people who may be in a similar position to myself. So this seemed like a good time to do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s what I wrote back to this person, tidied up a bit, and presented for your own enjoyment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I made Turbo Admin for me&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;and the initial prototype took about 2 days of my spare time to make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then realised it could totally be something that other people would love, and that it could easily be packaged up with a price tag and sold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seemed like an ideal first product to launch. So off I went!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u201cEasily\u201d was a bad assumption<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the difficulty was related specifically to the process of selling browser extensions. But there\u2019s also just the huge hassle of bundling releases, shipping stuff, marketing it, maintaining docs, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Documentation and automation are key here. I have a documented release process and some shell scripts that do some of the work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pricing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t want to be bothered with subscriptions. I didn\u2019t think there was THAT much value in it anyway. So I put a reasonable (in my opinion) price tag on it, and was sure to offer no guaranteed support (after all, it should \u201cjust work\u201d) and updates for the life of v1. But all without <em>promising<\/em> anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives me the option of making a v2 with a different pricing model if I want to. But doesn\u2019t commit me to doing ANYTHING. Though, in reality, v1 has grown a LOT and I&#8217;ve been supporting people when needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Marketing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve mostly marketed by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TurboAdmn\/status\/1501598332002738182\">\u201cteasing\u201d features on Twitter<\/a>. I have a reasonable following with a good number of WordPress developer \u201cinfluencers\u201d on the list. And announcing releases too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve taken the approach that every new feature or release is an excuse to talk about it, to the extent that I\u2019m quite worried my followers are getting bored\/annoyed (sorry!). I\u2019ve also used self-promotion channels in places like Slack groups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>More marketing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My product is HARD to market, because people aren\u2019t necessarily searching for it. But people that do find it love it (see <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/03\/turbo-admin-wordpress-command-palette-free-trial\/\">the testimonials on this post!<\/a>). So I\u2019ve relied a lot on word of mouth, recommendations, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is HARD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve done a bit of SEO work, and have been featured by Chris Coyier (on Twitter), on the WP Builds podcast\/stream (Nathan Wrigley) and a few other places.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s helped. But I need more of it and don&#8217;t know how to get it. I&#8217;ve done NO paid ads or anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Free trial\/more pricing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I only recently <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/03\/turbo-admin-wordpress-command-palette-free-trial\/\">implemented a free trial<\/a>. Initially I didn\u2019t want the support burden of a heap of free users. And I used <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/turbo-admin\/\">the plugin version<\/a> as the gateway\/trial of the main features. But arguably you don\u2019t see the full benefit of my product from that. So the price tag was a kinda deliberate barrier to entry. You had to want it!<br><br>Plus, at first, I only thought about time-limited trials. But I didn\u2019t want to do that for various reasons. But then I realised I could do a site-limited trial and that would work better. So I implemented that. (And have had ZERO sales since doing so! ( ? \/ ? ) )<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Riding media waves<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my features is notice hiding, so I tried to take advantage of the <a href=\"https:\/\/wptavern.com\/clarity-ad-blocker-for-wordpress-announced-receives-mixed-reactions\">recent debate around notice hiding\/ad blocking<\/a> and plug that feature a lot. There was a small bump in sales from this, but the impact wasn&#8217;t huge (other than this is how Nathan Wrigley picked it up).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sales and Software Licensing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, doing software licensing is HARD. I evaluated <a href=\"https:\/\/paddle.com\/\">Paddle<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/freemius.com\/\">Freemius<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/gumroad.com\/\">Gumroad<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/payhip.com\/\">PayHip<\/a>, and even started building my own solution, before settling on the very new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lemonsqueezy.com\/\">Lemon Squeezy<\/a> platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been great, but if I was new to it their pricing model wouldn\u2019t work for my kind of sales volumes (I\u2019m locked into a good deal as I was a beta tester).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DO use a \u201cmerchant of record\u201d to avoid all the tax faffing though. It\u2019s worth every penny of the fees you pay. And test out the licensing APIs thoroughly. They may look the same, but they are not!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>SHIP IT!<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I maybe have an advantage here in that my product won\u2019t do anything bad on your site. Really: It injects some JavaScript to scrape and manipulate the DOM. That\u2019s it. It handles no data or anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I\u2019ve very much taken the approach of \u201cit\u2019s good enough &#8211; ship it!\u201c to keep the releases and features coming and to keep it interesting. I actually do a lot of testing myself, and I can always fix things up later. I&#8217;ve aimed for &#8220;done&#8221; not &#8220;perfect&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Have fun. Don\u2019t burn out<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a day job with the wonderful <a href=\"https:\/\/deliciousbrains.com\/\">Delicious Brains<\/a>. So I&#8217;ve been doing this all in my &#8220;spare&#8221; time. I\u2019ve had \u201csprints\u201d on this where I barely talk to my family in the evenings to get stuff done. It\u2019s fun. But it\u2019s also not sustainable. Keep tabs on that. Don\u2019t burn yourself out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Deals and Freebies<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve avoided sales because I think people should pay what it\u2019s worth, I think the price is fair, and because I hate scarcity marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I\u2019ve done this I\u2019ve tried to have fun and do something a bit different (putting discount codes on the website as \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1465411502723248131\">easter eggs<\/a>\u201d for people to find, for example).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\u2019ve given out free licenses to some influential people with big followings in the hope that they will like it and promote it. This hasn&#8217;t done a huge amount (some people haven&#8217;t even used their coupons) but it seems like a good tactic that will maybe one day pay off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Social media is fickle<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Algorithms suck. I had a really good suggestion from someone to use more links to the product website in my Tweets about it. But honestly, Tweets with links seem to tank in the algorithm. Tweets with images and videos seem to do well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. Someone out there knows this better than I do. But try, learn, fail, try again, and figure it out as you go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Aim low. Be prepared for failure<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My basic goal was VERY low: I wanted 10 sales to be happy. If I had a stretch goal, it was 100 sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to know how it&#8217;s done? Really?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, here&#8217;s some numbers so you can get a feel for how it\u2019s done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>v1 released: 28th June 2021<\/li><li>Active plugin installs: 100+<\/li><li>Total paid browser extension sales: 65<\/li><li>Total revenue: nearly $2,500 (before fees)<\/li><li>Chrome extension installs: 111<\/li><li>5-star reviews: 7 &#8211; and there are ONLY 5-star reviews!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty chuffed with that. It&#8217;s not taken the world by storm. That&#8217;s OK. But people use it and love it. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s important. I\u2019m still hopeful I\u2019ll hit my stretch goal within the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m convinced I&#8217;m onto something that&#8217;s clever, unique and useful. But I&#8217;ve also had moments where I&#8217;ve done a big release and there&#8217;s been crickets. It feels futile sometimes. If it wasn&#8217;t enjoyable and interesting I&#8217;d have given up a long time ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But sales are great. Sometimes I\u2019m out and about and I get a sale notification on my phone and I smile because it paid for a meal out or a day trip with the kids. I work hard at it. But it is occasional passive income.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And writing posts like this? Yes. That&#8217;s totally part of the strategy. So <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">find out more<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/try.html\">try it for free<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/#the-deal\">buy a license to support me<\/a>. You could be buying my family dinner tonight!<\/p>\n",

It\u2019s a difficult tool to market because people don\u2019t know they need it until they have it. People don\u2019t seem to be Googling for this kind of tool because they don\u2019t know it\u2019s something that exists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Although the number of people who want to <a href=\"https:\/\/wptavern.com\/clarity-ad-blocker-for-wordpress-announced-receives-mixed-reactions\">hide notices<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dimensionmedia\/status\/1485617351617826822\">punch the block editor welcome screen in the face<\/a> seems huge! Both of which are things that Turbo Admin helps with!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people have come across Turbo Admin, however, they weren&#8217;t able to immediately see the big benefit of a browser extension because they had to pay for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now I\u2019ve found a way to make it available to everyone to try out: from today, you can use Turbo Admin on up to three sites for free!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/try.html\">Try Turbo Admin!<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m still in the process of updating the website and documentation to reflect this change, but I didn\u2019t want that to stop you trying it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-this-work\">How does this work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, download\/install the extension &#8211; start at <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/try.html\">turbo-admin.com\/try.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turbo Admin tries to detect WordPress sites from both the front and back-end, so be careful what you do next! The next three WordPress sites you visit will (probably) use up your three site limit. So you may want to visit three sites that you will log in to to be able to properly try it out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sites that are included in your limit will have a green dot on the Turbo Admin icon in your browser. Turbo Admin will work on these sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any other sites will have a red dot on the Turbo Admin icon and Turbo Admin will not work on these.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that if you don\u2019t see the coloured dots on Chrome\/Chromium then you may need to \u201cpin\u201d the icon. To do this, click the jigsaw puzzle icon and then click the pin icon next to Turbo Admin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve decided you can\u2019t do WordPress without Turbo Admin any more, it\u2019s only $35 (plus local taxes) to <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\">buy a license<\/a> to remove the three-site limit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a one-time purchase of version 1 that will last for as long as the extension works and will get any updates that to version 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-did-you-do-it-this-way\">Why did you do it this way?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d considered free trials before. But always as a time-limited thing. But for various reasons this didn\u2019t seem like a great idea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/turbo-admin\/\">the plugin<\/a>, which is free, but doesn\u2019t demonstrate the HUGE benefit of the browser extension. Plus the extension has some features that just don\u2019t make sense in the plugin so you don\u2019t get the full functionality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I realised I could easily limit by number of sites, I loved the idea. It\u2019s a much better way to see the benefits for free, while still making the purchase attractive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I won\u2019t lie, I\u2019m a little scared about how much support work this might generate. So to make it clear: this is a side gig, I have limited time, and I make no promises about support. And anyway, Turbo Admin should, mostly, \u201cjust work\u201d!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m hoping that this free-trial removes the barrier to trying out the extension, and to people accessing what I consider to be complete \u201cmagic\u201d in the WordPress dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s see what\u2019s next!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sign off with HUGE thanks to everyone who has bought Turbo Admin, shared it, promoted it, reviewed it, loved it, and helped me develop it and get it into the world.<\/p>\n",

It\u2019s a difficult tool to market because people don\u2019t know they need it until they have it. People don\u2019t seem to be Googling for this kind of tool because they don\u2019t know it\u2019s something that exists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Although the number of people who want to <a href=\"https:\/\/wptavern.com\/clarity-ad-blocker-for-wordpress-announced-receives-mixed-reactions\">hide notices<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dimensionmedia\/status\/1485617351617826822\">punch the block editor welcome screen in the face<\/a> seems huge! Both of which are things that Turbo Admin helps with!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people have come across Turbo Admin, however, they weren&#8217;t able to immediately see the big benefit of a browser extension because they had to pay for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now I\u2019ve found a way to make it available to everyone to try out: from today, you can use Turbo Admin on up to three sites for free!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/try.html\">Try Turbo Admin!<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m still in the process of updating the website and documentation to reflect this change, but I didn\u2019t want that to stop you trying it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-this-work\">How does this work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, download\/install the extension &#8211; start at <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/try.html\">turbo-admin.com\/try.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turbo Admin tries to detect WordPress sites from both the front and back-end, so be careful what you do next! The next three WordPress sites you visit will (probably) use up your three site limit. So you may want to visit three sites that you will log in to to be able to properly try it out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sites that are included in your limit will have a green dot on the Turbo Admin icon in your browser. Turbo Admin will work on these sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any other sites will have a red dot on the Turbo Admin icon and Turbo Admin will not work on these.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that if you don\u2019t see the coloured dots on Chrome\/Chromium then you may need to \u201cpin\u201d the icon. To do this, click the jigsaw puzzle icon and then click the pin icon next to Turbo Admin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve decided you can\u2019t do WordPress without Turbo Admin any more, it\u2019s only $35 (plus local taxes) to <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\">buy a license<\/a> to remove the three-site limit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a one-time purchase of version 1 that will last for as long as the extension works and will get any updates that to version 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-did-you-do-it-this-way\">Why did you do it this way?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d considered free trials before. But always as a time-limited thing. But for various reasons this didn\u2019t seem like a great idea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/turbo-admin\/\">the plugin<\/a>, which is free, but doesn\u2019t demonstrate the HUGE benefit of the browser extension. Plus the extension has some features that just don\u2019t make sense in the plugin so you don\u2019t get the full functionality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I realised I could easily limit by number of sites, I loved the idea. It\u2019s a much better way to see the benefits for free, while still making the purchase attractive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I won\u2019t lie, I\u2019m a little scared about how much support work this might generate. So to make it clear: this is a side gig, I have limited time, and I make no promises about support. And anyway, Turbo Admin should, mostly, \u201cjust work\u201d!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m hoping that this free-trial removes the barrier to trying out the extension, and to people accessing what I consider to be complete \u201cmagic\u201d in the WordPress dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s see what\u2019s next!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sign off with HUGE thanks to everyone who has bought Turbo Admin, shared it, promoted it, reviewed it, loved it, and helped me develop it and get it into the world.<\/p>\n",

And you may also know that I am, where possible, trying to #DitchTheBuild and use vanilla HTML, CSS and JS as much as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for the Turbo Admin website I kinda wanted to embrace this philosophy, get cheap-and-easy, static-file hosting, and make my build and maintenance process as simple as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230; I also wanted to make use of the <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\">Tailwind UI<\/a> component library that I have access to, so I wanted to embrace TailwindCSS and it&#8217;s component-based philosophy as well. How could I do all this but with a minimal build process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I investigated a number of options like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.11ty.dev\">Eleventy<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/mozilla.github.io\/nunjucks\/\">Nunjucks<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/jigsaw.tighten.co\/\">Jigsaw<\/a>, and some others. I decided that they were all too much for what I needed and that I didn&#8217;t want such a big dependency for the build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what DID I need? It&#8217;s just a few HTML pages with a common header and footer, and some template partials with a bit of conditional logic. Maybe some environment variables for testing, API keys, tags and stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>variables<\/li><li>some simple logic for building different environments<\/li><li>simple template includes\/extends<\/li><li>a command-line build process for a few files.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it occurred to me: PHP does all of this! Can&#8217;t I just use PHP?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>PHP has includes for templates<\/li><li>PHP has variables and logic<\/li><li>PHP can be run from the command line<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So I set out to see what was possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with a bit of clever <a href=\"https:\/\/www.php.net\/manual\/en\/book.outcontrol.php\">output buffering<\/a> it turns out that it&#8217;s not so hard to loop over a bunch of files, processing them with PHP, capturing the output, injecting it into a template and writing it out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a bit hacky, but it&#8217;s all standard PHP. It may not be the easiest code to understand, but <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d\">these 162 lines of PHP<\/a> are a simple, command-line static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined with <a href=\"https:\/\/esbuild.github.io\/\">esbuild<\/a> (only required because I&#8217;m using JavaScript modules to power the interactive parts of the homepage) and the <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/installation\">Tailwind CLI<\/a> this can build my whole site with very few dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tailwind can even now be <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/blog\/standalone-cli\">used standalone without node\/npm<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also use standardised build scripts for my projects. So each project has a <code>build.sh<\/code> and a <code>prod.sh<\/code> so I don&#8217;t have to remember what commands to run for each.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious, the script for this project is:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n#!\/bin\/sh\nnode_modules\/.bin\/esbuild src\/js\/turbo-admin\/main.js --bundle --minify --sourcemap --outfile=public\/js\/turbo-admin\/main.min.js\nphp .\/build.php\nnpm run build:dev\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Sure, this doesn&#8217;t have hot-module reloading or automatic browser refresh. But it&#8217;s not changing so much that I need those things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, this project has a build step. It uses npm (for now). But it&#8217;s pretty minimal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there you go. Summary:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Vanilla <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d\">PHP static site builder<\/a> in 162 lines<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/esbuild.github.io\/\">ESBuild<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/installation\">Tailwind CLI<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All you need to build a simple site with minimal dependencies.<\/p>\n",

And you may also know that I am, where possible, trying to #DitchTheBuild and use vanilla HTML, CSS and JS as much as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for the Turbo Admin website I kinda wanted to embrace this philosophy, get cheap-and-easy, static-file hosting, and make my build and maintenance process as simple as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230; I also wanted to make use of the <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\">Tailwind UI<\/a> component library that I have access to, so I wanted to embrace TailwindCSS and it&#8217;s component-based philosophy as well. How could I do all this but with a minimal build process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I investigated a number of options like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.11ty.dev\">Eleventy<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/mozilla.github.io\/nunjucks\/\">Nunjucks<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/jigsaw.tighten.co\/\">Jigsaw<\/a>, and some others. I decided that they were all too much for what I needed and that I didn&#8217;t want such a big dependency for the build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what DID I need? It&#8217;s just a few HTML pages with a common header and footer, and some template partials with a bit of conditional logic. Maybe some environment variables for testing, API keys, tags and stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>variables<\/li><li>some simple logic for building different environments<\/li><li>simple template includes\/extends<\/li><li>a command-line build process for a few files.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it occurred to me: PHP does all of this! Can&#8217;t I just use PHP?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>PHP has includes for templates<\/li><li>PHP has variables and logic<\/li><li>PHP can be run from the command line<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So I set out to see what was possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with a bit of clever <a href=\"https:\/\/www.php.net\/manual\/en\/book.outcontrol.php\">output buffering<\/a> it turns out that it&#8217;s not so hard to loop over a bunch of files, processing them with PHP, capturing the output, injecting it into a template and writing it out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a bit hacky, but it&#8217;s all standard PHP. It may not be the easiest code to understand, but <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d\">these 162 lines of PHP<\/a> are a simple, command-line static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined with <a href=\"https:\/\/esbuild.github.io\/\">esbuild<\/a> (only required because I&#8217;m using JavaScript modules to power the interactive parts of the homepage) and the <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/installation\">Tailwind CLI<\/a> this can build my whole site with very few dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tailwind can even now be <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/blog\/standalone-cli\">used standalone without node\/npm<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also use standardised build scripts for my projects. So each project has a <code>build.sh<\/code> and a <code>prod.sh<\/code> so I don&#8217;t have to remember what commands to run for each.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious, the script for this project is:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n#!\/bin\/sh\nnode_modules\/.bin\/esbuild src\/js\/turbo-admin\/main.js --bundle --minify --sourcemap --outfile=public\/js\/turbo-admin\/main.min.js\nphp .\/build.php\nnpm run build:dev\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Sure, this doesn&#8217;t have hot-module reloading or automatic browser refresh. But it&#8217;s not changing so much that I need those things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, this project has a build step. It uses npm (for now). But it&#8217;s pretty minimal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there you go. Summary:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Vanilla <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d\">PHP static site builder<\/a> in 162 lines<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/esbuild.github.io\/\">ESBuild<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/installation\">Tailwind CLI<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All you need to build a simple site with minimal dependencies.<\/p>\n",

There are still some loose ends to tie up but I really ought to close out my thoughts on freelancing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also read <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-1\/\">part 1<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-2\/\">part 2<\/a> if you missed them. I&#8217;ve already given you 10 things, so here are some bonus experiences. What can I say? It all got a bit out of hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"11-business-vs-personal-branding\">11. Business vs Personal branding<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started out I had no idea what &#8220;Oikos&#8221; &#8211; my business &#8211; would become. And I was nervous about being just myself. That didn&#8217;t seem right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I set up the business with a business name and worked under that. &#8220;Oikos&#8221; was the brand and it had some ideas and principles behind it. And maybe one day it would be more than just me. That was the main reason I avoided being &#8220;Ross Wintle&#8221; as a brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, though, my personal reputation seemed to become more important. As I started doing some public speaking and taking part in conferences and community events and forums, it was me that was well know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, over time, I realised that I didn&#8217;t want to grow and become more than just me. I was quite happy to not have the stress of directly employing other people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I kinda switched back to being &#8220;Ross Wintle&#8221; a bit more. Oikos was still the face of the business and the legal entity that clients dealt with, but I focussed much more on just being me, because that was really what Oikos was selling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was important to have the limited company for various reasons that are well documented elsewhere. And I don&#8217;t think I have an opinion one way or another on what you should be. It&#8217;s YOUR business, and the key is to understand the pros and cons of personal vs business branding. And know that it&#8217;s OK to change too&#8230; you can scale back on one and focus on the other if that&#8217;s what you need to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"12-you-get-freedom-you-lose-freedom\">12. You get freedom \u2013 you lose freedom<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of the big sell of Freelance life is the freedom that you get. And there IS a lot of freedom in freelancing. It&#8217;s a huge privilege actually: to have skills that allow you to work remotely doing something you enjoy in your own place and in your own time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But (and maybe this is just because of how my brain works) freelancing is a bit of a lifestyle. It can consume you. It occupies your thoughts and time when you&#8217;re not doing it. And this actually takes away some freedom too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure some people can switch off better than I can, but I found it hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of my rationale for taking a full-time role recently was that both of my kids are now at school and I don&#8217;t need as much flexibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with the full time rule I get to switch off. I get to the end of the day and I don&#8217;t have to work any more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s taking time to adjust &#8211; to train my brain that I don&#8217;t need to be thinking about work right now. But I can stop thinking about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"13-it-s-not-for-everyone\">13. It\u2019s not for everyone<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of hype around freelancing and many of the messages are that &#8220;Anyone can do it&#8221;, &#8220;You can achieve your dreams&#8221;, &#8220;Do what you love&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also see a lot of people struggling. And some that probably shouldn&#8217;t have started their freelance\/startup\/founder journey. So here&#8217;s some things that I believe about freelancing:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You have to be very motivated &#8211; you won&#8217;t get by without a good work ethic.<\/li><li>You need to be good (or willing to get good) at a whole load of other things in addition to whatever it is you do for a living (communication, organisation, marketing, etc)<\/li><li>You probably need some kind of financial buffer to get started.<\/li><li>You actually need to have a service or product that people want to pay decent money for.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have no money, no specialist thing that you&#8217;re good at, and you&#8217;re not willing to throw yourself into things then I don&#8217;t believe that just &#8220;following your dream&#8221; is enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"14-curiosity-is-a-superpower\">14. Curiosity is a superpower<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another trait that I think is really helpful is curiosity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Aside: &#8220;Curious&#8221; is my favourite word. I love the double meaning of &#8220;unusual&#8221; and &#8220;inquisitive&#8221;. I think both are highly undervalued traits. So to wrap them up in a single word is ACE!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I think about this I think about some of the things I&#8217;ve had to be curious about in my freelancing that aren&#8217;t my core competency of coding:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Data protection and GDPR<\/li><li>Video and audio production<\/li><li>SEO and social media<\/li><li>Bookkeeping and accounting<\/li><li>Insurance<\/li><li>Writing<\/li><li>Business planning<\/li><li>Coffee brewing (kinda half-joking here)<\/li><li>Psychology (habits, mental health, productivity)<\/li><li>Software, hardward and other tools<\/li><li>Project management<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Being curious isn&#8217;t <em>required<\/em>. You can pay other people to do some of these things for you. You can try to ignore them. But I reckon that if you&#8217;re willing to spend time going down some of these rabbit holes on your own you&#8217;ll broaden your knowledge and this will make you a more useful freelancer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent a lot of time advising my clients on some of these things that weren&#8217;t only ancillary to MY business, but to THEIR business\/organisation too. My knowledge made me more valuable to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"15-be-a-jack-of-all-trades-but-a-master-of-one\">15. Be a jack of all trades, but a master of one<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all of this stuff &#8211; broadening your horizons, being curious and learning lots being to your advantage &#8211; I believe it still pays to have a focus. I tried to sell myself too broadly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to help small organisations, but it was the bigger ones that paid the bills. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to do back-end work, but it was the front-end work that paid the bills. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to use my flexibility to work on side projects and build passive income, but it was the paid project work that paid the bills. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to offer hosting and support services, but these were often a distraction from the project work. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, I was overwhelmed with wanting to be and do everything. And this meant I wasn&#8217;t as effective at serving my clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should probably have chosen to be a back-end consultant who worked full time on a single project at a time for a big client, did no hosting, and worked minimally on my side projects in my spare time. I&#8217;d have made more money, been less stressed, and&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hang on&#8230; wait&#8230; this sounds like having a full time job? And this is what I&#8217;m experiencing right now!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you see where I ended up?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-summary\">In summary<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You might thing I&#8217;m saying don&#8217;t freelance because it&#8217;s hard, and you need to be a special kind of person, and you&#8217;ll burn out. It&#8217;s entirely possibly that I just wasn&#8217;t very good at it and should have stuck to employment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No. I&#8217;ve used the flexibility of freelancing for 10 years and it&#8217;s served me really well, especially with a young family in my care too. It was totally the right thing for me to do. But I am saying: it&#8217;s not a golden goose or a silver bullet. It&#8217;s not for everyone. It&#8217;s sold as a dream that everyone should aspire to, but honestly, I don&#8217;t think it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be really convenient and a great way to broaden your skills, make a name for yourself, and escape corporate culture or the apparent drudgery of employment. But you need to be sure it&#8217;s what you really want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And despite all the hyped-up positive of many business owners, remember that it&#8217;s OK to try it and not like it. It&#8217;s OK to stop being a freelancer too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope this helps you in your own journey.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>So I&#8217;ve had my last official day as a freelancer. There are still some loose ends to tie up but I really ought to close out my thoughts on freelancing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also read <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-1\/\">part 1<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-2\/\">part 2<\/a> if you missed them. I&#8217;ve already given you 10 things, so here are some bonus experiences. What can I say? It all got a bit out of hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"11-business-vs-personal-branding\">11. Business vs Personal branding<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started out I had no idea what &#8220;Oikos&#8221; &#8211; my business &#8211; would become. And I was nervous about being just myself. That didn&#8217;t seem right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I set up the business with a business name and worked under that. &#8220;Oikos&#8221; was the brand and it had some ideas and principles behind it. And maybe one day it would be more than just me. That was the main reason I avoided being &#8220;Ross Wintle&#8221; as a brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, though, my personal reputation seemed to become more important. As I started doing some public speaking and taking part in conferences and community events and forums, it was me that was well know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, over time, I realised that I didn&#8217;t want to grow and become more than just me. I was quite happy to not have the stress of directly employing other people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I kinda switched back to being &#8220;Ross Wintle&#8221; a bit more. Oikos was still the face of the business and the legal entity that clients dealt with, but I focussed much more on just being me, because that was really what Oikos was selling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was important to have the limited company for various reasons that are well documented elsewhere. And I don&#8217;t think I have an opinion one way or another on what you should be. It&#8217;s YOUR business, and the key is to understand the pros and cons of personal vs business branding. And know that it&#8217;s OK to change too&#8230; you can scale back on one and focus on the other if that&#8217;s what you need to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"12-you-get-freedom-you-lose-freedom\">12. You get freedom \u2013 you lose freedom<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of the big sell of Freelance life is the freedom that you get. And there IS a lot of freedom in freelancing. It&#8217;s a huge privilege actually: to have skills that allow you to work remotely doing something you enjoy in your own place and in your own time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But (and maybe this is just because of how my brain works) freelancing is a bit of a lifestyle. It can consume you. It occupies your thoughts and time when you&#8217;re not doing it. And this actually takes away some freedom too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure some people can switch off better than I can, but I found it hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of my rationale for taking a full-time role recently was that both of my kids are now at school and I don&#8217;t need as much flexibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with the full time rule I get to switch off. I get to the end of the day and I don&#8217;t have to work any more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s taking time to adjust &#8211; to train my brain that I don&#8217;t need to be thinking about work right now. But I can stop thinking about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"13-it-s-not-for-everyone\">13. It\u2019s not for everyone<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of hype around freelancing and many of the messages are that &#8220;Anyone can do it&#8221;, &#8220;You can achieve your dreams&#8221;, &#8220;Do what you love&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also see a lot of people struggling. And some that probably shouldn&#8217;t have started their freelance\/startup\/founder journey. So here&#8217;s some things that I believe about freelancing:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You have to be very motivated &#8211; you won&#8217;t get by without a good work ethic.<\/li><li>You need to be good (or willing to get good) at a whole load of other things in addition to whatever it is you do for a living (communication, organisation, marketing, etc)<\/li><li>You probably need some kind of financial buffer to get started.<\/li><li>You actually need to have a service or product that people want to pay decent money for.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have no money, no specialist thing that you&#8217;re good at, and you&#8217;re not willing to throw yourself into things then I don&#8217;t believe that just &#8220;following your dream&#8221; is enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"14-curiosity-is-a-superpower\">14. Curiosity is a superpower<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another trait that I think is really helpful is curiosity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Aside: &#8220;Curious&#8221; is my favourite word. I love the double meaning of &#8220;unusual&#8221; and &#8220;inquisitive&#8221;. I think both are highly undervalued traits. So to wrap them up in a single word is ACE!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I think about this I think about some of the things I&#8217;ve had to be curious about in my freelancing that aren&#8217;t my core competency of coding:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Data protection and GDPR<\/li><li>Video and audio production<\/li><li>SEO and social media<\/li><li>Bookkeeping and accounting<\/li><li>Insurance<\/li><li>Writing<\/li><li>Business planning<\/li><li>Coffee brewing (kinda half-joking here)<\/li><li>Psychology (habits, mental health, productivity)<\/li><li>Software, hardward and other tools<\/li><li>Project management<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Being curious isn&#8217;t <em>required<\/em>. You can pay other people to do some of these things for you. You can try to ignore them. But I reckon that if you&#8217;re willing to spend time going down some of these rabbit holes on your own you&#8217;ll broaden your knowledge and this will make you a more useful freelancer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent a lot of time advising my clients on some of these things that weren&#8217;t only ancillary to MY business, but to THEIR business\/organisation too. My knowledge made me more valuable to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"15-be-a-jack-of-all-trades-but-a-master-of-one\">15. Be a jack of all trades, but a master of one<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all of this stuff &#8211; broadening your horizons, being curious and learning lots being to your advantage &#8211; I believe it still pays to have a focus. I tried to sell myself too broadly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to help small organisations, but it was the bigger ones that paid the bills. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to do back-end work, but it was the front-end work that paid the bills. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to use my flexibility to work on side projects and build passive income, but it was the paid project work that paid the bills. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to offer hosting and support services, but these were often a distraction from the project work. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, I was overwhelmed with wanting to be and do everything. And this meant I wasn&#8217;t as effective at serving my clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should probably have chosen to be a back-end consultant who worked full time on a single project at a time for a big client, did no hosting, and worked minimally on my side projects in my spare time. I&#8217;d have made more money, been less stressed, and&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hang on&#8230; wait&#8230; this sounds like having a full time job? And this is what I&#8217;m experiencing right now!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you see where I ended up?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-summary\">In summary<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You might thing I&#8217;m saying don&#8217;t freelance because it&#8217;s hard, and you need to be a special kind of person, and you&#8217;ll burn out. It&#8217;s entirely possibly that I just wasn&#8217;t very good at it and should have stuck to employment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No. I&#8217;ve used the flexibility of freelancing for 10 years and it&#8217;s served me really well, especially with a young family in my care too. It was totally the right thing for me to do. But I am saying: it&#8217;s not a golden goose or a silver bullet. It&#8217;s not for everyone. It&#8217;s sold as a dream that everyone should aspire to, but honestly, I don&#8217;t think it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be really convenient and a great way to broaden your skills, make a name for yourself, and escape corporate culture or the apparent drudgery of employment. But you need to be sure it&#8217;s what you really want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And despite all the hyped-up positive of many business owners, remember that it&#8217;s OK to try it and not like it. It&#8217;s OK to stop being a freelancer too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope this helps you in your own journey.<\/p>\n",

You will never regret not tweeting.<\/li><li>Is it intended to delight, inform or amuse? Then go ahead. If not, don&#8217;t.<\/li><li>Never argue with anybody about anything. Really.<\/li><li>\u2026..except pizza, whether hot dogs are sandwiches, and old movies\/TV shows.<\/li><li>Don&#8217;t say anything about a piece of current art\/writing\/culture you wouldn&#8217;t say to the face of the person who created it.<\/li><li>Never promote any info or news unless it comes from a trust to tell you which door the tiger is behind. source you would<\/li><li>The only useful purpose of having a bigger platform a than other people is to use it to benefit those other people, so boost and recommend widely.<\/li><li>Resist the common urge to engage with the one critic rather than the many fans.<\/li><li>Never, ever insult anyone personally. Mockery is fine, as long as it aimed upwards.<\/li><li>To survive on the veldt, humans evolved to crave sugars and fats and to get energized by anger and fear. We don&#8217;t live on the veldt anymore. Refrain from feeding obsolete hungers.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know that I have some unwritten rules of my own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve had enough bad interactions on social media (and really, I acknowledge my privilege and it&#8217;s not very many at all, but it&#8217;s enough) to have learned some lessons. And I&#8217;ve spent enough time scrolling and curating my feed into a happy and useful place that I think there&#8217;s some wisdom here. So here&#8217;s how I use Twitter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Disable trends. Focus on your own timeline. Don&#8217;t get distracted by the algorithm. I use <a href=\"https:\/\/tapbots.com\/tweetbot\/\">Tweetbot<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/better-twitter\/illmpnnkeobcgnnjghammeohfjpjoljp\">Better Twitter<\/a>.<\/li><li>Learn when something is a fact and when something is an opinion. Always ask if you can put &#8220;IMO&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;I think that&#8230;&#8221; in front of your &#8220;fact&#8221;. There&#8217;s a world of difference between &#8220;Avocados are horrid&#8221; and &#8220;I think that Avocados are horrid&#8221;.<\/li><li>Related: Not everyone&#8217;s brain thinks the same way. Your shitpost might be insulting to someone that doesn&#8217;t &#8211; or just plain isn&#8217;t able to &#8211; get it. Kindness always wins.<\/li><li>Following is not a two-way thing. I don&#8217;t have to follow back. I don&#8217;t have to follow you at all. I reserve the right to unfollow at any point.<\/li><li>Mute judiciously: Learn to recognise when a topic is causing anxiety or anger and eliminate it. Mute people. Mute keywords. You won&#8217;t miss those Tweets. I honestly look at my mute list and think &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t read Tweets with that in? Ah well. ?\u200d\u2642\ufe0f&#8221;<\/li><li>Never argue with anybody about anything. Really.<\/li><li>If you must engage with something controversial, asking questions is always better than stating opinions. &#8220;Why do you think that?&#8221; is a great start. But mostly, never argue with anybody.<\/li><li>Not Tweeting about a topic doesn&#8217;t say anything about my opinion on that topic.<\/li><li>Avoid topics that can&#8217;t be effectively discussed in Tweets. Recognise when something has nuance and either don&#8217;t mention it, or find a better way to discuss it.<\/li><li>Researching before retweeting. Even if you agree with or like a message, make sure it&#8217;s correct before sharing it.<\/li><li>Say nice things. Share what your friends make and do. Kindness is free. You have an unlimited reserve of it if you look inside of you.<\/li><\/ol>\n",

Really.<\/li><li>\u2026..except pizza, whether hot dogs are sandwiches, and old movies\/TV shows.<\/li><li>Don&#8217;t say anything about a piece of current art\/writing\/culture you wouldn&#8217;t say to the face of the person who created it.<\/li><li>Never promote any info or news unless it comes from a trust to tell you which door the tiger is behind. source you would<\/li><li>The only useful purpose of having a bigger platform a than other people is to use it to benefit those other people, so boost and recommend widely.<\/li><li>Resist the common urge to engage with the one critic rather than the many fans.<\/li><li>Never, ever insult anyone personally. Mockery is fine, as long as it aimed upwards.<\/li><li>To survive on the veldt, humans evolved to crave sugars and fats and to get energized by anger and fear.

And I&#8217;ve spent enough time scrolling and curating my feed into a happy and useful place that I think there&#8217;s some wisdom here. So here&#8217;s how I use Twitter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Disable trends. Focus on your own timeline. Don&#8217;t get distracted by the algorithm. I use <a href=\"https:\/\/tapbots.com\/tweetbot\/\">Tweetbot<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/better-twitter\/illmpnnkeobcgnnjghammeohfjpjoljp\">Better Twitter<\/a>.<\/li><li>Learn when something is a fact and when something is an opinion. Always ask if you can put &#8220;IMO&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;I think that&#8230;&#8221; in front of your &#8220;fact&#8221;. There&#8217;s a world of difference between &#8220;Avocados are horrid&#8221; and &#8220;I think that Avocados are horrid&#8221;.<\/li><li>Related: Not everyone&#8217;s brain thinks the same way. Your shitpost might be insulting to someone that doesn&#8217;t &#8211; or just plain isn&#8217;t able to &#8211; get it. Kindness always wins.<\/li><li>Following is not a two-way thing. I don&#8217;t have to follow back. I don&#8217;t have to follow you at all. I reserve the right to unfollow at any point.<\/li><li>Mute judiciously: Learn to recognise when a topic is causing anxiety or anger and eliminate it. Mute people. Mute keywords. You won&#8217;t miss those Tweets. I honestly look at my mute list and think &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t read Tweets with that in? Ah well. ?\u200d\u2642\ufe0f&#8221;<\/li><li>Never argue with anybody about anything. Really.<\/li><li>If you must engage with something controversial, asking questions is always better than stating opinions. &#8220;Why do you think that?&#8221; is a great start. But mostly, never argue with anybody.<\/li><li>Not Tweeting about a topic doesn&#8217;t say anything about my opinion on that topic.<\/li><li>Avoid topics that can&#8217;t be effectively discussed in Tweets. Recognise when something has nuance and either don&#8217;t mention it, or find a better way to discuss it.<\/li><li>Researching before retweeting. Even if you agree with or like a message, make sure it&#8217;s correct before sharing it.<\/li><li>Say nice things. Share what your friends make and do. Kindness is free. You have an unlimited reserve of it if you look inside of you.<\/li><\/ol>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>Today I visited a local &#8220;Electric Vehicle Roadshow&#8221; where you could get information about eBikes, eCars, eMotorbikes, and stuff from people who sold them and owners clubs and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve long had the idea that our next car might be electric. Our current 13-year-old 1.8l petrol midi-MPV has been a superbly-reliable asset to our family life. But it&#8217;s getting old and tired (despite only 85,000 miles on it).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is that instead of one medium-sized car that we use for everything, we could get a small electric for getting round town and for longer trips where we&#8217;re not taking much luggage. Then for bigger or longer holidays we&#8217;ll just rent a bigger car. There&#8217;s no point owning a particular car because you need it&#8217;s size two or three times a year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for an electric car, charging is an issue. We don&#8217;t have a drive or garage. We have on-street parking. So if we wanted to charge something, we&#8217;d have to somehow park outside our house, and then run a cable out across the pavement!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But today, I think I was tipped over the edge with a realisation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was chatting with a chap about range and different battery capacities. He asked:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What sort of mileage do yo do?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Well, if we use the car a lot in a week it&#8217;s probably 30 miles.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;30 miles a day?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;No. 30 miles a WEEK.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HAaaaaaaannnnng on a mo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the small electric cars have a range of 120 miles. So even if we were busy and using the car a lot, we&#8217;ll charge it about once a month (assuming charge holds well).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason I had it in my head that we&#8217;d be charging this thing every other day. But the truth is that we go for days at a time without using our car. So driving to, say, a relative&#8217;s house and charging overnight every now and then, or finding a fast charger near a cafe occasionally. These are viable solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly the big blocker seems to have gone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NOW&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electric cars are still expensive. There&#8217;s an second-hand market now, which is good. And maybe that would work for us. But there&#8217;s possibly a question of: &#8220;If you&#8217;re only doing 30 miles a week, will it pay for itself? Is it good value?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might even be thinking &#8220;Why own a car at all?&#8221; and the answer really is convenience and the lack of a decent car club. Seriously, if I could borrow a car from a shared pool when I needed one I&#8217;d be on it like a shot. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don&#8217;t think &#8220;will it save us money&#8221; is a relevant question on it&#8217;s own. We don&#8217;t own a car because it&#8217;s cheap. We own a car because it gives us very flexible travel options. And anyway, currently we keep a 1.8l petrol car on the go. \u00a3100&#8217;s in vehicle duty. \u00a3100&#8217;s in servicing. And we only use it&#8217;s size and power a few times a year. Mostly it&#8217;s wasted. It THAT good value?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is wrong thinking then let me know. Really do!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, now I&#8217;m properly looking and researching and I&#8217;m likely to become a complete EV bore. So look forward to that!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Today I visited a local &#8220;Electric Vehicle Roadshow&#8221; where you could get information about eBikes, eCars, eMotorbikes, and stuff from people who sold them and owners clubs and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve long had the idea that our next car might be electric. Our current 13-year-old 1.8l petrol midi-MPV has been a superbly-reliable asset to our family life. But it&#8217;s getting old and tired (despite only 85,000 miles on it).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is that instead of one medium-sized car that we use for everything, we could get a small electric for getting round town and for longer trips where we&#8217;re not taking much luggage. Then for bigger or longer holidays we&#8217;ll just rent a bigger car. There&#8217;s no point owning a particular car because you need it&#8217;s size two or three times a year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for an electric car, charging is an issue. We don&#8217;t have a drive or garage. We have on-street parking. So if we wanted to charge something, we&#8217;d have to somehow park outside our house, and then run a cable out across the pavement!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But today, I think I was tipped over the edge with a realisation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was chatting with a chap about range and different battery capacities. He asked:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What sort of mileage do yo do?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Well, if we use the car a lot in a week it&#8217;s probably 30 miles.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;30 miles a day?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;No. 30 miles a WEEK.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HAaaaaaaannnnng on a mo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the small electric cars have a range of 120 miles. So even if we were busy and using the car a lot, we&#8217;ll charge it about once a month (assuming charge holds well).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason I had it in my head that we&#8217;d be charging this thing every other day. But the truth is that we go for days at a time without using our car. So driving to, say, a relative&#8217;s house and charging overnight every now and then, or finding a fast charger near a cafe occasionally. These are viable solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly the big blocker seems to have gone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NOW&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electric cars are still expensive. There&#8217;s an second-hand market now, which is good. And maybe that would work for us. But there&#8217;s possibly a question of: &#8220;If you&#8217;re only doing 30 miles a week, will it pay for itself? Is it good value?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might even be thinking &#8220;Why own a car at all?&#8221; and the answer really is convenience and the lack of a decent car club. Seriously, if I could borrow a car from a shared pool when I needed one I&#8217;d be on it like a shot. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don&#8217;t think &#8220;will it save us money&#8221; is a relevant question on it&#8217;s own. We don&#8217;t own a car because it&#8217;s cheap. We own a car because it gives us very flexible travel options. And anyway, currently we keep a 1.8l petrol car on the go. \u00a3100&#8217;s in vehicle duty. \u00a3100&#8217;s in servicing. And we only use it&#8217;s size and power a few times a year. Mostly it&#8217;s wasted. It THAT good value?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is wrong thinking then let me know. Really do!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, now I&#8217;m properly looking and researching and I&#8217;m likely to become a complete EV bore. So look forward to that!<\/p>\n",

If you want to understand why, see thing number 7<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you didn&#8217;t already: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-1\/\">read part 1<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-invest-in-tools-but-only-those-you-actually-need\">6. Invest in tools (but only those you actually need)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a job like mine you spend may hours at a desk, working at a computer, using a mouse and keyboard, looking at a screen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a hobby.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in the same way that a builder or decorator will spend good money buying decent power tools, I learned to see the things on my desk as my tools. And that they were worth spending extra on so that they were reliable, fast, powerful, and long-lasting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT\u2026 you don\u2019t need to go over the top. I see so much \u201cdesk\/setup porn\u201d and it frustrates me because I\u2019m sure so much of this is not actually what many peoples\u2019 desks look like when they work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reckon that only people with really tidy, fancy, expensive setups will share them. You don\u2019t see the less-fancy desks of many, many people who are busy and who are tucked away in the corner of ordinary bedrooms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, invest in good tools, but don\u2019t go overboard just because of what you see on Instagram or what the person who made that expensive video course had. You can waste an awful lot of money on things you don&#8217;t need too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-estimating-isn-t-that-hard-managing-scope-creep-is\">7. Estimating isn\u2019t THAT hard. Managing scope creep is.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I got pretty good at estimating how long it would take to do things I\u2019d been asked to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the things I hadn\u2019t been asked to do that were tricky.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8-freelancers-help-each-other\">8. Freelancers help each other<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019d think people running similar businesses would compete heavily against each other. And I\u2019m sure there are places where this happens. But in general I\u2019ve found freelancers and agency owners to be incredibly helpful and collaborative and supportive of each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess if you run a business you know what it\u2019s like to run a business. If you\u2019re a web developer, you know what it\u2019s like to be a web developer. You understand the struggles. And any reasonable person is going to have empathy and be supportive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, I was amazed at how much cheering on there was, and I like to think I did my bit sharing, mentoring, encouraging and cheering others on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9-niching-is-helpful-at-least-it-was-for-me\">9. Niching is helpful (at least, it was for me!)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s debate about operating your business in a niche, be it in an industry sector or geographic location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I, personally, found it very helpful to have a sector that I worked in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got referrals within that sector. I built up an understanding of the needs of the sector. I attended sector-specific events and joined sector-specific Slack and Facebook groups. I built up a personal profile and contacts in that sector. It meant I could focus a bit, and be especially interested in what my clients were doing, AND be extra helpful when work did come in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"10-people-are-everything\">10. People are EVERYTHING<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, you will work FOR people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will work WITH people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People may work for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will use the things you make (or, if you get it wrong, they may choose not to).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will send you work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will review your work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to be good at people stuff. You have to have empathy. You have to be good at communication. You have to be able to listen. And sometimes lead or take charge of a situation (even when it doesn\u2019t feel like your job to).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\u2019t just be a tech freelancer. People are always at the heart of every project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-part-three\">In part three&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This got really out of hand didn&#8217;t it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m still gonna write more.

If you want to understand why, see thing number 7<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you didn&#8217;t already: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-1\/\">read part 1<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-invest-in-tools-but-only-those-you-actually-need\">6. Invest in tools (but only those you actually need)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a job like mine you spend may hours at a desk, working at a computer, using a mouse and keyboard, looking at a screen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a hobby.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in the same way that a builder or decorator will spend good money buying decent power tools, I learned to see the things on my desk as my tools. And that they were worth spending extra on so that they were reliable, fast, powerful, and long-lasting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT\u2026 you don\u2019t need to go over the top. I see so much \u201cdesk\/setup porn\u201d and it frustrates me because I\u2019m sure so much of this is not actually what many peoples\u2019 desks look like when they work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reckon that only people with really tidy, fancy, expensive setups will share them. You don\u2019t see the less-fancy desks of many, many people who are busy and who are tucked away in the corner of ordinary bedrooms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, invest in good tools, but don\u2019t go overboard just because of what you see on Instagram or what the person who made that expensive video course had. You can waste an awful lot of money on things you don&#8217;t need too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-estimating-isn-t-that-hard-managing-scope-creep-is\">7. Estimating isn\u2019t THAT hard. Managing scope creep is.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I got pretty good at estimating how long it would take to do things I\u2019d been asked to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the things I hadn\u2019t been asked to do that were tricky.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8-freelancers-help-each-other\">8. Freelancers help each other<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019d think people running similar businesses would compete heavily against each other. And I\u2019m sure there are places where this happens. But in general I\u2019ve found freelancers and agency owners to be incredibly helpful and collaborative and supportive of each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess if you run a business you know what it\u2019s like to run a business. If you\u2019re a web developer, you know what it\u2019s like to be a web developer. You understand the struggles. And any reasonable person is going to have empathy and be supportive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, I was amazed at how much cheering on there was, and I like to think I did my bit sharing, mentoring, encouraging and cheering others on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9-niching-is-helpful-at-least-it-was-for-me\">9. Niching is helpful (at least, it was for me!)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s debate about operating your business in a niche, be it in an industry sector or geographic location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I, personally, found it very helpful to have a sector that I worked in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got referrals within that sector. I built up an understanding of the needs of the sector. I attended sector-specific events and joined sector-specific Slack and Facebook groups. I built up a personal profile and contacts in that sector. It meant I could focus a bit, and be especially interested in what my clients were doing, AND be extra helpful when work did come in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"10-people-are-everything\">10. People are EVERYTHING<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, you will work FOR people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will work WITH people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People may work for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will use the things you make (or, if you get it wrong, they may choose not to).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will send you work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will review your work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to be good at people stuff. You have to have empathy. You have to be good at communication. You have to be able to listen. And sometimes lead or take charge of a situation (even when it doesn\u2019t feel like your job to).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\u2019t just be a tech freelancer. People are always at the heart of every project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-part-three\">In part three&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This got really out of hand didn&#8217;t it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m still gonna write more. Here are some teasers:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Business vs Personal branding<\/li><li>You get freedom &#8211; you lose freedom<\/li><li>It\u2019s not for everyone<\/li><li>Curiosity is the superpower<\/li><li>Be a jack of all trades, but a master of one<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can go and <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/10\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-part-3\/\">read that now<\/a>!<\/p>\n",
