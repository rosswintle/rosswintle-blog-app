                "rendered": "<p>Philip Pullman is an author with a reputation.  He is the children&#8217;s Dan Brown.  He&#8217;s known more for the controversy about what he writes than for how he writes.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t like Dan Brown&#8217;s writing.  I read the Da Vinci Code and though I thought it was gripping and exciting, it was also patronising and unbelievable.  I also read the first chapter of &#8220;Angels and Demons&#8221; and decided it was the SAME book!  I won&#8217;t mention Brown&#8217;s weird ideas about history and religion.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, though I approached the Northern Lights with scepticism due to the author&#8217;s reputation for bashing religion and the church, I&#8217;m thinking that Philip Pullman is an excellent author!<\/p>\n<p>I confess that I saw &#8220;The Golden Compass&#8221; &#8211; the film version of &#8220;The Northern Lights&#8221; &#8211; just before Christmas and before I read the book.  It was very much a children&#8217;s film, albeit quite a violent one, but an enjoyable romp with some imaginative scenery and special effects.  The &#8220;daemons&#8221; were entirely believable! Though I thought the compass effect was done about three times too many.<\/p>\n<p>I went to see the film with people who HAD read the book and they said that the book made much more sense.<\/p>\n<p>And it did.  Not only is Pullman an excellent author who provokes the imagination with enchanting descriptions and clever dialogue, he also spins a good yarn.  The world(s) he has created is large, varied and yet coherant.  He draws on reality but uses it flexibly to create somewhere of this world, possibly from another century, but also not of this world. <\/p>\n<p>Does he attack the church?  Well, I think so.  Somewhat.  He&#8217;s certainly very political and implies that the church has lots of influence on the state and indoctrinates children with it&#8217;s nasty ideas.  But he&#8217;s not attacking the church that I know.  I don&#8217;t know his background &#8211; maybe he has issues with the church &#8211; his own &#8220;demon&#8221;, if you like.  But I, as a member of The Church (meaning the body of people who follow Jesus Christ), didn&#8217;t feel particularly put out by it.  Plus, it&#8217;s allegorical, so, unlike the Da Vinci Code that presents itself as almost-factual, you&#8217;re free to see the church as being that of Pullman&#8217;s world, not of our own.<\/p>\n<p>The only REALLY weird thing was the Bible being translated into the context of Pullman&#8217;s world.  Oh, and his interpretation of it.  Most odd and made me feel slightly uneasy.<\/p>\n<p>The film and the book are a little out of synch.  Having seen film 1 and then read book 1 it will be interesting to read book 2 and THEN see film 2 to see how things progress.<\/p>\n<p>I found the book more grown up than the film &#8211; a better place for an adult to be.  I would sincerely hope that children would be reading it too!  The film &#8211; OK for kids but plain confusing for adults.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Philip Pullman is an author with a reputation.  He is the children&#8217;s Dan Brown.  He&#8217;s known more for the controversy about what he writes than for how he writes.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t like Dan Brown&#8217;s writing.  I read the Da Vinci Code and though I thought it was gripping and exciting, it was also patronising and unbelievable.  I also read the first chapter of &#8220;Angels and Demons&#8221; and decided it was the SAME book!  I won&#8217;t mention Brown&#8217;s weird ideas about history and religion.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, though I approached the Northern Lights with scepticism due to the author&#8217;s reputation for bashing religion and the church, I&#8217;m thinking that Philip Pullman is an excellent author!<\/p>\n<p>I confess that I saw &#8220;The Golden Compass&#8221; &#8211; the film version of &#8220;The Northern Lights&#8221; &#8211; just before Christmas and before I read the book.  It was very much a children&#8217;s film, albeit quite a violent one, but an enjoyable romp with some imaginative scenery and special effects.  The &#8220;daemons&#8221; were entirely believable! Though I thought the compass effect was done about three times too many.<\/p>\n<p>I went to see the film with people who HAD read the book and they said that the book made much more sense.<\/p>\n<p>And it did.  Not only is Pullman an excellent author who provokes the imagination with enchanting descriptions and clever dialogue, he also spins a good yarn.  The world(s) he has created is large, varied and yet coherant.  He draws on reality but uses it flexibly to create somewhere of this world, possibly from another century, but also not of this world. <\/p>\n<p>Does he attack the church?  Well, I think so.  Somewhat.  He&#8217;s certainly very political and implies that the church has lots of influence on the state and indoctrinates children with it&#8217;s nasty ideas.  But he&#8217;s not attacking the church that I know.  I don&#8217;t know his background &#8211; maybe he has issues with the church &#8211; his own &#8220;demon&#8221;, if you like.  But I, as a member of The Church (meaning the body of people who follow Jesus Christ), didn&#8217;t feel particularly put out by it.  Plus, it&#8217;s allegorical, so, unlike the Da Vinci Code that presents itself as almost-factual, you&#8217;re free to see the church as being that of Pullman&#8217;s world, not of our own.<\/p>\n<p>The only REALLY weird thing was the Bible being translated into the context of Pullman&#8217;s world.  Oh, and his interpretation of it.  Most odd and made me feel slightly uneasy.<\/p>\n<p>The film and the book are a little out of synch.  Having seen film 1 and then read book 1 it will be interesting to read book 2 and THEN see film 2 to see how things progress.<\/p>\n<p>I found the book more grown up than the film &#8211; a better place for an adult to be.  I would sincerely hope that children would be reading it too!  The film &#8211; OK for kids but plain confusing for adults.<\/p>\n",

Yet I felt sad at the trashiness and commercialisation of it all.<\/li>\n<li>I had a fun and interesting day.  I had a long and tiring day.<\/li>\n<li>I could have stayed for many hours.  But I was kinda done and wanted to go home after two or three.<\/li>\n<li>There were some really neat and simple inventions for the outdoors enthusiast.  And there was Ford trying to sell big 4&#215;4&#8217;s.<\/li>\n<li>It was an outdoors show.  It was primarily indoors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>See what I mean?<\/p>\n<p>It was interesting to see how much was on offer.  Holidays, courses, bikes, canoes, volunteering, cars, careers, clothing, gadgets and so on.  I confess that we&#8217;re sucked in slightly to the commercial aspect, but we do also love the outdoors and there are plenty of people trying to make walking\/hiking\/cycling\/etc. accessible and take out some of the difficulties that the Joe Bloggs on the street might have.<\/p>\n<p>I enjoyed it.  But I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d have paid \u00a312 or \u00a316 quid to go + fuel + \u00a38 parking.  Maybe next year I&#8217;ll volunteer to help on the National Trust stand, get in for free, have a good couple of hours to look around and encourage people to give a little back to nature as well as just taking from it.<\/p>\n",

Yet I felt sad at the trashiness and commercialisation of it all.<\/li>\n<li>I had a fun and interesting day.  I had a long and tiring day.<\/li>\n<li>I could have stayed for many hours.  But I was kinda done and wanted to go home after two or three.<\/li>\n<li>There were some really neat and simple inventions for the outdoors enthusiast.  And there was Ford trying to sell big 4&#215;4&#8217;s.<\/li>\n<li>It was an outdoors show.  It was primarily indoors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>See what I mean?<\/p>\n<p>It was interesting to see how much was on offer.  Holidays, courses, bikes, canoes, volunteering, cars, careers, clothing, gadgets and so on.  I confess that we&#8217;re sucked in slightly to the commercial aspect, but we do also love the outdoors and there are plenty of people trying to make walking\/hiking\/cycling\/etc. accessible and take out some of the difficulties that the Joe Bloggs on the street might have.<\/p>\n<p>I enjoyed it.  But I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d have paid \u00a312 or \u00a316 quid to go + fuel + \u00a38 parking.  Maybe next year I&#8217;ll volunteer to help on the National Trust stand, get in for free, have a good couple of hours to look around and encourage people to give a little back to nature as well as just taking from it.<\/p>\n",

I also confess that I&#8217;m strangely prejudiced against Winehouse&#8217;s music because of what I hear about her in the news.<\/p>\n<p>I was surprised, therefore, to find myself thinking that her songs, music and voice were all very good.  Certainly not what I&#8217;d normally listen to, but pretty cool stuff none the less.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll maybe write more when I&#8217;ve heard the album some more.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler: Private Investigations &#8211; The Best Of<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Sally and I went to the cinema a while back and an advert for this &#8220;Best Of&#8221; came on.  At the end of the advert we turned to each other and at the same time said, sheepishly, &#8220;I&#8217;d quite like to get that&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>And so we have a classic Dad-rock album.  A load of tunes that we mostly already know really well but never realised were by Dire Straits.  Some awesome guitar solos, some classic lyrics, and a great variety of music too, from upbeat rock and roll through blues, to some lilting ballads, but all done with great style and a very high level of musical skill.<\/p>\n<p>Oddly, it gets boring quite quickly, but we&#8217;re glad to have it in our collection.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Newton Faulkner: Hand Built By Robots<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re not really very up-to-date with new band and artists.  For some reason that neihter of us could pin down, we  wanted to give Newton Faulkner a try.<\/p>\n<p>And we&#8217;re glad we did!<\/p>\n<p>Mostly low-key, bluesy, indie guitar music, there&#8217;s a lot of variety on this album.  It reminds me, at times, of plently of other artists &#8211; from the swinging accoustic guitar and laid-back melodies of Jack Johnson, to the cheeky pop-rap of Barenaked Ladies.<\/p>\n<p>The album meanders slightly and seems a bit aimless at times, but it&#8217;s a good, summery, feel-good pop record.<\/p>\n",

Certainly not what I&#8217;d normally listen to, but pretty cool stuff none the less.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll maybe write more when I&#8217;ve heard the album some more.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler: Private Investigations &#8211; The Best Of<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Sally and I went to the cinema a while back and an advert for this &#8220;Best Of&#8221; came on.  At the end of the advert we turned to each other and at the same time said, sheepishly, &#8220;I&#8217;d quite like to get that&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>And so we have a classic Dad-rock album.  A load of tunes that we mostly already know really well but never realised were by Dire Straits.  Some awesome guitar solos, some classic lyrics, and a great variety of music too, from upbeat rock and roll through blues, to some lilting ballads, but all done with great style and a very high level of musical skill.<\/p>\n<p>Oddly, it gets boring quite quickly, but we&#8217;re glad to have it in our collection.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Newton Faulkner: Hand Built By Robots<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re not really very up-to-date with new band and artists.  For some reason that neihter of us could pin down, we  wanted to give Newton Faulkner a try.<\/p>\n<p>And we&#8217;re glad we did!<\/p>\n<p>Mostly low-key, bluesy, indie guitar music, there&#8217;s a lot of variety on this album.  It reminds me, at times, of plently of other artists &#8211; from the swinging accoustic guitar and laid-back melodies of Jack Johnson, to the cheeky pop-rap of Barenaked Ladies.<\/p>\n<p>The album meanders slightly and seems a bit aimless at times, but it&#8217;s a good, summery, feel-good pop record.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>We saw the trailers for this film ages ago and, as we like Simon Pegg (of Spaced, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz), we thought it would be worth a bash.  But we totally missed it at the cinema.<\/p>\n<p>However, Sally&#8217;s borrowed it from a friend and so we sat down with a curry after a long, hard week, and watched it as light entertainment.<\/p>\n<p>It was a slight disappointment.  Pegg plays a security guard who&#8217;s low in self esteem and fitness.  It&#8217;s 5 years since he chickened out of marrying his pregnant girlfriend and ran off and he&#8217;s trying to get her back.  But she&#8217;s found anther man.  And so the fight is on.<\/p>\n<p>Pegg&#8217;s character trys to redeem himself, and find himself, through running.  The ex&#8217;s boyfriend is running a marathon and Pegg promises lots of people that he will run it.  He has three weeks to go from being able to run half way up the street, to being able to run 26 miles.  Not likely.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t tell you if he makes it (no spoilers here!).  But the file was vaguely entertaining &#8211; Pegg and his fellow actors are high on physical comedy and that alone carried the film for me.  But it was sorely disappointing in other places.  The plot was cheesy and the script pretty awful &#8211; though there were some nice scenes and certain themes that ran through the film worked well.  I felt I should have been more emotionally involved with the characters than I was &#8211; perhaps the comedy got in the way of that.  I didn&#8217;t notice bad acting or direction so maybe it wasn&#8217;t there, but there was nothing startling either.  Oh, and the product placement was pretty blatent!  Grrr.<\/p>\n<p>So, all in all, a mildly funny and entertaining rom-com (the &#8220;run-com&#8221; pun doesn&#8217;t <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">quite<\/span> work), but definitely not Pegg&#8217;s best.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>We saw the trailers for this film ages ago and, as we like Simon Pegg (of Spaced, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz), we thought it would be worth a bash.  But we totally missed it at the cinema.<\/p>\n<p>However, Sally&#8217;s borrowed it from a friend and so we sat down with a curry after a long, hard week, and watched it as light entertainment.<\/p>\n<p>It was a slight disappointment.  Pegg plays a security guard who&#8217;s low in self esteem and fitness.  It&#8217;s 5 years since he chickened out of marrying his pregnant girlfriend and ran off and he&#8217;s trying to get her back.  But she&#8217;s found anther man.  And so the fight is on.<\/p>\n<p>Pegg&#8217;s character trys to redeem himself, and find himself, through running.  The ex&#8217;s boyfriend is running a marathon and Pegg promises lots of people that he will run it.  He has three weeks to go from being able to run half way up the street, to being able to run 26 miles.  Not likely.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t tell you if he makes it (no spoilers here!).  But the file was vaguely entertaining &#8211; Pegg and his fellow actors are high on physical comedy and that alone carried the film for me.  But it was sorely disappointing in other places.  The plot was cheesy and the script pretty awful &#8211; though there were some nice scenes and certain themes that ran through the film worked well.  I felt I should have been more emotionally involved with the characters than I was &#8211; perhaps the comedy got in the way of that.  I didn&#8217;t notice bad acting or direction so maybe it wasn&#8217;t there, but there was nothing startling either.  Oh, and the product placement was pretty blatent!  Grrr.<\/p>\n<p>So, all in all, a mildly funny and entertaining rom-com (the &#8220;run-com&#8221; pun doesn&#8217;t <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">quite<\/span> work), but definitely not Pegg&#8217;s best.<\/p>\n",

Singing and playing this song at the same time is really hard.  So I know all the words, and I know all the music, but I can&#8217;t do both at the same time!<\/p>\n<p>Last week was Song 8 and I had a go at learning The Monkees &#8220;Daydream Believer&#8221;.  Another piece that I know all the words to already and so it should just be a case of committing the chords to memory, but again, rhythm got me stuck.  This really isn&#8217;t a guitar song&#8230;at least, not without some major re-arrangement.  So I gave up quite quickly.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve even memorised the chords.  Consider this dropped from the list!<\/p>\n<p>And so I approached song 9.  Leornard Cohen&#8217;s &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221;, which has been covered by many people in many different ways.  I&#8217;m attempting a fairly standard take of it on the accoustic guitar.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been simultaneously looking forward to and dreading this one.  When I mentioned it to Sally she expressed some doubt about it &#8211; it sounded to her like quite a complicated piece.  But I reckoned the chords weren&#8217;t too difficult (I&#8217;m sufficiently musical that I can tell a complicated chord sequence).  But any song that&#8217;s really a melancholy piano piece that will have to be carefully picked on the guitar is gonna be a bit hard.<\/p>\n<p>So I was delighted to find it not all that hard at all.  OK, so I don&#8217;t do it justice &#8211; it&#8217;s a beautiful song and I play it clumsily &#8211; but I can play C, F, G, Em and Am, and get between them, pretty OK.  I&#8217;ve still got some words to learn but most of them are there.  And it&#8217;s been a real joy to do.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m away on holiday next week so the next song may have to wait.  I&#8217;m well behind but have nearly 10 under my belt.  That&#8217;s 10 songs more than I knew by heart three months ago!  Yay!<\/p>\n",

Singing and playing this song at the same time is really hard.  So I know all the words, and I know all the music, but I can&#8217;t do both at the same time!<\/p>\n<p>Last week was Song 8 and I had a go at learning The Monkees &#8220;Daydream Believer&#8221;.  Another piece that I know all the words to already and so it should just be a case of committing the chords to memory, but again, rhythm got me stuck.  This really isn&#8217;t a guitar song&#8230;at least, not without some major re-arrangement.  So I gave up quite quickly.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve even memorised the chords.  Consider this dropped from the list!<\/p>\n<p>And so I approached song 9.  Leornard Cohen&#8217;s &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221;, which has been covered by many people in many different ways.  I&#8217;m attempting a fairly standard take of it on the accoustic guitar.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been simultaneously looking forward to and dreading this one.  When I mentioned it to Sally she expressed some doubt about it &#8211; it sounded to her like quite a complicated piece.  But I reckoned the chords weren&#8217;t too difficult (I&#8217;m sufficiently musical that I can tell a complicated chord sequence).  But any song that&#8217;s really a melancholy piano piece that will have to be carefully picked on the guitar is gonna be a bit hard.<\/p>\n<p>So I was delighted to find it not all that hard at all.  OK, so I don&#8217;t do it justice &#8211; it&#8217;s a beautiful song and I play it clumsily &#8211; but I can play C, F, G, Em and Am, and get between them, pretty OK.  I&#8217;ve still got some words to learn but most of them are there.  And it&#8217;s been a real joy to do.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m away on holiday next week so the next song may have to wait.  I&#8217;m well behind but have nearly 10 under my belt.  That&#8217;s 10 songs more than I knew by heart three months ago!  Yay!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>It&#8217;s been a while and we&#8217;re off on holiday tomorrow so here&#8217;s a few thoughts to jot down before I go.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Easter and &#8220;The Passion&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s Easter Sunday.  Easter is obviously a hijacked pagan festival &#8211; witness the eggs and bunnies that symbolise new life as spring approaches &#8211; heck the date of easter even changes with the lunar cycle!  But, regardless of that, this is the time when Christians celebrate that Jesus rose from the dead and brought us a new and different sort of life.  God has forgiven us of the wrong we&#8217;ve done and we can follow Jesus in faith knowing that he died and was brought back from the dead to live forever.  I join with the many today who shout &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221; &#8211; Praise the Lord!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a good time of reflecting on what Jesus did and why it means so much to us.  It<br \/>saddens me that people have so little understanding of the man at the centre of the Christian faith.  I&#8217;m not the sort to ram it down people throats, but if they ask I&#8217;ll happily explain, and highly recommend, my faith, that I have come to see as the truth.  But the<br \/>occasions to explain to people are sadly limited, even at this time of the year.<\/p>\n<p>Encouragingly, this year, the BBC has done a screening of a 4-part film of &#8220;The Passion&#8221; &#8211; the events of the last few days of Jesus&#8217; life.  This has been very interesting to watch.  Many have tried to interpret the events in their own ways down the years.  I like the BBC&#8217;s attempt.  It feels quite real and give you a good sense of what Jerusalem was like at the time, and some insight into why certain people may have done what they did on that first Easter.   What it lacked for me was a spiritual element &#8211; little prayer, no angels, no miracles, no fear of God.  I thought the  pharisees more interested in what was going on that then disciples.  It felt earthly, lacking a heavenly God.  A tale told, but somehow lacking the essence of what was really going on.  A political revolution was definitely going on, but the &#8220;kingdom of God&#8221; seemed relegated to little more than a nice-to-have desire of the heart.  I think it lacked&#8230;well&#8230;passion!<\/p>\n<p>But good on the Beeb for showing such a thing.  And don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; it was a REALLY good re-enactment of what happened &#8211; captivating and compelling.  It was just very non-committal too.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and there seems to have been a lot of chocolate around.  Not sure what that&#8217;s about.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Small Group Leading<\/p>\n<p><\/span><span>I attend a thing called a &#8220;Small Group&#8221;.  This is a group of about 10 people from church who meet during the week to chat, pray, study the bible and share news together.  Small groups are an important part of church life as they enable people to connect and meet in God&#8217;s presence in a deeper way than you can in a larger group on the Sunday.<\/p>\n<p>This week I led the group in a study.  It was the first time I&#8217;d done this for a long time and it seemed to go down well, but I&#8217;m not entirely sure.  It&#8217;s always hard to judge how these things look from the other side.  I really enjoy preparing and leading groups like this and I hope I&#8217;ll get to do it again.<br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/>Garden<\/span><\/p>\n<p>With 3 days off before our trip away, we were meant to be gardening.  Both digging and planting.  But the weather&#8217;s been AWFUL.  Snow, sleet, hail, rain, gales, freezing temperatures.  So that&#8217;ll have to wait. Longer days are coming so I suspect some evening digging may be required.  We&#8217;ve not planted a thing yet and only have a small patch of weedless garden.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">House<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So instead we&#8217;ve been concentrating on the house.  Sally&#8217;s a star with painting and has made great progress on the dining room.  We&#8217;ve committed quite a lot of the last couple of days to tidying up the edges and we&#8217;re VERY nearly done.  Here&#8217;s the before and after:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-a01UKeIXI\/AAAAAAAAB44\/mpaIwdDVJmc\/s1600-h\/IMG_0035.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-a01UKeIXI\/AAAAAAAAB44\/mpaIwdDVJmc\/s400\/IMG_0035.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-a1P0KeIYI\/AAAAAAAAB5A\/nMnvumVdO0o\/s1600-h\/IMG_0415.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-a1P0KeIYI\/AAAAAAAAB5A\/nMnvumVdO0o\/s400\/IMG_0415.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>As well as painting we&#8217;ve also put up another nice light.  I confess, I thought this was a bit over the top for the small room, but Sally loves it and it is a beautiful thing and we got it for half price.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-bGlUKeIZI\/AAAAAAAAB5I\/oE0l1b0x_I8\/s1600-h\/IMG_0411.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;cursor:pointer;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-bGlUKeIZI\/AAAAAAAAB5I\/oE0l1b0x_I8\/s320\/IMG_0411.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>Wiring the new light in was interesting (as are most thing involving the electrics in our house).  We have &#8220;loop in&#8221; wiring, so three cables come in from the ceiling; power in, power out, and the loop to the switch.  This makes for a complicated bit of wiring to get the light connected up.  However, in this fitting, the live and neutrals seemed to be wired backwards.  All the black cables were where the reds should be, and vice versa.  A quick chat with my dad and a few diagrams later and it appeared to be safe.  After all, the previous fitting worked!<\/p>\n<p>It seems that normally you have the three live wires tied together with power coming back from the switch to the light on the &#8220;spare&#8221; neutral cable.  In our case, we had the three neutrals tied together with the spare live coming back from the switch.  From a &#8220;logical&#8221; circuit point of view this means that the switch is on the neutral side of the light, rather than the live.  There was no reason why it shouldn&#8217;t work.  And, indeed, it does!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I should be more scared of electricals than I am.  I&#8217;ll get a nasty shock one day.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Rats!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Darn it.  The rats are back.  We&#8217;ve heard vague scratchings recently and dismissed it, but they were definitely up there last night.  I can only see one little hole outside that they might be getting in.  We&#8217;ve put fresh poison down and some proper rat traps in the loft.  Grrr&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Cycling<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Not much going on on the cycling front.  I&#8217;ve been doing longer trips into work and back and generally enjoying being out on the Felt.  Both bikes need a good clean which I was hoping to do this weekend and haven&#8217;t got around too.  Oh, and I had to replace another spoke on the Raleigh.  Not sure how this one broke but fixing it was easy having done it before.<\/p>\n<p>Had other transport problems too when the car started spluttering a bit on the way back from the outdoors show.  Kwik Fit fixed it with a new clamp on the exhaust &#8211; the existing one had come loose.  They charged me \u00a32.  Bargain!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Other Developments<\/span><\/p>\n<p>There are some other interesting developments going on that I can&#8217;t really talk about too.  These are very much connected to our spiritual and church life and involve some interesting changes that are going on around us.  Some of this is stuff that we thing God has been telling us might happen in some way over the last year so it&#8217;s very exciting seeing how that might come to fruition.  Please, if anyone&#8217;s reading, don&#8217;t ask us any questions because we can&#8217;t answer them.  I probably shouldn&#8217;t even be putting the teaser out.<\/p>\n<p>More will be apparent in the coming months, I hope!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Holiday<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And so to probably our most anticipated holiday so far.  We&#8217;re only going to York and the Lake Distri<br \/>\nct, but we&#8217;ve both had such a hard few weeks at work that we REALLY need it.  We&#8217;re looking forward to our first bit of fell walking on our own (how will we get on without a more experienced guide?), and we&#8217;ll hopefully have a rest in there too.<\/p>\n<p>I will probably be quiet for a few days, both Blog and Twitter-wise.  Back with some photos on Saturday!<\/p>\n",

        "title": "General Easter Update",
        "content": "<p>It&#8217;s been a while and we&#8217;re off on holiday tomorrow so here&#8217;s a few thoughts to jot down before I go.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Easter and &#8220;The Passion&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s Easter Sunday.  Easter is obviously a hijacked pagan festival &#8211; witness the eggs and bunnies that symbolise new life as spring approaches &#8211; heck the date of easter even changes with the lunar cycle!  But, regardless of that, this is the time when Christians celebrate that Jesus rose from the dead and brought us a new and different sort of life.  God has forgiven us of the wrong we&#8217;ve done and we can follow Jesus in faith knowing that he died and was brought back from the dead to live forever.  I join with the many today who shout &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221; &#8211; Praise the Lord!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a good time of reflecting on what Jesus did and why it means so much to us.  It<br \/>saddens me that people have so little understanding of the man at the centre of the Christian faith.  I&#8217;m not the sort to ram it down people throats, but if they ask I&#8217;ll happily explain, and highly recommend, my faith, that I have come to see as the truth.  But the<br \/>occasions to explain to people are sadly limited, even at this time of the year.<\/p>\n<p>Encouragingly, this year, the BBC has done a screening of a 4-part film of &#8220;The Passion&#8221; &#8211; the events of the last few days of Jesus&#8217; life.  This has been very interesting to watch.  Many have tried to interpret the events in their own ways down the years.  I like the BBC&#8217;s attempt.  It feels quite real and give you a good sense of what Jerusalem was like at the time, and some insight into why certain people may have done what they did on that first Easter.   What it lacked for me was a spiritual element &#8211; little prayer, no angels, no miracles, no fear of God.  I thought the  pharisees more interested in what was going on that then disciples.  It felt earthly, lacking a heavenly God.  A tale told, but somehow lacking the essence of what was really going on.  A political revolution was definitely going on, but the &#8220;kingdom of God&#8221; seemed relegated to little more than a nice-to-have desire of the heart.  I think it lacked&#8230;well&#8230;passion!<\/p>\n<p>But good on the Beeb for showing such a thing.  And don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; it was a REALLY good re-enactment of what happened &#8211; captivating and compelling.  It was just very non-committal too.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and there seems to have been a lot of chocolate around.  Not sure what that&#8217;s about.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Small Group Leading<\/p>\n<p><\/span><span>I attend a thing called a &#8220;Small Group&#8221;.  This is a group of about 10 people from church who meet during the week to chat, pray, study the bible and share news together.  Small groups are an important part of church life as they enable people to connect and meet in God&#8217;s presence in a deeper way than you can in a larger group on the Sunday.<\/p>\n<p>This week I led the group in a study.  It was the first time I&#8217;d done this for a long time and it seemed to go down well, but I&#8217;m not entirely sure.  It&#8217;s always hard to judge how these things look from the other side.  I really enjoy preparing and leading groups like this and I hope I&#8217;ll get to do it again.<br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/>Garden<\/span><\/p>\n<p>With 3 days off before our trip away, we were meant to be gardening.  Both digging and planting.  But the weather&#8217;s been AWFUL.  Snow, sleet, hail, rain, gales, freezing temperatures.  So that&#8217;ll have to wait. Longer days are coming so I suspect some evening digging may be required.  We&#8217;ve not planted a thing yet and only have a small patch of weedless garden.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">House<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So instead we&#8217;ve been concentrating on the house.  Sally&#8217;s a star with painting and has made great progress on the dining room.  We&#8217;ve committed quite a lot of the last couple of days to tidying up the edges and we&#8217;re VERY nearly done.  Here&#8217;s the before and after:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-a01UKeIXI\/AAAAAAAAB44\/mpaIwdDVJmc\/s1600-h\/IMG_0035.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-a01UKeIXI\/AAAAAAAAB44\/mpaIwdDVJmc\/s400\/IMG_0035.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-a1P0KeIYI\/AAAAAAAAB5A\/nMnvumVdO0o\/s1600-h\/IMG_0415.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-a1P0KeIYI\/AAAAAAAAB5A\/nMnvumVdO0o\/s400\/IMG_0415.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>As well as painting we&#8217;ve also put up another nice light.  I confess, I thought this was a bit over the top for the small room, but Sally loves it and it is a beautiful thing and we got it for half price.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-bGlUKeIZI\/AAAAAAAAB5I\/oE0l1b0x_I8\/s1600-h\/IMG_0411.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;cursor:pointer;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-bGlUKeIZI\/AAAAAAAAB5I\/oE0l1b0x_I8\/s320\/IMG_0411.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>Wiring the new light in was interesting (as are most thing involving the electrics in our house).  We have &#8220;loop in&#8221; wiring, so three cables come in from the ceiling; power in, power out, and the loop to the switch.  This makes for a complicated bit of wiring to get the light connected up.  However, in this fitting, the live and neutrals seemed to be wired backwards.  All the black cables were where the reds should be, and vice versa.  A quick chat with my dad and a few diagrams later and it appeared to be safe.  After all, the previous fitting worked!<\/p>\n<p>It seems that normally you have the three live wires tied together with power coming back from the switch to the light on the &#8220;spare&#8221; neutral cable.  In our case, we had the three neutrals tied together with the spare live coming back from the switch.  From a &#8220;logical&#8221; circuit point of view this means that the switch is on the neutral side of the light, rather than the live.  There was no reason why it shouldn&#8217;t work.  And, indeed, it does!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I should be more scared of electricals than I am.  I&#8217;ll get a nasty shock one day.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Rats!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Darn it.  The rats are back.  We&#8217;ve heard vague scratchings recently and dismissed it, but they were definitely up there last night.  I can only see one little hole outside that they might be getting in.  We&#8217;ve put fresh poison down and some proper rat traps in the loft.  Grrr&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Cycling<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Not much going on on the cycling front.  I&#8217;ve been doing longer trips into work and back and generally enjoying being out on the Felt.  Both bikes need a good clean which I was hoping to do this weekend and haven&#8217;t got around too.  Oh, and I had to replace another spoke on the Raleigh.  Not sure how this one broke but fixing it was easy having done it before.<\/p>\n<p>Had other transport problems too when the car started spluttering a bit on the way back from the outdoors show.  Kwik Fit fixed it with a new clamp on the exhaust &#8211; the existing one had come loose.  They charged me \u00a32.  Bargain!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Other Developments<\/span><\/p>\n<p>There are some other interesting developments going on that I can&#8217;t really talk about too.  These are very much connected to our spiritual and church life and involve some interesting changes that are going on around us.  Some of this is stuff that we thing God has been telling us might happen in some way over the last year so it&#8217;s very exciting seeing how that might come to fruition.  Please, if anyone&#8217;s reading, don&#8217;t ask us any questions because we can&#8217;t answer them.  I probably shouldn&#8217;t even be putting the teaser out.<\/p>\n<p>More will be apparent in the coming months, I hope!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Holiday<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And so to probably our most anticipated holiday so far.  We&#8217;re only going to York and the Lake Distri<br \/>\nct, but we&#8217;ve both had such a hard few weeks at work that we REALLY need it.  We&#8217;re looking forward to our first bit of fell walking on our own (how will we get on without a more experienced guide?), and we&#8217;ll hopefully have a rest in there too.<\/p>\n<p>I will probably be quiet for a few days, both Blog and Twitter-wise.  Back with some photos on Saturday!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>I&#8217;m beind with updates again, including a big write up of our holiday exploits.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a busy week, and with a 15 hour day at work on Wednesday, I was due a few late morning in, so I&#8217;ve been making use of my longer, 8.5 mile commute to work.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had two little incidents that are worth writing up.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday I did something a bit silly.  I was frustrated following a tractor that was doing about 12mph on a single track road.  It&#8217;s was slightly downhill and the wind was behind me so I should have been able to do a steady 25mph, if not more.  There were three cars backed up behind it and I was following behind them.  I saw that the road was getting a bit wider, so I nipped up the outside of the cars and went for it to get past the tractor.<\/p>\n<p>It was only when I pulled alongside that I noticed the road wasn&#8217;t too good at the edges.  So here I am, on the road bike, riding over rough and unpredictable ground, with a great big tractor about 4 feet to my left.<\/p>\n<p>It seemed like a good idea at the time, but looking back on it I really scared myself.  One wrong move and I was under a tractor wheel.  I&#8217;ll be more careful next time.<\/p>\n<p>So if Thursday&#8217;s ride in had something that could have damaged me physically, today&#8217;s ride home presented an overtaking opportunity that could have dented my pride.  I read an article a while ago (that I can&#8217;t find now) about overtaking, and how you need to be careful &#8216;cos if the person you pass is better than you they&#8217;ll hunt you down and get you back &#8211; to your shame!<\/p>\n<p>And so, a mile or so into my 5.5 miles home, I catch up with a woman on a road bike.  She has pretty strong looking legs, a nice bike with a ridiculously small cassette (that&#8217;s the rear gears), some semi-pro-looking, sponsored bike wear and jersey pockets stuffed full of stuff.  All of which says &#8220;I&#8217;m on a long ride and quite capable of outpacing you for a long time&#8221;.  But she was doing about 15mph up a slight incline &#8211; where I&#8217;d be doing 19 or 20!<\/p>\n<p>What do you?  Is it polite to breeze past in my relatively-amateur-looking gear on my commute home?  It seems like an insult.  And if I do pass is she going to hunt me down and breeze effortlessly past me shouting that I should try harder?  Should I wave?  Say &#8220;hi&#8221;?  Ring my bell?  All compounded by that fact that she&#8217;s a woman and any form of communication could be misinterpreted.<\/p>\n<p>AARRGHH!!!!!<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, just like with the tractor, I decided to go for it.  I sped up.  I got past.  I maintained my extra pace for as long as my tired legs would let me.   I looked back.  And she was nowhere to be seen.<\/p>\n<p>Result!<\/p>\n<p>In fact, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/news\/article\/humour-a-passing-score-12522\">FatCyclist&#8217;s overtaking point system<\/a> I reckon I got 6 points for passing one cyclist!  Though I&#8217;m not sure if the shaved legs points count for a woman.<\/p>\n<p>So, body and pride intact after 2 risky manoeuvres &#8211; it&#8217;s been a good week&#8217;s cycling!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;m beind with updates again, including a big write up of our holiday exploits.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a busy week, and with a 15 hour day at work on Wednesday, I was due a few late morning in, so I&#8217;ve been making use of my longer, 8.5 mile commute to work.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had two little incidents that are worth writing up.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday I did something a bit silly.  I was frustrated following a tractor that was doing about 12mph on a single track road.  It&#8217;s was slightly downhill and the wind was behind me so I should have been able to do a steady 25mph, if not more.  There were three cars backed up behind it and I was following behind them.  I saw that the road was getting a bit wider, so I nipped up the outside of the cars and went for it to get past the tractor.<\/p>\n<p>It was only when I pulled alongside that I noticed the road wasn&#8217;t too good at the edges.  So here I am, on the road bike, riding over rough and unpredictable ground, with a great big tractor about 4 feet to my left.<\/p>\n<p>It seemed like a good idea at the time, but looking back on it I really scared myself.  One wrong move and I was under a tractor wheel.  I&#8217;ll be more careful next time.<\/p>\n<p>So if Thursday&#8217;s ride in had something that could have damaged me physically, today&#8217;s ride home presented an overtaking opportunity that could have dented my pride.  I read an article a while ago (that I can&#8217;t find now) about overtaking, and how you need to be careful &#8216;cos if the person you pass is better than you they&#8217;ll hunt you down and get you back &#8211; to your shame!<\/p>\n<p>And so, a mile or so into my 5.5 miles home, I catch up with a woman on a road bike.  She has pretty strong looking legs, a nice bike with a ridiculously small cassette (that&#8217;s the rear gears), some semi-pro-looking, sponsored bike wear and jersey pockets stuffed full of stuff.  All of which says &#8220;I&#8217;m on a long ride and quite capable of outpacing you for a long time&#8221;.  But she was doing about 15mph up a slight incline &#8211; where I&#8217;d be doing 19 or 20!<\/p>\n<p>What do you?  Is it polite to breeze past in my relatively-amateur-looking gear on my commute home?  It seems like an insult.  And if I do pass is she going to hunt me down and breeze effortlessly past me shouting that I should try harder?  Should I wave?  Say &#8220;hi&#8221;?  Ring my bell?  All compounded by that fact that she&#8217;s a woman and any form of communication could be misinterpreted.<\/p>\n<p>AARRGHH!!!!!<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, just like with the tractor, I decided to go for it.  I sped up.  I got past.  I maintained my extra pace for as long as my tired legs would let me.   I looked back.  And she was nowhere to be seen.<\/p>\n<p>Result!<\/p>\n<p>In fact, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/news\/article\/humour-a-passing-score-12522\">FatCyclist&#8217;s overtaking point system<\/a> I reckon I got 6 points for passing one cyclist!  Though I&#8217;m not sure if the shaved legs points count for a woman.<\/p>\n<p>So, body and pride intact after 2 risky manoeuvres &#8211; it&#8217;s been a good week&#8217;s cycling!<\/p>\n",

I don&#8217;t hate it, but I mostly buy things because I need them.  And when I buy things that I want they&#8217;re well thought out and researched so that I buy the right thing at the right price.  This means that I don&#8217;t so much buying of things that I want.<\/p>\n<p>But with us getting into the outdoors, I&#8217;ve been finding myself a bit of a shopaholic.<\/p>\n<p>On our recent holiday we were in this little town called Grasmere, which is ALL set up as a tourist place for people who like the outdoors.  Therefore, there are lots of outdoors shops.  We also had a little trip to the Outdoors Show at the NEC which had lots of outdoors shops.<\/p>\n<p>The thing about outdoors shops is that they&#8217;re full of things that are well designed, functional, clever, and mostly with some element of cool too.<\/p>\n<p>I find myself in awe of all these things.  I don&#8217;t really do &#8220;pretty&#8221; clothes, but if it keeps you cool,  dry or stops the wind chill getting in, if it dries quickly, protects you from the sun, becomes a different article of clothing (convertible trousers!), makes you seen in the dark, weighs less, takes up less space in your luggage, washes at 30 degrees or gives you superhuman powers then it&#8217;s on my list!<\/p>\n<p>Seriously, I could spend a lot of money in these places.  And it bothers me.<\/p>\n",

This means that I don&#8217;t so much buying of things that I want.<\/p>\n<p>But with us getting into the outdoors, I&#8217;ve been finding myself a bit of a shopaholic.<\/p>\n<p>On our recent holiday we were in this little town called Grasmere, which is ALL set up as a tourist place for people who like the outdoors.  Therefore, there are lots of outdoors shops.  We also had a little trip to the Outdoors Show at the NEC which had lots of outdoors shops.<\/p>\n<p>The thing about outdoors shops is that they&#8217;re full of things that are well designed, functional, clever, and mostly with some element of cool too.<\/p>\n<p>I find myself in awe of all these things.  I don&#8217;t really do &#8220;pretty&#8221; clothes, but if it keeps you cool,  dry or stops the wind chill getting in, if it dries quickly, protects you from the sun, becomes a different article of clothing (convertible trousers!), makes you seen in the dark, weighs less, takes up less space in your luggage, washes at 30 degrees or gives you superhuman powers then it&#8217;s on my list!<\/p>\n<p>Seriously, I could spend a lot of money in these places.  And it bothers me.<\/p>\n",

I read books and magazines.  And when it came to getting Fuzzy home I generally thought I knew what I was doing&#8230;and I was well prepared for a LOT of time and effort doing maintenance.<\/p>\n<p>My first few rides, having fallen off, were tentative, and followed by a close inspection of parts.  But as time has gone on I&#8217;ve become less precious and Fuzzy&#8217;s not had much maintenance for a while now.<\/p>\n<p>I kinda feel bad about this.  But also, he doesn&#8217;t really need it!  He&#8217;s a bit grubby, but he&#8217;s well lubricated, the brakes are still strong and the transmission is smooth as silk still.<\/p>\n<p>The key, it seems, it making sure he&#8217;s looked after when he&#8217;s wet.  The books and forums all said to pay lots of attention to the chain, and to wipe down when you&#8217;ve been out in the rain.  And sure enough, this seems to have kept the bike in good nick.<\/p>\n<p>I really MUST spend some time doing some proper cleaning and maintenance at some point but for now it seems that little and often is the key, and it&#8217;s much less work than I thought it would be.<\/p>\n",
