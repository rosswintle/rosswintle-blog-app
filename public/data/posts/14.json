                "rendered": "\n<p>I\u2019ve been thinking about technical goals for 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I currently mostly write PHP with both WordPress and Laravel and associated HTML, CSS and bits of JavaScript enhancement, including Vue.js and I\u2019ve been trying to learn React too, without quite getting there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m trying to #LearnToLoveJS, rather than Learn JavaScript Deeply as the WordPress world is trying to do. Unfortunately this isn\u2019t quite working out as I had hoped: I feel like I\u2019m making progress with deeper JavaScript knowledge, but not so much with the enjoyment\/loving it aspect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Learn to love TypeScript, or learn it Deeply, or something?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So I\u2019ve been wondering about TypeScript and actually installing it and reading through the docs and tutorials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trouble with TypeScript is that it\u2019s a departure from the norm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like the small-to-medium-sized projects that I work on to be easily-hand-on-able.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another developer picking up one of my projects should not have to learn something that they don\u2019t know. The build process and tool-chain should be simple and well-documented (confession: the latter is not always true, for which I apologise to both other dev\u2019s and my future self).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And TypeScript would add another dependency both into the tool-chain and the required knowledge to take on a project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;I wonder if another goal of 2019 is to take on more projects that are more bespoke, more self-contained and less likely to be handed on to other devs. More projects where I am the dev and I make the technical choices and I\u2019m unashamed about picking the right tool for me to accomplish the task with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Go, Go, Go!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a real hankering to learn Go. I don\u2019t know how that will happen, but from what I\u2019ve heard it seems like a language I would enjoy working with. Compilation with compile-time static analysis. Strongly typed. Multi-threaded. There are all Good Things for a grumpy, old-school dev like me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what would I do with it? I don\u2019t work on the kind of projects where Go would be a viable technology choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But again&#8230;maybe I should. Maybe this is where I should be positioning myself this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can you select technology choices before positioning yourself for work?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Or should it happen the other way around? I suspect a bit of both is required. You won\u2019t win the kinds of work you want until you show capability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe that\u2019s the goal for this year &#8211; demonstrate capability for more of this kind of work and see what happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m pretty firmly entrenched in WordPress world. And I\u2019d like that to continue somewhat. So I SHOULD be learning Gutenberg and Blocks and React. But the reasons for not wanting to do that are&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;the subject of another post probably.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I\u2019ve been thinking about technical goals for 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I currently mostly write PHP with both WordPress and Laravel and associated HTML, CSS and bits of JavaScript enhancement, including Vue.js and I\u2019ve been trying to learn React too, without quite getting there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m trying to #LearnToLoveJS, rather than Learn JavaScript Deeply as the WordPress world is trying to do. Unfortunately this isn\u2019t quite working out as I had hoped: I feel like I\u2019m making progress with deeper JavaScript knowledge, but not so much with the enjoyment\/loving it aspect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Learn to love TypeScript, or learn it Deeply, or something?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So I\u2019ve been wondering about TypeScript and actually installing it and reading through the docs and tutorials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trouble with TypeScript is that it\u2019s a departure from the norm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like the small-to-medium-sized projects that I work on to be easily-hand-on-able.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another developer picking up one of my projects should not have to learn something that they don\u2019t know. The build process and tool-chain should be simple and well-documented (confession: the latter is not always true, for which I apologise to both other dev\u2019s and my future self).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And TypeScript would add another dependency both into the tool-chain and the required knowledge to take on a project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;I wonder if another goal of 2019 is to take on more projects that are more bespoke, more self-contained and less likely to be handed on to other devs. More projects where I am the dev and I make the technical choices and I\u2019m unashamed about picking the right tool for me to accomplish the task with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Go, Go, Go!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a real hankering to learn Go. I don\u2019t know how that will happen, but from what I\u2019ve heard it seems like a language I would enjoy working with. Compilation with compile-time static analysis. Strongly typed. Multi-threaded. There are all Good Things for a grumpy, old-school dev like me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what would I do with it? I don\u2019t work on the kind of projects where Go would be a viable technology choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But again&#8230;maybe I should. Maybe this is where I should be positioning myself this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can you select technology choices before positioning yourself for work?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Or should it happen the other way around? I suspect a bit of both is required. You won\u2019t win the kinds of work you want until you show capability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe that\u2019s the goal for this year &#8211; demonstrate capability for more of this kind of work and see what happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m pretty firmly entrenched in WordPress world. And I\u2019d like that to continue somewhat. So I SHOULD be learning Gutenberg and Blocks and React. But the reasons for not wanting to do that are&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;the subject of another post probably.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "Refactoring UI"
            },
            "content": {
                "rendered": "\n<p>As a developer who finds design really hard, I was very much looking forward to the release of Steve Schoger and Adam Wathan&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/refactoringui.com\/book\/\">Refactoring UI<\/a>&#8221; book and kit of resources. Here&#8217;s some thoughts on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: I&#8217;m writing my thoughts in the order I had them. The positive stuff comes later!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Price<br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I heard the quote recently that &#8220;If people complain about the price, you&#8217;re doing it right&#8221;, and I confess, I complained about the price, so maybe they did price it right. I&#8217;d prepared myself for it to be 3 or 4 times the cost of an expensive book. But they priced it at $249 for the digital version of the book (not a physical book!) with all the resources! Yes, there&#8217;s a launch discount of 50%, but even so, this half-priced version was expensive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I get the arguments that a lot of experience and knowledge is in here, and a lot of work has been put in to make it a thing. And I get the argument that this will save me time, and it only has to save me a few hours to pay for itself. But actually, I think owning this book won&#8217;t save me time; it will make me do better design work and spend longer on it! Which is fine. As long as someone wants that and is paying me for it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also can&#8217;t help thinking that if this was half the price then they&#8217;d sell twice as many copies, make just as much money and share their knowledge more widely. And isn&#8217;t this the point of making such a resource: to share your knowledge with people?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A could of years back I&#8217;d been disappointed by Adam&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/adamwathan.me\/refactoring-to-collections\/\">Refactoring to Collections<\/a>&#8221; book which I thought wasn&#8217;t worth the money, and the provided videos in particular weren&#8217;t useful at all. So I was skeptical that this book&#8217;s extra resources would be helpful too &#8211; maybe I should just buy the basic package with the book?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But persuaded by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fullstackradio.com\/103\">Full Stack Radio podcast<\/a> that detailed exactly what was in it, I eventually bit and bought the full Refactoring UI kit.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Format<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from it being a digital-only book, it was PDF format. And I get that they&#8217;ve spent time laying it out and typesetting it, but PDF&#8217;s are still not my favourite eBook format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re also selling it on Gumroad and the Gumroad reader seems to display PDFs at low quality. I&#8217;ve seen complaints on Twitter about the PDF quality and if you download it and open it locally it&#8217;s fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More annoying though is that the component library, colour schemes and font selections are all also in PDF form. Which is annoying because the ability to copy\/paste stuff out of here, see the code, and tinker with it in the browser would have been great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Material\/Content<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, so here&#8217;s the good stuff. Because I&#8217;m not a designer, I can&#8217;t see visual stuff in my head or produce &#8220;nice looking stuff&#8221; out of thin air, I&#8217;m pretty dependent on rules and copying other people&#8217;s ideas to make things I make for the web look nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the book here really delivers. Strategic, rule-based design tips that really suit someone like me. It&#8217;s presented in a really easily digestible format, and has LOADS of very-well-put-together real-life examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see the amount of work that has gone into this in creating the fictional-but-real-looking designs that illustrate the points being made. They&#8217;re done a really great job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s great stuff, well presented, and reading it WILL change my work for the better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I want exercises!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, as well as wanting the component library and things in code, I think it would really benefit from some exercises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The videos are great at explaining the concepts and showing how to transform a bad design into a good one. But I really want to have a go at this myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some exercises a bit like Wes Bos&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/javascript30.com\/\">JavaScript 30<\/a> course would be an amazing addition. Give me the video, the starting design\/code and the ending design\/code, and let me see if I can make some of the changes myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading and watching is all well and good, but I&#8217;m only going to build up the skills and get them into my &#8220;muscle memory&#8221; if I actually DO then.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summary<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I love this kit. It&#8217;s expensive, but it&#8217;s an amazing tool for me. But it does also feel lacking\/incomplete in its current form.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My hope is that Adam and Steve have made so much cash now that they don&#8217;t have to work for a year, and that now the book is out, they can spend some time producing some additional resources for those who have purchased it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>As a developer who finds design really hard, I was very much looking forward to the release of Steve Schoger and Adam Wathan&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/refactoringui.com\/book\/\">Refactoring UI<\/a>&#8221; book and kit of resources. Here&#8217;s some thoughts on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: I&#8217;m writing my thoughts in the order I had them. The positive stuff comes later!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Price<br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I heard the quote recently that &#8220;If people complain about the price, you&#8217;re doing it right&#8221;, and I confess, I complained about the price, so maybe they did price it right. I&#8217;d prepared myself for it to be 3 or 4 times the cost of an expensive book. But they priced it at $249 for the digital version of the book (not a physical book!) with all the resources! Yes, there&#8217;s a launch discount of 50%, but even so, this half-priced version was expensive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I get the arguments that a lot of experience and knowledge is in here, and a lot of work has been put in to make it a thing. And I get the argument that this will save me time, and it only has to save me a few hours to pay for itself. But actually, I think owning this book won&#8217;t save me time; it will make me do better design work and spend longer on it! Which is fine. As long as someone wants that and is paying me for it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also can&#8217;t help thinking that if this was half the price then they&#8217;d sell twice as many copies, make just as much money and share their knowledge more widely. And isn&#8217;t this the point of making such a resource: to share your knowledge with people?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A could of years back I&#8217;d been disappointed by Adam&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/adamwathan.me\/refactoring-to-collections\/\">Refactoring to Collections<\/a>&#8221; book which I thought wasn&#8217;t worth the money, and the provided videos in particular weren&#8217;t useful at all. So I was skeptical that this book&#8217;s extra resources would be helpful too &#8211; maybe I should just buy the basic package with the book?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But persuaded by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fullstackradio.com\/103\">Full Stack Radio podcast<\/a> that detailed exactly what was in it, I eventually bit and bought the full Refactoring UI kit.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Format<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from it being a digital-only book, it was PDF format. And I get that they&#8217;ve spent time laying it out and typesetting it, but PDF&#8217;s are still not my favourite eBook format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re also selling it on Gumroad and the Gumroad reader seems to display PDFs at low quality. I&#8217;ve seen complaints on Twitter about the PDF quality and if you download it and open it locally it&#8217;s fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More annoying though is that the component library, colour schemes and font selections are all also in PDF form. Which is annoying because the ability to copy\/paste stuff out of here, see the code, and tinker with it in the browser would have been great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Material\/Content<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, so here&#8217;s the good stuff. Because I&#8217;m not a designer, I can&#8217;t see visual stuff in my head or produce &#8220;nice looking stuff&#8221; out of thin air, I&#8217;m pretty dependent on rules and copying other people&#8217;s ideas to make things I make for the web look nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the book here really delivers. Strategic, rule-based design tips that really suit someone like me. It&#8217;s presented in a really easily digestible format, and has LOADS of very-well-put-together real-life examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see the amount of work that has gone into this in creating the fictional-but-real-looking designs that illustrate the points being made. They&#8217;re done a really great job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s great stuff, well presented, and reading it WILL change my work for the better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I want exercises!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, as well as wanting the component library and things in code, I think it would really benefit from some exercises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The videos are great at explaining the concepts and showing how to transform a bad design into a good one. But I really want to have a go at this myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some exercises a bit like Wes Bos&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/javascript30.com\/\">JavaScript 30<\/a> course would be an amazing addition. Give me the video, the starting design\/code and the ending design\/code, and let me see if I can make some of the changes myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading and watching is all well and good, but I&#8217;m only going to build up the skills and get them into my &#8220;muscle memory&#8221; if I actually DO then.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summary<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I love this kit. It&#8217;s expensive, but it&#8217;s an amazing tool for me. But it does also feel lacking\/incomplete in its current form.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My hope is that Adam and Steve have made so much cash now that they don&#8217;t have to work for a year, and that now the book is out, they can spend some time producing some additional resources for those who have purchased it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n",

Here&#8217;s how that went (click the Twitter icon in the top right, or the date\/time link to see the whole thing:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I took a quick dive into <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/statamic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@statamic<\/a> today. Here&#39;s a bit of a live-tweet of what I&#39;m finding.<br><br>Context: I&#39;m an experienced software dev mostly building websites by day in WordPress and tinkering with Laravel by night (pass me your fun Laravel jobs!!)<\/p>&mdash; Ross Wintle (@magicroundabout) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1064638961325432832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 19, 2018<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was really impressed with Statamic. It costs, but it&#8217;s got a lot going for it. But I was left with a niggling feeling about something, and as I&#8217;ve let my brain post-process it over the last couple of days, I&#8217;ve worked out what it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Statamic is still a CMS with a database. Yes, the database is in flat files, but it still &#8211; to some extent &#8211; builds pages on the fly from the data it has rather than being a full-on &#8220;static&#8221; CMS that builds a set of HTML files.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you can static-cache it, and it provides you with the tools for doing that, but it still needs a little extra effort to get the&nbsp;super-speed of a full static CMS. And it still has a control panel with a login, so it doesn&#8217;t have the super-security of a full static CMS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m left with this niggling doubt about performance. Statamic prides itself on &#8220;eliminating the rigid, relational database&#8221; which &#8220;unlocks the ability to create and support any data structures you can imagine&#8221;. Which I kinda get, but also I&#8217;m not sure I can imagine a data structure that would fit into YAML that wouldn&#8217;t work in SQL. And SQL&#8217;s rigidity means you can query it easily using a declarative query language, and you can get great performance from it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not knowing how the caching works in Statamic, it&#8217;s hard to say how it would perform with a large dataset, but my instinct is that, unless it builds indexes of some sort, it really won&#8217;t be as efficient as MySQL. And I&#8217;d feel like I was dependent on the software itself providing me with import\/export ability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that full-on static site generators are MUCH harder to use and really developer-only territory.\u00a0 And I see that Statamic is much more user-friendly than them, while being much more flexible and developer-friendly than something like WordPress. I&#8217;m struggling with this idea of a hybrid static\/dynamic CMS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me be clear, I can see a LOT of benefits to using Statamic:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>easier configuration with easier access to advanced options<\/li><li>built-in form builder<\/li><li>more flexible data structures<\/li><li>good user roles and groups system<\/li><li>simple drag-and-drop page ordering<\/li><li>built-in caching<\/li><li>built-in CLI tool<\/li><li>nice image editing features<\/li><li>built-in upgrade&#8230;and downgrade!&#8230;functionality<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And, biggest of all, the fact that it&#8217;s flat-file means you can store everything: content, configuration, users, the lot(!) in version control and, potentially, roll back and merge and do all the things that version control allows you to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m yet to be convinced that the benefits of a flat file database outweigh the drawbacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. It&#8217;s great. I&#8217;ll almost certainly play with it more and add it as a tool to my kit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And&#8230;HUGE thank you to the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/statamic\">@statamic<\/a> team, who followed along the live tweeting and well-actually&#8217;d me on a few things. They seem like a great bunch and I&#8217;m certain support from them would be superb.<\/p>\n",

Here&#8217;s how that went (click the Twitter icon in the top right, or the date\/time link to see the whole thing:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I took a quick dive into <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/statamic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@statamic<\/a> today. Here&#39;s a bit of a live-tweet of what I&#39;m finding.<br><br>Context: I&#39;m an experienced software dev mostly building websites by day in WordPress and tinkering with Laravel by night (pass me your fun Laravel jobs!!)<\/p>&mdash; Ross Wintle (@magicroundabout) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1064638961325432832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 19, 2018<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was really impressed with Statamic. It costs, but it&#8217;s got a lot going for it. But I was left with a niggling feeling about something, and as I&#8217;ve let my brain post-process it over the last couple of days, I&#8217;ve worked out what it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Statamic is still a CMS with a database. Yes, the database is in flat files, but it still &#8211; to some extent &#8211; builds pages on the fly from the data it has rather than being a full-on &#8220;static&#8221; CMS that builds a set of HTML files.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you can static-cache it, and it provides you with the tools for doing that, but it still needs a little extra effort to get the&nbsp;super-speed of a full static CMS. And it still has a control panel with a login, so it doesn&#8217;t have the super-security of a full static CMS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m left with this niggling doubt about performance. Statamic prides itself on &#8220;eliminating the rigid, relational database&#8221; which &#8220;unlocks the ability to create and support any data structures you can imagine&#8221;. Which I kinda get, but also I&#8217;m not sure I can imagine a data structure that would fit into YAML that wouldn&#8217;t work in SQL. And SQL&#8217;s rigidity means you can query it easily using a declarative query language, and you can get great performance from it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not knowing how the caching works in Statamic, it&#8217;s hard to say how it would perform with a large dataset, but my instinct is that, unless it builds indexes of some sort, it really won&#8217;t be as efficient as MySQL. And I&#8217;d feel like I was dependent on the software itself providing me with import\/export ability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that full-on static site generators are MUCH harder to use and really developer-only territory.\u00a0 And I see that Statamic is much more user-friendly than them, while being much more flexible and developer-friendly than something like WordPress. I&#8217;m struggling with this idea of a hybrid static\/dynamic CMS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me be clear, I can see a LOT of benefits to using Statamic:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>easier configuration with easier access to advanced options<\/li><li>built-in form builder<\/li><li>more flexible data structures<\/li><li>good user roles and groups system<\/li><li>simple drag-and-drop page ordering<\/li><li>built-in caching<\/li><li>built-in CLI tool<\/li><li>nice image editing features<\/li><li>built-in upgrade&#8230;and downgrade!&#8230;functionality<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And, biggest of all, the fact that it&#8217;s flat-file means you can store everything: content, configuration, users, the lot(!) in version control and, potentially, roll back and merge and do all the things that version control allows you to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m yet to be convinced that the benefits of a flat file database outweigh the drawbacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. It&#8217;s great. I&#8217;ll almost certainly play with it more and add it as a tool to my kit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And&#8230;HUGE thank you to the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/statamic\">@statamic<\/a> team, who followed along the live tweeting and well-actually&#8217;d me on a few things. They seem like a great bunch and I&#8217;m certain support from them would be superb.<\/p>\n",

            },
            "content": {
                "rendered": "\n<p>In Swindon at the moment there is this brilliant &#8220;game&#8221; called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/beatthestreet.me\/swindon\">Beat the Street<\/a>\u201d intended to get people out and about and walking and cycling. They have put more than 170 boxes around the town, strapped to lampposts, and they have given out thousands of fobs and cards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way the &#8220;game&#8221; works is that you tap a box with your fob\/card, and then for each subsequent box you tap (within an hour of the previous box) you get 10 points added. Players can be part of a team, so the school, fitness clubs, and businesses of the town are all competing for prizes &#8211; in and some cases the competition is hot!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been amazing to see loads of people out and about playing &#8211; and exercising! I will surely write more blogs about both the social and technical aspects of Beat the Street in the near future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve been thinking: what will we do when this ends in late October? I might miss having to check in at the boxes. Is there some way we can &#8220;reset&#8221; the points and continue the game?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s be clear &#8211; the physicality is a huge part of what has made this a success. For kids, being able to have a key-ring like fob in their posession, and being able to tap it on a physical box, and have that box light up and flash in recognition really makes the game. And, the engagement on social media from the Beat the Street team has been brilliant (and I applaud everything they have done here).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;equally, anyone with a tech-head (like me) knows that the vast majority of people tapping will have these smart, connected, location-aware devices with them as they travel around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the natural thinking progression is: could we create a virtual version of the game?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for me, the question is: how hard are the basics here? Especially with the mobile device part. And how much fun can we have finding out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today I just tinkered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The basic premise<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I&#8217;ve not fully thought this through. But on the front end at least, the idea is that you could have a mobile-friendly website with a big button on it. You have a stored list of virtual &#8220;box&#8221; locations. And when you approach a location and stand within a few metres of it, the button turns green and activates, and you can &#8220;check in&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notes before we begin:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Yes, this app has been built a zillion times before. But never by ME! So let me have some fun, will you?<\/li><li>This is all vanilla JavaScript with no libraries. It&#8217;s messy and hacked together in half an hour. Of course it can be better! I&#8217;m just tinkering!<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Getting location<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting location in the browser is pretty easy. You need HTTPS to do it, but with that on you just follow the pretty simple <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/API\/Geolocation_API\">Geolocation API<\/a> and do:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(geoSuccess, geoError);<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>where <code>geoSuccess<\/code>&nbsp;and <code>geoError<\/code>&nbsp;are functions that take a location parameter. Or you can use:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(geoSuccess, geoError);<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>to watch the position and fire the callback when the position changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A button<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you need a button. This is easy to make. I won&#8217;t bore you with the fine details of HTML and CSS (because if you&#8217;re reading this it&#8217;s likely you know them anyway), but I just used:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;button&gt;This is a button&lt;\/button&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And then<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;style&gt;\n  button {\n    font-size: 32px;\n    background-color: #ffbdbd \/* Pale red *\/\n    padding: 1rem 2rem;\n    border: 0 none;\n    outline: none;\n    border-radius: 8px;\n  }\n  button.active {\n    background-color: #ccffda; \/* Pale green *\/\n  }\n&lt;\/style&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Showing the location<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To help with finding coordinates of &#8220;boxes&#8221; and generally for figuring this stuff out, I decided I wanted the current location to show. So I added a container for the location result:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;div id=\"result\"&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>and then just created the <code>geoSuccess<\/code>&nbsp;function, which gets called when the location is found, and have it put the location in this container:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>var result = document.getElementById('result');\nfunction geoSuccess(position) {\n  result.innerHTML='You are at ' +\n                    position.coords.latitude.toFixed(9) +\n                    ', ' + position.coords.longitude.toFixed(9);\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Turning the button green\/how big IS the earth?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OK. Now the &#8220;fun&#8221; bit. We need to work out if we are close to a &#8220;box&#8221;. But how close should we be?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could try to work out if were within a circle around the &#8220;box&#8221; point. But that involves more maths than I want to do right now. Let&#8217;s go with an estimate of just &#8220;within X metres east\/west and X metres north\/south&#8221;. This, I THINK, means you have to be within a square box around the &#8220;box&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Co-ordinates are given in&#8230;what&#8230;degrees I guess? So how big is a degree?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wikipedia says that the earth&#8217;s circumference is&nbsp;40,075.017km around the equator (40,075,017m) and&nbsp;40007.86km around the poles (40,007,860m).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we divide by 360, we get&nbsp;111319.49167m per degree of longitude (east\/west) and&nbsp;111132.94444m per degree of latitude (north\/south).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s make things easy and say we&#8217;re happy with an 11m box around our &#8220;box&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s how close you have to be to be able to &#8220;check in&#8221;.&nbsp; So 11m is about 0.0001 degrees in both directions. I&#8217;m sure someone will point out something about elevation and the curvature of the earth, but it&#8217;s good enough for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than start with a list of boxes, lets just start with one location that activates the button. So all I need is some latitude and longitude I want to get close enough to in order to activate the button.&nbsp; Once I have this I can update my <code>geoSuccess<\/code> function:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>var boxLong = &lt;some co-ordinate&gt;;\nvar boxLat = &lt;some co-ordinate&gt;;\nvar result = document.getElementById('result');\nvar button = document.querySelector('button');\n\nfunction geoSuccess(position) {\n  result.innerHTML='You are at ' +\n                    position.coords.latitude.toFixed(9) +\n                    ', ' + position.coords.longitude.toFixed(9);\n  if (Math.abs(boxLong - position.coords.longitude) &lt; 0.0001 &amp;&amp;\n      Math.abs(boxLat - position.coords.latitude) &lt; 0.0001) {\n    button.classList.add('active');\n  } else {\n    button.classList.remove('active');\n  }\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, of course, this is just one coordinate. In reality you&#8217;re going to want to loop or map over a load of coordinates and find if you&#8217;re close to any of them. But this is the basics of a working system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve taken these basics and added some better styling and added a little to them to make a simple \u201capp\u201d. You can walk along and place a box in your current location using a button. The &#8220;check in&#8221; button is then green until you&#8217;re 11m (0.0001 degrees!) away when it turns red. It turns green again when you back inside the 11m range.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here it is in action (with annotations):<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/beats-me.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4238\" width=\"270\" height=\"480\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>OK. So this is just a bit of fun. But it&#8217;s the basis of something quite interesting: you could do a virtual beat-the-street style game using people&#8217;s smartphones to check in to virtual boxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can have a play at:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/zapthemap.com\/\">https:\/\/zapthemap.com\/<\/a> (It&#8217;s evolved a lot since this post!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>YES, yes, yes. This is (relatively) trivial to hack by simulating your location in a web browser. You wouldn&#8217;t want to run any kind of genuinely competitive real game using it. But it could form the basis of some friendly competition or some kind of personal game with yourself. I dunno.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it was fun, and surprisingly easy, to get this far.<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Beat the Street &#8211; tinkering with a virtual version of the game",
        "content": "\n<p>In Swindon at the moment there is this brilliant &#8220;game&#8221; called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/beatthestreet.me\/swindon\">Beat the Street<\/a>\u201d intended to get people out and about and walking and cycling. They have put more than 170 boxes around the town, strapped to lampposts, and they have given out thousands of fobs and cards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way the &#8220;game&#8221; works is that you tap a box with your fob\/card, and then for each subsequent box you tap (within an hour of the previous box) you get 10 points added. Players can be part of a team, so the school, fitness clubs, and businesses of the town are all competing for prizes &#8211; in and some cases the competition is hot!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been amazing to see loads of people out and about playing &#8211; and exercising! I will surely write more blogs about both the social and technical aspects of Beat the Street in the near future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve been thinking: what will we do when this ends in late October? I might miss having to check in at the boxes. Is there some way we can &#8220;reset&#8221; the points and continue the game?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s be clear &#8211; the physicality is a huge part of what has made this a success. For kids, being able to have a key-ring like fob in their posession, and being able to tap it on a physical box, and have that box light up and flash in recognition really makes the game. And, the engagement on social media from the Beat the Street team has been brilliant (and I applaud everything they have done here).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;equally, anyone with a tech-head (like me) knows that the vast majority of people tapping will have these smart, connected, location-aware devices with them as they travel around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the natural thinking progression is: could we create a virtual version of the game?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for me, the question is: how hard are the basics here? Especially with the mobile device part. And how much fun can we have finding out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today I just tinkered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The basic premise<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I&#8217;ve not fully thought this through. But on the front end at least, the idea is that you could have a mobile-friendly website with a big button on it. You have a stored list of virtual &#8220;box&#8221; locations. And when you approach a location and stand within a few metres of it, the button turns green and activates, and you can &#8220;check in&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notes before we begin:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Yes, this app has been built a zillion times before. But never by ME! So let me have some fun, will you?<\/li><li>This is all vanilla JavaScript with no libraries. It&#8217;s messy and hacked together in half an hour. Of course it can be better! I&#8217;m just tinkering!<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Getting location<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting location in the browser is pretty easy. You need HTTPS to do it, but with that on you just follow the pretty simple <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/API\/Geolocation_API\">Geolocation API<\/a> and do:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(geoSuccess, geoError);<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>where <code>geoSuccess<\/code>&nbsp;and <code>geoError<\/code>&nbsp;are functions that take a location parameter. Or you can use:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(geoSuccess, geoError);<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>to watch the position and fire the callback when the position changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A button<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you need a button. This is easy to make. I won&#8217;t bore you with the fine details of HTML and CSS (because if you&#8217;re reading this it&#8217;s likely you know them anyway), but I just used:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;button&gt;This is a button&lt;\/button&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And then<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;style&gt;\n  button {\n    font-size: 32px;\n    background-color: #ffbdbd \/* Pale red *\/\n    padding: 1rem 2rem;\n    border: 0 none;\n    outline: none;\n    border-radius: 8px;\n  }\n  button.active {\n    background-color: #ccffda; \/* Pale green *\/\n  }\n&lt;\/style&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Showing the location<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To help with finding coordinates of &#8220;boxes&#8221; and generally for figuring this stuff out, I decided I wanted the current location to show. So I added a container for the location result:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;div id=\"result\"&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>and then just created the <code>geoSuccess<\/code>&nbsp;function, which gets called when the location is found, and have it put the location in this container:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>var result = document.getElementById('result');\nfunction geoSuccess(position) {\n  result.innerHTML='You are at ' +\n                    position.coords.latitude.toFixed(9) +\n                    ', ' + position.coords.longitude.toFixed(9);\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Turning the button green\/how big IS the earth?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OK. Now the &#8220;fun&#8221; bit. We need to work out if we are close to a &#8220;box&#8221;. But how close should we be?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could try to work out if were within a circle around the &#8220;box&#8221; point. But that involves more maths than I want to do right now. Let&#8217;s go with an estimate of just &#8220;within X metres east\/west and X metres north\/south&#8221;. This, I THINK, means you have to be within a square box around the &#8220;box&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Co-ordinates are given in&#8230;what&#8230;degrees I guess? So how big is a degree?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wikipedia says that the earth&#8217;s circumference is&nbsp;40,075.017km around the equator (40,075,017m) and&nbsp;40007.86km around the poles (40,007,860m).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we divide by 360, we get&nbsp;111319.49167m per degree of longitude (east\/west) and&nbsp;111132.94444m per degree of latitude (north\/south).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s make things easy and say we&#8217;re happy with an 11m box around our &#8220;box&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s how close you have to be to be able to &#8220;check in&#8221;.&nbsp; So 11m is about 0.0001 degrees in both directions. I&#8217;m sure someone will point out something about elevation and the curvature of the earth, but it&#8217;s good enough for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than start with a list of boxes, lets just start with one location that activates the button. So all I need is some latitude and longitude I want to get close enough to in order to activate the button.&nbsp; Once I have this I can update my <code>geoSuccess<\/code> function:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>var boxLong = &lt;some co-ordinate&gt;;\nvar boxLat = &lt;some co-ordinate&gt;;\nvar result = document.getElementById('result');\nvar button = document.querySelector('button');\n\nfunction geoSuccess(position) {\n  result.innerHTML='You are at ' +\n                    position.coords.latitude.toFixed(9) +\n                    ', ' + position.coords.longitude.toFixed(9);\n  if (Math.abs(boxLong - position.coords.longitude) &lt; 0.0001 &amp;&amp;\n      Math.abs(boxLat - position.coords.latitude) &lt; 0.0001) {\n    button.classList.add('active');\n  } else {\n    button.classList.remove('active');\n  }\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, of course, this is just one coordinate. In reality you&#8217;re going to want to loop or map over a load of coordinates and find if you&#8217;re close to any of them. But this is the basics of a working system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve taken these basics and added some better styling and added a little to them to make a simple \u201capp\u201d. You can walk along and place a box in your current location using a button. The &#8220;check in&#8221; button is then green until you&#8217;re 11m (0.0001 degrees!) away when it turns red. It turns green again when you back inside the 11m range.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here it is in action (with annotations):<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/beats-me.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4238\" width=\"270\" height=\"480\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>OK. So this is just a bit of fun. But it&#8217;s the basis of something quite interesting: you could do a virtual beat-the-street style game using people&#8217;s smartphones to check in to virtual boxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can have a play at:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/zapthemap.com\/\">https:\/\/zapthemap.com\/<\/a> (It&#8217;s evolved a lot since this post!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>YES, yes, yes. This is (relatively) trivial to hack by simulating your location in a web browser. You wouldn&#8217;t want to run any kind of genuinely competitive real game using it. But it could form the basis of some friendly competition or some kind of personal game with yourself. I dunno.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it was fun, and surprisingly easy, to get this far.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>Yesterday I looked in the spam box in my email account, and found that there were some messages in there that had an old, out-of-date password in the subject line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These were quite scary-looking messages trying to blackmail me. But the presence of an actual password that I used to use made them seem very real.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. Two things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1) If you get a message like this, it will probably go to your spam box, but if it doesn&#8217;t, then don&#8217;t be scared. It&#8217;s fake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2) Did you know that there are databases on the internet of &#8220;leaked&#8221; email addresses and passwords? You can check if your email has ever been leaked\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/haveibeenpwned.com\/\">here<\/a>\u00a0and, if you&#8217;re willing to risk typing your password into a box on someone else&#8217;s website, you can see if you&#8217;re password has ever been leaked <a href=\"https:\/\/haveibeenpwned.com\/Passwords\">here<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The existence of my email address and an (old) password in these leaked databases explains how I got these messages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you DO get an email like this, or see one in your spam email box, and you still use that password. Then I suggest you immediately stop using that password and change it wherever it&#8217;s used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re response to that is &#8220;But I use it everywhere&#8221; then even more reason to log in everywhere and change it. Try to use different passwords on different websites and apps if you can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) have some brilliant built-in tools for managing passwords, generating and saving random passwords for you, remembering them so you don&#8217;t have to. So try to use those if you can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if you want to be super-advanced try one of the password managers like <a href=\"https:\/\/1password.com\/\">1Password<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lastpass.com\/\">LastPass<\/a>. I&#8217;ve made <a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/2017\/09\/online-security-generating-using-passwords-password-managers\/\">a video<\/a> that shows you how that works (once it&#8217;s set up it actually makes logging in to things both EASIER and MORE SECURE!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, ASK ME if you have any questions about this.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Yesterday I looked in the spam box in my email account, and found that there were some messages in there that had an old, out-of-date password in the subject line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These were quite scary-looking messages trying to blackmail me. But the presence of an actual password that I used to use made them seem very real.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. Two things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1) If you get a message like this, it will probably go to your spam box, but if it doesn&#8217;t, then don&#8217;t be scared. It&#8217;s fake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2) Did you know that there are databases on the internet of &#8220;leaked&#8221; email addresses and passwords? You can check if your email has ever been leaked\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/haveibeenpwned.com\/\">here<\/a>\u00a0and, if you&#8217;re willing to risk typing your password into a box on someone else&#8217;s website, you can see if you&#8217;re password has ever been leaked <a href=\"https:\/\/haveibeenpwned.com\/Passwords\">here<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The existence of my email address and an (old) password in these leaked databases explains how I got these messages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you DO get an email like this, or see one in your spam email box, and you still use that password. Then I suggest you immediately stop using that password and change it wherever it&#8217;s used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re response to that is &#8220;But I use it everywhere&#8221; then even more reason to log in everywhere and change it. Try to use different passwords on different websites and apps if you can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) have some brilliant built-in tools for managing passwords, generating and saving random passwords for you, remembering them so you don&#8217;t have to. So try to use those if you can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if you want to be super-advanced try one of the password managers like <a href=\"https:\/\/1password.com\/\">1Password<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lastpass.com\/\">LastPass<\/a>. I&#8217;ve made <a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/2017\/09\/online-security-generating-using-passwords-password-managers\/\">a video<\/a> that shows you how that works (once it&#8217;s set up it actually makes logging in to things both EASIER and MORE SECURE!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, ASK ME if you have any questions about this.<\/p>\n",
