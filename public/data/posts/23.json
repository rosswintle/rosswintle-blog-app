And now I&#8217;m looking at how it might be done I confess that I&#8217;m a little overwhelmed.<\/p>\n<p>I was trying to explain to Sally how many different technologies are involved:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>databases<\/li>\n<li>server-side scripting<\/li>\n<li>web servers<\/li>\n<li>markup (HTML and CSS)<\/li>\n<li>client-side scripting<\/li>\n<li>and possibly some XML for good measure too<\/li>\n<li>and it helps plug all the stuff above together if you know a web development framework<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To this end I&#8217;m trying to simulaneously get to grips with the following tools\/languages:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>MySQL (Database)<\/li>\n<li>PHP (Server-side scripting)<\/li>\n<li>Apache (Web Server)<\/li>\n<li>HTML\/XHTML<\/li>\n<li>CSS<\/li>\n<li>JavaScript (client-side scripting)<\/li>\n<li>the Domain Object Model(s) needed to manipulate DHTML documents using JavaScript<\/li>\n<li>XML<\/li>\n<li>Symfony (a PHP-based web development framework)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I wonder if such a large collection of technologies has always been required to write a business application? \u00a0I remember, on my University work placement, using Oracle on a VAX\/VMS System and using Oracle Forms. \u00a0And more recently I&#8217;ve been helping Sally with a MS Access database, which also has it&#8217;s own forms system.<\/p>\n<p>I suppose at the very most you would previously have to have known the database, the forms program and possibly a scripting language (VB Script).<\/p>\n<p>The problem with today&#8217;s systems is that things have gotten very flexible. \u00a0You can present data through the web in whatever formats and styles you like. \u00a0It can be branded and you can present very complex sets of data in a variety of meaningful ways &#8211; just check out Facebook and all the information on there&#8230;or read-again (if you dare) <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/12\/03\/social-web-the-good-and-the-bad\/\">my rant about information overload on Amazon<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I suspect that if you want to present a simple database using a web-based form you can do this quite easily.<\/p>\n<p>But, hey, why make things simple???<\/p>\n<p>Back to my reference books&#8230;<\/p>\n",

\u00a0So I&#8217;m told. \u00a0Weird!<\/p>\n<p>I tried in London. \u00a0Short runs around our old stomping ground there, round Hammersmith Park, under the shadow of BBC TV Centre and past Loftus Road Stadium. \u00a0Even, I might add, down Swindon Street!<\/p>\n<p>But even gait analysis and proper running shoes didn&#8217;t help. \u00a0My knees still hurt.<\/p>\n<p>I did end up seeing a physio though and she gave me some excellent pointers.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever run in Swindon. \u00a0I&#8217;ve not even done the treadmill thing. \u00a0But I have been cycling&#8230;building up fitness and some leg strength.<\/p>\n<p>I guess it was bound to come.\u00a0 It was even somewhat predicted <a title=\"Clapped Out\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/12\/clapped-out\/\">back in October<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>The First Outing<\/h2>\n<p>Wednesday was fine. \u00a0Sunny if cool. \u00a0I&#8217;m just about over my cold and have been back on the bike.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d packed spare clothes for a lunchtime bike ride. \u00a0I think, secretly, running was in the back of my head. \u00a0I knew some of the guys were out running at lunchtimes mid-week.<\/p>\n<p>It was a date with destiny.<\/p>\n<p>The men made the invite and I couldn&#8217;t refuse. \u00a0I tentatively changed into my T-Shirt, cycling longs and my Windstopper jacket. \u00a0I stretched to warm up. \u00a0I checked my watch. \u00a0And&#8230;.I&#8230;.ran!!!<\/p>\n<h2>Relentless<\/h2>\n<p>I deliberately held back. \u00a0I didn&#8217;t want to knacker my knees first time. \u00a0The others were doing a relatively slow pace as they&#8217;re building up fitness themselves, and I didn&#8217;t want to overdo it at the start. \u00a0My aim, if my running continues, is to build on that first run slowly, with the hope of strengthening up the things that usually give me grief.<\/p>\n<p>But despite my slow pace, I found running tough. \u00a0I&#8217;ve always favoured sports with bursts of activity: squash and five-a-side mentioned earlier, and cycling allows it too. \u00a0But my legs don&#8217;t have a freewheel. \u00a0I just had to keep going.<\/p>\n<p>I was also paying a lot of attention to HOW I was running. \u00a0I&#8217;m flat footed and so I was consciously rolling down from the outside edge of my foot. \u00a0I was really noticing that my style got heavy when I was tired or stopped thinking. \u00a0And I was trying out different styles &#8211; a long pace felt easier as I could skim the ground rather then up-and-downing so much &#8211; this felt good but was hard to keep up.<\/p>\n<p>I was also very conscious of my breathing. \u00a0The relentless nature of it meant I didn&#8217;t have time to catch breath, and I was breathing a good deep breath over and over for the whole 4 miles.<\/p>\n<h2>Lessons<\/h2>\n<p>My knees felt OK afterwards, but my back had been hurting and my legs were very tired&#8230;but a nice, well-used kind of tiredness.<\/p>\n<p>It was a great experience. \u00a0I was chuffed to have got round and finished second out of the four of us in about 36 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>But I also learned some things that I&#8217;ll carry on to the bike. \u00a0That control of pace that meant I could keep up a reasonable output continuously. \u00a0And the deeper, slower, more controlled breathing that went along with it. \u00a0There are things that I hope to take on to the wheels to see if they improve my riding.<\/p>\n<h2>Next Time<\/h2>\n<p>Will there be one?<\/p>\n<p>Well, yesterday I did 14 miles on the bike and there is some knee pain coming. \u00a0I wasn&#8217;t running in my proper running shoes and it was a bit far for a first run, so maybe I&#8217;ll try doing the same and see if it gets worse.<\/p>\n<p>I have plenty of physio-prescribed stretches and orthotics for my shoes that should all help.<\/p>\n<p>And, I confess, I enjoyed.<\/p>\n<p>So watch this space, either for reports of the demise of my limb joints, or for the result of my first half marathon!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I have lots of friends who run. \u00a0My sister, and her boyfriend: big runners. \u00a0Well, my sister&#8217;s quite little actually. \u00a0Lots of their friends from work run. \u00a0And most of their social circle are from a running club.<\/p>\n<p>I have friends at work too who run.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, I&#8217;m surrounded much of the time by people who do this crazy activity.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;ve finally stopped holding out. \u00a0On Wednesday, I went for a run.<\/p>\n<h2>A Potted History of Running in the Wintle Household<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;ve not wanted to. \u00a0I&#8217;ve tried running on several occasions, and it ALWAYS messes my knees up.<\/p>\n<p>I tried in Bath. \u00a0That was probably 8 years ago. \u00a0I was a young, fit, active guy who played squash and 5-a-side. \u00a0But a couple of short runs finished me off. \u00a0I blamed the hills. \u00a0Can&#8217;t run anywhere in Bath without a hill&#8230;though &#8211; oddly &#8211; it has one of the flattest half-marathons in the country! \u00a0So I&#8217;m told. \u00a0Weird!<\/p>\n<p>I tried in London. \u00a0Short runs around our old stomping ground there, round Hammersmith Park, under the shadow of BBC TV Centre and past Loftus Road Stadium. \u00a0Even, I might add, down Swindon Street!<\/p>\n<p>But even gait analysis and proper running shoes didn&#8217;t help. \u00a0My knees still hurt.<\/p>\n<p>I did end up seeing a physio though and she gave me some excellent pointers.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever run in Swindon. \u00a0I&#8217;ve not even done the treadmill thing. \u00a0But I have been cycling&#8230;building up fitness and some leg strength.<\/p>\n<p>I guess it was bound to come.\u00a0 It was even somewhat predicted <a title=\"Clapped Out\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/12\/clapped-out\/\">back in October<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>The First Outing<\/h2>\n<p>Wednesday was fine. \u00a0Sunny if cool. \u00a0I&#8217;m just about over my cold and have been back on the bike.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d packed spare clothes for a lunchtime bike ride. \u00a0I think, secretly, running was in the back of my head. \u00a0I knew some of the guys were out running at lunchtimes mid-week.<\/p>\n<p>It was a date with destiny.<\/p>\n<p>The men made the invite and I couldn&#8217;t refuse. \u00a0I tentatively changed into my T-Shirt, cycling longs and my Windstopper jacket. \u00a0I stretched to warm up. \u00a0I checked my watch. \u00a0And&#8230;.I&#8230;.ran!!!<\/p>\n<h2>Relentless<\/h2>\n<p>I deliberately held back. \u00a0I didn&#8217;t want to knacker my knees first time. \u00a0The others were doing a relatively slow pace as they&#8217;re building up fitness themselves, and I didn&#8217;t want to overdo it at the start. \u00a0My aim, if my running continues, is to build on that first run slowly, with the hope of strengthening up the things that usually give me grief.<\/p>\n<p>But despite my slow pace, I found running tough. \u00a0I&#8217;ve always favoured sports with bursts of activity: squash and five-a-side mentioned earlier, and cycling allows it too. \u00a0But my legs don&#8217;t have a freewheel. \u00a0I just had to keep going.<\/p>\n<p>I was also paying a lot of attention to HOW I was running. \u00a0I&#8217;m flat footed and so I was consciously rolling down from the outside edge of my foot. \u00a0I was really noticing that my style got heavy when I was tired or stopped thinking. \u00a0And I was trying out different styles &#8211; a long pace felt easier as I could skim the ground rather then up-and-downing so much &#8211; this felt good but was hard to keep up.<\/p>\n<p>I was also very conscious of my breathing. \u00a0The relentless nature of it meant I didn&#8217;t have time to catch breath, and I was breathing a good deep breath over and over for the whole 4 miles.<\/p>\n<h2>Lessons<\/h2>\n<p>My knees felt OK afterwards, but my back had been hurting and my legs were very tired&#8230;but a nice, well-used kind of tiredness.<\/p>\n<p>It was a great experience. \u00a0I was chuffed to have got round and finished second out of the four of us in about 36 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>But I also learned some things that I&#8217;ll carry on to the bike. \u00a0That control of pace that meant I could keep up a reasonable output continuously. \u00a0And the deeper, slower, more controlled breathing that went along with it. \u00a0There are things that I hope to take on to the wheels to see if they improve my riding.<\/p>\n<h2>Next Time<\/h2>\n<p>Will there be one?<\/p>\n<p>Well, yesterday I did 14 miles on the bike and there is some knee pain coming. \u00a0I wasn&#8217;t running in my proper running shoes and it was a bit far for a first run, so maybe I&#8217;ll try doing the same and see if it gets worse.<\/p>\n<p>I have plenty of physio-prescribed stretches and orthotics for my shoes that should all help.<\/p>\n<p>And, I confess, I enjoyed.<\/p>\n<p>So watch this space, either for reports of the demise of my limb joints, or for the result of my first half marathon!<\/p>\n",

Yes, sadly, on a treadmill!<\/p>\n<p>Now, some runners at work have mocked this slightly, calling it things like &#8220;Just bobbing up and down and not really going anywhere&#8221;, and I confess, that&#8217;s exactly what it is.  It&#8217;s not really like running.  But that&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s completely dissimilar too, and with my possibly painful knee I didn&#8217;t want to run 2 miles and have to abort and walk home, so it seemed like the thing to do.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m pleased to say it was a success!  I did get a bit of knee pain, in the left knee, but it wasn&#8217;t too bad and I ran through it and clocked up 5km.  I felt pretty OK afterwards too.<\/p>\n<p>The treadmill was funny.  I mentioned about liking a long stride in my first run, and it was really hard to get that in the gym.  It also seemed to take FOREVER to run 5km.  I can see why people much prefer running outdoors.<\/p>\n<p>But at the same time it was good.  I did the 5km.  I didn&#8217;t get as hot and sweaty as I thought I would.  And I got to watch the highlights of Obama&#8217;s inauguration on the news while I did it.<\/p>\n<p>I now have an odd pain just behind my right knee.  It&#8217;s fading a bit but persisting.  It&#8217;s not holding up the cycling, but I&#8217;m taking it easy, and definitely not running again, until it&#8217;s definitely OK.<\/p>\n<p>The Swindon Half Marathon&#8217;s not quite in sight yet. But maybe I could get used to this running lark after all?!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>So, not to be beaten after a single run, and slightly concerned about the very slight pain in my knee, I headed to the gym last week for my second run.  Yes, sadly, on a treadmill!<\/p>\n<p>Now, some runners at work have mocked this slightly, calling it things like &#8220;Just bobbing up and down and not really going anywhere&#8221;, and I confess, that&#8217;s exactly what it is.  It&#8217;s not really like running.  But that&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s completely dissimilar too, and with my possibly painful knee I didn&#8217;t want to run 2 miles and have to abort and walk home, so it seemed like the thing to do.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m pleased to say it was a success!  I did get a bit of knee pain, in the left knee, but it wasn&#8217;t too bad and I ran through it and clocked up 5km.  I felt pretty OK afterwards too.<\/p>\n<p>The treadmill was funny.  I mentioned about liking a long stride in my first run, and it was really hard to get that in the gym.  It also seemed to take FOREVER to run 5km.  I can see why people much prefer running outdoors.<\/p>\n<p>But at the same time it was good.  I did the 5km.  I didn&#8217;t get as hot and sweaty as I thought I would.  And I got to watch the highlights of Obama&#8217;s inauguration on the news while I did it.<\/p>\n<p>I now have an odd pain just behind my right knee.  It&#8217;s fading a bit but persisting.  It&#8217;s not holding up the cycling, but I&#8217;m taking it easy, and definitely not running again, until it&#8217;s definitely OK.<\/p>\n<p>The Swindon Half Marathon&#8217;s not quite in sight yet. But maybe I could get used to this running lark after all?!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>We started work on the garden again last weekend.  Sally&#8217;s been quite prepared with ideas and we&#8217;ve ordered our seeds for the year.  The weekend was mild and dryish&#8230;time to start preparing the ground!<\/p>\n<p>The plan is to have raised beds.  This is where you put wooden borders up and contain within it a raised area of soil.  Sally&#8217;s mum, a VERY keen gardener, raves about them and we&#8217;ve been told that they have many benefits, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Warming up quicker in spring<\/li>\n<li>Not needing digging<\/li>\n<li>Better drainage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Plus, you get to put paths between them, which, potentially means you don&#8217;t get as muddy.  You just kneel at the side and reach in to do your planting\/tending\/harvesting.<\/p>\n<p>So, this weekend we tried to start making this a reality, and rapidly ran into some stumbling blocks.<\/p>\n<p>We measured up and did the maths.  Our plot can have 4 beds, each the full width of the garden (about 5 metres), and each about 1.5 metres wide.  A nice lot of space.<\/p>\n<p>But that means we&#8217;ll need about 26 metres of timber for each plot to do the edges.  Once that&#8217;s done we&#8217;ll need to fill them with earth too.  We calculated this on the basis of needing 30cm deep of earth and it came to around 2500 litres of soil for each bed.<\/p>\n<p>WOW!!!<\/p>\n<p>In reality it won&#8217;t quite be that much.  But it&#8217;s still going to be a lot.<\/p>\n<p>So, looks like it&#8217;s off to the reclaimed timber yard for some wood at some point, and then to the council&#8230;several times&#8230;for some cheap compost.<\/p>\n<p>You know, maybe we won&#8217;t get ALL the beds done this year.  But we&#8217;ll try and make a start. Watch this space for progress.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>We started work on the garden again last weekend.  Sally&#8217;s been quite prepared with ideas and we&#8217;ve ordered our seeds for the year.  The weekend was mild and dryish&#8230;time to start preparing the ground!<\/p>\n<p>The plan is to have raised beds.  This is where you put wooden borders up and contain within it a raised area of soil.  Sally&#8217;s mum, a VERY keen gardener, raves about them and we&#8217;ve been told that they have many benefits, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Warming up quicker in spring<\/li>\n<li>Not needing digging<\/li>\n<li>Better drainage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Plus, you get to put paths between them, which, potentially means you don&#8217;t get as muddy.  You just kneel at the side and reach in to do your planting\/tending\/harvesting.<\/p>\n<p>So, this weekend we tried to start making this a reality, and rapidly ran into some stumbling blocks.<\/p>\n<p>We measured up and did the maths.  Our plot can have 4 beds, each the full width of the garden (about 5 metres), and each about 1.5 metres wide.  A nice lot of space.<\/p>\n<p>But that means we&#8217;ll need about 26 metres of timber for each plot to do the edges.  Once that&#8217;s done we&#8217;ll need to fill them with earth too.  We calculated this on the basis of needing 30cm deep of earth and it came to around 2500 litres of soil for each bed.<\/p>\n<p>WOW!!!<\/p>\n<p>In reality it won&#8217;t quite be that much.  But it&#8217;s still going to be a lot.<\/p>\n<p>So, looks like it&#8217;s off to the reclaimed timber yard for some wood at some point, and then to the council&#8230;several times&#8230;for some cheap compost.<\/p>\n<p>You know, maybe we won&#8217;t get ALL the beds done this year.  But we&#8217;ll try and make a start. Watch this space for progress.<\/p>\n",

That was confirmed on stepping outside. Brrrr.  I was mostly prepared for this, but I only had my three-season, three-quarter-length longs on.<\/p>\n<p>About 5 miles in though, and I could feel little twinges in my legs.  Not something I&#8217;ve had before.  Icy little darts of&#8230;not pain&#8230;but tension.  I abandoned the 14-miler and started heading for home.<\/p>\n<p>It was a traffic-light stop that killed me.  I had to wait about a minute or so for it to change and as soon as I&#8217;d clipped back in&#8230;TWANG!!! It went.  My left calf seized up.<\/p>\n<p>I just about made it home without anything else going, but even after some good stretching I&#8217;m not right.<\/p>\n<p>A word of winter warning.  Wrap up well when it&#8217;s freezing, or take the short route home.<\/p>\n<p>Ow.<\/p>\n",

That was confirmed on stepping outside. Brrrr.  I was mostly prepared for this, but I only had my three-season, three-quarter-length longs on.<\/p>\n<p>About 5 miles in though, and I could feel little twinges in my legs.  Not something I&#8217;ve had before.  Icy little darts of&#8230;not pain&#8230;but tension.  I abandoned the 14-miler and started heading for home.<\/p>\n<p>It was a traffic-light stop that killed me.  I had to wait about a minute or so for it to change and as soon as I&#8217;d clipped back in&#8230;TWANG!!! It went.  My left calf seized up.<\/p>\n<p>I just about made it home without anything else going, but even after some good stretching I&#8217;m not right.<\/p>\n<p>A word of winter warning.  Wrap up well when it&#8217;s freezing, or take the short route home.<\/p>\n<p>Ow.<\/p>\n",

A fairly intense introduction gave you an idea of the events that lead up to Nixon&#8217;s resignation and you were set to be introduced to Frost.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what genre of film this was meant to be.\u00a0 It&#8217;s part documentary, mostly drama, but you wonder how much is historical and how much has been made up to make it a good story.\u00a0 The factual &#8220;whatever happened to&#8230;&#8221; bits at the end of the suggest it leans more towards fact than fiction, but it&#8217;s such a dramatic story that you are left wondering.<\/p>\n<p>But given that I thought the film was excellent.\u00a0 The 2 hours flew by and I was on the edge of my seat at times, and I was taken on a roller coaster of emotions as Frost&#8217;s plans, and the big interview, teeter on the edge.<\/p>\n<p>It was well acted and scripted, though I felt there were some cheesy editorial moments.\u00a0 There are some nice little touches that hold the film together &#8211; thankfully these are obvious enough\u00a0 for a dunce like me to spot and engage with &#8211; though they were possibly a little too obvious.<\/p>\n<p>The other little niggle was that I recognised some of the actors but really couldn&#8217;t place them.\u00a0 I spent most of the film asking myself &#8220;What the heck has that guy been in?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I should probably try and draw some moral point from the story.\u00a0 But I can&#8217;t.\u00a0 The characters are fantastic and the portrayal of Nixon was particularly fascinating.\u00a0 I was left wondering if he was good or bad.\u00a0 Clever, or too clever.\u00a0 Had his power corrupted him beyond redemption?\u00a0 Or did the interview change him for the better?<\/p>\n<p>Well worth seeing!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>We haven&#8217;t been ot the cinema for ages, so a free evening on Friday was a chance to use some free tickets we&#8217;d acquired.\u00a0 After a bit of debate and looking up times we headed to Cineworld to see Frost-Nixon.<\/p>\n<p>First off, the seats in Cineworld are rubbish and uncomfortable -must make a mental note to use the Empire instead.<\/p>\n<p>As we took our uncomfortable seat we didn&#8217;t really know what to expect of the film either.\u00a0 Sal&#8217;s much better at the history side of things than I am but we&#8217;re both a bit vague on Watergate and the Nixon (and post-Nixon) era.\u00a0 So we were hoping the film was self explanatory.<\/p>\n<p>Which it was! A fairly intense introduction gave you an idea of the events that lead up to Nixon&#8217;s resignation and you were set to be introduced to Frost.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what genre of film this was meant to be.\u00a0 It&#8217;s part documentary, mostly drama, but you wonder how much is historical and how much has been made up to make it a good story.\u00a0 The factual &#8220;whatever happened to&#8230;&#8221; bits at the end of the suggest it leans more towards fact than fiction, but it&#8217;s such a dramatic story that you are left wondering.<\/p>\n<p>But given that I thought the film was excellent.\u00a0 The 2 hours flew by and I was on the edge of my seat at times, and I was taken on a roller coaster of emotions as Frost&#8217;s plans, and the big interview, teeter on the edge.<\/p>\n<p>It was well acted and scripted, though I felt there were some cheesy editorial moments.\u00a0 There are some nice little touches that hold the film together &#8211; thankfully these are obvious enough\u00a0 for a dunce like me to spot and engage with &#8211; though they were possibly a little too obvious.<\/p>\n<p>The other little niggle was that I recognised some of the actors but really couldn&#8217;t place them.\u00a0 I spent most of the film asking myself &#8220;What the heck has that guy been in?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I should probably try and draw some moral point from the story.\u00a0 But I can&#8217;t.\u00a0 The characters are fantastic and the portrayal of Nixon was particularly fascinating.\u00a0 I was left wondering if he was good or bad.\u00a0 Clever, or too clever.\u00a0 Had his power corrupted him beyond redemption?\u00a0 Or did the interview change him for the better?<\/p>\n<p>Well worth seeing!<\/p>\n",
