It was also VERY cold and I was numb even through my winter SealSkins AND thermal inners.<\/p>\n<p>Things had improved by evening time and, despite the darkness, I put in a fairly useful 9 urban miles or so.  And I felt pretty strong too!<\/p>\n<p>You know, I might have said this a thousand times before but I just LOVE cycling.  I think I&#8217;m the sort of person that thrives on intense exercise, so that sways my opinion, but I feel so much better in so many ways for having put a few miles in.<\/p>\n",

Hello!!!<\/p>\n<p>I will, at some point write some &#8220;pages&#8221; that explain a bit about me and why this blog is here&#8230;watch this space.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, one of the reasons I started writing stuff down was to track various health things that were going on.  Not really personal stuff&#8230;of course!  But, I guess this blog is really about things I&#8217;m learning.  The tag line contines to be true &#8220;Discovering new things in an old home&#8221;.  And so I&#8217;m slowly learning how to keep my body from failing under the various strains of things like stress and cycling.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Sally, my wife, pointed out the other day that I&#8217;d not written anything about the huge amount of snow that we&#8217;ve had lately.  Truth is, I&#8217;m not that interested in it (though there is a post in my head about the cool ways that people have used the internet and social networking during the snow time).<\/p>\n<p>But I have discovered one of the dangers of snow!  And it&#8217;s caused me an injury.<\/p>\n<p>Some facts about the snow:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s made me stop exercising, not just cycling, but generally, I&#8217;ve been moving around less.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s getting quite dangerous to walk on round here.\u00a0 Not that it&#8217;s hard-packed ice, it&#8217;s not nice, and as I drove (yeah, I&#8217;ve been driving to work&#8230;bad form I know!) out of my street this morning, people were choosing to walk on the well-gritted road rather than the pavement.<\/li>\n<li>There have been <a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/uk_politics\/3453039.stm\">some articles in the press about clearing paths of snow<\/a>, but I quite like the idea of communities pulling together with their spades to clear the paths and make them safe to walk on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, attempting to set a precedent, I went out with my spade on Sunday and cleared the path and two parking spaces outside our house.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, this sudden exertion seems to have brought on some back pain.<\/p>\n<p>Actually, I think it&#8217;s a combination of doing nothing, sudden exertion, and then doing nothing again.\u00a0 I actually spent most of Sunday afternoon slumped in a chair with the laptop typing out a huge long essay on &#8220;How to read the Bible&#8221; and I&#8217;m sure that did me no good either.\u00a0 In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/01\/10\/coughing-my-way-into-the-new-year\/\">the last time I did my back in<\/a> I&#8217;d spent too much time slumped in comfy furniture.<\/p>\n<p>My back is an on-and-off source of trouble.\u00a0 I think I know what causes it and I have long periods of being pain free between minor incidents.\u00a0 But I was thinking last night about the fact that I&#8217;m probably somewhere between a fifth and quarter of the way through my working life and if bad posture is occasionally a problem now, I really need to get it sorted out in the long term, or I&#8217;ll end up seizing up entirely!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>There&#8217;s been a few more hits and even a comment lately, which suggests new readers.  Hello!!!<\/p>\n<p>I will, at some point write some &#8220;pages&#8221; that explain a bit about me and why this blog is here&#8230;watch this space.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, one of the reasons I started writing stuff down was to track various health things that were going on.  Not really personal stuff&#8230;of course!  But, I guess this blog is really about things I&#8217;m learning.  The tag line contines to be true &#8220;Discovering new things in an old home&#8221;.  And so I&#8217;m slowly learning how to keep my body from failing under the various strains of things like stress and cycling.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Sally, my wife, pointed out the other day that I&#8217;d not written anything about the huge amount of snow that we&#8217;ve had lately.  Truth is, I&#8217;m not that interested in it (though there is a post in my head about the cool ways that people have used the internet and social networking during the snow time).<\/p>\n<p>But I have discovered one of the dangers of snow!  And it&#8217;s caused me an injury.<\/p>\n<p>Some facts about the snow:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s made me stop exercising, not just cycling, but generally, I&#8217;ve been moving around less.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s getting quite dangerous to walk on round here.\u00a0 Not that it&#8217;s hard-packed ice, it&#8217;s not nice, and as I drove (yeah, I&#8217;ve been driving to work&#8230;bad form I know!) out of my street this morning, people were choosing to walk on the well-gritted road rather than the pavement.<\/li>\n<li>There have been <a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/uk_politics\/3453039.stm\">some articles in the press about clearing paths of snow<\/a>, but I quite like the idea of communities pulling together with their spades to clear the paths and make them safe to walk on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, attempting to set a precedent, I went out with my spade on Sunday and cleared the path and two parking spaces outside our house.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, this sudden exertion seems to have brought on some back pain.<\/p>\n<p>Actually, I think it&#8217;s a combination of doing nothing, sudden exertion, and then doing nothing again.\u00a0 I actually spent most of Sunday afternoon slumped in a chair with the laptop typing out a huge long essay on &#8220;How to read the Bible&#8221; and I&#8217;m sure that did me no good either.\u00a0 In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/01\/10\/coughing-my-way-into-the-new-year\/\">the last time I did my back in<\/a> I&#8217;d spent too much time slumped in comfy furniture.<\/p>\n<p>My back is an on-and-off source of trouble.\u00a0 I think I know what causes it and I have long periods of being pain free between minor incidents.\u00a0 But I was thinking last night about the fact that I&#8217;m probably somewhere between a fifth and quarter of the way through my working life and if bad posture is occasionally a problem now, I really need to get it sorted out in the long term, or I&#8217;ll end up seizing up entirely!<\/p>\n",

How very generous of her!  It has been an interesting thing to be signed up to and I may well write more about it at a later date.<\/p>\n<h3>The activities of an old friend<\/h3>\n<p>An old friend of mine from Bath, who I&#8217;ve reconnected with through some fancy social web malarkey, is as much, if not more, of an avid cyclist as I am.  It&#8217;s been great chatting to him, sharing experiences of commuting in all weathers, following his recommended reading on the subject (lots of links to <a title=\"Link to copenhagenize.com\" href=\"http:\/\/www.copenhagenize.com\/\">Copenhagenize<\/a> and <a title=\"Link to Amsterdamize.com\" href=\"http:\/\/amsterdamize.com\/\">Amsterdamize<\/a>) and, more recently, finding out about his participation in some cycle campaigning.\u00a0 He&#8217;s gotten involved with the <a title=\"Link to Bath Cycling Campaign\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bathcyclingcampaign.org.uk\/\">Bath Cycling Campaign<\/a> and has recently been making some noise about removal of &#8220;the ramp&#8221; (and, I might add, moving of the cycle park) at Bath Spa station.<\/p>\n<p>He&#8217;s generally helped along my own thinking about cycle campaigning and encouraged me to get involved.<\/p>\n<h2>Do what??<\/h2>\n<p>That&#8217;s really the first question.\u00a0 What is cycle campaigning about?\u00a0 What are cycle campaigners trying to change.<\/p>\n<p>My own take on this would be that some cyclists are trying to do the following things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>get other people to realise the benefits of cycling;<\/li>\n<li>encourage investment in cycling infrastructure (bike parking, paths, priority schemes, and other safety features);<\/li>\n<li>make cycling safer;<\/li>\n<li>have the government recognise the benefits of cycling to the community and the economy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There may be more.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, as a keen cyclist and cycle commuter who lives in a small town where most people drive cars on short journeys, I&#8217;m definitely up for all of this.\u00a0 Heck, I&#8217;m even a <a title=\"link to previous post about being a cycle evangelist\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/11\/07\/eek-im-an-evangelist\/\">self-confessed cycle-evangelist<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h2>Getting Started<\/h2>\n<p>But how do I get involved in this sort of thing?\u00a0 What is there to do? How can I make a difference?<\/p>\n<p>Well, of course, there&#8217;s my own personal sharing about my own cycling and how quick it is, how it&#8217;s good for my health, how it&#8217;s often better than using the car for getting around, and how enjoyable it is.\u00a0 That&#8217;s easy and ongoing.<\/p>\n<p>But what can I do to get the government and local authorities to do more to promote cycling?\u00a0 I&#8217;d love for Swindon to become like some of the European towns where up to 80% of people keep cycling even through the winter.\u00a0 Or even like Oxford or Cambridge, where cycling is so popular.\u00a0 I would have loved it if, this week, with all the snow and ice that we&#8217;ve had, cycle lanes could have seen a bit of grit and been made safe for me to cycle to work &#8211; just like they do <a href=\"http:\/\/hembrow.blogspot.com\/2009\/01\/priorities-when-it-snows.html\">in the Netherlands where priorities are different<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Barriers<\/h2>\n<p>But how do you start getting momentum on moving towards towns like these?\u00a0 Do you start by getting more people cycling and hope that the authorities recognise this and make the facilities better?\u00a0 Or do you convince the authorities to make the facilities better and hope that this will encourage people to cycle more?\u00a0 (This was pretty much what I said yesterday).<\/p>\n<p>I suspect a bit of both is necessary.\u00a0 But it&#8217;s chicken and egg.<\/p>\n<p>And it raises some difficult questions.\u00a0 How do you convince a cash-strapped council to improve facilities that are currently only used by a minority in the hope that more people will in the long term start using them?\u00a0 When the priority for the town has to be roads because they&#8217;re the main way into, out of, and around the town &#8211; they&#8217;re the paths of commerce and industry.\u00a0 And when our culture is one where people need to travel great distances to work, shop, and visit friends and family.<\/p>\n<p>Things like the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swindoncyclechallenge.org.uk\/\">Swindon Cycle Challenge<\/a> help and I&#8217;ve emailed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ctc.org.uk\/desktopdefault.aspx?tabid=4916\">our town&#8217;s CTC cycle champion<\/a> (though, disappointingly, with no response as yet).\u00a0 Perhaps there are opportunities with doing cycle training, to help people have confidence on the roads, or to bring up the next generation with the idea that cycling is a good thing.\u00a0 And maybe writing to the local MP or to the council will help.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all a bit unknown and it&#8217;s hard to see how little old me can make a difference.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully being a CTC member will help and there will be ideas in their magazines and lots of encouragement and support from others with similar hopes.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I&#8217;ll be writing more about this if, as and when I get involved.\u00a0 Perhaps in a few years time I&#8217;ll be writing about the successes and joys of sharing the many, well-maintained cycle lanes with more Swindoners.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h2>Background<\/h2>\n<p>There are two bits of background to this post.<\/p>\n<h3>CTC Membership<\/h3>\n<p>My lovely, lovely wife, bought me membership of the Cyclists Touring Club (CTC) for Christmas.  How very generous of her!  It has been an interesting thing to be signed up to and I may well write more about it at a later date.<\/p>\n<h3>The activities of an old friend<\/h3>\n<p>An old friend of mine from Bath, who I&#8217;ve reconnected with through some fancy social web malarkey, is as much, if not more, of an avid cyclist as I am.  It&#8217;s been great chatting to him, sharing experiences of commuting in all weathers, following his recommended reading on the subject (lots of links to <a title=\"Link to copenhagenize.com\" href=\"http:\/\/www.copenhagenize.com\/\">Copenhagenize<\/a> and <a title=\"Link to Amsterdamize.com\" href=\"http:\/\/amsterdamize.com\/\">Amsterdamize<\/a>) and, more recently, finding out about his participation in some cycle campaigning.\u00a0 He&#8217;s gotten involved with the <a title=\"Link to Bath Cycling Campaign\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bathcyclingcampaign.org.uk\/\">Bath Cycling Campaign<\/a> and has recently been making some noise about removal of &#8220;the ramp&#8221; (and, I might add, moving of the cycle park) at Bath Spa station.<\/p>\n<p>He&#8217;s generally helped along my own thinking about cycle campaigning and encouraged me to get involved.<\/p>\n<h2>Do what??<\/h2>\n<p>That&#8217;s really the first question.\u00a0 What is cycle campaigning about?\u00a0 What are cycle campaigners trying to change.<\/p>\n<p>My own take on this would be that some cyclists are trying to do the following things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>get other people to realise the benefits of cycling;<\/li>\n<li>encourage investment in cycling infrastructure (bike parking, paths, priority schemes, and other safety features);<\/li>\n<li>make cycling safer;<\/li>\n<li>have the government recognise the benefits of cycling to the community and the economy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There may be more.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, as a keen cyclist and cycle commuter who lives in a small town where most people drive cars on short journeys, I&#8217;m definitely up for all of this.\u00a0 Heck, I&#8217;m even a <a title=\"link to previous post about being a cycle evangelist\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/11\/07\/eek-im-an-evangelist\/\">self-confessed cycle-evangelist<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h2>Getting Started<\/h2>\n<p>But how do I get involved in this sort of thing?\u00a0 What is there to do? How can I make a difference?<\/p>\n<p>Well, of course, there&#8217;s my own personal sharing about my own cycling and how quick it is, how it&#8217;s good for my health, how it&#8217;s often better than using the car for getting around, and how enjoyable it is.\u00a0 That&#8217;s easy and ongoing.<\/p>\n<p>But what can I do to get the government and local authorities to do more to promote cycling?\u00a0 I&#8217;d love for Swindon to become like some of the European towns where up to 80% of people keep cycling even through the winter.\u00a0 Or even like Oxford or Cambridge, where cycling is so popular.\u00a0 I would have loved it if, this week, with all the snow and ice that we&#8217;ve had, cycle lanes could have seen a bit of grit and been made safe for me to cycle to work &#8211; just like they do <a href=\"http:\/\/hembrow.blogspot.com\/2009\/01\/priorities-when-it-snows.html\">in the Netherlands where priorities are different<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Barriers<\/h2>\n<p>But how do you start getting momentum on moving towards towns like these?\u00a0 Do you start by getting more people cycling and hope that the authorities recognise this and make the facilities better?\u00a0 Or do you convince the authorities to make the facilities better and hope that this will encourage people to cycle more?\u00a0 (This was pretty much what I said yesterday).<\/p>\n<p>I suspect a bit of both is necessary.\u00a0 But it&#8217;s chicken and egg.<\/p>\n<p>And it raises some difficult questions.\u00a0 How do you convince a cash-strapped council to improve facilities that are currently only used by a minority in the hope that more people will in the long term start using them?\u00a0 When the priority for the town has to be roads because they&#8217;re the main way into, out of, and around the town &#8211; they&#8217;re the paths of commerce and industry.\u00a0 And when our culture is one where people need to travel great distances to work, shop, and visit friends and family.<\/p>\n<p>Things like the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swindoncyclechallenge.org.uk\/\">Swindon Cycle Challenge<\/a> help and I&#8217;ve emailed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ctc.org.uk\/desktopdefault.aspx?tabid=4916\">our town&#8217;s CTC cycle champion<\/a> (though, disappointingly, with no response as yet).\u00a0 Perhaps there are opportunities with doing cycle training, to help people have confidence on the roads, or to bring up the next generation with the idea that cycling is a good thing.\u00a0 And maybe writing to the local MP or to the council will help.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all a bit unknown and it&#8217;s hard to see how little old me can make a difference.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully being a CTC member will help and there will be ideas in their magazines and lots of encouragement and support from others with similar hopes.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I&#8217;ll be writing more about this if, as and when I get involved.\u00a0 Perhaps in a few years time I&#8217;ll be writing about the successes and joys of sharing the many, well-maintained cycle lanes with more Swindoners.<\/p>\n",

It\u2019s pretty simple as I see it:<\/p>\n<p>1) There are bad (narrow) integrated cycle lanes. These are generally too narrow as to be dangerous (the car thinks that everything that\u2019s not the cycle lane is theirs).<br \/>\n2) There are integrated cycle lanes in silly places that cars are allowed to park in (wishing I had photos of Uxbridge Road in Shepherds Bush, London, to demonstrate this)<br \/>\n3) There are good integrated cycle lanes<br \/>\n4) There are (at least) two types of cyclist.<br \/>\na) those that can usefully and safely use segregated cycle lanes\/shared pedestrain paths &#8211; usually people who want to easily and safely get from A to B, or families on outings<br \/>\nb) those serious MTB\u2019ers or road bike riders who aren\u2019t going anywhere, but who want to ride fast and hard &#8211; it\u2019s usually not appropriate for these people (I include myself among them) to be on a segregated lane with other, slower, cyclists.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore:<br \/>\n&#8211; Integrated cycle lanes are good if they\u2019re well designed, which is not always the case; badly designed cycle lanes do treat cyclists badly.<br \/>\n&#8211; Segregated cycle lanes are good, but not for everyone<br \/>\n&#8211; Cyclists should be allowed to use or not use special cycle lanes as they see fit. If they choose not to use them it\u2019s at the risk of the cyclist.<\/p>\n<p>Is any of that debatable?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The response from the blog author goes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Looking at much of the provision we have, I\u2019d say no: local authorities <em>generally<\/em> go for option 1.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>To which I think:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Hah!  Agreed.  <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http:\/\/karlmccracken.sweat365.com\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\"-)\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Many cycle lanes are token gestures to cyclists rather than being of any real benefit. My home town (Swindon) has some good segregated lanes shared with pedestrians, which I use on my daily commute, and some good shared bus lanes that let cyclists take some nice quiet shortcuts. But the on-road stuff may as well not be there.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe I\u2019ll try and get some photos &#8211; once the snow has gone and we can see the lines again.<\/p>\n<p>The debate, in my opinion, needs to be how we get from a state where cycling is for the minority and therefore funding is low, to a state where cycling is popular, and funding increases\u2026<\/p>\n<p>or possibly:<\/p>\n<p>from a state where funding is low and so cycling is for the minority, to a state where funding increases, raising popularity.<\/p>\n<p>Chicken?  Egg?<\/p>\n<p>Hmm\u2026<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There&#8217;s also some interesting <a title=\"cycle-related Bad Science\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/Kco1\">cycle-related &#8220;Bad Science&#8221;<\/a> in the Guardian today.<\/p>\n<p>As for me, I&#8217;ve not been on the bike this week due to the snow&#8230;but that&#8217;s a whole other story.<\/p>\n",

It\u2019s pretty simple as I see it:<\/p>\n<p>1) There are bad (narrow) integrated cycle lanes. These are generally too narrow as to be dangerous (the car thinks that everything that\u2019s not the cycle lane is theirs).<br \/>\n2) There are integrated cycle lanes in silly places that cars are allowed to park in (wishing I had photos of Uxbridge Road in Shepherds Bush, London, to demonstrate this)<br \/>\n3) There are good integrated cycle lanes<br \/>\n4) There are (at least) two types of cyclist.<br \/>\na) those that can usefully and safely use segregated cycle lanes\/shared pedestrain paths &#8211; usually people who want to easily and safely get from A to B, or families on outings<br \/>\nb) those serious MTB\u2019ers or road bike riders who aren\u2019t going anywhere, but who want to ride fast and hard &#8211; it\u2019s usually not appropriate for these people (I include myself among them) to be on a segregated lane with other, slower, cyclists.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore:<br \/>\n&#8211; Integrated cycle lanes are good if they\u2019re well designed, which is not always the case; badly designed cycle lanes do treat cyclists badly.<br \/>\n&#8211; Segregated cycle lanes are good, but not for everyone<br \/>\n&#8211; Cyclists should be allowed to use or not use special cycle lanes as they see fit. If they choose not to use them it\u2019s at the risk of the cyclist.<\/p>\n<p>Is any of that debatable?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The response from the blog author goes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Looking at much of the provision we have, I\u2019d say no: local authorities <em>generally<\/em> go for option 1.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>To which I think:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Hah!  Agreed.  <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http:\/\/karlmccracken.sweat365.com\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\"-)\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Many cycle lanes are token gestures to cyclists rather than being of any real benefit. My home town (Swindon) has some good segregated lanes shared with pedestrians, which I use on my daily commute, and some good shared bus lanes that let cyclists take some nice quiet shortcuts. But the on-road stuff may as well not be there.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe I\u2019ll try and get some photos &#8211; once the snow has gone and we can see the lines again.<\/p>\n<p>The debate, in my opinion, needs to be how we get from a state where cycling is for the minority and therefore funding is low, to a state where cycling is popular, and funding increases\u2026<\/p>\n<p>or possibly:<\/p>\n<p>from a state where funding is low and so cycling is for the minority, to a state where funding increases, raising popularity.<\/p>\n<p>Chicken?  Egg?<\/p>\n<p>Hmm\u2026<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There&#8217;s also some interesting <a title=\"cycle-related Bad Science\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/Kco1\">cycle-related &#8220;Bad Science&#8221;<\/a> in the Guardian today.<\/p>\n<p>As for me, I&#8217;ve not been on the bike this week due to the snow&#8230;but that&#8217;s a whole other story.<\/p>\n",

A fairly intense introduction gave you an idea of the events that lead up to Nixon&#8217;s resignation and you were set to be introduced to Frost.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what genre of film this was meant to be.\u00a0 It&#8217;s part documentary, mostly drama, but you wonder how much is historical and how much has been made up to make it a good story.\u00a0 The factual &#8220;whatever happened to&#8230;&#8221; bits at the end of the suggest it leans more towards fact than fiction, but it&#8217;s such a dramatic story that you are left wondering.<\/p>\n<p>But given that I thought the film was excellent.\u00a0 The 2 hours flew by and I was on the edge of my seat at times, and I was taken on a roller coaster of emotions as Frost&#8217;s plans, and the big interview, teeter on the edge.<\/p>\n<p>It was well acted and scripted, though I felt there were some cheesy editorial moments.\u00a0 There are some nice little touches that hold the film together &#8211; thankfully these are obvious enough\u00a0 for a dunce like me to spot and engage with &#8211; though they were possibly a little too obvious.<\/p>\n<p>The other little niggle was that I recognised some of the actors but really couldn&#8217;t place them.\u00a0 I spent most of the film asking myself &#8220;What the heck has that guy been in?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I should probably try and draw some moral point from the story.\u00a0 But I can&#8217;t.\u00a0 The characters are fantastic and the portrayal of Nixon was particularly fascinating.\u00a0 I was left wondering if he was good or bad.\u00a0 Clever, or too clever.\u00a0 Had his power corrupted him beyond redemption?\u00a0 Or did the interview change him for the better?<\/p>\n<p>Well worth seeing!<\/p>\n",

A fairly intense introduction gave you an idea of the events that lead up to Nixon&#8217;s resignation and you were set to be introduced to Frost.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what genre of film this was meant to be.\u00a0 It&#8217;s part documentary, mostly drama, but you wonder how much is historical and how much has been made up to make it a good story.\u00a0 The factual &#8220;whatever happened to&#8230;&#8221; bits at the end of the suggest it leans more towards fact than fiction, but it&#8217;s such a dramatic story that you are left wondering.<\/p>\n<p>But given that I thought the film was excellent.\u00a0 The 2 hours flew by and I was on the edge of my seat at times, and I was taken on a roller coaster of emotions as Frost&#8217;s plans, and the big interview, teeter on the edge.<\/p>\n<p>It was well acted and scripted, though I felt there were some cheesy editorial moments.\u00a0 There are some nice little touches that hold the film together &#8211; thankfully these are obvious enough\u00a0 for a dunce like me to spot and engage with &#8211; though they were possibly a little too obvious.<\/p>\n<p>The other little niggle was that I recognised some of the actors but really couldn&#8217;t place them.\u00a0 I spent most of the film asking myself &#8220;What the heck has that guy been in?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I should probably try and draw some moral point from the story.\u00a0 But I can&#8217;t.\u00a0 The characters are fantastic and the portrayal of Nixon was particularly fascinating.\u00a0 I was left wondering if he was good or bad.\u00a0 Clever, or too clever.\u00a0 Had his power corrupted him beyond redemption?\u00a0 Or did the interview change him for the better?<\/p>\n<p>Well worth seeing!<\/p>\n",

That was confirmed on stepping outside. Brrrr.  I was mostly prepared for this, but I only had my three-season, three-quarter-length longs on.<\/p>\n<p>About 5 miles in though, and I could feel little twinges in my legs.  Not something I&#8217;ve had before.  Icy little darts of&#8230;not pain&#8230;but tension.  I abandoned the 14-miler and started heading for home.<\/p>\n<p>It was a traffic-light stop that killed me.  I had to wait about a minute or so for it to change and as soon as I&#8217;d clipped back in&#8230;TWANG!!! It went.  My left calf seized up.<\/p>\n<p>I just about made it home without anything else going, but even after some good stretching I&#8217;m not right.<\/p>\n<p>A word of winter warning.  Wrap up well when it&#8217;s freezing, or take the short route home.<\/p>\n<p>Ow.<\/p>\n",

That was confirmed on stepping outside. Brrrr.  I was mostly prepared for this, but I only had my three-season, three-quarter-length longs on.<\/p>\n<p>About 5 miles in though, and I could feel little twinges in my legs.  Not something I&#8217;ve had before.  Icy little darts of&#8230;not pain&#8230;but tension.  I abandoned the 14-miler and started heading for home.<\/p>\n<p>It was a traffic-light stop that killed me.  I had to wait about a minute or so for it to change and as soon as I&#8217;d clipped back in&#8230;TWANG!!! It went.  My left calf seized up.<\/p>\n<p>I just about made it home without anything else going, but even after some good stretching I&#8217;m not right.<\/p>\n<p>A word of winter warning.  Wrap up well when it&#8217;s freezing, or take the short route home.<\/p>\n<p>Ow.<\/p>\n",

The weekend was mild and dryish&#8230;time to start preparing the ground!<\/p>\n<p>The plan is to have raised beds.  This is where you put wooden borders up and contain within it a raised area of soil.  Sally&#8217;s mum, a VERY keen gardener, raves about them and we&#8217;ve been told that they have many benefits, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Warming up quicker in spring<\/li>\n<li>Not needing digging<\/li>\n<li>Better drainage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Plus, you get to put paths between them, which, potentially means you don&#8217;t get as muddy.  You just kneel at the side and reach in to do your planting\/tending\/harvesting.<\/p>\n<p>So, this weekend we tried to start making this a reality, and rapidly ran into some stumbling blocks.<\/p>\n<p>We measured up and did the maths.  Our plot can have 4 beds, each the full width of the garden (about 5 metres), and each about 1.5 metres wide.  A nice lot of space.<\/p>\n<p>But that means we&#8217;ll need about 26 metres of timber for each plot to do the edges.  Once that&#8217;s done we&#8217;ll need to fill them with earth too.  We calculated this on the basis of needing 30cm deep of earth and it came to around 2500 litres of soil for each bed.<\/p>\n<p>WOW!!!<\/p>\n<p>In reality it won&#8217;t quite be that much.  But it&#8217;s still going to be a lot.<\/p>\n<p>So, looks like it&#8217;s off to the reclaimed timber yard for some wood at some point, and then to the council&#8230;several times&#8230;for some cheap compost.<\/p>\n<p>You know, maybe we won&#8217;t get ALL the beds done this year.  But we&#8217;ll try and make a start. Watch this space for progress.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>We started work on the garden again last weekend.  Sally&#8217;s been quite prepared with ideas and we&#8217;ve ordered our seeds for the year.  The weekend was mild and dryish&#8230;time to start preparing the ground!<\/p>\n<p>The plan is to have raised beds.  This is where you put wooden borders up and contain within it a raised area of soil.  Sally&#8217;s mum, a VERY keen gardener, raves about them and we&#8217;ve been told that they have many benefits, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Warming up quicker in spring<\/li>\n<li>Not needing digging<\/li>\n<li>Better drainage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Plus, you get to put paths between them, which, potentially means you don&#8217;t get as muddy.  You just kneel at the side and reach in to do your planting\/tending\/harvesting.<\/p>\n<p>So, this weekend we tried to start making this a reality, and rapidly ran into some stumbling blocks.<\/p>\n<p>We measured up and did the maths.  Our plot can have 4 beds, each the full width of the garden (about 5 metres), and each about 1.5 metres wide.  A nice lot of space.<\/p>\n<p>But that means we&#8217;ll need about 26 metres of timber for each plot to do the edges.  Once that&#8217;s done we&#8217;ll need to fill them with earth too.  We calculated this on the basis of needing 30cm deep of earth and it came to around 2500 litres of soil for each bed.<\/p>\n<p>WOW!!!<\/p>\n<p>In reality it won&#8217;t quite be that much.  But it&#8217;s still going to be a lot.<\/p>\n<p>So, looks like it&#8217;s off to the reclaimed timber yard for some wood at some point, and then to the council&#8230;several times&#8230;for some cheap compost.<\/p>\n<p>You know, maybe we won&#8217;t get ALL the beds done this year.  But we&#8217;ll try and make a start. Watch this space for progress.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>So, not to be beaten after a single run, and slightly concerned about the very slight pain in my knee, I headed to the gym last week for my second run.  Yes, sadly, on a treadmill!<\/p>\n<p>Now, some runners at work have mocked this slightly, calling it things like &#8220;Just bobbing up and down and not really going anywhere&#8221;, and I confess, that&#8217;s exactly what it is.  It&#8217;s not really like running.  But that&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s completely dissimilar too, and with my possibly painful knee I didn&#8217;t want to run 2 miles and have to abort and walk home, so it seemed like the thing to do.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m pleased to say it was a success!  I did get a bit of knee pain, in the left knee, but it wasn&#8217;t too bad and I ran through it and clocked up 5km.  I felt pretty OK afterwards too.<\/p>\n<p>The treadmill was funny.  I mentioned about liking a long stride in my first run, and it was really hard to get that in the gym.  It also seemed to take FOREVER to run 5km.  I can see why people much prefer running outdoors.<\/p>\n<p>But at the same time it was good.  I did the 5km.  I didn&#8217;t get as hot and sweaty as I thought I would.  And I got to watch the highlights of Obama&#8217;s inauguration on the news while I did it.<\/p>\n<p>I now have an odd pain just behind my right knee.  It&#8217;s fading a bit but persisting.  It&#8217;s not holding up the cycling, but I&#8217;m taking it easy, and definitely not running again, until it&#8217;s definitely OK.<\/p>\n<p>The Swindon Half Marathon&#8217;s not quite in sight yet. But maybe I could get used to this running lark after all?!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>So, not to be beaten after a single run, and slightly concerned about the very slight pain in my knee, I headed to the gym last week for my second run.  Yes, sadly, on a treadmill!<\/p>\n<p>Now, some runners at work have mocked this slightly, calling it things like &#8220;Just bobbing up and down and not really going anywhere&#8221;, and I confess, that&#8217;s exactly what it is.  It&#8217;s not really like running.  But that&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s completely dissimilar too, and with my possibly painful knee I didn&#8217;t want to run 2 miles and have to abort and walk home, so it seemed like the thing to do.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m pleased to say it was a success!  I did get a bit of knee pain, in the left knee, but it wasn&#8217;t too bad and I ran through it and clocked up 5km.  I felt pretty OK afterwards too.<\/p>\n<p>The treadmill was funny.  I mentioned about liking a long stride in my first run, and it was really hard to get that in the gym.  It also seemed to take FOREVER to run 5km.  I can see why people much prefer running outdoors.<\/p>\n<p>But at the same time it was good.  I did the 5km.  I didn&#8217;t get as hot and sweaty as I thought I would.  And I got to watch the highlights of Obama&#8217;s inauguration on the news while I did it.<\/p>\n<p>I now have an odd pain just behind my right knee.  It&#8217;s fading a bit but persisting.  It&#8217;s not holding up the cycling, but I&#8217;m taking it easy, and definitely not running again, until it&#8217;s definitely OK.<\/p>\n<p>The Swindon Half Marathon&#8217;s not quite in sight yet. But maybe I could get used to this running lark after all?!<\/p>\n",
