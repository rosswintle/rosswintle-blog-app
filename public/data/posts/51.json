But it&#8217;s been such a revelation to us that I have to share it.<\/p>\n<p>This post is an explanation of a character trait that we (are very glad we) found out about. It&#8217;s a summary of our own learnings and experiences. It will duplicate some things that you can read much more polished and detailed accounts of elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever felt different, shy, like you understand some things that other people don&#8217;t, or that you dwell on things deeply and thoughtfully &#8211; or if you have a bright and curious small child that seems to be highly attentive and sensitive, and WON&#8217;T SLEEP &#8211; then this may be worth reading. It may be a complete revelation!<\/p>\n<h2>Highly sensitive small people<\/h2>\n<p>As we and our friends reached the having-children stage of life, we started noticing a trait in some of the small children. Children who are highly attentive even from an early age. Children who seem to have extreme emotions. Children who are awful sleepers. Children who are AMAZING at spotting patterns and who are really interested in the tiny details of things. Some practical examples of some of these things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feeding and sleeping in a public places might be very difficult. Hiding away in a dark, quiet room may be the only way to feed the child or to get them to sleep for a nap.<\/li>\n<li>They may be very bright, learning numbers and letters, learning basic reading early on, counting and knowing lots of colours.<\/li>\n<li>Being fussy about food: often rejecting things because they are &#8220;broken&#8221; or wrong in some way, or because they have been contaminated with some other food.<\/li>\n<li>Finding busy public spaces totally over-stimulating: where other kids seem to adapt to that environment or just fall asleep, this kid just can&#8217;t switch off from the noise.<\/li>\n<li>Being both very highly distractable AND, seeming to totally zone out and focus on certain activities to the exclusion of the whole rest of the world.<\/li>\n<li>Having an extreme dislike of certain bits of furniture or a car seat. Being a very difficult traveller. Finding it difficult to be comfortable. Maybe having an extreme preference for or dislike of a particular way of being moved around or carried, be it in a buggy\/stroller, sling, being carried, or wanting to walk and get around under their own steam.<\/li>\n<li>Developing a clever sense of humour, engaging in word-play and abstraction, at quite an early age.<\/li>\n<li>Early potty-training, maybe potty training easily without much encouragement.<\/li>\n<li>Seeming to understand emotions well and how their actions will affect themselves and others.<\/li>\n<li>Being difficult to discipline or &#8216;train&#8217; (e.g. sleep training) with most efforts failing with spectacular, unending tantrums.<\/li>\n<li>Hating dummies and bottles and tooth-brushing and other things that you might put in their mouth or on their body. Again, with violent and outright rejection.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to judge other people&#8217;s children as you don&#8217;t spend all day every day with them, but we had noticed these traits as common things in particular kids<\/p>\n<p>There definitely seemed to be two types of child: those that do lots of the things above, and others that children fall asleep in restaurants, cafes, churches or other busy places. Those who are rarely content, and often bothered or distracted, and those who happily sit in buggies and stare into the distance, ignoring everything around them. Stuff like that.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes we wondered if some of the bothered\/distracted children were somewhere on the autistic scale. But they often had good social skills and other things about them just weren&#8217;t extreme enough.<\/p>\n<p>But it nagged us that some of these children seemed different somehow.<\/p>\n<h2>And me&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s me. I&#8217;m logical, deep-thinking, cautious. I make &#8216;anxious predictions&#8217; about the future, usually based on dwelled-upon past experiences. I worry about what other people think. A LOT!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m an ambivert. I think I&#8217;m mostly an introvert, but I&#8217;ve learned to deal with people quite well. I have a quite analytical approach to being extroverted &#8211; probably based on past experiences &#8211; and when that approach doesn&#8217;t work I get very left out.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a stickler for detail. I notice things that others don&#8217;t and they bother me. Interestingly, I&#8217;m not a very visual person &#8211; it&#8217;s almost a family joke that I don&#8217;t remember people by hair colour! I think this is because there&#8217;s less thinking to be done about visual things. I find people&#8217;s characters more interesting than their appearance.<\/p>\n<p>I &#8216;zone out&#8217; in activities.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m really hesitant to start doing things when I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing. Computers are an exception, but with DIY for example, I overthink everything before starting and it\u00a0makes it hard to get going with things that I&#8217;m not confident in.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a careful driver with high hazard perception. I love escaping to nature. I hate being too hot. I find some materials really cringy &#8211; tights and rough synthetic fabrics bring me out in goose bumps.<\/p>\n<p>I find travel hard. I think because I worry about all the things that could go wrong. Not big things like air crashes, but little things like being stuck in place where no one speaks English.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember much of my childhood, but the things I do remember are things that I know I dwelled on a lot at the time. Minor incidents that I thought over for weeks, and still occasionally think back to: I felt so stupid; why did I do it that way?<\/p>\n<p>I hate, hate, hate being punished or thought badly of. I got detention once at school. Most people just seemed to brush this off, but I was devastated. I think the teacher ended up letting me off as it was my first time ever. But it was massively emotional for me.<\/p>\n<h2>HSP<\/h2>\n<p>These kind of traits, it turns out, are associated with a genetic character trait known under various names, but which I&#8217;ll refer to as &#8220;high sensitivity&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Discovering high sensitivity was one of the biggest &#8220;aha!&#8221; moments of my life.<\/p>\n<p>High sensitivity is present in around 20-25% of people (and a similar percentage in some animals), and it&#8217;s more easy to see in small children &#8211; adults developing coping mechanisms, so it&#8217;s not always as clear. This totally fits with our observations about other children.<\/p>\n<p>Highly sensitive people don&#8217;t get more sensory input, but they do appear to process it more intensely. You can probably see how this results in a lot of the traits mentioned above, but let me give an example that applies to small children: reading. Some kids just breeze through a book. But have you ever come across a child who doesn&#8217;t just let the story go in; who points all all the tiny details in the pictures, and asks questions about crazy-detailed things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>That owl has yellow feet!<\/li>\n<li>What is the owl doing?<\/li>\n<li>What is his name?<\/li>\n<li>Is the grass wet?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Stuff like that. I mean, kids ask these kinds of questions. But with with some it seems almost relentless.<\/p>\n<p>And highly sensitive people think harder about things. That&#8217;s definitely not saying that non-highly-sensitive people always think less; but the highly sensitive person will tend to think things through more. They will more readily make predictions based on previous experiences. They will get more emotional. They will be more cautious and conscientious.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the behaviour of highly sensitive people is explained in terms of reflexes. You can think of people as having a &#8220;go-ahead&#8221; reflex, and a &#8220;hold on&#8221; reflex. In highly sensitive people the &#8220;hold on&#8221; reflex is stronger, causing them to hesitate and think things through. It&#8217;s not that they don&#8217;t have the &#8220;go ahead&#8221; reflex, it&#8217;s just countered or balanced out more. What this can mean is that a highly sensitive person can be more hesitant at first, but once they&#8217;ve decided something is safe or good, they will go at it with great energy and excitement.<\/p>\n<h2>Society and HSP&#8217;s<\/h2>\n<p>Society doesn&#8217;t always value the trait of high sensitivity. This has bothered me, personally, greatly in my life.<\/p>\n<p>Take the travel thing. I&#8217;m a home bird. I like things that are familiar And where I know how they work. Going to places where I don&#8217;t speak the native language, where I don&#8217;t know if the natives will speak my language, and where I don&#8217;t know how things work, freaks me out.<\/p>\n<p>Even really simple things like going to a cafe. Cafes work differently in different parts of the world. Am I supposed to sit down and be served? Or order at the bar? If I order at the bar, will they bring my food over or do I take it with me? Do I pay when I order or before we leave? What if I sit down and they come over to ask what I want and I don&#8217;t understand what they&#8217;re saying and they don&#8217;t speak English and I can&#8217;t point at things on display to show what I want. I&#8217;ll look really stupid and we won&#8217;t be able to get lunch and&#8230;oh&#8230;why are we abroad?!?<\/p>\n<p>From what I can tell, most people just think: &#8220;Ah, well get by!&#8221; and get on with it. But these are genuine things that I think and worry about, and that I dwell on afterwards for hours.<\/p>\n<p>Classic high sensitivity.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also not an explorer. I don&#8217;t care all that much for seeing\/experiencing new things. Though whether that&#8217;s an innate part of me, or simply an it&#8217;s-not-worth-the-hassle response to finding being in new places difficult I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, where was I going with this? Ah yes. Society.<\/p>\n<p>Society thinks I&#8217;m odd because I don&#8217;t like travel.<\/p>\n<p>Seriously: how many people do you know that approach the subject of foreign holidays with dread? Or that would rather stay in the UK? And how many people do you know that think &#8220;It&#8217;s great that that person doesn&#8217;t want to travel. I totally understand their desire to go somewhere familiar and comfortable and not expand their horizons?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s not many. Society doesn&#8217;t think that this is a positive thing. Society sees this as being afraid or xenophobic. My fears are made out to be silly or easy to overcome. But the truth is that every time I push myself and go on a foreign holiday I have a mid-week meltdown and want to go home. Holidays should be restful and easy, not panic-inducing stress-fests!<\/p>\n<p>What else? Shyness is generally seen as bad. &#8216;Adventurous&#8217; is a quality to aspire to, and those who aren&#8217;t are seen as boring. Risk taking is rewarded, while thinking carefully and planning things out is seen as anal or risk-averse. A &#8216;who cares&#8217; attitude generally seems to get you by better in life than worrying about what others will think.<\/p>\n<p>I feel like other people can easily decide to do exciting and adventurous things, whereas I&#8217;m cautious and immediately see things that need fixing before I can do something adventurous, and that, somehow, makes me feel inferior.<\/p>\n<p>And the children?<\/p>\n<p>Well, let&#8217;s take a look at primary schools. I know of modern primary schools that have large year 1 classes that are effectively in a shared space with a pre-school. This means up to about 60 or 70 little people and their carers all occupying the same space. A space which has lots of displays and activities to do. Lots of people potentially engaging in lots of different things at the same time. Lots of noise. Lots of multi-sensory stimuli.<\/p>\n<p>This sounds like a nightmare kind of environment for ME to be in, let alone a 3 year old person with little emotional intelligence and who is likely to be highly stimulated by all this stuff all day long.<\/p>\n<p>Primary Schools, to me, do not seem to cater very well for highly sensitive children. It seems to me like they try to be stimulating learning environments, when that&#8217;s exactly not what the highly sensitive child needs.<\/p>\n<p>Society seems to think that a loud, busy environment is normal and good for children, and that if a child is sat quietly and intently assembling Lego and ignoring the children around him then that is bad.<\/p>\n<p>Then there are children&#8217;s films. Some films, even U rated, are absolutely chock full of scary stuff. &#8216;Finding Nemo&#8217;, for example, is just wall-to-wall mild peril; a series of mini-disaster movies plugged together with an over-arching narrative which is also one of strong emotions and minor catastrophe.<\/p>\n<p>It seems like children are expected to take stories like this in their stride; appreciate the comedy in them; enjoy the ride. But if you&#8217;re three, and you&#8217;re thinking about every detail and you&#8217;re experiencing the music and images more intensely, and you&#8217;re empathising with the characters and worrying about what they might be going through&#8230;then films like these are pretty terrifying.<\/p>\n<p>Generally the world is a loud and busy place and children are expected to just deal with it. Some seem to sail through. But others are distracted by it, intrigued by it, over-stimulated by it, scared by it, or bothered by it.<\/p>\n<p>This is both a huge problem, and a huge opportunity. But the world doesn&#8217;t always seem to see it that way.<\/p>\n<h2>Acceptance and the joy of being highly sensitive<\/h2>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve said, it&#8217;s been a complete revelation to me, understanding why I am like I am, but also understanding why these children we know are like they are too, and some of the ways in which that might help us to help them.<\/p>\n<p>There is a certain amount of acceptance involved. I&#8217;m now much more conscious of highly stimulating environments, and of my need to take time out to recover after being in busy places, or after being stimulated for too long.<\/p>\n<p>Understanding high sensitivity definitely helps in this way, but it also help me to see that other people don&#8217;t experience things in the same way that I do, and that&#8217;s helpful too. That makes me feel less like I&#8217;m shy or silly, and more &#8211; well, more like I&#8217;m just me and that&#8217;s OK.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also help me see the opportunities of being highly sensitive. This trait enables me to be a person that has a high level of attention to detail, which is great in my line of work. And not just visually, but, I think, empathically too. I think hard about the consequences of what I do on other people.<\/p>\n<p>Technical training is a great example. A long time ago now, I was delivering some technical training for a client alongside another, far more senior engineer. I was only actually teaching a few modules but was otherwise there to facilitate and help out during workshops. In a module prior to one that I was to teach, I was really aware that the senior trainer was using some technical language that had not been introduced. I let him complete his module then stepped up to teach my module. The first time I hit the same technical language I put it out there &#8220;Who knows what this means?&#8221; (very few people). &#8220;Who doesn&#8217;t know what this means?&#8221; (almost everyone).<\/p>\n<p>That empathy, that consciousness of what others might be thinking, can be REALLY helpful and I make use of my sensitivity to it a lot when having technical conversations with non-technical people.<\/p>\n<p>It also think it makes me really interested in things. Deep, difficult, interesting, obscure things. I&#8217;ve always said that I&#8217;d like to go back to University to study something weird like Philosophy of Maths; what&#8217;s the history of mathematical concepts, and how do we relate abstract mathematical concepts to real world things. I can look at 5 apples, they are countable. But what does the square root of 5 look like? Why is that useful? This kind of thing intrigues\u00a0me.<\/p>\n<p>I think the trait makes me a grammar pedant. Which is a good thing. It&#8217;s a good thing to know the difference between &#8220;knowing your shit&#8221; and &#8220;knowing you&#8217;re shit&#8221;, right?<\/p>\n<p>With highly sensitive children, they may be natural spotter of patterns; remarkable with numbers and letters; reading far above their age level.<\/p>\n<h2>What does all this mean?<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve written this because I want people to understand other people who may be highly sensitive.<\/p>\n<p>I want people to know that a child walking into a busy room might find it difficult and need time to adjust &#8211; and then some time out later.<\/p>\n<p>I want people to know that people who seem shy or quiet might be really struggling.<\/p>\n<p>I want people to know that being outgoing and outrageous and carefree aren&#8217;t the only &#8220;good&#8221; ways to be. Quiet, thoughtful, sensitive people are important in our world too and we should seek to understand them, value them, and nurture them.<\/p>\n<p>As I said earlier, discovering high-sensitivity has been a revelation to me and to my immediate family. It explains so much about me and about some of these children that we have observed, and it gives us some tools and strategies for accepting ourselves and each other, and for understanding each other too.<\/p>\n<p>This has been long, but I hope it has been useful. If any of it resonates, I recommend looking up <a href=\"http:\/\/hsperson.com\/\">Elaine Aron and her research and books<\/a> or do a Google Search to find out more by reading useful articles like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2014\/02\/26\/highly-sensitive-people-signs-habits_n_4810794.html\">this<\/a>, or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.parents.com\/toddlers-preschoolers\/development\/behavioral\/how-to-help-your-sensitive-child\/\">this<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps it will be a revelation to you too?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;m nervous about writing this, mostly because it contains some stuff that&#8217;s about my own personality traits. But it&#8217;s been such a revelation to us that I have to share it.<\/p>\n<p>This post is an explanation of a character trait that we (are very glad we) found out about. It&#8217;s a summary of our own learnings and experiences. It will duplicate some things that you can read much more polished and detailed accounts of elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever felt different, shy, like you understand some things that other people don&#8217;t, or that you dwell on things deeply and thoughtfully &#8211; or if you have a bright and curious small child that seems to be highly attentive and sensitive, and WON&#8217;T SLEEP &#8211; then this may be worth reading. It may be a complete revelation!<\/p>\n<h2>Highly sensitive small people<\/h2>\n<p>As we and our friends reached the having-children stage of life, we started noticing a trait in some of the small children. Children who are highly attentive even from an early age. Children who seem to have extreme emotions. Children who are awful sleepers. Children who are AMAZING at spotting patterns and who are really interested in the tiny details of things. Some practical examples of some of these things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feeding and sleeping in a public places might be very difficult. Hiding away in a dark, quiet room may be the only way to feed the child or to get them to sleep for a nap.<\/li>\n<li>They may be very bright, learning numbers and letters, learning basic reading early on, counting and knowing lots of colours.<\/li>\n<li>Being fussy about food: often rejecting things because they are &#8220;broken&#8221; or wrong in some way, or because they have been contaminated with some other food.<\/li>\n<li>Finding busy public spaces totally over-stimulating: where other kids seem to adapt to that environment or just fall asleep, this kid just can&#8217;t switch off from the noise.<\/li>\n<li>Being both very highly distractable AND, seeming to totally zone out and focus on certain activities to the exclusion of the whole rest of the world.<\/li>\n<li>Having an extreme dislike of certain bits of furniture or a car seat. Being a very difficult traveller. Finding it difficult to be comfortable. Maybe having an extreme preference for or dislike of a particular way of being moved around or carried, be it in a buggy\/stroller, sling, being carried, or wanting to walk and get around under their own steam.<\/li>\n<li>Developing a clever sense of humour, engaging in word-play and abstraction, at quite an early age.<\/li>\n<li>Early potty-training, maybe potty training easily without much encouragement.<\/li>\n<li>Seeming to understand emotions well and how their actions will affect themselves and others.<\/li>\n<li>Being difficult to discipline or &#8216;train&#8217; (e.g. sleep training) with most efforts failing with spectacular, unending tantrums.<\/li>\n<li>Hating dummies and bottles and tooth-brushing and other things that you might put in their mouth or on their body. Again, with violent and outright rejection.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to judge other people&#8217;s children as you don&#8217;t spend all day every day with them, but we had noticed these traits as common things in particular kids<\/p>\n<p>There definitely seemed to be two types of child: those that do lots of the things above, and others that children fall asleep in restaurants, cafes, churches or other busy places. Those who are rarely content, and often bothered or distracted, and those who happily sit in buggies and stare into the distance, ignoring everything around them. Stuff like that.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes we wondered if some of the bothered\/distracted children were somewhere on the autistic scale. But they often had good social skills and other things about them just weren&#8217;t extreme enough.<\/p>\n<p>But it nagged us that some of these children seemed different somehow.<\/p>\n<h2>And me&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s me. I&#8217;m logical, deep-thinking, cautious. I make &#8216;anxious predictions&#8217; about the future, usually based on dwelled-upon past experiences. I worry about what other people think. A LOT!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m an ambivert. I think I&#8217;m mostly an introvert, but I&#8217;ve learned to deal with people quite well. I have a quite analytical approach to being extroverted &#8211; probably based on past experiences &#8211; and when that approach doesn&#8217;t work I get very left out.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a stickler for detail. I notice things that others don&#8217;t and they bother me. Interestingly, I&#8217;m not a very visual person &#8211; it&#8217;s almost a family joke that I don&#8217;t remember people by hair colour! I think this is because there&#8217;s less thinking to be done about visual things. I find people&#8217;s characters more interesting than their appearance.<\/p>\n<p>I &#8216;zone out&#8217; in activities.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m really hesitant to start doing things when I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing. Computers are an exception, but with DIY for example, I overthink everything before starting and it\u00a0makes it hard to get going with things that I&#8217;m not confident in.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a careful driver with high hazard perception. I love escaping to nature. I hate being too hot. I find some materials really cringy &#8211; tights and rough synthetic fabrics bring me out in goose bumps.<\/p>\n<p>I find travel hard. I think because I worry about all the things that could go wrong. Not big things like air crashes, but little things like being stuck in place where no one speaks English.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember much of my childhood, but the things I do remember are things that I know I dwelled on a lot at the time. Minor incidents that I thought over for weeks, and still occasionally think back to: I felt so stupid; why did I do it that way?<\/p>\n<p>I hate, hate, hate being punished or thought badly of. I got detention once at school. Most people just seemed to brush this off, but I was devastated. I think the teacher ended up letting me off as it was my first time ever. But it was massively emotional for me.<\/p>\n<h2>HSP<\/h2>\n<p>These kind of traits, it turns out, are associated with a genetic character trait known under various names, but which I&#8217;ll refer to as &#8220;high sensitivity&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Discovering high sensitivity was one of the biggest &#8220;aha!&#8221; moments of my life.<\/p>\n<p>High sensitivity is present in around 20-25% of people (and a similar percentage in some animals), and it&#8217;s more easy to see in small children &#8211; adults developing coping mechanisms, so it&#8217;s not always as clear. This totally fits with our observations about other children.<\/p>\n<p>Highly sensitive people don&#8217;t get more sensory input, but they do appear to process it more intensely. You can probably see how this results in a lot of the traits mentioned above, but let me give an example that applies to small children: reading. Some kids just breeze through a book. But have you ever come across a child who doesn&#8217;t just let the story go in; who points all all the tiny details in the pictures, and asks questions about crazy-detailed things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>That owl has yellow feet!<\/li>\n<li>What is the owl doing?<\/li>\n<li>What is his name?<\/li>\n<li>Is the grass wet?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Stuff like that. I mean, kids ask these kinds of questions. But with with some it seems almost relentless.<\/p>\n<p>And highly sensitive people think harder about things. That&#8217;s definitely not saying that non-highly-sensitive people always think less; but the highly sensitive person will tend to think things through more. They will more readily make predictions based on previous experiences. They will get more emotional. They will be more cautious and conscientious.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the behaviour of highly sensitive people is explained in terms of reflexes. You can think of people as having a &#8220;go-ahead&#8221; reflex, and a &#8220;hold on&#8221; reflex. In highly sensitive people the &#8220;hold on&#8221; reflex is stronger, causing them to hesitate and think things through. It&#8217;s not that they don&#8217;t have the &#8220;go ahead&#8221; reflex, it&#8217;s just countered or balanced out more. What this can mean is that a highly sensitive person can be more hesitant at first, but once they&#8217;ve decided something is safe or good, they will go at it with great energy and excitement.<\/p>\n<h2>Society and HSP&#8217;s<\/h2>\n<p>Society doesn&#8217;t always value the trait of high sensitivity. This has bothered me, personally, greatly in my life.<\/p>\n<p>Take the travel thing. I&#8217;m a home bird. I like things that are familiar And where I know how they work. Going to places where I don&#8217;t speak the native language, where I don&#8217;t know if the natives will speak my language, and where I don&#8217;t know how things work, freaks me out.<\/p>\n<p>Even really simple things like going to a cafe. Cafes work differently in different parts of the world. Am I supposed to sit down and be served? Or order at the bar? If I order at the bar, will they bring my food over or do I take it with me? Do I pay when I order or before we leave? What if I sit down and they come over to ask what I want and I don&#8217;t understand what they&#8217;re saying and they don&#8217;t speak English and I can&#8217;t point at things on display to show what I want. I&#8217;ll look really stupid and we won&#8217;t be able to get lunch and&#8230;oh&#8230;why are we abroad?!?<\/p>\n<p>From what I can tell, most people just think: &#8220;Ah, well get by!&#8221; and get on with it. But these are genuine things that I think and worry about, and that I dwell on afterwards for hours.<\/p>\n<p>Classic high sensitivity.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also not an explorer. I don&#8217;t care all that much for seeing\/experiencing new things. Though whether that&#8217;s an innate part of me, or simply an it&#8217;s-not-worth-the-hassle response to finding being in new places difficult I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, where was I going with this? Ah yes. Society.<\/p>\n<p>Society thinks I&#8217;m odd because I don&#8217;t like travel.<\/p>\n<p>Seriously: how many people do you know that approach the subject of foreign holidays with dread? Or that would rather stay in the UK? And how many people do you know that think &#8220;It&#8217;s great that that person doesn&#8217;t want to travel. I totally understand their desire to go somewhere familiar and comfortable and not expand their horizons?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s not many. Society doesn&#8217;t think that this is a positive thing. Society sees this as being afraid or xenophobic. My fears are made out to be silly or easy to overcome. But the truth is that every time I push myself and go on a foreign holiday I have a mid-week meltdown and want to go home. Holidays should be restful and easy, not panic-inducing stress-fests!<\/p>\n<p>What else? Shyness is generally seen as bad. &#8216;Adventurous&#8217; is a quality to aspire to, and those who aren&#8217;t are seen as boring. Risk taking is rewarded, while thinking carefully and planning things out is seen as anal or risk-averse. A &#8216;who cares&#8217; attitude generally seems to get you by better in life than worrying about what others will think.<\/p>\n<p>I feel like other people can easily decide to do exciting and adventurous things, whereas I&#8217;m cautious and immediately see things that need fixing before I can do something adventurous, and that, somehow, makes me feel inferior.<\/p>\n<p>And the children?<\/p>\n<p>Well, let&#8217;s take a look at primary schools. I know of modern primary schools that have large year 1 classes that are effectively in a shared space with a pre-school. This means up to about 60 or 70 little people and their carers all occupying the same space. A space which has lots of displays and activities to do. Lots of people potentially engaging in lots of different things at the same time. Lots of noise. Lots of multi-sensory stimuli.<\/p>\n<p>This sounds like a nightmare kind of environment for ME to be in, let alone a 3 year old person with little emotional intelligence and who is likely to be highly stimulated by all this stuff all day long.<\/p>\n<p>Primary Schools, to me, do not seem to cater very well for highly sensitive children. It seems to me like they try to be stimulating learning environments, when that&#8217;s exactly not what the highly sensitive child needs.<\/p>\n<p>Society seems to think that a loud, busy environment is normal and good for children, and that if a child is sat quietly and intently assembling Lego and ignoring the children around him then that is bad.<\/p>\n<p>Then there are children&#8217;s films. Some films, even U rated, are absolutely chock full of scary stuff. &#8216;Finding Nemo&#8217;, for example, is just wall-to-wall mild peril; a series of mini-disaster movies plugged together with an over-arching narrative which is also one of strong emotions and minor catastrophe.<\/p>\n<p>It seems like children are expected to take stories like this in their stride; appreciate the comedy in them; enjoy the ride. But if you&#8217;re three, and you&#8217;re thinking about every detail and you&#8217;re experiencing the music and images more intensely, and you&#8217;re empathising with the characters and worrying about what they might be going through&#8230;then films like these are pretty terrifying.<\/p>\n<p>Generally the world is a loud and busy place and children are expected to just deal with it. Some seem to sail through. But others are distracted by it, intrigued by it, over-stimulated by it, scared by it, or bothered by it.<\/p>\n<p>This is both a huge problem, and a huge opportunity. But the world doesn&#8217;t always seem to see it that way.<\/p>\n<h2>Acceptance and the joy of being highly sensitive<\/h2>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve said, it&#8217;s been a complete revelation to me, understanding why I am like I am, but also understanding why these children we know are like they are too, and some of the ways in which that might help us to help them.<\/p>\n<p>There is a certain amount of acceptance involved. I&#8217;m now much more conscious of highly stimulating environments, and of my need to take time out to recover after being in busy places, or after being stimulated for too long.<\/p>\n<p>Understanding high sensitivity definitely helps in this way, but it also help me to see that other people don&#8217;t experience things in the same way that I do, and that&#8217;s helpful too. That makes me feel less like I&#8217;m shy or silly, and more &#8211; well, more like I&#8217;m just me and that&#8217;s OK.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also help me see the opportunities of being highly sensitive. This trait enables me to be a person that has a high level of attention to detail, which is great in my line of work. And not just visually, but, I think, empathically too. I think hard about the consequences of what I do on other people.<\/p>\n<p>Technical training is a great example. A long time ago now, I was delivering some technical training for a client alongside another, far more senior engineer. I was only actually teaching a few modules but was otherwise there to facilitate and help out during workshops. In a module prior to one that I was to teach, I was really aware that the senior trainer was using some technical language that had not been introduced. I let him complete his module then stepped up to teach my module. The first time I hit the same technical language I put it out there &#8220;Who knows what this means?&#8221; (very few people). &#8220;Who doesn&#8217;t know what this means?&#8221; (almost everyone).<\/p>\n<p>That empathy, that consciousness of what others might be thinking, can be REALLY helpful and I make use of my sensitivity to it a lot when having technical conversations with non-technical people.<\/p>\n<p>It also think it makes me really interested in things. Deep, difficult, interesting, obscure things. I&#8217;ve always said that I&#8217;d like to go back to University to study something weird like Philosophy of Maths; what&#8217;s the history of mathematical concepts, and how do we relate abstract mathematical concepts to real world things. I can look at 5 apples, they are countable. But what does the square root of 5 look like? Why is that useful? This kind of thing intrigues\u00a0me.<\/p>\n<p>I think the trait makes me a grammar pedant. Which is a good thing. It&#8217;s a good thing to know the difference between &#8220;knowing your shit&#8221; and &#8220;knowing you&#8217;re shit&#8221;, right?<\/p>\n<p>With highly sensitive children, they may be natural spotter of patterns; remarkable with numbers and letters; reading far above their age level.<\/p>\n<h2>What does all this mean?<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve written this because I want people to understand other people who may be highly sensitive.<\/p>\n<p>I want people to know that a child walking into a busy room might find it difficult and need time to adjust &#8211; and then some time out later.<\/p>\n<p>I want people to know that people who seem shy or quiet might be really struggling.<\/p>\n<p>I want people to know that being outgoing and outrageous and carefree aren&#8217;t the only &#8220;good&#8221; ways to be. Quiet, thoughtful, sensitive people are important in our world too and we should seek to understand them, value them, and nurture them.<\/p>\n<p>As I said earlier, discovering high-sensitivity has been a revelation to me and to my immediate family. It explains so much about me and about some of these children that we have observed, and it gives us some tools and strategies for accepting ourselves and each other, and for understanding each other too.<\/p>\n<p>This has been long, but I hope it has been useful. If any of it resonates, I recommend looking up <a href=\"http:\/\/hsperson.com\/\">Elaine Aron and her research and books<\/a> or do a Google Search to find out more by reading useful articles like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2014\/02\/26\/highly-sensitive-people-signs-habits_n_4810794.html\">this<\/a>, or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.parents.com\/toddlers-preschoolers\/development\/behavioral\/how-to-help-your-sensitive-child\/\">this<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps it will be a revelation to you too?<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ve been wondering about whether or not anyone does split testing in the real world with physical things.<\/p>\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, split testing is where you do an experiment where you change something for a proportion of people to see how they react and measure the effect. If the proportion experiencing the change react more favourably (for a given definition of favourably) then you make the change for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>An example is email subject lines. Marketing and campaigning emails are frequently split tested. The subject line or message has some variation and you measure the response (how many people open the email, how many people click a link in the email). If the variation has a higher response rate then you adopt that change in the future.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m SURE they do this kind of thing in the real world, but I&#8217;ve been trying to think of examples.<\/p>\n<p>Now, recently there was a story about Leicestershire police ignoring attempted burglaries at odd numbered houses. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-leicestershire-33788264\">BBC actually gave a fairly accurate report<\/a>,\u00a0as did some other places, but the headline clearly didn&#8217;t communicate the reality.<\/p>\n<p>And the reality was that this was a real-world split test! Burglaries were attended, but the forensics team were previously being sent to every case. Forensics were only helping in a very small number of cases, so they decided it wasn&#8217;t worth doing, but wanted to know if the public would mind forensics NOT being sent in to every case.<\/p>\n<p>So they tested public reaction with a split test. Forensics would only be sent to critical cases, and in non-critical cases, only to burglaries with odd house numbers.<\/p>\n<p>Strangely fascinating.

        "content": "<p>Here&#8217;s a quick interesting thing. I&#8217;ve been wondering about whether or not anyone does split testing in the real world with physical things.<\/p>\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, split testing is where you do an experiment where you change something for a proportion of people to see how they react and measure the effect. If the proportion experiencing the change react more favourably (for a given definition of favourably) then you make the change for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>An example is email subject lines. Marketing and campaigning emails are frequently split tested. The subject line or message has some variation and you measure the response (how many people open the email, how many people click a link in the email). If the variation has a higher response rate then you adopt that change in the future.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m SURE they do this kind of thing in the real world, but I&#8217;ve been trying to think of examples.<\/p>\n<p>Now, recently there was a story about Leicestershire police ignoring attempted burglaries at odd numbered houses. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-leicestershire-33788264\">BBC actually gave a fairly accurate report<\/a>,\u00a0as did some other places, but the headline clearly didn&#8217;t communicate the reality.<\/p>\n<p>And the reality was that this was a real-world split test! Burglaries were attended, but the forensics team were previously being sent to every case. Forensics were only helping in a very small number of cases, so they decided it wasn&#8217;t worth doing, but wanted to know if the public would mind forensics NOT being sent in to every case.<\/p>\n<p>So they tested public reaction with a split test. Forensics would only be sent to critical cases, and in non-critical cases, only to burglaries with odd house numbers.<\/p>\n<p>Strangely fascinating. Hear more at the BBC&#8217;s More or Less podcast; about seven minutes in:<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/p030bct8<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<h4>An all-round, family adventure and commuting bike that brings out the inner hooligan. Bought from a fantastic local bike shop in Swindon centre.<\/h4>\n<h2>Me and my bikes<\/h2>\n<p>So, a bit of history. I love bikes and cycling, as you can probably tell. But my stable has until now consisted of only a cheap Raleigh Pioneer hybrid, and a low-to-mid-range Felt Road bike.<\/p>\n<p>When we first moved to Swindon, the Raleigh was a great starting point, but I quickly become fed up with the upright position &#8211; I wanted something more sporty.<\/p>\n<p>This was about 8 years ago when bikes were either mountain, road (or tourer) or simple hybrid. Though Cyclocross bikes were an option too, albeit an unusual one at the time.<\/p>\n<p>So, when I decided to add a second bike, I really had to choose between trail or road. I chose road. Mostly because I&#8217;m surrounded by nice, meandering country roads, and most real off-road trail riding is quite a way away.<\/p>\n<p>In the years that followed, the hybrid world seemed to go crazy. I remember seeing a <a href=\"http:\/\/road.cc\/content\/review\/24161-trek-portland\">Trek Portland<\/a> &#8211; an urban road\/cyclocross combo in retro brown-leather styling, but with disc brakes. WHAT?!?! \u00a0And ever since the hybrid spectrum seems to have gone nuts.<\/p>\n<p>More recently, I&#8217;ve had a small child to carry around. Deciding that the skinny, lightweight frame of my road bike wouldn&#8217;t like a 5kg bike seat and (now) 13kg toddler clinging to the seat tube and wobbling around, the road bike has pretty much been consigned to the shed while I pootle around, commuting in &#8220;normal clothes&#8221;, on the old faithful Raleigh. \u00a0Credit where credit&#8217;s due: that bike has taken a beating over the years and held up well for it&#8217;s \u00a3180 price tag and occasional service and spare part.<\/p>\n<p>And me? I&#8217;m truly post-MAMIL. I&#8217;m having a mid-life bike crisis. I&#8217;m a &#8220;Middle Aged Dad in Normal Clothes&#8221; &#8211; a MADINC! And I need something different.<\/p>\n<h2>Choosing a new steed<\/h2>\n<p>The Raleigh was getting rusty, and I was longing to get some sportiness back into my commute. I wanted a bike that would:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Let me carry Isaac to nursery, and on family adventures<\/li>\n<li>Let me cycle to work quickly and efficiently<\/li>\n<li>Let me do longer on-road, and possibly off-road (easy trails, not gnarly singletrack) rides for fitness<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I was sort-of inspired when I accidentally looked at a Boardman hybrid that seemed sporty but practical and had front suspension forks that with a quick-lock-out mechanism. &#8220;This could be it!&#8221;, I thought, &#8220;the do-everything hybrid&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So when we came into a little extra cash one day, we decided that we would buy some new bikes. And I got researching properly.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll spare you the long story, but I eliminated a load of bikes, shops, and brands, and ended up looking at Ridgebacks, which seemed to do a really good part of the spectrum of hybrids, and looked cool too. I&#8217;m not a visual person but I took a fancy to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ridgeback.co.uk\/bike\/x1\">X1<\/a> (you&#8217;ll notice the similarities to the Portland mentioned above), but wanted to check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ridgeback.co.uk\/bike\/mx4\">MX4<\/a> too with more nobbly tyres and suspension fork.<\/p>\n<p>I was torn about the fork. Would my use case really need suspension? Would it encourage me off road more? Or was it an unnecessary extra?<\/p>\n<p>In looking at the Ridgebacks we also came across Marin Bikes. I sat on a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marinbikes.com\/gb\/bikes\/description\/2015-fairfax-sc3\">Fairfax<\/a>: a rugged-looking, speedy urban commuter and really liked the feel from the word go. I then tried a slightly-chunkier <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marinbikes.com\/gb\/bikes\/description\/2015-muirwoods-29er\">Muirwoods 29er<\/a> and wrote it off because I didn&#8217;t like the really wide handlebar.<\/p>\n<p>A quick &#8211; no, it wasn&#8217;t quick, it was quite lengthly &#8211; chat with a guy who knows a lot about bikes decided at least one thing for me: I didn&#8217;t want a cheap suspension fork, and I couldn&#8217;t afford an expensive suspension fork. So a solid fork it was. Which meant the MX4 was out of the equation, and it was between the Ridgeback X1 and the Marins &#8211; probably the Fairfax.<\/p>\n<p>So I went back to the shop and tried them all. Initially they didn&#8217;t have the X1 in, and I tried the Fairfax and Muirwoods again. And&#8230;to my surprise&#8230;ended up preferring the more mountain-bikey Muirwoods. \u00a0The X1 demo bike hadn&#8217;t arrived, so I went away to mull things over.<\/p>\n<p>The Muirwoods just felt&#8230;FUN! I looked up reviews. Reviews of the specific bikes I&#8217;d been looking at were hard to come across, but the Muirwoods had one:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Fun, tough, practical<\/em><\/p>\n<p>said <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/gear\/category\/bikes\/urban\/product\/review-marin-muirwoods-29er-10-37582\/\">Bike Radar<\/a>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>[The Muirwoods] encourages a belligerent approach to your commute that your mum wouldn\u2019t like. It brings out the inner hooligan as you look for every opportunity to carve a corner or dive through a gap. It&#8217;s huge fun.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Yes. Yes it was. I could tell just taking it for a quick spin outside the shop. It was fun. It wanted to play.<\/p>\n<p>And that feeling prevailed when I went back to compare the Muirwoods with the X1. I sat on the X1. It looked great. It was really comfortable. It rode well. It would probably have been a great all-rounder of a bike capable of doing all the things that I wanted to do. But when I sat on it, I felt like I was riding to the office.<\/p>\n<p>When I sat on the Muirwoods, I felt like I was riding to the skate park, or the forest. I felt like I could do Danny Macaskill tricks on my way to work. But also that it would get me around on the roads in speed and with comfort too.<\/p>\n<p>I ordered the Muirwoods. I was undecided for about an afternoon about whether or not I&#8217;d done the right thing. I&#8217;d never met my inner-hooligan before. What was about to happen?!<\/p>\n<p>The indecision soon passed. It was play time!<\/p>\n<h2>The Marin<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had the Marin for a few months now. It&#8217;s a great bike. I love it to bits. It&#8217;s a true all-rounder. Here&#8217;s some of what&#8217;s different, good and bad about it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s to like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I like the extra-wide handlebar. It took a while to get used to, but it adds to the fun of the ride. It does, however, sometimes make it difficult to park in a busy bike rack!<\/p>\n<p>I like the disc brakes. My first experience of them, and I&#8217;m totally convinced so far.<\/p>\n<p>I like the big, wide pedals. They make it really easy to hop on and off and just get going.<\/p>\n<p>I like the subtle reflective decals and reflective tyre walls. Neat little touches. And I&#8217;m glad that reflective tyres seem more common these days &#8211; especially in a town with lots of roundabouts when side-on visibility is key.<\/p>\n<p>I like that it has eyelets and space for mud guards as they&#8217;re essential for a commuter. The guys in the bike shop got me some great guards and spent a good time getting them fitted well.<\/p>\n<p>I like that it&#8217;s black.<\/p>\n<p>I like the big wheels and choice of tyres. It rolls nicely both off and on-road.<\/p>\n<p>I like the MTB shifters. They&#8217;re fast, accessible, accurate. Yes, the cables stretch over time, but these work well. The components are at a good level here.<\/p>\n<p>I like that it doesn&#8217;t have suspension. It turns out that I really don&#8217;t need it and it&#8217;s one thing less to worry about.<\/p>\n<p>I like that I can happily carry my three-year-old around on it in his seat. Fitting the bracket for the seat was easy and he&#8217;s quite happy on it.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s lots to like! From the bigger-picture overall feel of the thing, right down to tiny details like the decals and reflectives.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It has this steel frame.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Which is kinda weird. Bike nerds please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong here but I&#8217;ll try to explain what I know.<\/p>\n<p>Steel is less stiff; it flexes more. \u00a0But it&#8217;s stronger; it&#8217;s less likely to break or bend. Steel is also heavier. But because of the increased strength you need less of it. So it has these really thin tubes made of really thin metal. And this makes the bike &#8220;ring&#8221; slightly. There&#8217;s actually this odd noise when the frame is tapped or knocked or it experiences a jolt. \u00a0This sound take a while to get used to and it does give the bike a whole different character. I wasn&#8217;t sure what I was riding at first.<\/p>\n<p>Steel also feels different. It&#8217;s hard to explain this. It&#8217;s highly qualitative. It&#8217;s just weird. You&#8217;ll have to take my word for it. But you get used to it. And it&#8217;s not bad &#8211; just different.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It feels like it has a &#8220;missing gear&#8221;.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Between cogs\u00a05 and 6. It needs an extra 5-and-a-half&#8217;th gear. Which is kinda awkward because at a reasonable pace 5th gear is too low, and 6th is too high. This comes up in the reviews. And it&#8217;s totally true.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I THINK it needs different grips.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The grips are OK but not very comfortable. \u00a0They&#8217;re round and flat. I always felt like they were intended to make you hold on for dear life, which, given the nature of the bike, isn&#8217;t a bad idea. They felt especially harsh at first, but I&#8217;ve got used to them. \u00a0I&#8217;m not sure how I&#8217;d get on with them on a longer ride though.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I THINK it needs a different saddle.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is a similar story to the grips. It felt really harsh at first but I&#8217;ve grown accustomed to it. You may want to add a more comfortable saddle of your own choosing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stupid\u00a0cable\/hose clips<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Details, details. The other crazy thing is the C-shaped cable\/hose clips used to hold the cables\/hoses to the frame are plastic and, well, they just fall off. Perhaps there&#8217;s a good reason for their use, but I quickly replaced them with proper cable ties. A tiny thing, but annoying none the less.<\/p>\n<h2>The Bike Shop: @thehub, Swindon<\/h2>\n<p>I want to give an extra special plug to the guys that sold us our new bikes: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.atthehub.website\/\">@thehub<\/a>. They are a new, startup, bike shop and coffee shop in central Swindon.<\/p>\n<p>@thehub is\u00a0a new business, and I went in to chat with them when they first opened. They&#8217;re brilliant. Super-friendly, proper helpful. The staff have gone totally out of their way to give us advice, let us try things out, and generally provide awesome customer service &#8211; even down to making sure my mudguards were installed JUST right. Their attention to detail is superb, as is their coffee and hot chocolate.<\/p>\n<p>As a new, and fairly small bike shop they have limited stock.

        "content": "<h4>An all-round, family adventure and commuting bike that brings out the inner hooligan. Bought from a fantastic local bike shop in Swindon centre.<\/h4>\n<h2>Me and my bikes<\/h2>\n<p>So, a bit of history. I love bikes and cycling, as you can probably tell. But my stable has until now consisted of only a cheap Raleigh Pioneer hybrid, and a low-to-mid-range Felt Road bike.<\/p>\n<p>When we first moved to Swindon, the Raleigh was a great starting point, but I quickly become fed up with the upright position &#8211; I wanted something more sporty.<\/p>\n<p>This was about 8 years ago when bikes were either mountain, road (or tourer) or simple hybrid. Though Cyclocross bikes were an option too, albeit an unusual one at the time.<\/p>\n<p>So, when I decided to add a second bike, I really had to choose between trail or road. I chose road. Mostly because I&#8217;m surrounded by nice, meandering country roads, and most real off-road trail riding is quite a way away.<\/p>\n<p>In the years that followed, the hybrid world seemed to go crazy. I remember seeing a <a href=\"http:\/\/road.cc\/content\/review\/24161-trek-portland\">Trek Portland<\/a> &#8211; an urban road\/cyclocross combo in retro brown-leather styling, but with disc brakes. WHAT?!?! \u00a0And ever since the hybrid spectrum seems to have gone nuts.<\/p>\n<p>More recently, I&#8217;ve had a small child to carry around. Deciding that the skinny, lightweight frame of my road bike wouldn&#8217;t like a 5kg bike seat and (now) 13kg toddler clinging to the seat tube and wobbling around, the road bike has pretty much been consigned to the shed while I pootle around, commuting in &#8220;normal clothes&#8221;, on the old faithful Raleigh. \u00a0Credit where credit&#8217;s due: that bike has taken a beating over the years and held up well for it&#8217;s \u00a3180 price tag and occasional service and spare part.<\/p>\n<p>And me? I&#8217;m truly post-MAMIL. I&#8217;m having a mid-life bike crisis. I&#8217;m a &#8220;Middle Aged Dad in Normal Clothes&#8221; &#8211; a MADINC! And I need something different.<\/p>\n<h2>Choosing a new steed<\/h2>\n<p>The Raleigh was getting rusty, and I was longing to get some sportiness back into my commute. I wanted a bike that would:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Let me carry Isaac to nursery, and on family adventures<\/li>\n<li>Let me cycle to work quickly and efficiently<\/li>\n<li>Let me do longer on-road, and possibly off-road (easy trails, not gnarly singletrack) rides for fitness<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I was sort-of inspired when I accidentally looked at a Boardman hybrid that seemed sporty but practical and had front suspension forks that with a quick-lock-out mechanism. &#8220;This could be it!&#8221;, I thought, &#8220;the do-everything hybrid&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So when we came into a little extra cash one day, we decided that we would buy some new bikes. And I got researching properly.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll spare you the long story, but I eliminated a load of bikes, shops, and brands, and ended up looking at Ridgebacks, which seemed to do a really good part of the spectrum of hybrids, and looked cool too. I&#8217;m not a visual person but I took a fancy to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ridgeback.co.uk\/bike\/x1\">X1<\/a> (you&#8217;ll notice the similarities to the Portland mentioned above), but wanted to check out the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ridgeback.co.uk\/bike\/mx4\">MX4<\/a> too with more nobbly tyres and suspension fork.<\/p>\n<p>I was torn about the fork. Would my use case really need suspension? Would it encourage me off road more? Or was it an unnecessary extra?<\/p>\n<p>In looking at the Ridgebacks we also came across Marin Bikes. I sat on a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marinbikes.com\/gb\/bikes\/description\/2015-fairfax-sc3\">Fairfax<\/a>: a rugged-looking, speedy urban commuter and really liked the feel from the word go. I then tried a slightly-chunkier <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marinbikes.com\/gb\/bikes\/description\/2015-muirwoods-29er\">Muirwoods 29er<\/a> and wrote it off because I didn&#8217;t like the really wide handlebar.<\/p>\n<p>A quick &#8211; no, it wasn&#8217;t quick, it was quite lengthly &#8211; chat with a guy who knows a lot about bikes decided at least one thing for me: I didn&#8217;t want a cheap suspension fork, and I couldn&#8217;t afford an expensive suspension fork. So a solid fork it was. Which meant the MX4 was out of the equation, and it was between the Ridgeback X1 and the Marins &#8211; probably the Fairfax.<\/p>\n<p>So I went back to the shop and tried them all. Initially they didn&#8217;t have the X1 in, and I tried the Fairfax and Muirwoods again. And&#8230;to my surprise&#8230;ended up preferring the more mountain-bikey Muirwoods. \u00a0The X1 demo bike hadn&#8217;t arrived, so I went away to mull things over.<\/p>\n<p>The Muirwoods just felt&#8230;FUN! I looked up reviews. Reviews of the specific bikes I&#8217;d been looking at were hard to come across, but the Muirwoods had one:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Fun, tough, practical<\/em><\/p>\n<p>said <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/gear\/category\/bikes\/urban\/product\/review-marin-muirwoods-29er-10-37582\/\">Bike Radar<\/a>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>[The Muirwoods] encourages a belligerent approach to your commute that your mum wouldn\u2019t like. It brings out the inner hooligan as you look for every opportunity to carve a corner or dive through a gap. It&#8217;s huge fun.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Yes. Yes it was. I could tell just taking it for a quick spin outside the shop. It was fun. It wanted to play.<\/p>\n<p>And that feeling prevailed when I went back to compare the Muirwoods with the X1. I sat on the X1. It looked great. It was really comfortable. It rode well. It would probably have been a great all-rounder of a bike capable of doing all the things that I wanted to do. But when I sat on it, I felt like I was riding to the office.<\/p>\n<p>When I sat on the Muirwoods, I felt like I was riding to the skate park, or the forest. I felt like I could do Danny Macaskill tricks on my way to work. But also that it would get me around on the roads in speed and with comfort too.<\/p>\n<p>I ordered the Muirwoods. I was undecided for about an afternoon about whether or not I&#8217;d done the right thing. I&#8217;d never met my inner-hooligan before. What was about to happen?!<\/p>\n<p>The indecision soon passed. It was play time!<\/p>\n<h2>The Marin<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had the Marin for a few months now. It&#8217;s a great bike. I love it to bits. It&#8217;s a true all-rounder. Here&#8217;s some of what&#8217;s different, good and bad about it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s to like?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I like the extra-wide handlebar. It took a while to get used to, but it adds to the fun of the ride. It does, however, sometimes make it difficult to park in a busy bike rack!<\/p>\n<p>I like the disc brakes. My first experience of them, and I&#8217;m totally convinced so far.<\/p>\n<p>I like the big, wide pedals. They make it really easy to hop on and off and just get going.<\/p>\n<p>I like the subtle reflective decals and reflective tyre walls. Neat little touches. And I&#8217;m glad that reflective tyres seem more common these days &#8211; especially in a town with lots of roundabouts when side-on visibility is key.<\/p>\n<p>I like that it has eyelets and space for mud guards as they&#8217;re essential for a commuter. The guys in the bike shop got me some great guards and spent a good time getting them fitted well.<\/p>\n<p>I like that it&#8217;s black.<\/p>\n<p>I like the big wheels and choice of tyres. It rolls nicely both off and on-road.<\/p>\n<p>I like the MTB shifters. They&#8217;re fast, accessible, accurate. Yes, the cables stretch over time, but these work well. The components are at a good level here.<\/p>\n<p>I like that it doesn&#8217;t have suspension. It turns out that I really don&#8217;t need it and it&#8217;s one thing less to worry about.<\/p>\n<p>I like that I can happily carry my three-year-old around on it in his seat. Fitting the bracket for the seat was easy and he&#8217;s quite happy on it.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s lots to like! From the bigger-picture overall feel of the thing, right down to tiny details like the decals and reflectives.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It has this steel frame.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Which is kinda weird. Bike nerds please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong here but I&#8217;ll try to explain what I know.<\/p>\n<p>Steel is less stiff; it flexes more. \u00a0But it&#8217;s stronger; it&#8217;s less likely to break or bend. Steel is also heavier. But because of the increased strength you need less of it. So it has these really thin tubes made of really thin metal. And this makes the bike &#8220;ring&#8221; slightly. There&#8217;s actually this odd noise when the frame is tapped or knocked or it experiences a jolt. \u00a0This sound take a while to get used to and it does give the bike a whole different character. I wasn&#8217;t sure what I was riding at first.<\/p>\n<p>Steel also feels different. It&#8217;s hard to explain this. It&#8217;s highly qualitative. It&#8217;s just weird. You&#8217;ll have to take my word for it. But you get used to it. And it&#8217;s not bad &#8211; just different.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It feels like it has a &#8220;missing gear&#8221;.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Between cogs\u00a05 and 6. It needs an extra 5-and-a-half&#8217;th gear. Which is kinda awkward because at a reasonable pace 5th gear is too low, and 6th is too high. This comes up in the reviews. And it&#8217;s totally true.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I THINK it needs different grips.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The grips are OK but not very comfortable. \u00a0They&#8217;re round and flat. I always felt like they were intended to make you hold on for dear life, which, given the nature of the bike, isn&#8217;t a bad idea. They felt especially harsh at first, but I&#8217;ve got used to them. \u00a0I&#8217;m not sure how I&#8217;d get on with them on a longer ride though.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I THINK it needs a different saddle.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is a similar story to the grips. It felt really harsh at first but I&#8217;ve grown accustomed to it. You may want to add a more comfortable saddle of your own choosing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stupid\u00a0cable\/hose clips<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Details, details. The other crazy thing is the C-shaped cable\/hose clips used to hold the cables\/hoses to the frame are plastic and, well, they just fall off. Perhaps there&#8217;s a good reason for their use, but I quickly replaced them with proper cable ties. A tiny thing, but annoying none the less.<\/p>\n<h2>The Bike Shop: @thehub, Swindon<\/h2>\n<p>I want to give an extra special plug to the guys that sold us our new bikes: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.atthehub.website\/\">@thehub<\/a>. They are a new, startup, bike shop and coffee shop in central Swindon.<\/p>\n<p>@thehub is\u00a0a new business, and I went in to chat with them when they first opened. They&#8217;re brilliant. Super-friendly, proper helpful. The staff have gone totally out of their way to give us advice, let us try things out, and generally provide awesome customer service &#8211; even down to making sure my mudguards were installed JUST right. Their attention to detail is superb, as is their coffee and hot chocolate.<\/p>\n<p>As a new, and fairly small bike shop they have limited stock. But if you are in the market for a new bike or for a service or parts, I highly recommend them and would urge you to support this new local business. It&#8217;s a real asset to our town centre.<\/p>\n<h2>In summary<\/h2>\n<p>My mid-life crisis is complete. The lycra is gone. I&#8217;m a jeans-and-trainers wearing hooligan on a stealthy beast of a bike that goes everywhere and does everything. Family adventures here we come!<\/p>\n",

I didn&#8217;t really want to publish it until I had the full quote, which I managed to acquire this week. I think it&#8217;s still relevant.<\/p>\n<p>All sorts of things are &#8216;speaking&#8217; to me at the moment about life.<\/p>\n<p>Last night we did a bit of TV catchup and saw the jungle episode of the BBC&#8217;s brilliant &#8216;Human Planet&#8217;. And while the programme as a whole was extraordinary what got me was the little &#8216;the making of&#8217; documentary at the end.<\/p>\n<p>For those that missed it they&#8217;d done a section on a tribe of people who, with primitive tools, had built a tree house&#8230;in a 35m-high tree!! The tribesmen climbed to the treetops using not more than sticks and vines and strength and stamina. Yet, in the making-of we see the BBC crew all safety-harnessed up with lines and backup lines, helmets, etc.<\/p>\n<p>At the end they interviewed one of the crew. What had he learned from his visit?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I find I judge my own inadequacies against their expertise and knowledge. You know, you come here and you&#8217;ve got boots on in case of snake bites, you&#8217;ve got sun cream on because of the sun. You know, you&#8217;ve got twin safety ropes to make sure if one fails you&#8217;re caught on the other one. And these guys? OK, maybe they have a higher mortality rate, but they&#8217;re much freer in their lifestyle. You know, they&#8217;ll shimmy up and down these trees. I think I&#8217;d much rather lead a fuller, shorter life like they do out here.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The impact of a simpler, freer life is clear.

        "content": "<p>Editorial note: I started writing this in 2013 after seeing an episode of &#8216;Human Planet&#8217;. I didn&#8217;t really want to publish it until I had the full quote, which I managed to acquire this week. I think it&#8217;s still relevant.<\/p>\n<p>All sorts of things are &#8216;speaking&#8217; to me at the moment about life.<\/p>\n<p>Last night we did a bit of TV catchup and saw the jungle episode of the BBC&#8217;s brilliant &#8216;Human Planet&#8217;. And while the programme as a whole was extraordinary what got me was the little &#8216;the making of&#8217; documentary at the end.<\/p>\n<p>For those that missed it they&#8217;d done a section on a tribe of people who, with primitive tools, had built a tree house&#8230;in a 35m-high tree!! The tribesmen climbed to the treetops using not more than sticks and vines and strength and stamina. Yet, in the making-of we see the BBC crew all safety-harnessed up with lines and backup lines, helmets, etc.<\/p>\n<p>At the end they interviewed one of the crew. What had he learned from his visit?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I find I judge my own inadequacies against their expertise and knowledge. You know, you come here and you&#8217;ve got boots on in case of snake bites, you&#8217;ve got sun cream on because of the sun. You know, you&#8217;ve got twin safety ropes to make sure if one fails you&#8217;re caught on the other one. And these guys? OK, maybe they have a higher mortality rate, but they&#8217;re much freer in their lifestyle. You know, they&#8217;ll shimmy up and down these trees. I think I&#8217;d much rather lead a fuller, shorter life like they do out here.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The impact of a simpler, freer life is clear. How much do we miss out on experiences because of caution, rules, expectations.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, sometimes, the risk of &#8216;going ropeless&#8217; is worth it.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ve rewritten it in <a href=\"http:\/\/laravel.com\">Laravel<\/a>: a PHP-based rapid application development framework. And one thing I learned is that launching even a super, super simple web application in public is a far from rapid process.<\/p>\n<p>Hasyourbabyarrivedyet.com is basically a big red button that changes the word &#8220;NO&#8221; to the word &#8220;YES&#8221;. Other than that function the app needs user registration, and log in and log out functionality. And yes, that&#8217;s pretty much it.<\/p>\n<p>Except, if you&#8217;re making a thing like this public, search-engine indexable, social-media optimised, responsive\/mobile friendly, secure and spam free. If you want it to handle outgoing email well, include analytics and be user friendly. And probably a host of things that I&#8217;ve not considered.<\/p>\n<p>At one point, the app was, to all intents and purposes, functionally complete. \u00a0But my todo list for it looked something like this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add analytics<\/li>\n<li>Write privacy\/cookie policy for cookies and basic terms and conditions<\/li>\n<li>Add welcome notice after login<\/li>\n<li>Add ReCapthca to prevent spam<\/li>\n<li>Configure transactional email (MailGun)<\/li>\n<li>Send email to admin on signup<\/li>\n<li>Explain form fields<\/li>\n<li>Add OpenGraph and other meta data and sort titles<\/li>\n<li>Test in Facebook debugger<\/li>\n<li>Add favicons<\/li>\n<li>Add about page<\/li>\n<li>Configure email forwarding<\/li>\n<li>Add sitemap<\/li>\n<li>Make sure webmaster tools works<\/li>\n<li>Add to uptime and domain monitoring<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And so on.<\/p>\n<p>I knew all of these things had to be done, and it didn&#8217;t take me long to rattle through the list, but the process reminded me that rapidly developing an application is one thing. But there&#8217;s so much ancillary stuff that you need to do to make something public on the internet.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be fooled. Tools help developers achieve great things in short spaces of time. But a good launch requires thought, planning and knowledge of quite a few things that go beyond the realms of just coding something.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I forgot some things too. If I did please let me know in the comments.<\/p>\n<p>And feel free to share the site with any friends you have that are expecting. Being constantly asked &#8220;has your baby arrived yet&#8221; is a bit of a bore. ?<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ve rewritten it in <a href=\"http:\/\/laravel.com\">Laravel<\/a>: a PHP-based rapid application development framework. And one thing I learned is that launching even a super, super simple web application in public is a far from rapid process.<\/p>\n<p>Hasyourbabyarrivedyet.com is basically a big red button that changes the word &#8220;NO&#8221; to the word &#8220;YES&#8221;. Other than that function the app needs user registration, and log in and log out functionality. And yes, that&#8217;s pretty much it.<\/p>\n<p>Except, if you&#8217;re making a thing like this public, search-engine indexable, social-media optimised, responsive\/mobile friendly, secure and spam free. If you want it to handle outgoing email well, include analytics and be user friendly. And probably a host of things that I&#8217;ve not considered.<\/p>\n<p>At one point, the app was, to all intents and purposes, functionally complete. \u00a0But my todo list for it looked something like this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add analytics<\/li>\n<li>Write privacy\/cookie policy for cookies and basic terms and conditions<\/li>\n<li>Add welcome notice after login<\/li>\n<li>Add ReCapthca to prevent spam<\/li>\n<li>Configure transactional email (MailGun)<\/li>\n<li>Send email to admin on signup<\/li>\n<li>Explain form fields<\/li>\n<li>Add OpenGraph and other meta data and sort titles<\/li>\n<li>Test in Facebook debugger<\/li>\n<li>Add favicons<\/li>\n<li>Add about page<\/li>\n<li>Configure email forwarding<\/li>\n<li>Add sitemap<\/li>\n<li>Make sure webmaster tools works<\/li>\n<li>Add to uptime and domain monitoring<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And so on.<\/p>\n<p>I knew all of these things had to be done, and it didn&#8217;t take me long to rattle through the list, but the process reminded me that rapidly developing an application is one thing. But there&#8217;s so much ancillary stuff that you need to do to make something public on the internet.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be fooled. Tools help developers achieve great things in short spaces of time. But a good launch requires thought, planning and knowledge of quite a few things that go beyond the realms of just coding something.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I forgot some things too. If I did please let me know in the comments.<\/p>\n<p>And feel free to share the site with any friends you have that are expecting. Being constantly asked &#8220;has your baby arrived yet&#8221; is a bit of a bore. ?<\/p>\n",

The idea of having a WordPress REST API seems really good on the surface. It will let developers do some amazing things. But here&#8217;s the problem: <em>it will let developers do amazing things!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If developers can build cool things they will. They will build amazing new themes based on JS frameworks. And they will build new dashboards and editing interfaces.<\/p>\n<p>Is this good? Well, who knows? We can only guess and speculate at this point.<\/p>\n<p>I predict short term pain and confusion as lots of new things bolt on to the WordPress API. There will be fragmentation and experimentation as new user interfaces for WordPress appear. Users will be confused about what WordPress is. And after a while this will probably settle down and the good things will mature. But I think there may\u00a0still be confusion. And people may have lost faith in the mean time.<\/p>\n<h2>Ssssh&#8230;don&#8217;t tell anyone but&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>Now&#8230;here&#8217;s the thing. And I kinda need to whisper this because it may be quite controversial:<\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"color: #999999;\">WordPress doesn&#8217;t have a great data model for general purpose app development!<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Some people try to build really complex web applications using WordPress &#8211; yes, I have too! &#8211; and it&#8217;s hard and inefficient because of the limitations of the data model.<\/p>\n<p>So if you&#8217;re going to build a new JavaScript-based user interface that communicates with a back-end using a REST API then, well, it doesn&#8217;t matter what the back-end is. You can write your own. And it could well be better suited to a web-application&#8217;s needs than WordPress is.<\/p>\n<p>Many people are asking &#8220;What can we build on top of WordPress now that it has an API?&#8221; but an alternative question might be &#8220;If Calypso is a good user experience, what can we build to go behind Calypso?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s another way of looking at this too. I&#8217;m going to call it:<\/p>\n<h2>Throwing the baby out with the bathwater<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some of the things I really like about WordPress:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s actually a really well thought out blogging tool and simple CMS that has evolved over time<\/li>\n<li>It has (relatively) great built-in media management<\/li>\n<li>LOTS of people already know how to use it and are familiar with the UI<\/li>\n<li>It has loads of plugins that you can use to extend its functionality, many of which extend the UI<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s really easy to install and update &#8211; automatic security updates are great!<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s templating system isn&#8217;t great, but its easy to get to grips with which makes simple development work easy, and it&#8217;s a low barrier-of-entry for new developers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here are some of the things that I don&#8217;t like about WordPress:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It has a limited data model with no relationships between object types (taxonomies are not general purpose objects!) and no real ORM<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s well coded and easy to understand, but it doesn&#8217;t use modern &#8211; well quite well-established now! &#8211; patterns for development<\/li>\n<li>The PHP code is well documented. But the JavaScript code and libraries is\/are really hard to learn how to use.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It seems to me that building a new user interface using the REST API will embrace those things that I dislike while throwing away a lot of the things that I like. If you&#8217;re not going to use the Dashboard, then why accept the limitations of the data model?<\/p>\n<p>If I&#8217;m going to build a complex web app, I&#8217;m not going to use WordPress as a back-end because its data model is not good enough. It&#8217;s a data model designed for blogs and low-to-moderately complex websites.<\/p>\n<p>If I&#8217;m going to build a blog or low-to-moderately complex website then WordPress is ideal precisely because of the user interface. It&#8217;s a user interface designed for blogs and low-to-moderately complex websites.<\/p>\n<p>It seems to me that it&#8217;s the combination of these two things that makes WordPress what it is: the de-facto website content management system that powers more than 25% of the web. And that separating them could actually be a disaster.<\/p>\n<p>Even one of the WordPress REST API&#8217;s developers seems to agree:<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/twitter.com\/danielbachhuber\/status\/672207252019945472<\/p>\n<p>So the future for WordPress seems uncertain to me. In some ways I hope that all the UI experimentation comes to nothing and the API is just used to enhance the existing WordPress dashboard (AJAX-based post filtering and pagination PLEASE!!!). It seems to me that the Dashboard is one of WordPress&#8217;s best assets. Throw it out and it&#8217;s not WordPress anymore. Throw it out, and you may as well use something else altogether.<\/p>\n<p>This, for me, is the identity crisis that WordPress will have in the months and years to come.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h2>Change is upon us!<\/h2>\n<p>If you work with WordPress, that is.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t go into details on the <a href=\"http:\/\/wptavern.com\/the-first-half-of-the-rest-api-is-officially-added-to-wordpress-core\">WordPress REST API that&#8217;s going to be a part of the software soon<\/a>, or of &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/wptavern.com\/automattic-unveils-open-source-wordpress-desktop-application-for-the-mac\">Calypso<\/a>&#8221; which is a new tool for\u00a0edit content and managing WordPress sites (both wordpress.com and self-hosted wordpress.org) that uses an API (or two) to communicate with WordPress.<\/p>\n<p>But these things are coming&#8230;or are already here&#8230;and they will change what WordPress is.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this for a while. The idea of having a WordPress REST API seems really good on the surface. It will let developers do some amazing things. But here&#8217;s the problem: <em>it will let developers do amazing things!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If developers can build cool things they will. They will build amazing new themes based on JS frameworks. And they will build new dashboards and editing interfaces.<\/p>\n<p>Is this good? Well, who knows? We can only guess and speculate at this point.<\/p>\n<p>I predict short term pain and confusion as lots of new things bolt on to the WordPress API. There will be fragmentation and experimentation as new user interfaces for WordPress appear. Users will be confused about what WordPress is. And after a while this will probably settle down and the good things will mature. But I think there may\u00a0still be confusion. And people may have lost faith in the mean time.<\/p>\n<h2>Ssssh&#8230;don&#8217;t tell anyone but&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>Now&#8230;here&#8217;s the thing. And I kinda need to whisper this because it may be quite controversial:<\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"color: #999999;\">WordPress doesn&#8217;t have a great data model for general purpose app development!<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Some people try to build really complex web applications using WordPress &#8211; yes, I have too! &#8211; and it&#8217;s hard and inefficient because of the limitations of the data model.<\/p>\n<p>So if you&#8217;re going to build a new JavaScript-based user interface that communicates with a back-end using a REST API then, well, it doesn&#8217;t matter what the back-end is. You can write your own. And it could well be better suited to a web-application&#8217;s needs than WordPress is.<\/p>\n<p>Many people are asking &#8220;What can we build on top of WordPress now that it has an API?&#8221; but an alternative question might be &#8220;If Calypso is a good user experience, what can we build to go behind Calypso?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s another way of looking at this too. I&#8217;m going to call it:<\/p>\n<h2>Throwing the baby out with the bathwater<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some of the things I really like about WordPress:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s actually a really well thought out blogging tool and simple CMS that has evolved over time<\/li>\n<li>It has (relatively) great built-in media management<\/li>\n<li>LOTS of people already know how to use it and are familiar with the UI<\/li>\n<li>It has loads of plugins that you can use to extend its functionality, many of which extend the UI<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s really easy to install and update &#8211; automatic security updates are great!<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s templating system isn&#8217;t great, but its easy to get to grips with which makes simple development work easy, and it&#8217;s a low barrier-of-entry for new developers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here are some of the things that I don&#8217;t like about WordPress:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It has a limited data model with no relationships between object types (taxonomies are not general purpose objects!) and no real ORM<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s well coded and easy to understand, but it doesn&#8217;t use modern &#8211; well quite well-established now! &#8211; patterns for development<\/li>\n<li>The PHP code is well documented. But the JavaScript code and libraries is\/are really hard to learn how to use.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It seems to me that building a new user interface using the REST API will embrace those things that I dislike while throwing away a lot of the things that I like. If you&#8217;re not going to use the Dashboard, then why accept the limitations of the data model?<\/p>\n<p>If I&#8217;m going to build a complex web app, I&#8217;m not going to use WordPress as a back-end because its data model is not good enough. It&#8217;s a data model designed for blogs and low-to-moderately complex websites.<\/p>\n<p>If I&#8217;m going to build a blog or low-to-moderately complex website then WordPress is ideal precisely because of the user interface. It&#8217;s a user interface designed for blogs and low-to-moderately complex websites.<\/p>\n<p>It seems to me that it&#8217;s the combination of these two things that makes WordPress what it is: the de-facto website content management system that powers more than 25% of the web. And that separating them could actually be a disaster.<\/p>\n<p>Even one of the WordPress REST API&#8217;s developers seems to agree:<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/twitter.com\/danielbachhuber\/status\/672207252019945472<\/p>\n<p>So the future for WordPress seems uncertain to me. In some ways I hope that all the UI experimentation comes to nothing and the API is just used to enhance the existing WordPress dashboard (AJAX-based post filtering and pagination PLEASE!!!). It seems to me that the Dashboard is one of WordPress&#8217;s best assets. Throw it out and it&#8217;s not WordPress anymore. Throw it out, and you may as well use something else altogether.<\/p>\n<p>This, for me, is the identity crisis that WordPress will have in the months and years to come.<\/p>\n",

There&#8217;s plenty of other information online if you want that. But the existence of a couple of <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/amp\/\">WordPress<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/pagefrog\/\">plugins<\/a> for AMP got me thinking about what this would mean for smaller publishers, bloggers, and organisations producing content.<\/p>\n<p>In general, I dislike Facebook&#8217;s approach of sucking in the whole internet and keeping it within its own walled garden. Facebook wants to BE the internet and to not let people go outside of Facebook. Observe the lack of external sharing options in its mobile apps: the iOS app will let me copy a link, but there&#8217;s not access to a standard iOS sharing panel that might let me save to other apps that I have installed like Pocket or Evernote.<\/p>\n<p>So while I can see the advantages of Instant Articles for users and organisations, I have an idealogical objection to it.<\/p>\n<p>AMP is slightly different. Yes, Google will cache AMP pages. But Google also generally acts as an open space where you can leave Google&#8217;s space to do other things. But I prefer the openness of it.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, in theory Facebook (or anyone else) could be an AMP consumer platform and crawl AMP pages and suck them into its walled garden anyway. Hmm. \u00a0I&#8217;m not sure of the ethical, legal or idealogical aspects of that: re-publishing my content for me? This is gonna raise some interesting issues about who owns content and has the right to publish it and re-publish it.<\/p>\n<p>The other issue for me is one of user experience and user journey. AMP pages are&#8230;as far as I can tell&#8230;dead ends. It&#8217;s great that I can load a single page REALLY quickly. But what if I, as a publisher, want to build community or get feedback by having people comment on that page? Or if I want them to take an action based on the content of the page? Or if I want to try and keep visitors on my site by providing access to similar, related or important content?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve not done a deep dive into either technology, but it looks like some of these aspects are missing, and things like analytics and advertising are more complicated.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m missing something. I totally support the drive for a simpler, faster web, \u00a0will these projects help? I&#8217;m not sure. But if they do there will certainly be side-effects.<\/p>\n<p>Small publishers: take note, be informed, and use wisely.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>These are some un-structured thoughts on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ampproject.org\/\">Google&#8217;s Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/instantarticles.fb.com\/\">Facebook&#8217;s Instant Articles<\/a> that were too long for sharing on social media alone.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to cover what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ampproject.org\/\">AMP<\/a> is or what Instant Articles are. There&#8217;s plenty of other information online if you want that. But the existence of a couple of <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/amp\/\">WordPress<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/pagefrog\/\">plugins<\/a> for AMP got me thinking about what this would mean for smaller publishers, bloggers, and organisations producing content.<\/p>\n<p>In general, I dislike Facebook&#8217;s approach of sucking in the whole internet and keeping it within its own walled garden. Facebook wants to BE the internet and to not let people go outside of Facebook. Observe the lack of external sharing options in its mobile apps: the iOS app will let me copy a link, but there&#8217;s not access to a standard iOS sharing panel that might let me save to other apps that I have installed like Pocket or Evernote.<\/p>\n<p>So while I can see the advantages of Instant Articles for users and organisations, I have an idealogical objection to it.<\/p>\n<p>AMP is slightly different. Yes, Google will cache AMP pages. But Google also generally acts as an open space where you can leave Google&#8217;s space to do other things. But I prefer the openness of it.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, in theory Facebook (or anyone else) could be an AMP consumer platform and crawl AMP pages and suck them into its walled garden anyway. Hmm. \u00a0I&#8217;m not sure of the ethical, legal or idealogical aspects of that: re-publishing my content for me? This is gonna raise some interesting issues about who owns content and has the right to publish it and re-publish it.<\/p>\n<p>The other issue for me is one of user experience and user journey. AMP pages are&#8230;as far as I can tell&#8230;dead ends. It&#8217;s great that I can load a single page REALLY quickly. But what if I, as a publisher, want to build community or get feedback by having people comment on that page? Or if I want them to take an action based on the content of the page? Or if I want to try and keep visitors on my site by providing access to similar, related or important content?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve not done a deep dive into either technology, but it looks like some of these aspects are missing, and things like analytics and advertising are more complicated.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m missing something. I totally support the drive for a simpler, faster web, \u00a0will these projects help? I&#8217;m not sure. But if they do there will certainly be side-effects.<\/p>\n<p>Small publishers: take note, be informed, and use wisely.<\/p>\n",
