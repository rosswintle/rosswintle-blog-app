                "rendered": "<p>Despite being a highly non-confrontational, easy-going kind of chap, who takes the middle ground with cycling, I find myself frequently at odds with lots of other cycling folks.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, I&#8217;m not a mountain biker, I&#8217;m not a long-distance tourer, I&#8217;m not a suit-wearing commuter, I&#8217;m not a triathlete. If anything I&#8217;m closest to being a roadie, yet I don&#8217;t race and I&#8217;m not in a club &#8211; heck I&#8217;ve even got a bike that&#8217;s mostly made of metal, rather than carbon fibre.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But I am highly pro-cycling, both as a form of fitness and as a form of general transport. I ride to work every day and encourage others out of their cars at every opportunity. Yet I find myself thinking what feel like &#8220;dirty thoughts&#8221;. Things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>cycling is actually quite dangerous sometimes;<\/li>\n<li>I should wear a helmet;<\/li>\n<li>commuting is a big faff;<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;d rather be seen and safe than look stylish;<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;d rather be comfortable than look cool;<\/li>\n<li>it would be easier to drive today.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been cycle commuting my 3.5 miles a day for nearly three years now, and it&#8217;s brilliant and I&#8217;d recommend it to anyone and everyone who lives close enough to their workplace to do it.<\/p>\n<p>But cycling, it turns out, is sometimes &#8211; SOMETIMES &#8211; the opposite of all the things I want it to be, and that the pro-cycling people (including myself) advertise it as being.  It&#8217;s tiring, it makes me angry, it&#8217;s complicated, it&#8217;s hampered by the weather, it&#8217;s dangerous, it&#8217;s expensive&#8230;SOMETIMES!<\/p>\n<p>Some of these things are my own fault and are due to <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/03\/11\/my-kind-of-cycling\/\">the way that I am as a cyclist<\/a>, the routes I take, the way that I am as a person. But some are, I believe facts of life as a cycle commuter.<\/p>\n<p>But commuting has got easier over time. I&#8217;ve learnt things, I&#8217;ve got more confident on the roads, I&#8217;ve established a routine, I&#8217;ve bought a better bike and decent gear.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;ve not been very good at sustaining series of posts, but I hope to run at least a few entries here detailing some of what I&#8217;ve experienced and learned. It&#8217;ll be an insight into how I organise that 7 miles a day in the saddle, in all weathers, and arrive in the office ready for a days work. And I hope it will be helpful to others.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want this all to be taken negatively, and I hope I don&#8217;t put anyone off &#8211; far from it! I hope to be real about what life on two wheels is like, and to make suggestions that will lighten the load a little.<\/p>\n<p>Controversial? Possibly. But leaving the car at home is always going to go against the grain in this day and age &#8211; perhaps I&#8217;m just used to doing things differently.<\/p>\n",

If anything I&#8217;m closest to being a roadie, yet I don&#8217;t race and I&#8217;m not in a club &#8211; heck I&#8217;ve even got a bike that&#8217;s mostly made of metal, rather than carbon fibre.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But I am highly pro-cycling, both as a form of fitness and as a form of general transport. I ride to work every day and encourage others out of their cars at every opportunity. Yet I find myself thinking what feel like &#8220;dirty thoughts&#8221;. Things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>cycling is actually quite dangerous sometimes;<\/li>\n<li>I should wear a helmet;<\/li>\n<li>commuting is a big faff;<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;d rather be seen and safe than look stylish;<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;d rather be comfortable than look cool;<\/li>\n<li>it would be easier to drive today.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been cycle commuting my 3.5 miles a day for nearly three years now, and it&#8217;s brilliant and I&#8217;d recommend it to anyone and everyone who lives close enough to their workplace to do it.<\/p>\n<p>But cycling, it turns out, is sometimes &#8211; SOMETIMES &#8211; the opposite of all the things I want it to be, and that the pro-cycling people (including myself) advertise it as being.  It&#8217;s tiring, it makes me angry, it&#8217;s complicated, it&#8217;s hampered by the weather, it&#8217;s dangerous, it&#8217;s expensive&#8230;SOMETIMES!<\/p>\n<p>Some of these things are my own fault and are due to <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/03\/11\/my-kind-of-cycling\/\">the way that I am as a cyclist<\/a>, the routes I take, the way that I am as a person. But some are, I believe facts of life as a cycle commuter.<\/p>\n<p>But commuting has got easier over time. I&#8217;ve learnt things, I&#8217;ve got more confident on the roads, I&#8217;ve established a routine, I&#8217;ve bought a better bike and decent gear.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;ve not been very good at sustaining series of posts, but I hope to run at least a few entries here detailing some of what I&#8217;ve experienced and learned. It&#8217;ll be an insight into how I organise that 7 miles a day in the saddle, in all weathers, and arrive in the office ready for a days work. And I hope it will be helpful to others.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want this all to be taken negatively, and I hope I don&#8217;t put anyone off &#8211; far from it! I hope to be real about what life on two wheels is like, and to make suggestions that will lighten the load a little.<\/p>\n<p>Controversial? Possibly. But leaving the car at home is always going to go against the grain in this day and age &#8211; perhaps I&#8217;m just used to doing things differently.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>I don&#8217;t mean to blow my own trumpet here&#8230;or to sound ungrateful.  But something has unexpectedly come into my life that has been quite complicated and caused me to have to explore some new things: a pair of headphones!<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Prize Management Waffle<\/h3>\n<p>I was on a training course last week put on by one of my software suppliers, and each day there was a prize draw.  The first two days the prize was a little iPod shuffle&#8230;something I would have quite appreciated.<\/p>\n<p>But on the final day the prize was some headphones.<\/p>\n<p>To win, you had to write something about how you would use the supplier&#8217;s software to enhance your business, or something like that.  I wrote some buzz-word packed drivel about &#8220;application services&#8221; and &#8220;increased revenue&#8221; and, somehow won (as a side note, I&#8217;m slightly concerned about my ability to use management-speak!).<\/p>\n<h3>What have I won?<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-433\" title=\"Bose Headphones\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/3688579278_056052e4b2_b.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"Bose Headphones\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3688579278_056052e4b2_b.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3688579278_056052e4b2_b-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/>I resisted opening the box on the train on the way home, waiting, instead, until I got home to unbox them, plug them into my iPod, and mosey around the house with them on testing out the &#8216;phones&#8217; (that&#8217;s not in quotes &#8211; it just has two apostrophes) noise-cancelling abilities.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, these weren&#8217;t just any old headphones.  They were <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bose.co.uk\/GB\/en\/home-entertainment\/personal-audio\/headphones\/acoustic-noise-cancelling-headphones\/qc2\/index.jsp\">Bose Quiet Comfort 2, Noise-Cancelleing, over-ear headphones<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>And jolly good they were too.  But not really my thing.  I like music, and appreciate quality in products, but I&#8217;m not really into wearing big &#8220;cans&#8221; in public, and as I don&#8217;t travel much the noise-cancelling properties wouldn&#8217;t be put to much use.<\/p>\n<h3>What to do?<\/h3>\n<p>My initial thoughts were that these were probably worth about \u00a370 or \u00a380 &#8211; a search on Amazon showed them turning up second hand for around this sort of prise &#8211; and that, as I&#8217;d got them for free and didn&#8217;t really need them, I would sell them and give the proceeds to charity.<\/p>\n<p>However, after a few chats with other people who know their hi-fi gear better than I, I discovered that they were worth a whopping \u00a3250 and probably aren&#8217;t the sort of thing that you&#8217;d sell to your mates.<\/p>\n<p>So, these are for a specialist market that I couldn&#8217;t easily reach and selling them on eBay was looking like the best option.<\/p>\n<p>Did I then want to donate the whole \u00a3150 that I was likely to get for them to charity?  Well, that was a quandry, and I&#8217;ve settled on giving some away and keeping some for myself as a treat (more on thsi later).<\/p>\n<h3>eBay<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-432\" title=\"Bose Headphones with Box\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/3687771303_a3168401ac_b.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Bose Headphones with Box\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3687771303_a3168401ac_b.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3687771303_a3168401ac_b-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>I&#8217;ve never sold on eBay before.  I&#8217;ve bought a couple of things in the past, but I&#8217;m not a big user.  So I took some nice pictures on the dining room table and got cracking with adding my listing.<\/p>\n<p>Only, first, I had to check my PayPal account was still working after years of neglect.  And it was, but I needed to add a valid card and have it upgraded to a &#8220;Premier&#8221; account, which didn&#8217;t seem to cost anything but meant accepting that they would take a slice of anything paid to me.<\/p>\n<p>And then I had to have my eBay account verified.  This involved a weird disembodied voiced phoning my landline and telling me a code that had to be typed back in to the website.<\/p>\n<p>And then I had to check the postage costs.<\/p>\n<p>And I had to decide on an initial price, how many photos to upload, did I want a reserve, where could I ship to, would I offer insurance.<\/p>\n<p>Argh!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve an odd feeling that, once you&#8217;ve done this a few times, it&#8217;s easy.  But it took me most of an evening to list a single item properly.<\/p>\n<p>And it costs too.  Three photos, with a reserve price, cost around \u00a33.50 to list, and they&#8217;ll take 10% of the selling price.  And PayPay will take 2% as well, or something.  Will there be any left for me after all that effort?<\/p>\n<h3>Sitting, waiting, wishing<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s a ten-day listing, so I probably shouldn&#8217;t panic, but as yet I have no bids and an enquiry about how much it would cost to ship to Portugal.<\/p>\n<p>Is this normal?  Is my &#8220;0% positive feedback&#8221; (HEY!  I&#8217;ve never sold anything!!!) not helping?  Have I put the initial bid too high?  Should I have had a lower reserve?  Or a higher one?<\/p>\n<p>We shall wait and see.  I guess that people are bidding on items closer to ending, so next week I can expect a flurry of activity, but in the meantime all is quiet.<\/p>\n<h3>An unexpected treat<\/h3>\n<p>So I&#8217;m not ungrateful, really I&#8217;m not.  And I&#8217;m hoping to spend the proceeds on something that I would rather have won.<\/p>\n<p>Initially I was thinking of an iPod touch, but I worry that this will just make me covet a full-on, ridiculously expensive, iPhone.  If I can&#8217;t use the web broswer and apps wherever I go, is there much point in having them?  It MIGHT help consolidate my current electronic organiser with my portable media player, but I don&#8217;t know how good the organiser functions on the iPod Touch are, and internet opinion seems to be divided.<\/p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s still a possibility, but a better idea would be to upgrade my mobile to a touch-screen, smart phone of some kind.  I really dislike Nokias, can&#8217;t afford &#8211; or rather refuse to afford &#8211; Apple, and so am contemplating Google&#8217;s Android as a platform.  But at what cost I&#8217;ve yet to find out.<\/p>\n<p>So, this small, prize-winning event has unfurled a whole load of other questions and discoveries.  Who&#8217;d have thought that a bit of management speak could cause so much excitement?<\/p>\n",

The first two days the prize was a little iPod shuffle&#8230;something I would have quite appreciated.<\/p>\n<p>But on the final day the prize was some headphones.<\/p>\n<p>To win, you had to write something about how you would use the supplier&#8217;s software to enhance your business, or something like that.  I wrote some buzz-word packed drivel about &#8220;application services&#8221; and &#8220;increased revenue&#8221; and, somehow won (as a side note, I&#8217;m slightly concerned about my ability to use management-speak!).<\/p>\n<h3>What have I won?<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-433\" title=\"Bose Headphones\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/3688579278_056052e4b2_b.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"Bose Headphones\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3688579278_056052e4b2_b.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3688579278_056052e4b2_b-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/>I resisted opening the box on the train on the way home, waiting, instead, until I got home to unbox them, plug them into my iPod, and mosey around the house with them on testing out the &#8216;phones&#8217; (that&#8217;s not in quotes &#8211; it just has two apostrophes) noise-cancelling abilities.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, these weren&#8217;t just any old headphones.  They were <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bose.co.uk\/GB\/en\/home-entertainment\/personal-audio\/headphones\/acoustic-noise-cancelling-headphones\/qc2\/index.jsp\">Bose Quiet Comfort 2, Noise-Cancelleing, over-ear headphones<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>And jolly good they were too.  But not really my thing.  I like music, and appreciate quality in products, but I&#8217;m not really into wearing big &#8220;cans&#8221; in public, and as I don&#8217;t travel much the noise-cancelling properties wouldn&#8217;t be put to much use.<\/p>\n<h3>What to do?<\/h3>\n<p>My initial thoughts were that these were probably worth about \u00a370 or \u00a380 &#8211; a search on Amazon showed them turning up second hand for around this sort of prise &#8211; and that, as I&#8217;d got them for free and didn&#8217;t really need them, I would sell them and give the proceeds to charity.<\/p>\n<p>However, after a few chats with other people who know their hi-fi gear better than I, I discovered that they were worth a whopping \u00a3250 and probably aren&#8217;t the sort of thing that you&#8217;d sell to your mates.<\/p>\n<p>So, these are for a specialist market that I couldn&#8217;t easily reach and selling them on eBay was looking like the best option.<\/p>\n<p>Did I then want to donate the whole \u00a3150 that I was likely to get for them to charity?  Well, that was a quandry, and I&#8217;ve settled on giving some away and keeping some for myself as a treat (more on thsi later).<\/p>\n<h3>eBay<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-432\" title=\"Bose Headphones with Box\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/3687771303_a3168401ac_b.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Bose Headphones with Box\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3687771303_a3168401ac_b.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3687771303_a3168401ac_b-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>I&#8217;ve never sold on eBay before.  I&#8217;ve bought a couple of things in the past, but I&#8217;m not a big user.  So I took some nice pictures on the dining room table and got cracking with adding my listing.<\/p>\n<p>Only, first, I had to check my PayPal account was still working after years of neglect.  And it was, but I needed to add a valid card and have it upgraded to a &#8220;Premier&#8221; account, which didn&#8217;t seem to cost anything but meant accepting that they would take a slice of anything paid to me.<\/p>\n<p>And then I had to have my eBay account verified.  This involved a weird disembodied voiced phoning my landline and telling me a code that had to be typed back in to the website.<\/p>\n<p>And then I had to check the postage costs.<\/p>\n<p>And I had to decide on an initial price, how many photos to upload, did I want a reserve, where could I ship to, would I offer insurance.<\/p>\n<p>Argh!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve an odd feeling that, once you&#8217;ve done this a few times, it&#8217;s easy.  But it took me most of an evening to list a single item properly.<\/p>\n<p>And it costs too.  Three photos, with a reserve price, cost around \u00a33.50 to list, and they&#8217;ll take 10% of the selling price.  And PayPay will take 2% as well, or something.  Will there be any left for me after all that effort?<\/p>\n<h3>Sitting, waiting, wishing<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s a ten-day listing, so I probably shouldn&#8217;t panic, but as yet I have no bids and an enquiry about how much it would cost to ship to Portugal.<\/p>\n<p>Is this normal?  Is my &#8220;0% positive feedback&#8221; (HEY!  I&#8217;ve never sold anything!!!) not helping?  Have I put the initial bid too high?  Should I have had a lower reserve?  Or a higher one?<\/p>\n<p>We shall wait and see.  I guess that people are bidding on items closer to ending, so next week I can expect a flurry of activity, but in the meantime all is quiet.<\/p>\n<h3>An unexpected treat<\/h3>\n<p>So I&#8217;m not ungrateful, really I&#8217;m not.  And I&#8217;m hoping to spend the proceeds on something that I would rather have won.<\/p>\n<p>Initially I was thinking of an iPod touch, but I worry that this will just make me covet a full-on, ridiculously expensive, iPhone.  If I can&#8217;t use the web broswer and apps wherever I go, is there much point in having them?  It MIGHT help consolidate my current electronic organiser with my portable media player, but I don&#8217;t know how good the organiser functions on the iPod Touch are, and internet opinion seems to be divided.<\/p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s still a possibility, but a better idea would be to upgrade my mobile to a touch-screen, smart phone of some kind.  I really dislike Nokias, can&#8217;t afford &#8211; or rather refuse to afford &#8211; Apple, and so am contemplating Google&#8217;s Android as a platform.  But at what cost I&#8217;ve yet to find out.<\/p>\n<p>So, this small, prize-winning event has unfurled a whole load of other questions and discoveries.  Who&#8217;d have thought that a bit of management speak could cause so much excitement?<\/p>\n",

I already had a nice outdoor waterproof that was quite expensive, but it wasn&#8217;t a cycling fit and it was grey &#8211; not good for standing out from the tarmac.<\/p>\n<p>So I managed to convince my lovely wife that I could spend a similar amount on a cycling jacket, on the basis that it would would be used pretty much every day for probably 3 of the four seasons.<\/p>\n<h3>Why the Windstopper<\/h3>\n<p>The one I had my eye on was the Gore Phantom Windstopper Jacket (2008), in bright red!  Here&#8217;s why:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Gore Windstopper fabric gets rave reviews everywhere and I wanted to give it a go.<\/li>\n<li>Red would make me stand out without looking too silly.<\/li>\n<li>The zip-off arms would make it suitable for, probably, autumn, winter and spring, if not bits of summer too.<\/li>\n<li>Gore&#8217;s Bikewear is generally considered to be top quality &#8211; this is a garment that would last<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s supposedly pretty waterproof as well as windproof, but in any case, not having wind chill would make being damp much less of a problem anyway<\/li>\n<li>Nice, quick-wicking softshell will be far nicer than my existing rubbery laminate waterproof, which gets wet on the inside pretty quickly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It took a bit of research and faffing around to find my size and the right colour at a reasonable price.  If you&#8217;re a XXXXXL or want dull grey or lemon yellow then you&#8217;re fine, but any reasonable sizes and colours are harder to come by. Eventually I visited <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tgstore.net\/\">The Gore Store <\/a>and placed an order.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;ve not been disappointed.<\/p>\n<h3>First Impressions and Fit<\/h3>\n<p>I was initially surprised at how thin and light the jacket was.  But the soft shell felt lovely.  I&#8217;d ordered a small expecting quite a close fit, and it was pretty much perfect; not so tight that I couldn&#8217;t wear something under it, but not so loose that it flaps around in the wind.<\/p>\n<p>I should probably point out here that, sadly, the &#8220;Windstopper&#8221; doesn&#8217;t miraculously <strong>STOP<\/strong> the wind, but it does act as a water-resistant, breathable layer that blocks chilly air, creating a little micro-climate around you.<\/p>\n<h3>Effective and Comfortable<\/h3>\n<p>And I have to say, it&#8217;s extremely effective.  One of the best things I can say about this jacket is that I don&#8217;t notice it&#8217;s there.  It&#8217;s light, comfortable, well-cut.  It really is breathable and doesn&#8217;t get damp, even when cycling far and fast.  Well, OK, maybe a little bit, but the Windstopper really does keep the chill out so that you don&#8217;t notice.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been out in a few downpours in it too and it&#8217;s performed admirably.  It&#8217;s NOT a waterproof, but it does a fine job of trying to keep out water and I&#8217;ve only ever been slightly damp inside after rain on my short commute.  Of course, the jacket dries out quickly too.<\/p>\n<p>I even happen to think it looks pretty cool.  It&#8217;s a sporty fit, and it&#8217;s a practical garment rather than a stylish one, but compared to my cheaper jackets it feels positively trendy.<\/p>\n<h3>Minor Issues<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had it through three seasons now and it&#8217;s been a delight.<\/p>\n<p>I had a little problem with the zip, which was sticky at first but seems to have worn in.  I&#8217;m a little baffled by the reflectives, which are on the arms facing forwards.  I&#8217;d have preferred something more on the back to keep me visible.  And there isn&#8217;t a zip-up pocket.  But these are small things in an otherwise brilliant bit of kit.<\/p>\n<h3>What to wear?<\/h3>\n<p>There are a lot of people who say you should be able to just cycle in your normal clothes, and you can.  But it&#8217;s my opinion that cycle-specific gear is a whole load more practical, safe, and comfortable if you want to ride fast and\/or far.  And this is a great piece of cycle gear that I reckon was money well spent!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h2>Gore Bikewear Phantom Windstopper Jacket (2008)<\/h2>\n<p>Those of you that have been reading for a while will know that <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/04\/06\/eeekim-a-shopaholic\/\">I&#8217;m not a big shopper<\/a>, but I do appreciate quality and usefulness, even if it&#8217;s at a price.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Back last year when it was cold and wet and windy, I was, I confess, coveting a decent cycling jacket.  I already had a nice outdoor waterproof that was quite expensive, but it wasn&#8217;t a cycling fit and it was grey &#8211; not good for standing out from the tarmac.<\/p>\n<p>So I managed to convince my lovely wife that I could spend a similar amount on a cycling jacket, on the basis that it would would be used pretty much every day for probably 3 of the four seasons.<\/p>\n<h3>Why the Windstopper<\/h3>\n<p>The one I had my eye on was the Gore Phantom Windstopper Jacket (2008), in bright red!  Here&#8217;s why:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Gore Windstopper fabric gets rave reviews everywhere and I wanted to give it a go.<\/li>\n<li>Red would make me stand out without looking too silly.<\/li>\n<li>The zip-off arms would make it suitable for, probably, autumn, winter and spring, if not bits of summer too.<\/li>\n<li>Gore&#8217;s Bikewear is generally considered to be top quality &#8211; this is a garment that would last<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s supposedly pretty waterproof as well as windproof, but in any case, not having wind chill would make being damp much less of a problem anyway<\/li>\n<li>Nice, quick-wicking softshell will be far nicer than my existing rubbery laminate waterproof, which gets wet on the inside pretty quickly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It took a bit of research and faffing around to find my size and the right colour at a reasonable price.  If you&#8217;re a XXXXXL or want dull grey or lemon yellow then you&#8217;re fine, but any reasonable sizes and colours are harder to come by. Eventually I visited <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tgstore.net\/\">The Gore Store <\/a>and placed an order.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;ve not been disappointed.<\/p>\n<h3>First Impressions and Fit<\/h3>\n<p>I was initially surprised at how thin and light the jacket was.  But the soft shell felt lovely.  I&#8217;d ordered a small expecting quite a close fit, and it was pretty much perfect; not so tight that I couldn&#8217;t wear something under it, but not so loose that it flaps around in the wind.<\/p>\n<p>I should probably point out here that, sadly, the &#8220;Windstopper&#8221; doesn&#8217;t miraculously <strong>STOP<\/strong> the wind, but it does act as a water-resistant, breathable layer that blocks chilly air, creating a little micro-climate around you.<\/p>\n<h3>Effective and Comfortable<\/h3>\n<p>And I have to say, it&#8217;s extremely effective.  One of the best things I can say about this jacket is that I don&#8217;t notice it&#8217;s there.  It&#8217;s light, comfortable, well-cut.  It really is breathable and doesn&#8217;t get damp, even when cycling far and fast.  Well, OK, maybe a little bit, but the Windstopper really does keep the chill out so that you don&#8217;t notice.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been out in a few downpours in it too and it&#8217;s performed admirably.  It&#8217;s NOT a waterproof, but it does a fine job of trying to keep out water and I&#8217;ve only ever been slightly damp inside after rain on my short commute.  Of course, the jacket dries out quickly too.<\/p>\n<p>I even happen to think it looks pretty cool.  It&#8217;s a sporty fit, and it&#8217;s a practical garment rather than a stylish one, but compared to my cheaper jackets it feels positively trendy.<\/p>\n<h3>Minor Issues<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had it through three seasons now and it&#8217;s been a delight.<\/p>\n<p>I had a little problem with the zip, which was sticky at first but seems to have worn in.  I&#8217;m a little baffled by the reflectives, which are on the arms facing forwards.  I&#8217;d have preferred something more on the back to keep me visible.  And there isn&#8217;t a zip-up pocket.  But these are small things in an otherwise brilliant bit of kit.<\/p>\n<h3>What to wear?<\/h3>\n<p>There are a lot of people who say you should be able to just cycle in your normal clothes, and you can.  But it&#8217;s my opinion that cycle-specific gear is a whole load more practical, safe, and comfortable if you want to ride fast and\/or far.  And this is a great piece of cycle gear that I reckon was money well spent!<\/p>\n",

These tools aren&#8217;t cheap, and we expect them to be good.<\/p>\n<p>But we&#8217;ve been having problems with quality lately and this has caused me to be contacting the supplier for support.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll spare the details, but basically, if I ran an upgrade of this software as the wrong user, it brought the whole system down.  Testing for this condition with either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>if user = &#8220;&#8221; then&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>or<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> if response from task is &#8220;insufficient privileges&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Seems like a simple and obvious thing to want to do.<\/p>\n<p>Yet here&#8217;s the response I got:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">&#8220;Generally all testing are done with the same single administrator user.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Hmmm&#8230;OK.  Now, I did a computing A&#8217; level and in that we studied software testing and it was pretty much basic practice that you tested with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>valid data<\/li>\n<li>invalid data<\/li>\n<li>data from the boundary of validity<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, for a percentage value which only has valid values between 0 and 100 you would test with, say:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>20, 54 and 78<\/li>\n<li>-13, 1000<\/li>\n<li>-1, 0, 1, 99, 100, 101<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You didn&#8217;t say: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to test with the value 50 every time&#8221; because it would rarely tell you anything useful about whether or not your software functons.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m assured that the quality assurances processes for this software are excellent, however, to miss a simple case like this makes me wonder, not just what other simple errors may not be tested for in my expensive, best-in-class software, but what&#8217;s happened to software development processes that this is allowed to happen.<\/p>\n<p>Back to school folks&#8230;<\/p>\n",

These tools aren&#8217;t cheap, and we expect them to be good.<\/p>\n<p>But we&#8217;ve been having problems with quality lately and this has caused me to be contacting the supplier for support.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll spare the details, but basically, if I ran an upgrade of this software as the wrong user, it brought the whole system down.  Testing for this condition with either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>if user = &#8220;&#8221; then&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>or<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> if response from task is &#8220;insufficient privileges&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Seems like a simple and obvious thing to want to do.<\/p>\n<p>Yet here&#8217;s the response I got:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">&#8220;Generally all testing are done with the same single administrator user.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Hmmm&#8230;OK.  Now, I did a computing A&#8217; level and in that we studied software testing and it was pretty much basic practice that you tested with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>valid data<\/li>\n<li>invalid data<\/li>\n<li>data from the boundary of validity<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, for a percentage value which only has valid values between 0 and 100 you would test with, say:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>20, 54 and 78<\/li>\n<li>-13, 1000<\/li>\n<li>-1, 0, 1, 99, 100, 101<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You didn&#8217;t say: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to test with the value 50 every time&#8221; because it would rarely tell you anything useful about whether or not your software functons.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m assured that the quality assurances processes for this software are excellent, however, to miss a simple case like this makes me wonder, not just what other simple errors may not be tested for in my expensive, best-in-class software, but what&#8217;s happened to software development processes that this is allowed to happen.<\/p>\n<p>Back to school folks&#8230;<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>I am&#8230;yes, really, I am getting there.<\/p>\n<p>Friday &#8211; our last day.  We&#8217;d previously planned a hike up to over 800m up the mountain known as Tonelagee.  Having abandoned this on Thursday we were up early with the aim of doing it on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>So, we packed our rucksacks and jumped in the car, back towards Glendalough heading back to towards Sally Gap and parking at Glenmacnass Car Park.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>One last sporadic sign<\/h3>\n<p>The map showed a path just a short distance from the car park, over a small river.  However, when we arrived, there was a sign explaining that &#8220;Member of the public should not cross the river as it is very dangerous&#8221;, or words to that effect.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;there&#8217;s a path up there, no bridge, and it doesn&#8217;t look very dangerous.  And what sort of dangerous?  Minefield dangerous?  Being-chased-by-a-raging-bull dangerous?  Or just standard hill walking dangerous?<\/p>\n<p>It was pretty windy again and we ummed and aaahed, walked up the river a bit to see what we could see&#8230;I even hopped across the stones to the other side to see what was hidden in the trees!  But ultimately we couldn&#8217;t see very much, and &#8220;dangerous&#8221; was looking like all we were going to get.<\/p>\n<p>So we decided to head down Glendalough and the National Park information centre.  Perhaps they have walking books for sale, or guides to the hills?  There were also other walking options should be run out of time and need them (we had a restaurant booked for 7pm which meant heading home at about 5pm).<\/p>\n<p>The information centre was a bit useless, being mostly a exhibition of taxidermy.   OK, that&#8217;s a bit harsh, there was lots of good information about the wildlife, but it was mostly wildlife that you&#8217;ll never see because you&#8217;re not allowed to walk anywhere!  Nothing about walking the hills though.<\/p>\n<h3>Camaderry<\/h3>\n<p>Time was ticking on and we had no more information about Tonelagee, so we decided to head up a lesser peak &#8211; Camaderry.  Path even clearer on the map, route up the sheltered and sunny side of the mountain and starting just outside the Glendalough car park.<\/p>\n<p>We quickly found the path, and the immediate problem of it being about a 1 in 3 climb for most of the first kilometre.  It was up up and more up, through the trees, without a warm up for the legs, and we rose from 150m to 450m in no time.<\/p>\n<p>The path continued across a plateau and then up a short almost-scramble to Camaderry&#8217;s south-east top at 677m.<\/p>\n<p>The shape of the mountain meant that you didn&#8217;t get such a great view down to Glendalough as you might have expected, but it was exhilarating being up so high.  Most of the mountains in Wicklow are hidden away behind smaller hills and false summits, but from up top, you could see just how mountainous it really is and you could easily pick out the three biggest peaks of Lugnaquillia, Mullaghcleevaun and the abandoned Tonelagee.<\/p>\n<p>The lack of other walkers meant that were had the summit cairn completely to ourselves, and we didn&#8217;t see another soul on the way up or down.<\/p>\n<p>The walk was great too, short, but with varied terrain: forest and firs; expanses of peat bog strewn with foxglove and ferns; and rocky paths.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, when you can find a safe way up, the hill walking in Wicklow turns out to be pretty good!<\/p>\n<p>Were were a bit concerned about the peat erosion.  Peat is a big carbon sink, and is easily eroded, damaging the natural environment and releasing the carbon, but we figured that following the path that was already very eroded can&#8217;t have been doing too much damage.  We can only guess that the erosion issue is one of the things that prevents hill walking being promoted more strongly here.<\/p>\n<h3>A Meal Out<\/h3>\n<p>We headed back down, which took no time, and scrubbed up back in the cottage ready for a meal out.  We&#8217;d been self-catering all week because food was very expensive, but we&#8217;d both had birthdays recently which were not really properly celebrated, and we&#8217;d promised ourselves a night out.<\/p>\n<p>Restaurants were even more expensive, but we bit the bullet and had booked into &#8220;The Wicklow Heather&#8221; in Laragh &#8211; back over towards Glendalough.<\/p>\n<p>We were not disappointed and had an excellent meal in a charmingly decorated setting.<\/p>\n<p>One thing that particularly amused me was that some tables, including ours, had a little rack of old, educational books, including once called &#8220;The Psychology of Eating&#8221; by Lewis R Wolberg, which, though written in the Thirties, said things like &#8220;This is not another fad diet book&#8221;, and could have been written yesterday.  I hadn&#8217;t realised that fad diets had been around so long.<\/p>\n<h3>Finishing off<\/h3>\n<p>After the meal it was hometime, packing, and cleaning the cottage before departure.  The trip home was uneventful.  It was a windy day so we bought seasickness tablets, but these ended up being unnecessary as we had a pleasant crossing back.<\/p>\n<p>It had been a great week of rest, walking, Geocaching, and exploring Co. Wicklow, and another fantastic week in Ireland &#8211; a country that I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll visit again and again.<\/p>\n<p>Highly recommended &#8211; but if you plan hiking, get as much information beforehand as you can, including good maps.  We&#8217;d recommend staying closer to Laragh than Wicklow Town, and with the exchange rate as it is, would recommend self catering, if you can find an appropriately sized cottage.<\/p>\n<p>For now, it&#8217;s back to the grindstone and the busyness of normal life.<\/p>\n<p>When&#8217;s the next holiday?<\/p>\n",

        "title": "A Week in Wicklow &#8211; Part 8: A First and Final Climb",
        "content": "<p>I am&#8230;yes, really, I am getting there.<\/p>\n<p>Friday &#8211; our last day.  We&#8217;d previously planned a hike up to over 800m up the mountain known as Tonelagee.  Having abandoned this on Thursday we were up early with the aim of doing it on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>So, we packed our rucksacks and jumped in the car, back towards Glendalough heading back to towards Sally Gap and parking at Glenmacnass Car Park.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>One last sporadic sign<\/h3>\n<p>The map showed a path just a short distance from the car park, over a small river.  However, when we arrived, there was a sign explaining that &#8220;Member of the public should not cross the river as it is very dangerous&#8221;, or words to that effect.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;there&#8217;s a path up there, no bridge, and it doesn&#8217;t look very dangerous.  And what sort of dangerous?  Minefield dangerous?  Being-chased-by-a-raging-bull dangerous?  Or just standard hill walking dangerous?<\/p>\n<p>It was pretty windy again and we ummed and aaahed, walked up the river a bit to see what we could see&#8230;I even hopped across the stones to the other side to see what was hidden in the trees!  But ultimately we couldn&#8217;t see very much, and &#8220;dangerous&#8221; was looking like all we were going to get.<\/p>\n<p>So we decided to head down Glendalough and the National Park information centre.  Perhaps they have walking books for sale, or guides to the hills?  There were also other walking options should be run out of time and need them (we had a restaurant booked for 7pm which meant heading home at about 5pm).<\/p>\n<p>The information centre was a bit useless, being mostly a exhibition of taxidermy.   OK, that&#8217;s a bit harsh, there was lots of good information about the wildlife, but it was mostly wildlife that you&#8217;ll never see because you&#8217;re not allowed to walk anywhere!  Nothing about walking the hills though.<\/p>\n<h3>Camaderry<\/h3>\n<p>Time was ticking on and we had no more information about Tonelagee, so we decided to head up a lesser peak &#8211; Camaderry.  Path even clearer on the map, route up the sheltered and sunny side of the mountain and starting just outside the Glendalough car park.<\/p>\n<p>We quickly found the path, and the immediate problem of it being about a 1 in 3 climb for most of the first kilometre.  It was up up and more up, through the trees, without a warm up for the legs, and we rose from 150m to 450m in no time.<\/p>\n<p>The path continued across a plateau and then up a short almost-scramble to Camaderry&#8217;s south-east top at 677m.<\/p>\n<p>The shape of the mountain meant that you didn&#8217;t get such a great view down to Glendalough as you might have expected, but it was exhilarating being up so high.  Most of the mountains in Wicklow are hidden away behind smaller hills and false summits, but from up top, you could see just how mountainous it really is and you could easily pick out the three biggest peaks of Lugnaquillia, Mullaghcleevaun and the abandoned Tonelagee.<\/p>\n<p>The lack of other walkers meant that were had the summit cairn completely to ourselves, and we didn&#8217;t see another soul on the way up or down.<\/p>\n<p>The walk was great too, short, but with varied terrain: forest and firs; expanses of peat bog strewn with foxglove and ferns; and rocky paths.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, when you can find a safe way up, the hill walking in Wicklow turns out to be pretty good!<\/p>\n<p>Were were a bit concerned about the peat erosion.  Peat is a big carbon sink, and is easily eroded, damaging the natural environment and releasing the carbon, but we figured that following the path that was already very eroded can&#8217;t have been doing too much damage.  We can only guess that the erosion issue is one of the things that prevents hill walking being promoted more strongly here.<\/p>\n<h3>A Meal Out<\/h3>\n<p>We headed back down, which took no time, and scrubbed up back in the cottage ready for a meal out.  We&#8217;d been self-catering all week because food was very expensive, but we&#8217;d both had birthdays recently which were not really properly celebrated, and we&#8217;d promised ourselves a night out.<\/p>\n<p>Restaurants were even more expensive, but we bit the bullet and had booked into &#8220;The Wicklow Heather&#8221; in Laragh &#8211; back over towards Glendalough.<\/p>\n<p>We were not disappointed and had an excellent meal in a charmingly decorated setting.<\/p>\n<p>One thing that particularly amused me was that some tables, including ours, had a little rack of old, educational books, including once called &#8220;The Psychology of Eating&#8221; by Lewis R Wolberg, which, though written in the Thirties, said things like &#8220;This is not another fad diet book&#8221;, and could have been written yesterday.  I hadn&#8217;t realised that fad diets had been around so long.<\/p>\n<h3>Finishing off<\/h3>\n<p>After the meal it was hometime, packing, and cleaning the cottage before departure.  The trip home was uneventful.  It was a windy day so we bought seasickness tablets, but these ended up being unnecessary as we had a pleasant crossing back.<\/p>\n<p>It had been a great week of rest, walking, Geocaching, and exploring Co. Wicklow, and another fantastic week in Ireland &#8211; a country that I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll visit again and again.<\/p>\n<p>Highly recommended &#8211; but if you plan hiking, get as much information beforehand as you can, including good maps.  We&#8217;d recommend staying closer to Laragh than Wicklow Town, and with the exchange rate as it is, would recommend self catering, if you can find an appropriately sized cottage.<\/p>\n<p>For now, it&#8217;s back to the grindstone and the busyness of normal life.<\/p>\n<p>When&#8217;s the next holiday?<\/p>\n",

Our aim has been to be outdoors as much as we can, and do some hill walking if possible.  While we&#8217;ve certainly been to mountain height, we&#8217;ve still not really &#8220;climbed a mountain&#8221;, and so last night we planned a hike up Tonelagee (817m).<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But when we awoke we decided that the forecast, was, and always had been, better for Friday than for Thursday, so we put off the big walk until tomorrow.  So today was the backup plan&#8230;a trip up the military road, through Sally Gap, stopping off to do some shorter walks to pick up our last Geocaches.<\/p>\n<h3>Trooping and Paddock Hill<\/h3>\n<p>First stop, &#8220;Trooping&#8221; at the foot of Trooperstown Hill.  Not much of a climb from the Trooperstown car park to get to this, but we did have to carefully pick our way through lots of spiky gorse and muddy, marshy ground.  It was well worth it though, as we were treated to more great scenery, hidden away by a remote bit of river.<\/p>\n<p>Then, back to the car and up to &#8220;Paddock Hill&#8221;.  The recommended route is not from the south, as we did it, but there was a route on the map and we gave it a go.  It was mostly easy, but we lost the path at one point and ended up in what&#8217;s best described as a graveyard for old fir trees.  The cache was easily found on the summit to glorious views of the surrounding peaks (Scarr, Brockagh, Tonelagee) and some fierce, blustery winds.<\/p>\n<h3>Blown Away<\/h3>\n<p>Having bagged a minor peak (Paddock Hill is 357m and, I think, technically a mountain), we headed back to the car to find another place to park up and find some more.  We headed up to the Wicklow Gap, which is quite a climb up to 476m in the car.  We parked up and got out the car only to be nearly blown away.  We toyed with picking up Turlough Hill, a walk up to the reservoir at 692m, but the path was on the exposed side of the hill and we decided that it would either be to cold or to dangerous to head up in such a strong wind.<\/p>\n<p>So we opted to head down hill, and down wind, to &#8220;Wicklow Gold&#8221;.  This was along St Kevin&#8217;s Way, which, apparently, was once paved, but is now mostly boggy marsh.  This was another quick and easy one, though the walk back to the car &#8211; uphill and into the wind, while losing the path in some more boggy marshland &#8211; was not so pleasant.<\/p>\n<h3>Through the Gap<\/h3>\n<p>Weather was still not good so we decided to skip &#8220;Turlough Hill&#8221; and hit the military road.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, I hadn&#8217;t paid much attention to the detail of the map for this drive.  In my head it was a fairly main road and pretty straight.  But the military had other ideas when building it &#8211; mostly their idea was to build a road through the mountains, following the contours, peaking at 524m and crossing a barren and spectacular landscape.  The drive started well, and after a steady climb we got to take in Glenmacnass waterfall and to see Tonelagee a bit closer up.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after Glenmacnass though, the road got increasingly narrow, twisty and remote.  We drove for quite some time across a flatish moorland, surrounded by some high peaks.  It felt incredibly wild and it was exhilarating just being there.  The light played off the cliffs and hillsides, shadows of the clouds brought a moody, atmospheric feel to the place, and there was no one &#8211; no one! &#8211; for miles.  We were even treated to what felt like our own, personal rainbow.<\/p>\n<p>If you come to Wicklow, take time out to head up the military road through the Sally Gap.  I promise, it&#8217;s spectacular!<\/p>\n<p>We headed back from Enniskerry on the N11, wilderness behind us, and a fun evening of learning old card games, and remembering some old ones &#8211; shed, slam, nines and so on.<\/p>\n<p>One more full day to go &#8211; the forecast is still good for tomorrow, though I&#8217;m worried it will still be windy.  We will pack, rise early, and head to Tonelagee for a short hike.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h3>To Walk or not to Walk, that is the question<\/h3>\n<p>Despite it being predictably unpredictable, We&#8217;ve been trying our best to closely watch the weather this week.  Our aim has been to be outdoors as much as we can, and do some hill walking if possible.  While we&#8217;ve certainly been to mountain height, we&#8217;ve still not really &#8220;climbed a mountain&#8221;, and so last night we planned a hike up Tonelagee (817m).<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But when we awoke we decided that the forecast, was, and always had been, better for Friday than for Thursday, so we put off the big walk until tomorrow.  So today was the backup plan&#8230;a trip up the military road, through Sally Gap, stopping off to do some shorter walks to pick up our last Geocaches.<\/p>\n<h3>Trooping and Paddock Hill<\/h3>\n<p>First stop, &#8220;Trooping&#8221; at the foot of Trooperstown Hill.  Not much of a climb from the Trooperstown car park to get to this, but we did have to carefully pick our way through lots of spiky gorse and muddy, marshy ground.  It was well worth it though, as we were treated to more great scenery, hidden away by a remote bit of river.<\/p>\n<p>Then, back to the car and up to &#8220;Paddock Hill&#8221;.  The recommended route is not from the south, as we did it, but there was a route on the map and we gave it a go.  It was mostly easy, but we lost the path at one point and ended up in what&#8217;s best described as a graveyard for old fir trees.  The cache was easily found on the summit to glorious views of the surrounding peaks (Scarr, Brockagh, Tonelagee) and some fierce, blustery winds.<\/p>\n<h3>Blown Away<\/h3>\n<p>Having bagged a minor peak (Paddock Hill is 357m and, I think, technically a mountain), we headed back to the car to find another place to park up and find some more.  We headed up to the Wicklow Gap, which is quite a climb up to 476m in the car.  We parked up and got out the car only to be nearly blown away.  We toyed with picking up Turlough Hill, a walk up to the reservoir at 692m, but the path was on the exposed side of the hill and we decided that it would either be to cold or to dangerous to head up in such a strong wind.<\/p>\n<p>So we opted to head down hill, and down wind, to &#8220;Wicklow Gold&#8221;.  This was along St Kevin&#8217;s Way, which, apparently, was once paved, but is now mostly boggy marsh.  This was another quick and easy one, though the walk back to the car &#8211; uphill and into the wind, while losing the path in some more boggy marshland &#8211; was not so pleasant.<\/p>\n<h3>Through the Gap<\/h3>\n<p>Weather was still not good so we decided to skip &#8220;Turlough Hill&#8221; and hit the military road.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, I hadn&#8217;t paid much attention to the detail of the map for this drive.  In my head it was a fairly main road and pretty straight.  But the military had other ideas when building it &#8211; mostly their idea was to build a road through the mountains, following the contours, peaking at 524m and crossing a barren and spectacular landscape.  The drive started well, and after a steady climb we got to take in Glenmacnass waterfall and to see Tonelagee a bit closer up.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after Glenmacnass though, the road got increasingly narrow, twisty and remote.  We drove for quite some time across a flatish moorland, surrounded by some high peaks.  It felt incredibly wild and it was exhilarating just being there.  The light played off the cliffs and hillsides, shadows of the clouds brought a moody, atmospheric feel to the place, and there was no one &#8211; no one! &#8211; for miles.  We were even treated to what felt like our own, personal rainbow.<\/p>\n<p>If you come to Wicklow, take time out to head up the military road through the Sally Gap.  I promise, it&#8217;s spectacular!<\/p>\n<p>We headed back from Enniskerry on the N11, wilderness behind us, and a fun evening of learning old card games, and remembering some old ones &#8211; shed, slam, nines and so on.<\/p>\n<p>One more full day to go &#8211; the forecast is still good for tomorrow, though I&#8217;m worried it will still be windy.  We will pack, rise early, and head to Tonelagee for a short hike.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ve left out much detail but if you think any of what I&#8217;ve said is inappropriate then let me know and I&#8217;ll remove it.]<\/p>\n<h3>It&#8217;s Been on My Mind<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to write about cycle helmets for ages but recent events have brought to the fore my want to share what I think.<\/p>\n<p>A friend of mine was knocked off his bike and landed on his head, crushing a vertebrae.\u00a0 His helmet was severely damaged &#8211; his skull was intact.<\/p>\n<p>This has obviously made me think hard about cycling and helmet-wearing and I&#8217;ve been trying to crystallise my thoughts.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Background<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m obviously a keen cyclist, and I read lots on the internet, Twitter, and other people&#8217;s blogs, about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>pros and cons of wearing a helmet;<\/li>\n<li>pros and cons of helmet legislation;<\/li>\n<li>anecdotes about helmet wearing\/not-wearing;<\/li>\n<li>pros and cons of websites\/blogs\/people that talk about the pros and cons of wearing a helmet;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You get the idea.<\/p>\n<p>For those who don&#8217;t move in cycling circles, the safety benefits of cycle helmets are far from proven and they may even make injuries from an accident WORSE!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all explained, far better than I could ever explain it, on the <a title=\"CycleHelmets.org\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclehelmets.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Cycle Helmets Site<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Lidlessness<\/h3>\n<p>Anyway, other people seem to get very passionate about helmet wearing. \u00a0Most people, and cycling organisations, I&#8217;ve come across are &#8220;pro-helmet-choice&#8221;, or &#8220;anti-helmet-legislation&#8221;. \u00a0They are keen to educate people about the myth that a helmet makes you safer.<\/p>\n<p>What strikes me is that the balance seems to be a bit out.\u00a0 People who are pro-helmet-choice come across as being anti-helmet, even though some of them wear helmets.\u00a0 Some of what I read also paints those who don&#8217;t know about the inconclusive bike helmet science as being a bit daft.<\/p>\n<p>This annoys me somewhat as I used to be someone who thought that a helmet was obviously going to help protect you in a fall and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s stupid to think that way.<\/p>\n<h3>Out with it!<\/h3>\n<p>So, where am I at with the whole cycle helmet thing?\u00a0 Well:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I instinctively feel that I SHOULD wear one.\u00a0 The thought of my head hitting tarmac at speed doesn&#8217;t fill me with joyous expectation.\u00a0 I&#8217;d like my head to be protected.<\/li>\n<li>I read the current science and research as being inconclusive.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve not read it all in depth, but it seems to say that if I fall one way a helmet will protect me, and if I fall another way, a helmet will make my injuries worse.\u00a0 There appears to be no right or wrong.<\/li>\n<li>So&#8230;I wear a helmet for all my cycling.<\/li>\n<li>I am &#8220;pro-helmet-choice&#8221; &#8211; I am against making cycle helmet wearing compulsory as I believe that this would put people off cycling (this seems to be fairly well proven by statistics).<\/li>\n<li>I am very much pro-cycling.\u00a0 The benefits of cycling far outweigh the risks, and the risks clearly decrease as more people cycle.\u00a0 (See <a title=\"CTC's Safety in Numbers Campaign\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ctc.org.uk\/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=5225\" target=\"_blank\">CTC&#8217;s Safety in Numbers report<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m also pro- other cycle safety measures: training people to ride on the road; better cycle infrastructure; use of lights, colours and reflectives to make sure you&#8217;re seen; and riding confidently and learning to anticipate driver movements.\u00a0 How&#8217;s about we reduce the risk of falling or being hit in the first place?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>There are other aspects of this discussion, that I actually don&#8217;t feel I can answer, or even that they&#8217;re particularly important, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do I ride more dangerously, and take more risks because I&#8217;m wearing a helmet?<\/li>\n<li>Do vehicle drivers give me less room because I wear a helmet&#8230;and lycra&#8230;and reflectives!?!<\/li>\n<li>Are there better solutions to protecting your head whilst on a bike?\u00a0 Is there a different helmet design that could be used?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Recent Events<\/h3>\n<p>What happened to my friend has really brought home the whole cycling safety and helmets issue.\u00a0 I no longer have just statistics, studies and reports, I have a real person, that I know, who has had a week in hospital, is wearing a brace, and who will have 6 to 8 weeks of not being able to do much at all, and probably a lengthly period of recouperation after that.<\/p>\n<p>The studies say that wearing a helmet may increase the damage done in a nasty accident.\u00a0 But it may also save your life.<\/p>\n<p>My common sense says that in a minor accident my head will probably be better off with a helmet.<\/p>\n<p>And my personal experience is of a person who seems to have been spared injury because of a helmet.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that people have information and make a choice about helmet wearing.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that we offer people training on cycling on the road, build decent cycle lanes and infrastructure, and encourage more people onto bikes.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that we all, when driving vehicles, give room to cyclists and take extra care to look out for them. And DON&#8217;T pass them at any sort of junction&#8230;especially a roundabout!<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, I pray for my friend and his family, and I continue to wear my polystyrene &#8220;lid&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think?\u00a0 Would the inconclusive facts change your mind about helmets? Would the experience of my friend change your opinion?\u00a0 Or would it reinforce your existing opinion?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>[Prologue: At least one regular reader will know who&#8217;s involved in what I&#8217;m about to write. I&#8217;ve left out much detail but if you think any of what I&#8217;ve said is inappropriate then let me know and I&#8217;ll remove it.]<\/p>\n<h3>It&#8217;s Been on My Mind<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to write about cycle helmets for ages but recent events have brought to the fore my want to share what I think.<\/p>\n<p>A friend of mine was knocked off his bike and landed on his head, crushing a vertebrae.\u00a0 His helmet was severely damaged &#8211; his skull was intact.<\/p>\n<p>This has obviously made me think hard about cycling and helmet-wearing and I&#8217;ve been trying to crystallise my thoughts.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Background<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m obviously a keen cyclist, and I read lots on the internet, Twitter, and other people&#8217;s blogs, about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>pros and cons of wearing a helmet;<\/li>\n<li>pros and cons of helmet legislation;<\/li>\n<li>anecdotes about helmet wearing\/not-wearing;<\/li>\n<li>pros and cons of websites\/blogs\/people that talk about the pros and cons of wearing a helmet;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You get the idea.<\/p>\n<p>For those who don&#8217;t move in cycling circles, the safety benefits of cycle helmets are far from proven and they may even make injuries from an accident WORSE!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all explained, far better than I could ever explain it, on the <a title=\"CycleHelmets.org\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclehelmets.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Cycle Helmets Site<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Lidlessness<\/h3>\n<p>Anyway, other people seem to get very passionate about helmet wearing. \u00a0Most people, and cycling organisations, I&#8217;ve come across are &#8220;pro-helmet-choice&#8221;, or &#8220;anti-helmet-legislation&#8221;. \u00a0They are keen to educate people about the myth that a helmet makes you safer.<\/p>\n<p>What strikes me is that the balance seems to be a bit out.\u00a0 People who are pro-helmet-choice come across as being anti-helmet, even though some of them wear helmets.\u00a0 Some of what I read also paints those who don&#8217;t know about the inconclusive bike helmet science as being a bit daft.<\/p>\n<p>This annoys me somewhat as I used to be someone who thought that a helmet was obviously going to help protect you in a fall and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s stupid to think that way.<\/p>\n<h3>Out with it!<\/h3>\n<p>So, where am I at with the whole cycle helmet thing?\u00a0 Well:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I instinctively feel that I SHOULD wear one.\u00a0 The thought of my head hitting tarmac at speed doesn&#8217;t fill me with joyous expectation.\u00a0 I&#8217;d like my head to be protected.<\/li>\n<li>I read the current science and research as being inconclusive.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve not read it all in depth, but it seems to say that if I fall one way a helmet will protect me, and if I fall another way, a helmet will make my injuries worse.\u00a0 There appears to be no right or wrong.<\/li>\n<li>So&#8230;I wear a helmet for all my cycling.<\/li>\n<li>I am &#8220;pro-helmet-choice&#8221; &#8211; I am against making cycle helmet wearing compulsory as I believe that this would put people off cycling (this seems to be fairly well proven by statistics).<\/li>\n<li>I am very much pro-cycling.\u00a0 The benefits of cycling far outweigh the risks, and the risks clearly decrease as more people cycle.\u00a0 (See <a title=\"CTC's Safety in Numbers Campaign\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ctc.org.uk\/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=5225\" target=\"_blank\">CTC&#8217;s Safety in Numbers report<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m also pro- other cycle safety measures: training people to ride on the road; better cycle infrastructure; use of lights, colours and reflectives to make sure you&#8217;re seen; and riding confidently and learning to anticipate driver movements.\u00a0 How&#8217;s about we reduce the risk of falling or being hit in the first place?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>There are other aspects of this discussion, that I actually don&#8217;t feel I can answer, or even that they&#8217;re particularly important, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do I ride more dangerously, and take more risks because I&#8217;m wearing a helmet?<\/li>\n<li>Do vehicle drivers give me less room because I wear a helmet&#8230;and lycra&#8230;and reflectives!?!<\/li>\n<li>Are there better solutions to protecting your head whilst on a bike?\u00a0 Is there a different helmet design that could be used?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Recent Events<\/h3>\n<p>What happened to my friend has really brought home the whole cycling safety and helmets issue.\u00a0 I no longer have just statistics, studies and reports, I have a real person, that I know, who has had a week in hospital, is wearing a brace, and who will have 6 to 8 weeks of not being able to do much at all, and probably a lengthly period of recouperation after that.<\/p>\n<p>The studies say that wearing a helmet may increase the damage done in a nasty accident.\u00a0 But it may also save your life.<\/p>\n<p>My common sense says that in a minor accident my head will probably be better off with a helmet.<\/p>\n<p>And my personal experience is of a person who seems to have been spared injury because of a helmet.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that people have information and make a choice about helmet wearing.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that we offer people training on cycling on the road, build decent cycle lanes and infrastructure, and encourage more people onto bikes.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that we all, when driving vehicles, give room to cyclists and take extra care to look out for them. And DON&#8217;T pass them at any sort of junction&#8230;especially a roundabout!<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, I pray for my friend and his family, and I continue to wear my polystyrene &#8220;lid&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think?\u00a0 Would the inconclusive facts change your mind about helmets? Would the experience of my friend change your opinion?\u00a0 Or would it reinforce your existing opinion?<\/p>\n",
