She&#8217;s awesome and I totally\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f her! But it&#8217;s a good excuse to get people thinking about this&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\">\n    <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today&#39;s poll: It&#39;s local elections in parts of the UK tomorrow. Turnout&#39;s are rarely high. Is it time for optional secure digital home voting for all (or on application like postal votes)? Or is the effort needed to go to vote booth useful filtering?<br><br>What&#39;s CLOSEST to ur view?<\/p>&mdash; Martin Lewis (@MartinSLewis) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MartinSLewis\/status\/991599938365739013?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 2, 2018<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a software developer. I develop software. I have written software that helps aircraft fly! So I kinda know how computers work and how to make computers safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying the current paper based voting system isn&#8217;t flawed. There surely are ways that it could be exploited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT the thing about the current system is that it&#8217;s INCREDIBLY simple. You enter a room. You put a mark on a piece of paper. That goes in a sealed box. The boxes are all accounted for. The boxes are opened under scrutiny and the marked bits of paper are counted in public, under scrutiny from anyone that wants to see it happening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you wanted to you could wait outside (or presumably inside) the polling station and then follow your vote, in the box, to the count, and watch all the votes from your box being counted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if it&#8217;s tampered with there is usually a trail &#8211; a way to see how it was tampered with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This system is SO simple and transparent that I could explain it to my six year old and he would probably understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we know what this system&#8217;s flaws are and they have been mitigated over many years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Software<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>e-Voting introduces software. So let&#8217;s talk about software.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Software is INCREDIBLY complex. It&#8217;s very difficult to prove the properties of. It&#8217;s very difficult to show that it does what it should without error. It&#8217;s likely to have multiple flaws, any of which could be an exploitable security issue. You don&#8217;t know what it does. You don&#8217;t know how it works. You have no idea how trustworthy it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple, 1-decimal-place arithmetic is pretty easy, right? A computer should be able to do that accurately in micro seconds, right? Well, here is a picture of my web browser adding 0.1 and 0.2:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"344\" height=\"132\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-02-at-22.19.12.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3472\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-02-at-22.19.12.png 344w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-02-at-22.19.12-300x115.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px\" \/>\n    <figcaption>Computers, huh?<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I could explain how this is caused by a lack of precision in the JavaScript implementation of binary floating point arithmetic, but it&#8217;s unlikely that would make any sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it makes the point that when you think you&#8217;re simply adding 0.1 and 0.2, some incredibly complex things that you don&#8217;t understand are happening under the bonnet of your computer to make that happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s make a deal, then: if you can tell me what happens when you click the &#8220;Vote&#8221; button, then you can keep the idea of an electronic vote!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Internet<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And you want to send votes over the internet. So let&#8217;s talk about the internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The internet is made up of millions of devices. You don&#8217;t know what they are. You don&#8217;t know WHERE they are. You don&#8217;t know what they do. You don&#8217;t know what software they are running. You don&#8217;t know what flaws they have. You can&#8217;t take them apart and inspect what&#8217;s going on inside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A casino was <a href=\"https:\/\/thehackernews.com\/2018\/04\/iot-hacking-thermometer.html\">recently hacked into because it had an internet-connected thermometer in an aquarium in the lobby<\/a>. Hackers used this as an entry point to the casino&#8217;s private network and downloaded a database of gamblers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you really want a cobbled-together system of frankly-who-knows-what sending your vote to the authorities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But we have internet banking? Surely if that&#8217;s safe and reliable and trustworthy&#8230;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.moneysavingexpert.com\/news\/banking\/2018\/05\/40000-complain-over-tsb-meltdown---and-bosses-still-cant-say-when-itll-be-fixed\">Ahem&#8230;\ufeff<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Irony notice: that article linked above is on the website owned by the man who ran the Twitter poll)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Democracy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And to top it all, the government, and particularly local government, know precious little about how anything computer related works. Until a few years ago the local transport people sent informational emails with hundreds of people visibly cc&#8217;d in them. I wouldn&#8217;t trust them to even set a secure password on their own systems!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not long ago our NHS systems were infected with a program that locked them, encrypted them and threatened to delete all the data on them unless a ransom was paid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cambridge Analytica thing has proven that democracy is too important to allow it to be interfered with by software and algorithms that we don&#8217;t understand and that can be exploited in ways that we did not expect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230;maybe I convinced you, can we keep marks on bits of trees, please!?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if I didn&#8217;t, here&#8217;s 8 minutes of a fellow University of York Alumnus who is equally passionate about the topic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube\">\n    <iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Why Electronic Voting is a BAD Idea - Computerphile\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/w3_0x6oaDmI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/figure>\n",

She&#8217;s awesome and I totally\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f her! But it&#8217;s a good excuse to get people thinking about this&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\">\n    <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today&#39;s poll: It&#39;s local elections in parts of the UK tomorrow. Turnout&#39;s are rarely high. Is it time for optional secure digital home voting for all (or on application like postal votes)? Or is the effort needed to go to vote booth useful filtering?<br><br>What&#39;s CLOSEST to ur view?<\/p>&mdash; Martin Lewis (@MartinSLewis) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MartinSLewis\/status\/991599938365739013?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 2, 2018<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a software developer. I develop software. I have written software that helps aircraft fly! So I kinda know how computers work and how to make computers safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying the current paper based voting system isn&#8217;t flawed. There surely are ways that it could be exploited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT the thing about the current system is that it&#8217;s INCREDIBLY simple. You enter a room. You put a mark on a piece of paper. That goes in a sealed box. The boxes are all accounted for. The boxes are opened under scrutiny and the marked bits of paper are counted in public, under scrutiny from anyone that wants to see it happening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you wanted to you could wait outside (or presumably inside) the polling station and then follow your vote, in the box, to the count, and watch all the votes from your box being counted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if it&#8217;s tampered with there is usually a trail &#8211; a way to see how it was tampered with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This system is SO simple and transparent that I could explain it to my six year old and he would probably understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we know what this system&#8217;s flaws are and they have been mitigated over many years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Software<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>e-Voting introduces software. So let&#8217;s talk about software.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Software is INCREDIBLY complex. It&#8217;s very difficult to prove the properties of. It&#8217;s very difficult to show that it does what it should without error. It&#8217;s likely to have multiple flaws, any of which could be an exploitable security issue. You don&#8217;t know what it does. You don&#8217;t know how it works. You have no idea how trustworthy it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple, 1-decimal-place arithmetic is pretty easy, right? A computer should be able to do that accurately in micro seconds, right? Well, here is a picture of my web browser adding 0.1 and 0.2:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"344\" height=\"132\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-02-at-22.19.12.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3472\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-02-at-22.19.12.png 344w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-02-at-22.19.12-300x115.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px\" \/>\n    <figcaption>Computers, huh?<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I could explain how this is caused by a lack of precision in the JavaScript implementation of binary floating point arithmetic, but it&#8217;s unlikely that would make any sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it makes the point that when you think you&#8217;re simply adding 0.1 and 0.2, some incredibly complex things that you don&#8217;t understand are happening under the bonnet of your computer to make that happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s make a deal, then: if you can tell me what happens when you click the &#8220;Vote&#8221; button, then you can keep the idea of an electronic vote!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Internet<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And you want to send votes over the internet. So let&#8217;s talk about the internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The internet is made up of millions of devices. You don&#8217;t know what they are. You don&#8217;t know WHERE they are. You don&#8217;t know what they do. You don&#8217;t know what software they are running. You don&#8217;t know what flaws they have. You can&#8217;t take them apart and inspect what&#8217;s going on inside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A casino was <a href=\"https:\/\/thehackernews.com\/2018\/04\/iot-hacking-thermometer.html\">recently hacked into because it had an internet-connected thermometer in an aquarium in the lobby<\/a>. Hackers used this as an entry point to the casino&#8217;s private network and downloaded a database of gamblers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you really want a cobbled-together system of frankly-who-knows-what sending your vote to the authorities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But we have internet banking? Surely if that&#8217;s safe and reliable and trustworthy&#8230;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.moneysavingexpert.com\/news\/banking\/2018\/05\/40000-complain-over-tsb-meltdown---and-bosses-still-cant-say-when-itll-be-fixed\">Ahem&#8230;\ufeff<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Irony notice: that article linked above is on the website owned by the man who ran the Twitter poll)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Democracy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And to top it all, the government, and particularly local government, know precious little about how anything computer related works. Until a few years ago the local transport people sent informational emails with hundreds of people visibly cc&#8217;d in them. I wouldn&#8217;t trust them to even set a secure password on their own systems!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not long ago our NHS systems were infected with a program that locked them, encrypted them and threatened to delete all the data on them unless a ransom was paid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cambridge Analytica thing has proven that democracy is too important to allow it to be interfered with by software and algorithms that we don&#8217;t understand and that can be exploited in ways that we did not expect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230;maybe I convinced you, can we keep marks on bits of trees, please!?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if I didn&#8217;t, here&#8217;s 8 minutes of a fellow University of York Alumnus who is equally passionate about the topic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube\">\n    <iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Why Electronic Voting is a BAD Idea - Computerphile\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/w3_0x6oaDmI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/figure>\n",

Yes. I admit it. Early in my coding career I got to use SPARK Ada and the SPARK Examiner and it left its mark.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ada, for those that don&#8217;t know, is a curious programming language. Pascal-like, clunky, verbose, typed. But I was brought up on Pascal so I got on with it quite nicely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SPARK Ada is a subset of Ada that removes, well, all the dangerous stuff. It&#8217;s a subset that lets you prove properties about your code, such as whether or not you it will go beyond the bounds of an array, or whether you have loop invariants. And all before you even run it through a compiler.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This checking is called &#8220;static analysis&#8221;.\u00a0 Remember that &#8211; you&#8217;ll need it later!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rules of SPARK make coding in it even more verbose than with standard Ada. It&#8217;s strongly typed so all type conversions are explicit. Arrays have fixed types and bounds. All variables and data structures are of a known size.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;it gloriously eliminated huge swathes of potential run-time error conditions without even needing to write tests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Web development<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ada, as far as I know, isn&#8217;t used on the web (someone will prove me wrong, I&#8217;m sure). I mostly write PHP and JavaScript which, if you do things wrong, have a habit of making it up as you go along.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve used various text editors and IDE&#8217;s in my web development career.\u00a0 Notepad++, Aptana Studio, Sublime Text, and more recently PHPStorm and VS Code.\u00a0 VS Code recently replaced PHPStorm as the main tool I use for coding small projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a number of PHP extensions installed in VS Code, including Intelliphense, and I somehow thought that the editor and extensions would be clever enough to at least let me know if a variable I was using was undeclared or something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230;well&#8230;here&#8217;s some code I wrote today in VS Code:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"548\" height=\"170\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-16.57.32.png\" alt=\"Code snipper in VS code with a subtle error\" class=\"wp-image-3531\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-16.57.32.png 548w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-16.57.32-300x93.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Spot the deliberate error. It&#8217;s subtle. It&#8217;s on the second line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This code actually worked with a human-initiated &#8220;integration test&#8221; on the front end. This is because of a WordPress quirk whereby, further down the stack, <code>get_post( null )<\/code>\u00a0actually returns the current post, and it just so happened that the only place I called this method was in some code inside a loop where there was a current post, and the current post&#8217;s ID was always the same as the <code>$related_to_id<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway &#8211; I blame my text editor for this. How is an error of this sort not reported by my text editor, or by PHP, or anywhere?!\u00a0 This is exactly the sort of thing that a computer is really good at detecting, but a human is not (unless you are <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hellofromTonya\/status\/994600056266412032\">Tonya<\/a> &#8211; THANK YOU!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I discovered that I kinda take static analysis for granted, and miss it when it&#8217;s not there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After some research, it seems that setting up useful static analysis in VS Code is non-trivial (again, correct me if I&#8217;m wrong). But PHPStorm has some of this baked right into it&#8217;s core.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not SPARK Ada-level static analysis. But this is my computer doing what it&#8217;s best at: automating stuff that humans are bad at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"488\" height=\"175\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-17.09.20.png\" alt=\"Code snippet in PHPStorm with the same error, but with the error underlined!\" class=\"wp-image-3532\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-17.09.20.png 488w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-17.09.20-300x108.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ve gone running back to it.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>In which I lament my own utter incompetence, but also switch back from VS Code to PHPStorm in a flash and cry over programming languages<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been spoiled. Yes. I admit it. Early in my coding career I got to use SPARK Ada and the SPARK Examiner and it left its mark.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ada, for those that don&#8217;t know, is a curious programming language. Pascal-like, clunky, verbose, typed. But I was brought up on Pascal so I got on with it quite nicely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SPARK Ada is a subset of Ada that removes, well, all the dangerous stuff. It&#8217;s a subset that lets you prove properties about your code, such as whether or not you it will go beyond the bounds of an array, or whether you have loop invariants. And all before you even run it through a compiler.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This checking is called &#8220;static analysis&#8221;.\u00a0 Remember that &#8211; you&#8217;ll need it later!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rules of SPARK make coding in it even more verbose than with standard Ada. It&#8217;s strongly typed so all type conversions are explicit. Arrays have fixed types and bounds. All variables and data structures are of a known size.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;it gloriously eliminated huge swathes of potential run-time error conditions without even needing to write tests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Web development<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ada, as far as I know, isn&#8217;t used on the web (someone will prove me wrong, I&#8217;m sure). I mostly write PHP and JavaScript which, if you do things wrong, have a habit of making it up as you go along.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve used various text editors and IDE&#8217;s in my web development career.\u00a0 Notepad++, Aptana Studio, Sublime Text, and more recently PHPStorm and VS Code.\u00a0 VS Code recently replaced PHPStorm as the main tool I use for coding small projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a number of PHP extensions installed in VS Code, including Intelliphense, and I somehow thought that the editor and extensions would be clever enough to at least let me know if a variable I was using was undeclared or something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230;well&#8230;here&#8217;s some code I wrote today in VS Code:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"548\" height=\"170\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-16.57.32.png\" alt=\"Code snipper in VS code with a subtle error\" class=\"wp-image-3531\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-16.57.32.png 548w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-16.57.32-300x93.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Spot the deliberate error. It&#8217;s subtle. It&#8217;s on the second line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This code actually worked with a human-initiated &#8220;integration test&#8221; on the front end. This is because of a WordPress quirk whereby, further down the stack, <code>get_post( null )<\/code>\u00a0actually returns the current post, and it just so happened that the only place I called this method was in some code inside a loop where there was a current post, and the current post&#8217;s ID was always the same as the <code>$related_to_id<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway &#8211; I blame my text editor for this. How is an error of this sort not reported by my text editor, or by PHP, or anywhere?!\u00a0 This is exactly the sort of thing that a computer is really good at detecting, but a human is not (unless you are <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hellofromTonya\/status\/994600056266412032\">Tonya<\/a> &#8211; THANK YOU!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I discovered that I kinda take static analysis for granted, and miss it when it&#8217;s not there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After some research, it seems that setting up useful static analysis in VS Code is non-trivial (again, correct me if I&#8217;m wrong). But PHPStorm has some of this baked right into it&#8217;s core.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not SPARK Ada-level static analysis. But this is my computer doing what it&#8217;s best at: automating stuff that humans are bad at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"488\" height=\"175\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-17.09.20.png\" alt=\"Code snippet in PHPStorm with the same error, but with the error underlined!\" class=\"wp-image-3532\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-17.09.20.png 488w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-05-10-at-17.09.20-300x108.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ve gone running back to it.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>This very much falls into the category of &#8220;things that must surely be easier&#8221;. So let me know in the comments if it is actually easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, I&#8217;m tinkering with Vue and Laravel. I have a Vue component that represents a Laravel model object. I note that the component has a hierarchy of parent components.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In it&#8217;s simplest form it looks like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }}<br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ]<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I want to add a delete button that will fire a request off to Laravel to delete the model and the redirect back to the model index.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it looks something like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ]<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And we need to work out what the HREF should be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I COULD create a &#8220;GET&#8221; route for this. But let&#8217;s try and keep it RESTful\/resourceful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A delete request should really use the DELETE HTTP method.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we need to add a little hidden form to make this work and submit that on click:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"delete\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ]<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>OK. Getting there. Now I need to get the <code>deleteUrl<\/code>\u00a0into the action property of the form. But this is a Vue component, not something in Blade that I can use Laravel methods in; I can&#8217;t do something like <code>{{ action('SomeController@destroy') }}<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I confess, at this point, I took a bit of a shortcut and just coded this as a computed property with a hard-coded base URL and making use of the thing&#8217;s ID:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"delete\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ],<br\/>    computed: {<br\/>      deleteUrl: function () {<br\/>        return '\/admin\/things\/' <strong>+ <\/strong>this.thingData.id;<br\/>      }<br\/>    }<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Hmm. This is not simple is it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we need to trigger the form submission when the delete link is clicked. To do that we need to identify the components form element and submit it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with adding a method and calling that method on click:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\" @click=\"deleteThing\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"delete\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ],<br\/>    computed: {<br\/>      deleteUrl: function () {<br\/>        return '\/admin\/things\/' <strong>+ <\/strong>this.thingData.id;<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    methods: {<br\/>      deleteThing: function( ev ) {<br\/>        ev.preventDefault();<br\/>        \/\/ What now?<br\/>      }<br\/>    }<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230;how do we track down the form element we need to submit? A bit of Googling shows that I can use\u00a0<code>this.$el<\/code>\u00a0in JavaScript to get my component, and I can <code>getElementsByTagName('form')<\/code>\u00a0from there. So here&#8217;s the method:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">methods<strong>: <\/strong>{<br\/>  deleteThing<strong>: <\/strong>function ( event ) {<br\/>    event.preventDefault();<br\/>    this.$el.getElementsByTagName('form')[0].submit();<br\/>  }<br\/>}<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now this will fail because we don&#8217;t have a CSRF token. Yes, Laravel kindly adds this as a header to all AJAX requests made using Axios. But with a straight form submission I&#8217;ll need to add the token.\u00a0 This is easy in Blade, you just add <code>@csrf<\/code>\u00a0and go and make yourself a celebratory cup of coffee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in a component?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I can&#8217;t find any Laravel cleverness that somehow automatically gives you some kind of global token in Vue that you can use in any component.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I COULD pass it down through my component hierarchy as props, but that seems messy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A better way would be to have it as some kind of global state\/prop that I can use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One method for doing this is to add an <a href=\"https:\/\/vuejs.org\/v2\/cookbook\/adding-instance-properties.html\">Instance Property<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel DOES give you a head start in having an HTML meta element in the <code>&lt;head><\/code> that has the CSRF token in it. So that&#8217;s helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can the set a Vue instance property in our top-level app.js like so:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">\/\/ Add the token<br\/>Vue.prototype.$token <strong>= <\/strong>document.head.querySelector('meta[name=\"csrf-token\"]').content;<br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>I could not then find a way to directly reference this in my components template. So I had to pull it into the components <code>data<\/code>\u00a0and then bind that to a new hidden input in the form:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\" @click=\"deleteThing\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"delete\"><br\/>      &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_token\" :value=\"token\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ],<br\/>    data: function () {<br\/>      return {<br\/>        token: this.$token<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    computed: {<br\/>      deleteUrl: function () {<br\/>        return '\/admin\/things\/' <strong>+ <\/strong>this.thingData.id;<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    methods: {<br\/>      deleteThing: function( ev ) {<br\/>        ev.preventDefault();<br\/>        this.$el.getElementsByTagName('form')[0].submit();<br\/>      }<br\/>    }<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and, hang on, one final thing&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>method=\"delete\"<\/code>\u00a0on a <code>form<\/code> rarely works, so you need to fake it with a <code>post<\/code>\u00a0request and another input.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the final code:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\" @click=\"deleteThing\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"post\"><br\/>      &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_token\" :value=\"token\"><br\/>      &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_method\" value=\"DELETE\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ],<br\/>    data: function () {<br\/>      return {<br\/>        token: this.$token<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    computed: {<br\/>      deleteUrl: function () {<br\/>        return '\/admin\/things\/' <strong>+ <\/strong>this.thingData.id;<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    methods: {<br\/>      deleteThing: function( ev ) {<br\/>        ev.preventDefault();<br\/>        this.$el.getElementsByTagName('form')[0].submit();<br\/>      }<br\/>    }<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Phew!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really&#8230;what did I miss here?

        "title": "Adding a &#8220;delete&#8221; link to a Vue component representing a Laravel model",
        "content": "\n<p>This very much falls into the category of &#8220;things that must surely be easier&#8221;. So let me know in the comments if it is actually easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, I&#8217;m tinkering with Vue and Laravel. I have a Vue component that represents a Laravel model object. I note that the component has a hierarchy of parent components.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In it&#8217;s simplest form it looks like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }}<br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ]<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I want to add a delete button that will fire a request off to Laravel to delete the model and the redirect back to the model index.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it looks something like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ]<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And we need to work out what the HREF should be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I COULD create a &#8220;GET&#8221; route for this. But let&#8217;s try and keep it RESTful\/resourceful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A delete request should really use the DELETE HTTP method.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we need to add a little hidden form to make this work and submit that on click:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"delete\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ]<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>OK. Getting there. Now I need to get the <code>deleteUrl<\/code>\u00a0into the action property of the form. But this is a Vue component, not something in Blade that I can use Laravel methods in; I can&#8217;t do something like <code>{{ action('SomeController@destroy') }}<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I confess, at this point, I took a bit of a shortcut and just coded this as a computed property with a hard-coded base URL and making use of the thing&#8217;s ID:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"delete\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ],<br\/>    computed: {<br\/>      deleteUrl: function () {<br\/>        return '\/admin\/things\/' <strong>+ <\/strong>this.thingData.id;<br\/>      }<br\/>    }<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Hmm. This is not simple is it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we need to trigger the form submission when the delete link is clicked. To do that we need to identify the components form element and submit it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with adding a method and calling that method on click:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\" @click=\"deleteThing\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"delete\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ],<br\/>    computed: {<br\/>      deleteUrl: function () {<br\/>        return '\/admin\/things\/' <strong>+ <\/strong>this.thingData.id;<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    methods: {<br\/>      deleteThing: function( ev ) {<br\/>        ev.preventDefault();<br\/>        \/\/ What now?<br\/>      }<br\/>    }<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230;how do we track down the form element we need to submit? A bit of Googling shows that I can use\u00a0<code>this.$el<\/code>\u00a0in JavaScript to get my component, and I can <code>getElementsByTagName('form')<\/code>\u00a0from there. So here&#8217;s the method:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">methods<strong>: <\/strong>{<br\/>  deleteThing<strong>: <\/strong>function ( event ) {<br\/>    event.preventDefault();<br\/>    this.$el.getElementsByTagName('form')[0].submit();<br\/>  }<br\/>}<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now this will fail because we don&#8217;t have a CSRF token. Yes, Laravel kindly adds this as a header to all AJAX requests made using Axios. But with a straight form submission I&#8217;ll need to add the token.\u00a0 This is easy in Blade, you just add <code>@csrf<\/code>\u00a0and go and make yourself a celebratory cup of coffee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in a component?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I can&#8217;t find any Laravel cleverness that somehow automatically gives you some kind of global token in Vue that you can use in any component.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I COULD pass it down through my component hierarchy as props, but that seems messy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A better way would be to have it as some kind of global state\/prop that I can use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One method for doing this is to add an <a href=\"https:\/\/vuejs.org\/v2\/cookbook\/adding-instance-properties.html\">Instance Property<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laravel DOES give you a head start in having an HTML meta element in the <code>&lt;head><\/code> that has the CSRF token in it. So that&#8217;s helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can the set a Vue instance property in our top-level app.js like so:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">\/\/ Add the token<br\/>Vue.prototype.$token <strong>= <\/strong>document.head.querySelector('meta[name=\"csrf-token\"]').content;<br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>I could not then find a way to directly reference this in my components template. So I had to pull it into the components <code>data<\/code>\u00a0and then bind that to a new hidden input in the form:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\" @click=\"deleteThing\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"delete\"><br\/>      &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_token\" :value=\"token\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ],<br\/>    data: function () {<br\/>      return {<br\/>        token: this.$token<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    computed: {<br\/>      deleteUrl: function () {<br\/>        return '\/admin\/things\/' <strong>+ <\/strong>this.thingData.id;<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    methods: {<br\/>      deleteThing: function( ev ) {<br\/>        ev.preventDefault();<br\/>        this.$el.getElementsByTagName('form')[0].submit();<br\/>      }<br\/>    }<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and, hang on, one final thing&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>method=\"delete\"<\/code>\u00a0on a <code>form<\/code> rarely works, so you need to fake it with a <code>post<\/code>\u00a0request and another input.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the final code:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&lt;template><br\/>  &lt;div class=\"thing\"><br\/>    {{ thingData.title }} ( &lt;a href=\"...\" @click=\"deleteThing\">Delete&lt;\/a> )<br\/>    &lt;form style=\"display: none;\" :action=\"deleteUrl\" method=\"post\"><br\/>      &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_token\" :value=\"token\"><br\/>      &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_method\" value=\"DELETE\"><br\/>    &lt;\/form><br\/>  &lt;\/div><br\/>&lt;\/template><br\/>&lt;script><br\/>  export default {<br\/>    props: [<br\/>      'thingData'<br\/>    ],<br\/>    data: function () {<br\/>      return {<br\/>        token: this.$token<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    computed: {<br\/>      deleteUrl: function () {<br\/>        return '\/admin\/things\/' <strong>+ <\/strong>this.thingData.id;<br\/>      }<br\/>    },<br\/>    methods: {<br\/>      deleteThing: function( ev ) {<br\/>        ev.preventDefault();<br\/>        this.$el.getElementsByTagName('form')[0].submit();<br\/>      }<br\/>    }<br\/>  }<br\/>&lt;\/script> <br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Phew!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really&#8230;what did I miss here?

You need to go all in. They aren&#8217;t intended to be mashed up with traditional HTML page reloads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I then tried to work out how to use the Axios HTTP client library to do my delete action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And was that easy?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well&#8230;hmm&#8230;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Axios\/AJAX thing was actually pretty simple. I&#8217;ll give you that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I was then faced with the propsect of having to delete the <code>thing<\/code>\u00a0from my list of things stored as data in the top-level component instance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the problem with this is that this data is a nested array that comes from PHP via JSON.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I know some people complain that PHP arrays are trying to be all things to all men, but from a developer happiness point of view they are pretty nice and I&#8217;ve got very used to their flexibility and ease of use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But getting them from PHP into JS isn&#8217;t so simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my case I have a list of things for each day of the week. But not every day needs a list. So I can have:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">[<br\/>  1 => [<br\/>          'thing1',<br\/>          'thing2'<br\/>  ],<br\/>  3 => [<br\/>          'thing3',<br\/>          'thing4'<br\/>  ]<br\/>]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can have this in JavaScript too. Sort of.\u00a0 JavaScript doesn&#8217;t like the gaps &#8211; note in the image below the <code>empty<\/code>\u00a0slots and the length:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3778\" width=\"316\" height=\"84\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08.png 632w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08-300x80.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08-600x159.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;to get between PHP and JS we generally use JSON as a kind of intermediate format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And JSON doesn&#8217;t have arrays with indexes. JSON arrays have no specific indices. They always start at zero and subsequent elements are indexed with the next integer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to get around this, PHP&#8217;s <code>json_encode()<\/code>\u00a0function works out if the PHP array is compatible with JSON. If it is then it spits out a JSON array. And if it isn&#8217;t then it spits out a JSON OBJECT!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a valid JSON array &#8211; zero-indexed and all sequential keys:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">> $a = [ 0 => 'a', 1 => 'b' ];<br\/>> echo json_encode( $a );<br\/>[\"a\",\"b\"]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a non-JSON compatible array:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">> $b = [ 1 => 'a', 2 => 'b' ];<br\/>> echo json_encode( $b );<br\/>{\"1\":\"a\",\"2\":\"b\"}<br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Fun! Now I note that you can add the <code>JSON_FORCE_OBJECT<\/code>\u00a0flag to always convert PHP arrays to JSON objects, even if they are JSON-array compatible. But for the most part, you sometime get an array in JSON, and you sometimes get an object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And my list of things, not being JSON-array compatible, was being spat out as an object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s my issue: JavaScript objects aren&#8217;t really iterable. You can&#8217;t easily loop over them. I mean, yes, you can get the keys, and you can use <code>for...of<\/code>\u00a0or <code>for...in<\/code>\u00a0or something. But sometimes you&#8217;ll get properties you don&#8217;t want (such as a Vue <code>__ob__<\/code>\u00a0observer property) and&#8230;well&#8230;objects just aren&#8217;t really intended to be used in this way. Objects are objects, not lists or arrays.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what to do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I could use <code>JSON_FORCE_OBJECT<\/code>\u00a0and treat ALL my arrays as objects and deal with it. That would probably be OK. But then I&#8217;m stuck using objects for lists of things in JS and that&#8217;s not right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or I could try to make all my PHP arrays JSON compatible. So my list would be zero-indexed and sequential, like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">[<br\/>  0 => [],<br\/>  1 => [<br\/>    'thing1',<br\/>    'thing2'<br\/>  ],<br\/>  2 => [],<br\/>  3 => [<br\/>    'thing3',<br\/>    'thing4'<br\/>  ]<br\/>]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>But enforcing this inside PHP doesn&#8217;t seem like the right thing to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or I could try to find a way to convert JSON objects that only have numeric keys back into JS arrays. But that still has issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, I think, is a major pain point and frustration for me.\u00a0 Once my data is in the right places and in the right types of data structure, I know what I&#8217;m doing and can work quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But moving data between the different parts of these multi-part systems is hard to get right. And doing it in a scalable and maintainable way is even harder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday I also had problems with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JavaScript scope<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>How how how How HOW do\u00a0I pass a variable to a lexically-out-of-scope callback, like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">function deleteThingFromData( thingToDelete ) {<br\/>  newData = _.mapValues( data, myOutOfScopeCallback );<br\/>  data = newData;<br\/>}<br\/><br\/>function myOutOfScopeCallback( dataItem ) {<br\/>  \/\/ Needs access to thingToDelete!<br\/>}<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">this<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>this is perpetually not my friend. Nothing in programming should be called <code>this<\/code>, especially when its meaning can vary so wildly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday I got caught by the fact that <code>this<\/code>\u00a0inside an arrow function is different to <code>this<\/code>\u00a0with a normal function.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#learnToLoveJs<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, my delete now works (YAY!), and I&#8217;m still motivated to #learnToLoveJS, but gosh it&#8217;s hard work.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/06\/adding-a-delete-link-to-a-vue-component-representing-a-laravel-model\/\">Yesterday<\/a> I was struggling with getting Vue components to do non-AJAXy things and wondering why on earth this was so difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conclusion I came to, with the help of some good people on Twitter, is that if you&#8217;re using a component-based reactive framework like Vue, you don&#8217;t want to be half-hearted about it. You need to go all in. They aren&#8217;t intended to be mashed up with traditional HTML page reloads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I then tried to work out how to use the Axios HTTP client library to do my delete action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And was that easy?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well&#8230;hmm&#8230;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Axios\/AJAX thing was actually pretty simple. I&#8217;ll give you that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I was then faced with the propsect of having to delete the <code>thing<\/code>\u00a0from my list of things stored as data in the top-level component instance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the problem with this is that this data is a nested array that comes from PHP via JSON.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I know some people complain that PHP arrays are trying to be all things to all men, but from a developer happiness point of view they are pretty nice and I&#8217;ve got very used to their flexibility and ease of use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But getting them from PHP into JS isn&#8217;t so simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my case I have a list of things for each day of the week. But not every day needs a list. So I can have:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">[<br\/>  1 => [<br\/>          'thing1',<br\/>          'thing2'<br\/>  ],<br\/>  3 => [<br\/>          'thing3',<br\/>          'thing4'<br\/>  ]<br\/>]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can have this in JavaScript too. Sort of.\u00a0 JavaScript doesn&#8217;t like the gaps &#8211; note in the image below the <code>empty<\/code>\u00a0slots and the length:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3778\" width=\"316\" height=\"84\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08.png 632w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08-300x80.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08-600x159.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;to get between PHP and JS we generally use JSON as a kind of intermediate format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And JSON doesn&#8217;t have arrays with indexes. JSON arrays have no specific indices. They always start at zero and subsequent elements are indexed with the next integer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to get around this, PHP&#8217;s <code>json_encode()<\/code>\u00a0function works out if the PHP array is compatible with JSON. If it is then it spits out a JSON array. And if it isn&#8217;t then it spits out a JSON OBJECT!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a valid JSON array &#8211; zero-indexed and all sequential keys:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">> $a = [ 0 => 'a', 1 => 'b' ];<br\/>> echo json_encode( $a );<br\/>[\"a\",\"b\"]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a non-JSON compatible array:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">> $b = [ 1 => 'a', 2 => 'b' ];<br\/>> echo json_encode( $b );<br\/>{\"1\":\"a\",\"2\":\"b\"}<br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Fun! Now I note that you can add the <code>JSON_FORCE_OBJECT<\/code>\u00a0flag to always convert PHP arrays to JSON objects, even if they are JSON-array compatible. But for the most part, you sometime get an array in JSON, and you sometimes get an object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And my list of things, not being JSON-array compatible, was being spat out as an object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s my issue: JavaScript objects aren&#8217;t really iterable. You can&#8217;t easily loop over them. I mean, yes, you can get the keys, and you can use <code>for...of<\/code>\u00a0or <code>for...in<\/code>\u00a0or something. But sometimes you&#8217;ll get properties you don&#8217;t want (such as a Vue <code>__ob__<\/code>\u00a0observer property) and&#8230;well&#8230;objects just aren&#8217;t really intended to be used in this way. Objects are objects, not lists or arrays.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what to do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I could use <code>JSON_FORCE_OBJECT<\/code>\u00a0and treat ALL my arrays as objects and deal with it. That would probably be OK. But then I&#8217;m stuck using objects for lists of things in JS and that&#8217;s not right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or I could try to make all my PHP arrays JSON compatible. So my list would be zero-indexed and sequential, like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">[<br\/>  0 => [],<br\/>  1 => [<br\/>    'thing1',<br\/>    'thing2'<br\/>  ],<br\/>  2 => [],<br\/>  3 => [<br\/>    'thing3',<br\/>    'thing4'<br\/>  ]<br\/>]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>But enforcing this inside PHP doesn&#8217;t seem like the right thing to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or I could try to find a way to convert JSON objects that only have numeric keys back into JS arrays. But that still has issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, I think, is a major pain point and frustration for me.\u00a0 Once my data is in the right places and in the right types of data structure, I know what I&#8217;m doing and can work quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But moving data between the different parts of these multi-part systems is hard to get right. And doing it in a scalable and maintainable way is even harder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday I also had problems with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JavaScript scope<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>How how how How HOW do\u00a0I pass a variable to a lexically-out-of-scope callback, like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">function deleteThingFromData( thingToDelete ) {<br\/>  newData = _.mapValues( data, myOutOfScopeCallback );<br\/>  data = newData;<br\/>}<br\/><br\/>function myOutOfScopeCallback( dataItem ) {<br\/>  \/\/ Needs access to thingToDelete!<br\/>}<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">this<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>this is perpetually not my friend. Nothing in programming should be called <code>this<\/code>, especially when its meaning can vary so wildly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday I got caught by the fact that <code>this<\/code>\u00a0inside an arrow function is different to <code>this<\/code>\u00a0with a normal function.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#learnToLoveJs<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, my delete now works (YAY!), and I&#8217;m still motivated to #learnToLoveJS, but gosh it&#8217;s hard work.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I am NOT getting involved in school communications\u2026but\u2026<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have school children now. And I kinda made a vow to not get involved in school communications. Mostly because the primary job of school staff is educating and caring for children to do, and they don\u2019t want some geeky parent turning up with bright ideas that will probably make their lives more complicated.  In short: I don\u2019t want to cause trouble.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like churches and councils and various other public organisations that do way more than just sell stuff, schools have difficult communications challenges.  They have lots of information about lots of different things, and any one person is only interested in a small amount of it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organising and presenting this information such that people can see what they need without the stuff that they don\u2019t need getting in the way is very difficult. And, while I have some ideas for improving it, I don\u2019t have ideas for fixing the whole problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m a parent now, and so getting the information that a parent needs for day-to-day schooling is what concerns me most.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting way in which I see parents trying to get the information they need is to collaborate. Parents\u2019 Facebook groups pop up, and parents ask each other questions in these groups, and with several hundred parents, answers can arrive quite quickly. This is great!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I\u2019m also a software developer, and so when I see the same problem appearing repeatedly and being solved repeatedly, my instinct is to make it more efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see questions that are frequently being asked, and people having to wait for answers, I wonder how we can get people the answers more efficiently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Surveying the landscape<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a school comms expert, so there&#8217;s probably lots missing here. But from what I can tell there are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Tools that send information to parents, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.schoop.co.uk\/\">Schoop<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parentmail.co.uk\/\">ParentMail<\/a><\/li><li>Tools that contain some information, but who&#8217;s primary purpose is elsewhere, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parentpay.com\/\">ParentPay<\/a><\/li><li>Generic content management systems, like WordPress or Drupal or paid services like SquareSpace that can be used for a website for any kind of organisation. These systems are not school-specific.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>What I&#8217;ve been unable to find is a school-shaped content management system that stores and presents information that parents and other people interested in a school might want to see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few things that seem to advertise themselves as content management systems for schools, but they don&#8217;t seem to be huge advancement on standard CMS&#8217;s like WordPress and Joomla.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And anyway, I don&#8217;t think I wanted to a system for managing &#8220;content&#8221; as much as a systems for managing &#8220;information&#8221; &#8211; information that is specific to schools that can be presented in a variety of different ways, in order to fix the challenge of answering repeated similar questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enter &#8220;SchoolBot&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the idea of SchoolBot came before my ideas about an information system emerged from it.  I didn&#8217;t want to get involved in my own kid&#8217;s primary school website, but I wanted to make the information on it more easily accessible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The people were asking questions on Facebook. And I&#8217;d been tinkering with Facebook Messenger &#8220;Bots&#8221; on another project. Bots are computer programs that can automatically respond to people using Facebook Messenger or other instant messaging systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I wondered if I could create a Messenger &#8220;bot&#8221; that could use information from the school website to answer peoples&#8217; questions without them even leaving Facebook &#8211; which for many people is the main way that they use the internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"School Bot\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/TGOOfe-kWts?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<figcaption>Initial schoolbot tests (on a non-school day!)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial SchoolBot was built in just a few hours, but Facebook Messenger was on a bit of a lockdown in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica investigations so it wasn&#8217;t available on Messenger to start with. And it was limited to a couple of initial functions like telling you the school meals for the day, and giving you term dates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, SchoolBot has become able to answer more questions, and generally be smarter. And it&#8217;s now connected to Facebook Messenger too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re thinking it, this is NOT &#8220;Artificial Intelligence&#8221;. It&#8217;s actually really quite dumb. But it&#8217;s clever enough to have the veil of something intelligent-looking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a parent &#8211; and yes, I&#8217;m currently the only parent that has access to it &#8211; it&#8217;s a super quick way to ask those essential parent questions and get responses in super quick time. And it&#8217;s fun too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A central &#8220;brain&#8221; for parent information<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SchoolBot did start out as just a simple parent-information chatbot. But it had the information behind it stored in a small database.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I quickly realised that I could use this information in other ways that could be really helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the information in a database, I could not only respond to messenger questions, but I could generate text or tables for a website, or even &#8211; given a suitable template &#8211; printable PDFs!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2144\" height=\"1344\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4067\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test.png 2144w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-300x188.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-768x481.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-1024x642.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-945x592.png 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-600x376.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2144px) 100vw, 2144px\" \/><figcaption>A test of getting data from SchoolBot into a web page &#8211; this uses actual SchoolBot data<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Both of these things are important.  I totally understand the need for things like school meal menus to be in printable format for people that need them. And it seems that most documents start as PDFs, then these are uploaded to the website &#8211; which isn&#8217;t great because PDF&#8217;s on websites are really hard to use, especially on mobile devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So rather than having the information in MS Word <strong>and<\/strong> on the website <strong>and<\/strong> in the SchoolBot database too (and possibly other places), you could just have it in one place &#8211; the central SchoolBot &#8220;brain&#8221; &#8211; and all the other things can be generated from that!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Technical geekery note: yes, the aim here is to have the data available on an API and create widgets and so on that consume that API &#8211; in the screengrab above I&#8217;ve built a simple WordPress plugin that uses SchoolBot data in shortcodes. And yes, the holiday dates are derived from the term dates! You didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d store the same information twice did you?!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SchoolBot also gathers feedback. It keeps a tally of how many times it has been asked questions that it can answer.  And questions that it does not know how to answer are logged so the system can be improved by feeding it more data! Both of these things could be used by a school to improve parent communications by helping them recognise what parents need to know, or what information is hard to get hold of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The impact on community<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In all of this I&#8217;m really aware that, if this ever actually becomes a useful thing, I might be taking something important away. The Facebook group is a source of community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People answering other people&#8217;s questions is a way to connect parents outside of the school run. Who knows what relationships might have sprung up just by someone spotting someone else at the school gate and saying &#8220;Oh, hi. You helped me out the other day!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if the benefits of quick answers to questions outweigh the potential negative effects of removing the Q&amp;A from the group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t even know if the messenger bot part of SchoolBot will be something that people use. Though the centralised data aspects of it remain useful, even without the messenger-related parts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It still feels like a useful thing. So I&#8217;m going to forge ahead and see what I can make of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s the status of SchoolBot?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s very much in development, but like many of my side projects, it exists in a somewhat-usable form and competes with other projects for my attention.  Currently only I can use it. But there&#8217;s no reason why, in its current form, it couldn&#8217;t be put to the public to test.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that would involve me being a geeky parent turning up with bright ideas that will probably make teacher&#8217;s lives more complicated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hmm\u2026<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I am NOT getting involved in school communications\u2026but\u2026<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have school children now. And I kinda made a vow to not get involved in school communications. Mostly because the primary job of school staff is educating and caring for children to do, and they don\u2019t want some geeky parent turning up with bright ideas that will probably make their lives more complicated.  In short: I don\u2019t want to cause trouble.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like churches and councils and various other public organisations that do way more than just sell stuff, schools have difficult communications challenges.  They have lots of information about lots of different things, and any one person is only interested in a small amount of it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organising and presenting this information such that people can see what they need without the stuff that they don\u2019t need getting in the way is very difficult. And, while I have some ideas for improving it, I don\u2019t have ideas for fixing the whole problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m a parent now, and so getting the information that a parent needs for day-to-day schooling is what concerns me most.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting way in which I see parents trying to get the information they need is to collaborate. Parents\u2019 Facebook groups pop up, and parents ask each other questions in these groups, and with several hundred parents, answers can arrive quite quickly. This is great!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I\u2019m also a software developer, and so when I see the same problem appearing repeatedly and being solved repeatedly, my instinct is to make it more efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see questions that are frequently being asked, and people having to wait for answers, I wonder how we can get people the answers more efficiently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Surveying the landscape<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a school comms expert, so there&#8217;s probably lots missing here. But from what I can tell there are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Tools that send information to parents, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.schoop.co.uk\/\">Schoop<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parentmail.co.uk\/\">ParentMail<\/a><\/li><li>Tools that contain some information, but who&#8217;s primary purpose is elsewhere, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parentpay.com\/\">ParentPay<\/a><\/li><li>Generic content management systems, like WordPress or Drupal or paid services like SquareSpace that can be used for a website for any kind of organisation. These systems are not school-specific.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>What I&#8217;ve been unable to find is a school-shaped content management system that stores and presents information that parents and other people interested in a school might want to see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few things that seem to advertise themselves as content management systems for schools, but they don&#8217;t seem to be huge advancement on standard CMS&#8217;s like WordPress and Joomla.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And anyway, I don&#8217;t think I wanted to a system for managing &#8220;content&#8221; as much as a systems for managing &#8220;information&#8221; &#8211; information that is specific to schools that can be presented in a variety of different ways, in order to fix the challenge of answering repeated similar questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enter &#8220;SchoolBot&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the idea of SchoolBot came before my ideas about an information system emerged from it.  I didn&#8217;t want to get involved in my own kid&#8217;s primary school website, but I wanted to make the information on it more easily accessible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The people were asking questions on Facebook. And I&#8217;d been tinkering with Facebook Messenger &#8220;Bots&#8221; on another project. Bots are computer programs that can automatically respond to people using Facebook Messenger or other instant messaging systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I wondered if I could create a Messenger &#8220;bot&#8221; that could use information from the school website to answer peoples&#8217; questions without them even leaving Facebook &#8211; which for many people is the main way that they use the internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"School Bot\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/TGOOfe-kWts?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<figcaption>Initial schoolbot tests (on a non-school day!)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial SchoolBot was built in just a few hours, but Facebook Messenger was on a bit of a lockdown in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica investigations so it wasn&#8217;t available on Messenger to start with. And it was limited to a couple of initial functions like telling you the school meals for the day, and giving you term dates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, SchoolBot has become able to answer more questions, and generally be smarter. And it&#8217;s now connected to Facebook Messenger too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re thinking it, this is NOT &#8220;Artificial Intelligence&#8221;. It&#8217;s actually really quite dumb. But it&#8217;s clever enough to have the veil of something intelligent-looking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a parent &#8211; and yes, I&#8217;m currently the only parent that has access to it &#8211; it&#8217;s a super quick way to ask those essential parent questions and get responses in super quick time. And it&#8217;s fun too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A central &#8220;brain&#8221; for parent information<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SchoolBot did start out as just a simple parent-information chatbot. But it had the information behind it stored in a small database.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I quickly realised that I could use this information in other ways that could be really helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the information in a database, I could not only respond to messenger questions, but I could generate text or tables for a website, or even &#8211; given a suitable template &#8211; printable PDFs!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2144\" height=\"1344\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4067\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test.png 2144w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-300x188.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-768x481.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-1024x642.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-945x592.png 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-600x376.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2144px) 100vw, 2144px\" \/><figcaption>A test of getting data from SchoolBot into a web page &#8211; this uses actual SchoolBot data<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Both of these things are important.  I totally understand the need for things like school meal menus to be in printable format for people that need them. And it seems that most documents start as PDFs, then these are uploaded to the website &#8211; which isn&#8217;t great because PDF&#8217;s on websites are really hard to use, especially on mobile devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So rather than having the information in MS Word <strong>and<\/strong> on the website <strong>and<\/strong> in the SchoolBot database too (and possibly other places), you could just have it in one place &#8211; the central SchoolBot &#8220;brain&#8221; &#8211; and all the other things can be generated from that!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Technical geekery note: yes, the aim here is to have the data available on an API and create widgets and so on that consume that API &#8211; in the screengrab above I&#8217;ve built a simple WordPress plugin that uses SchoolBot data in shortcodes. And yes, the holiday dates are derived from the term dates! You didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d store the same information twice did you?!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SchoolBot also gathers feedback. It keeps a tally of how many times it has been asked questions that it can answer.  And questions that it does not know how to answer are logged so the system can be improved by feeding it more data! Both of these things could be used by a school to improve parent communications by helping them recognise what parents need to know, or what information is hard to get hold of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The impact on community<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In all of this I&#8217;m really aware that, if this ever actually becomes a useful thing, I might be taking something important away. The Facebook group is a source of community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People answering other people&#8217;s questions is a way to connect parents outside of the school run. Who knows what relationships might have sprung up just by someone spotting someone else at the school gate and saying &#8220;Oh, hi. You helped me out the other day!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if the benefits of quick answers to questions outweigh the potential negative effects of removing the Q&amp;A from the group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t even know if the messenger bot part of SchoolBot will be something that people use. Though the centralised data aspects of it remain useful, even without the messenger-related parts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It still feels like a useful thing. So I&#8217;m going to forge ahead and see what I can make of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s the status of SchoolBot?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s very much in development, but like many of my side projects, it exists in a somewhat-usable form and competes with other projects for my attention.  Currently only I can use it. But there&#8217;s no reason why, in its current form, it couldn&#8217;t be put to the public to test.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that would involve me being a geeky parent turning up with bright ideas that will probably make teacher&#8217;s lives more complicated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hmm\u2026<\/p>\n",
