One of the boons of this has been watching the inspiring little comments of an old Bathonian friend of mine.<\/p>\n<p>My friend (I won&#8217;t name him unless he reads this and decides he would like me to) is&#8230;well&#8230;I don&#8217;t really know what he does now.  I think he used to work for the Institute of Physics or something, as a web designer, and he seems to have continued in a similar line of work.  And now, in the absence of anyone else, he&#8217;s my personal guru for all things web design, Web 2.0, blogs, social networking and so on.  I guess he inspires my inner-geek.<\/p>\n<p>And I do have a part of me that thrives on this stuff.  I love the interesting ways that people make innovative use of technology to achieve useful, and sometimes beautiful things.  Here are some other little web-based things that I&#8217;ve come across since following this person:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/last.fm\">last.fm<\/a> &#8211; great way to discover new music<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mycyclinglog.com\">mycyclinglog.com<\/a> &#8211; my current bike logger<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/identi.ca\">identi.ca<\/a> &#8211; open alternative to Twitter<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/ping.fm\">ping.fm<\/a> &#8211; update multiple statuses\/micro-blogs from one place<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opera.com\">Opera<\/a> &#8211; a rediscovery of the old alternative web-browser<\/p>\n<p>But not just those practical things.  My curiosity about the way people are using the web to communicate and interact has been roused.  I&#8217;m intrigued how people are creating web sites that are simple, functional and well-designed.  Things not only of purpose but of beauty.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m feeling behind and afraid though.  I barely know Java and have heard only rumours of Ajax, let alone other &#8220;next big things&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve been toying with client-side scripting, servlets, application frameworks, but not digging deep.  I have an excellent grounding in Computer Science and an inquisitive mind, but there&#8217;s so much to learn and I don&#8217;t have time enough to invest to satisfy my curiosity, let alone learn anything of much use.  And where would I start?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m afraid because of security, the nature of my online identity. I&#8217;m generally very open, as readers of this blog would know, but there&#8217;s stuff that I don&#8217;t want out there on the internet (mostly about other people and work, but sometimes about me).  Can I throw myself into the online world of sharing so much with so many in safety?  Do I want <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brightkite.com\">BrightKite.com<\/a> telling everyone where I am all the time?<\/p>\n<p>And there&#8217;s the issue of time.  My feed list in <a href=\"http:\/\/reader.google.com\">Google Reader<\/a> continues to grow and reading, as well as writing, is a chore.  Could I read the Twitter entries of more than about 20 people and have a real life too?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also uncertain about who to take on the journey with me.  In many ways I&#8217;m a long way ahead of my peers and I&#8217;d love to be able to introduce others to my personal world of customised web sites, RSS and Atom feeds, alternative browsers and web presence because I think these things are useful tools.  But would they get it?  How confusing is it to a non techie?  There are so many places to be with new networks and tools appearing all the time. If I can barely keep up, how will they?<\/p>\n<p>I think the web is an exciting, fun, and hugely creative place to be at the moment.  Yet it&#8217;s a big place.  A scary place.  A confusing place.  An ever-changing and unknown place.<\/p>\n<p>My online interaction with the friend I mentioned above is a fine example of how the web can bring together people with a common cause or interest.  It can be a very negative place, but it can be inspiring and friendly too.  With my friend&#8217;s help I hope to continue to be a part of this strange world, and to introduce others to it, and maybe, one day, to be responsible for a small part of it.<\/p>\n",

One of the boons of this has been watching the inspiring little comments of an old Bathonian friend of mine.<\/p>\n<p>My friend (I won&#8217;t name him unless he reads this and decides he would like me to) is&#8230;well&#8230;I don&#8217;t really know what he does now.  I think he used to work for the Institute of Physics or something, as a web designer, and he seems to have continued in a similar line of work.  And now, in the absence of anyone else, he&#8217;s my personal guru for all things web design, Web 2.0, blogs, social networking and so on.  I guess he inspires my inner-geek.<\/p>\n<p>And I do have a part of me that thrives on this stuff.  I love the interesting ways that people make innovative use of technology to achieve useful, and sometimes beautiful things.  Here are some other little web-based things that I&#8217;ve come across since following this person:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/last.fm\">last.fm<\/a> &#8211; great way to discover new music<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mycyclinglog.com\">mycyclinglog.com<\/a> &#8211; my current bike logger<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/identi.ca\">identi.ca<\/a> &#8211; open alternative to Twitter<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/ping.fm\">ping.fm<\/a> &#8211; update multiple statuses\/micro-blogs from one place<br \/>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opera.com\">Opera<\/a> &#8211; a rediscovery of the old alternative web-browser<\/p>\n<p>But not just those practical things.  My curiosity about the way people are using the web to communicate and interact has been roused.  I&#8217;m intrigued how people are creating web sites that are simple, functional and well-designed.  Things not only of purpose but of beauty.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m feeling behind and afraid though.  I barely know Java and have heard only rumours of Ajax, let alone other &#8220;next big things&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve been toying with client-side scripting, servlets, application frameworks, but not digging deep.  I have an excellent grounding in Computer Science and an inquisitive mind, but there&#8217;s so much to learn and I don&#8217;t have time enough to invest to satisfy my curiosity, let alone learn anything of much use.  And where would I start?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m afraid because of security, the nature of my online identity. I&#8217;m generally very open, as readers of this blog would know, but there&#8217;s stuff that I don&#8217;t want out there on the internet (mostly about other people and work, but sometimes about me).  Can I throw myself into the online world of sharing so much with so many in safety?  Do I want <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brightkite.com\">BrightKite.com<\/a> telling everyone where I am all the time?<\/p>\n<p>And there&#8217;s the issue of time.  My feed list in <a href=\"http:\/\/reader.google.com\">Google Reader<\/a> continues to grow and reading, as well as writing, is a chore.  Could I read the Twitter entries of more than about 20 people and have a real life too?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also uncertain about who to take on the journey with me.  In many ways I&#8217;m a long way ahead of my peers and I&#8217;d love to be able to introduce others to my personal world of customised web sites, RSS and Atom feeds, alternative browsers and web presence because I think these things are useful tools.  But would they get it?  How confusing is it to a non techie?  There are so many places to be with new networks and tools appearing all the time. If I can barely keep up, how will they?<\/p>\n<p>I think the web is an exciting, fun, and hugely creative place to be at the moment.  Yet it&#8217;s a big place.  A scary place.  A confusing place.  An ever-changing and unknown place.<\/p>\n<p>My online interaction with the friend I mentioned above is a fine example of how the web can bring together people with a common cause or interest.  It can be a very negative place, but it can be inspiring and friendly too.  With my friend&#8217;s help I hope to continue to be a part of this strange world, and to introduce others to it, and maybe, one day, to be responsible for a small part of it.<\/p>\n",

We\u2019ve also stated the \u201csuggested searches\u201d that Cuil came up with as we typed, and what we actually thought we might get.<\/p>\n<p>We didn\u2019t have time (and we\u2019re not THAT sad) to do a complete comparison of Google, Yahoo, MSN and others, so we\u2019ve simply compared the results to those given with Google &#8211; it seems appropriate given the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 1 &#8211; \u201cWhat would Jesus Do?\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well\u2026what would he?  (For those that don&#8217;t know this was a cheesy Christian slogan used to remind people to ask the question themselves when making decisions &#8211; it was probably a good idea until someone got into printing it on merchandise galore &#8211; keyrings, wrist bands, etc).<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What would jesus buy<\/li>\n<li>What would jesus drive<\/li>\n<li>What would jesus eat<\/li>\n<li>what would jesus do<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: WWJD merchandise, or possibly a site actually stating some things that Jesus did.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: What would Jesus Buy (www.wwjbmovie.com)<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lots of references to the film above<\/li>\n<li>Christian weight loss: What would Jesus Eat?<\/li>\n<li>What would Jesus shave with?<\/li>\n<li>The Church of Stop Shopping (presumably related to the movie?)<\/li>\n<li>www.wwjd.com (we didn\u2019t follow the link and have no idea what it is)<\/li>\n<li>Listed Categories (to narrow your search): \u201cWorld Championship Wrestling Alumni\u201d and \u201cAmerican Professional Wrestlers\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What Would Jesus Do on Wikipedia<\/li>\n<li>WWJD merchandise at www.whatwouldjesusdo.com<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Result: Wrestling??? Seriously, we\u2019re NOT making this up!!!  Google wins by a clear mile.  Cuil gets 1 out of 5 for entertainment value only.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 2: \u201cThe Bible\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Can Cuil find me a Good Book?<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Bible (yay!  First hit!)<\/li>\n<li>History of the Bible<\/li>\n<li>How to Read the Bible<\/li>\n<li>The Bible Code<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Links to online bibles, or possibly reference articles explaining what the Bible is.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result:Track and Field News: The Bible of the Sport since 1948<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigating the Bible II<\/li>\n<li>bible.crosswalk.com (an actual Bible!)<\/li>\n<li>The Bible Society<\/li>\n<li>A few other random bible-related things, none of which seem very important<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says: www.biblegateway.com &#8211; everyone\u2019s favourite online bible!<\/p>\n<p>Result: Cuil gets closer but is again blown away by Google.  2 out of 5 for effort!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 3: Lalbagh Indian Cuisine<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u2026because even the faithful like a good curry now and then!<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lalbagh Fort<\/li>\n<li>Lalbagh Road<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Web page of my favourite local Indian takeaway, local directory entries and some reviews.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: Correct listing on donowdo.com (What\u2019s that then?)<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local newspaper reviews<\/li>\n<li>Other fairly random listings<\/li>\n<li>Category: Kings of Mysore<\/li>\n<li>Wikipedia article on Culture of Bangalore<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says: The Lalbagh Website, Yell and Thompson directory entries, and reviews of the intended, and other restaurants called \u201cLalbagh\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Result: Again, I got the information I needed, but a link to the restaurant\u2019s own web site didn\u2019t make the front page.  2 out of 5 again.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 4: \u201cCuil\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Can it find itself?

Cuil Homepage.<\/p>\n<p>Result: What?  They\u2019re not their own top search result?  Zero!!!!<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Test 5: \u201cHelp\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Maybe Cuil is a new breed of search engine and I\u2019m expecting the wrong sort of results.  Perhaps there\u2019s a help page?<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Still no suggested results at all.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Cuil help page.  Err\u2026not sure what else.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: This is really REALLY true.  I got a page back that said: \u201cNo results because of high load\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nothing<\/li>\n<li>Zip<\/li>\n<li>Zilch<\/li>\n<li>Not a sausage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>www.help.com &#8211; seems reasonable<\/li>\n<li>BBC Help (www.bbc.co.uk\/help)<\/li>\n<li>Ingenta Connect Help (???)<\/li>\n<li>Google Help (which is, of course, the equivalent of what we wanted)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Result: Another zero I\u2019m afraid.  An overloaded service is no service at all!<\/p>\n<p><strong>In conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve done our best to show you how this new search engine performs.  We\u2019ll leave you to make up your own mind from our results.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree they\u2019re a great help!<\/p>\n<p>We give Cuil a grand total of 4 out of a possible 25 points!<\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t think Google need worry too much.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Tuesday Update:<\/p>\n<p>The service is back up.

We\u2019ve also stated the \u201csuggested searches\u201d that Cuil came up with as we typed, and what we actually thought we might get.<\/p>\n<p>We didn\u2019t have time (and we\u2019re not THAT sad) to do a complete comparison of Google, Yahoo, MSN and others, so we\u2019ve simply compared the results to those given with Google &#8211; it seems appropriate given the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 1 &#8211; \u201cWhat would Jesus Do?\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well\u2026what would he?  (For those that don&#8217;t know this was a cheesy Christian slogan used to remind people to ask the question themselves when making decisions &#8211; it was probably a good idea until someone got into printing it on merchandise galore &#8211; keyrings, wrist bands, etc).<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What would jesus buy<\/li>\n<li>What would jesus drive<\/li>\n<li>What would jesus eat<\/li>\n<li>what would jesus do<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: WWJD merchandise, or possibly a site actually stating some things that Jesus did.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: What would Jesus Buy (www.wwjbmovie.com)<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lots of references to the film above<\/li>\n<li>Christian weight loss: What would Jesus Eat?<\/li>\n<li>What would Jesus shave with?<\/li>\n<li>The Church of Stop Shopping (presumably related to the movie?)<\/li>\n<li>www.wwjd.com (we didn\u2019t follow the link and have no idea what it is)<\/li>\n<li>Listed Categories (to narrow your search): \u201cWorld Championship Wrestling Alumni\u201d and \u201cAmerican Professional Wrestlers\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What Would Jesus Do on Wikipedia<\/li>\n<li>WWJD merchandise at www.whatwouldjesusdo.com<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Result: Wrestling??? Seriously, we\u2019re NOT making this up!!!  Google wins by a clear mile.  Cuil gets 1 out of 5 for entertainment value only.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 2: \u201cThe Bible\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Can Cuil find me a Good Book?<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Bible (yay!  First hit!)<\/li>\n<li>History of the Bible<\/li>\n<li>How to Read the Bible<\/li>\n<li>The Bible Code<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Links to online bibles, or possibly reference articles explaining what the Bible is.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result:Track and Field News: The Bible of the Sport since 1948<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Navigating the Bible II<\/li>\n<li>bible.crosswalk.com (an actual Bible!)<\/li>\n<li>The Bible Society<\/li>\n<li>A few other random bible-related things, none of which seem very important<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says: www.biblegateway.com &#8211; everyone\u2019s favourite online bible!<\/p>\n<p>Result: Cuil gets closer but is again blown away by Google.  2 out of 5 for effort!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 3: Lalbagh Indian Cuisine<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u2026because even the faithful like a good curry now and then!<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lalbagh Fort<\/li>\n<li>Lalbagh Road<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Web page of my favourite local Indian takeaway, local directory entries and some reviews.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: Correct listing on donowdo.com (What\u2019s that then?)<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local newspaper reviews<\/li>\n<li>Other fairly random listings<\/li>\n<li>Category: Kings of Mysore<\/li>\n<li>Wikipedia article on Culture of Bangalore<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says: The Lalbagh Website, Yell and Thompson directory entries, and reviews of the intended, and other restaurants called \u201cLalbagh\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Result: Again, I got the information I needed, but a link to the restaurant\u2019s own web site didn\u2019t make the front page.  2 out of 5 again.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test 4: \u201cCuil\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Can it find itself? And will Google list their new competitor?<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>None &#8211; though by this point I wasn\u2019t getting any suggested searches at all &#8211; perhaps the system was overloaded?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Cuil home page, lots of news articles from today about the launch.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: Properties for sale in Cuil Mhuine, Ireland on Properazzi.com<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>References to what appears to be a music album or a band called \u201cChase around the Windmill\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Books, and area guides relating to several places whose name includes the word \u201cCuil\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Categories: Towns and Villages in Sligo, French Cuisine, Local Breads, Lochaber, and Glens of Scotland.<\/li>\n<li>I also noticed that Cuil returned 121,578 results, compared to Google\u2019s \u201cabout 718,000? &#8211; I\u2019m open to the possibility that less is more in this case.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says: News results for Cuil from Information Week and 819 related articles. Cuil Homepage.<\/p>\n<p>Result: What?  They\u2019re not their own top search result?  Zero!!!!<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Test 5: \u201cHelp\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Maybe Cuil is a new breed of search engine and I\u2019m expecting the wrong sort of results.  Perhaps there\u2019s a help page?<\/p>\n<p>Suggested searches:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Still no suggested results at all.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Expected result: Cuil help page.  Err\u2026not sure what else.<\/p>\n<p>Top Cuil result: This is really REALLY true.  I got a page back that said: \u201cNo results because of high load\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>What else we got:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nothing<\/li>\n<li>Zip<\/li>\n<li>Zilch<\/li>\n<li>Not a sausage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google says:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>www.help.com &#8211; seems reasonable<\/li>\n<li>BBC Help (www.bbc.co.uk\/help)<\/li>\n<li>Ingenta Connect Help (???)<\/li>\n<li>Google Help (which is, of course, the equivalent of what we wanted)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Result: Another zero I\u2019m afraid.  An overloaded service is no service at all!<\/p>\n<p><strong>In conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve done our best to show you how this new search engine performs.  We\u2019ll leave you to make up your own mind from our results.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree they\u2019re a great help!<\/p>\n<p>We give Cuil a grand total of 4 out of a possible 25 points!<\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t think Google need worry too much.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Tuesday Update:<\/p>\n<p>The service is back up.  Searching for &#8220;help&#8221; didn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>Oddly, though searching for &#8220;Cuil&#8221; on Cuil.com gave random results, searching for &#8220;Google&#8221; on Cuil.com gave lots of links to Google&#8217;s sites.

I only found out about this at the weekend and it started on Monday.  The idea is to incentivise people to go and ride a bike for 10 minutes or 1 mile, by running a workplace competition, giving spot prizes to individuals who enter, and team prizes to the companies\/departments who get the highest percentage of staff on a bike!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really clever and seems to have lots of good backing.  They&#8217;ve sent me a goodie bag of lollipops, cycle computers, lights, keyrings, reflective strips and puncture repair kits, and have generally been very helpful in promoting it around the office.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Everyday Cycling<\/p>\n<p><\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.everydaycycling.com\/\">Everyday Cycling<\/a> have also just released more community features, like groups, blogs, messages and rankings.

I only found out about this at the weekend and it started on Monday.  The idea is to incentivise people to go and ride a bike for 10 minutes or 1 mile, by running a workplace competition, giving spot prizes to individuals who enter, and team prizes to the companies\/departments who get the highest percentage of staff on a bike!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really clever and seems to have lots of good backing.  They&#8217;ve sent me a goodie bag of lollipops, cycle computers, lights, keyrings, reflective strips and puncture repair kits, and have generally been very helpful in promoting it around the office.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Everyday Cycling<\/p>\n<p><\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.everydaycycling.com\/\">Everyday Cycling<\/a> have also just released more community features, like groups, blogs, messages and rankings.

                "rendered": "<p>I quoted from the Bible&#8217;s book called &#8220;Exodus&#8221; only yesterday &#8211; here&#8217;s a bit again from the 10 commandments: &#8220;You shall have no other gods before me.  You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to see what this might mean in modern times.  We try to turn it into idolising things like wealth, fame, or work, and I&#8217;m sure that these are things we need to be careful not to become the focus of our lives, but somehow it doesn&#8217;t quite seem the same.  These don&#8217;t feel like Gods somehow.<\/p>\n<p>There are people out there that really do have other &#8220;Gods&#8221;.  Maybe they worship mother earth, or the rain gods, or the sun gods.  Lots of gods have been created to symbolise things that we can&#8217;t control and people ask them to control the things that we can&#8217;t control.  If I sacrifice a lamb to the rain God maybe he will send the rain we need for our crops?  Is our scorching weather and drought because I&#8217;ve been a bad person and the weather Gods are looking down on me<\/p>\n<p>As a new gardener lots of things start to take over your life.  Weather is one of them.  And it&#8217;s getting personal!  Who&#8217;s in control of all this, and how do I get them to send the weather I need?!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s annoying when it doesn&#8217;t rain.  I fear drought and our one 120l water butt will only last us a week or so.  But it&#8217;s also annoying when it&#8217;s cold, or cloudy.  Our plants love water, but they love heat and light too. <\/p>\n<p>Gardening really puts you in a position where you depend on the weather.  And it feels sometimes like it&#8217;s having a go at you.  I can clearly see how people saw drought and floods as punishment, prayed for rain, or for it to stop raining.  I can understand the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anthropomorphic\">anthropomorphisation<\/a> of nature.  I can understand the relationship that people have had with the elements.<\/p>\n<p>I can understand why these people had weather Gods, and that, somehow, makes the commandment all the more powerful.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not a 7-day creationist, but I love the imagery of the creation story in the book of Genesis in the Bible.  A book which clearly asserts that God, the God of Israel, and now the God of the world, made everything and has it all in his hands.  I love the little details intended to dispell the myths of other Gods, such as the storytellers throwaway comment that &#8220;He also made the stars&#8221; (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?book_id=1&amp;chapter=1&amp;verse=16&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse\">Gen 1:16<\/a>) &#8211; you know, just while He was at it, might as well make a few little stars too.<\/p>\n<p>And Jesus confirms both his deity and his power over nature in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Matthew%208:23-27;&amp;version=31;\">calming of the storm<\/a> and other such miracles.<\/p>\n<p>So, I have a new understanding of other Gods.  But I also have a continued faith in the one true God.<\/p>\n",

These don&#8217;t feel like Gods somehow.<\/p>\n<p>There are people out there that really do have other &#8220;Gods&#8221;.  Maybe they worship mother earth, or the rain gods, or the sun gods.  Lots of gods have been created to symbolise things that we can&#8217;t control and people ask them to control the things that we can&#8217;t control.  If I sacrifice a lamb to the rain God maybe he will send the rain we need for our crops?  Is our scorching weather and drought because I&#8217;ve been a bad person and the weather Gods are looking down on me<\/p>\n<p>As a new gardener lots of things start to take over your life.  Weather is one of them.  And it&#8217;s getting personal!  Who&#8217;s in control of all this, and how do I get them to send the weather I need?!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s annoying when it doesn&#8217;t rain.  I fear drought and our one 120l water butt will only last us a week or so.  But it&#8217;s also annoying when it&#8217;s cold, or cloudy.  Our plants love water, but they love heat and light too. <\/p>\n<p>Gardening really puts you in a position where you depend on the weather.  And it feels sometimes like it&#8217;s having a go at you.  I can clearly see how people saw drought and floods as punishment, prayed for rain, or for it to stop raining.  I can understand the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anthropomorphic\">anthropomorphisation<\/a> of nature.  I can understand the relationship that people have had with the elements.<\/p>\n<p>I can understand why these people had weather Gods, and that, somehow, makes the commandment all the more powerful.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not a 7-day creationist, but I love the imagery of the creation story in the book of Genesis in the Bible.  A book which clearly asserts that God, the God of Israel, and now the God of the world, made everything and has it all in his hands.  I love the little details intended to dispell the myths of other Gods, such as the storytellers throwaway comment that &#8220;He also made the stars&#8221; (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?book_id=1&amp;chapter=1&amp;verse=16&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse\">Gen 1:16<\/a>) &#8211; you know, just while He was at it, might as well make a few little stars too.<\/p>\n<p>And Jesus confirms both his deity and his power over nature in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Matthew%208:23-27;&amp;version=31;\">calming of the storm<\/a> and other such miracles.<\/p>\n<p>So, I have a new understanding of other Gods.  But I also have a continued faith in the one true God.<\/p>\n",

For those that don&#8217;t know what this means, I basically led the music for a church service; I picked the songs, did a little bit of arranging, made sure everyone knew what they were doing, organised the rehersal and introduced and led the songs themselves.  It&#8217;s important that this wasn&#8217;t something great that I did, I love my God and it was all about getting other people to connect with Him and show their adoration for Him.  But it was an important event for me too, so I mention it here state that it went well and that I enjoyed it, and then I leave it.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><br \/>Life is good!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

It&#8217;s important that this wasn&#8217;t something great that I did, I love my God and it was all about getting other people to connect with Him and show their adoration for Him.

However, the rubber fittings you see in the photo have done me proud, holding the fenders on with little movement through some of Swindon&#8217;s roughest roads.  The extra fittings for blade-style front forks are clever too, allowing secure attachment to oddly shaped aero forks, and they come with &#8220;permanent&#8221; fixings in the form of some cable-ties too.<\/p>\n<p>Riding with them is fine and you hardly notice them there.  There is an occasional squeak when you go over a bump and the blade rubs on the tyre, but a little careful alignment (by tweaking the position of the fittings slightly) mostly fixes this.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a pretty wet July so far and so they&#8217;ve had plenty of rain to cope with and I must say, they do a great job!  I&#8217;ve not had any spray come up at me and, unlike the previous crud catchers, the front blade follows the wheel, protecting me even on corners.  I have no experience of group riding so can&#8217;t make any claim about the guy behind me getting drenched.  I might have to go with the pro&#8217;s with their experience of that, however, glancing back, I can&#8217;t see much spray coming up at all!<\/p>\n<p>My only complaint so far is that you can bash them when track-standing.  You need to be careful to keep your foot out of the way when turning the front wheel a lot.  Somehow the difference is only a few centimeters, but it is a BIG difference.  Even so, when I have knocked the in this way, they&#8217;ve stayed on.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m really pleased with my blades.  If you&#8217;re thinking of buying some I would heartily recommend them.<\/p>\n<p>Now where&#8217;s those permanent fixings?<\/p>\n",

Well, they are clip-on mud guards for road bikes that do not require eyelets to screw into or clearance between the brake calipers and the tyres.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m an all weather commuter (and rapidly becoming an all-weather trainer too) and Fuzzy, my Felt Road Bike, doesn&#8217;t have either eyelets or mudguard clearance.  So when I got him I kitted him out with some &#8220;Crud Catcher&#8221; type mud guards.  Not ideal and pretty uncool for a sleek, speed machine:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/ross.wintle\/MagicRoundaboutsAndPaddedPants\/photo?authkey=AnBieCY4GSw#5169945778666692082\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/R79WS011XfI\/AAAAAAAAB0s\/uATCuL3_jCY\/s400\/IMG_0300.JPG\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>I tried to re-create this photo with the Race Blades but got the bike (and the weather) the wrong way round and I can&#8217;t be bothered to do another&#8230;here he is with the new kit:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/ross.wintle\/MagicRoundaboutsAndPaddedPants\/photo?authkey=AnBieCY4GSw#5213668065362303794\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SFqre3S32zI\/AAAAAAAACm8\/CURdgCKFb8k\/s400\/IMG_0737.JPG\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>Nice!

However, the rubber fittings you see in the photo have done me proud, holding the fenders on with little movement through some of Swindon&#8217;s roughest roads.  The extra fittings for blade-style front forks are clever too, allowing secure attachment to oddly shaped aero forks, and they come with &#8220;permanent&#8221; fixings in the form of some cable-ties too.<\/p>\n<p>Riding with them is fine and you hardly notice them there.  There is an occasional squeak when you go over a bump and the blade rubs on the tyre, but a little careful alignment (by tweaking the position of the fittings slightly) mostly fixes this.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a pretty wet July so far and so they&#8217;ve had plenty of rain to cope with and I must say, they do a great job!  I&#8217;ve not had any spray come up at me and, unlike the previous crud catchers, the front blade follows the wheel, protecting me even on corners.  I have no experience of group riding so can&#8217;t make any claim about the guy behind me getting drenched.  I might have to go with the pro&#8217;s with their experience of that, however, glancing back, I can&#8217;t see much spray coming up at all!<\/p>\n<p>My only complaint so far is that you can bash them when track-standing.  You need to be careful to keep your foot out of the way when turning the front wheel a lot.  Somehow the difference is only a few centimeters, but it is a BIG difference.  Even so, when I have knocked the in this way, they&#8217;ve stayed on.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m really pleased with my blades.  If you&#8217;re thinking of buying some I would heartily recommend them.<\/p>\n<p>Now where&#8217;s those permanent fixings?<\/p>\n",

The news stories were served up from it and the internet trembled in anticipation at the announcement of their latest social research findings, and the sound of the journalists grew louder and louder. Then the journalists spoke and the voice of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation answered it.  The Joseph Rowntree Foundation descended to the internet and sent their press release to the news web sites&#8230;and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation spoke all these words:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I am the Jospeh Rowntree Foundation, who has surveyed 3,500 people, and have revealed a strong sense of unease about some of the changes shaping British society:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#8220;you shall build stronger communities;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not be selfish;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not be greedy consumers;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall have good moral values;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall have strong families;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not make victims of young people; and they shall not perpetrate anti-social behaviour;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not comsume too much drugs and alcohol;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall strive to remove poverty and inequality;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall be tolerant and inclusive of foreigners; and they shall respect you;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not partake in crime and violence.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>When the people saw the research report and heard the radio reports and read the newspaper commentators, they trembled with fear.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Nothing Changes<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I hope you get the point.

God gave these commands in order to protect His people, to help them.

But I had my first crash involving someone else today.<\/p>\n<p>It was nothing major.  I, on my bike, collided with a 10-ish-year-old girl, also on a bike.  There were no major injuries but it was quite a shock.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been pulling away from a roundabout.  Just past the exit, there was an unmarked crossing with an island.  I&#8217;d seen the family with a couple of kids on bikes, about to cross from a distance.  As I approached, the mother saw me and shouted to stop, and I pulled away from the roundabout as normal assuming that they would.<\/p>\n<p>As I got closer, it appeared that one of the girls wasn&#8217;t about to stop.  I THINK I remember<br \/>making eye contact, but if we did she must have thought that I would stop.  My initial thought was that SHE would stop.  Either that or speed up and get out of my way.  But she continued on at the same slow speed.  I&#8217;d committed to the gap on my left, in front of the girl, but it was shrinking, so I got on the brakes.  Too late though.  We collided.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really remember what happened then, but we all ended up standing at the side of the road.  The mother was more concerned with my welfare than that of her daughter.  I think she felt bad because, ultimately, it was the girl&#8217;s fault for crossing without looking.  She stood in silence holding her hand and looking mightily scared.  I had a bruised leg but kept my cool and wished them a good day once we&#8217;d established that everyone was OK.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to blame myself for it &#8211; something I&#8217;m usually pretty good at &#8211; but all I can come up with is that, had I judged it better, I could have avoided a collision; a collision that occurred because the girl crossed in front of me.<\/p>\n<p>It was a minor incident, but it&#8217;s made me cautious.  Maybe next time I&#8217;ll anticipate the family crossing and be slower.  If I was in a car it would have been much worse, so perhaps I&#8217;ll be driving more carefully in future too.<\/p>\n<p>This is not the first incident of children running out at me.  I know that the bike is quiet, but the incidents have occurred on pretty major roads and kids should be stopping and looking hard both ways before crossing.  Whatever happened to the green cross code?<\/p>\n<p>It was a bad start to my first day back at work after being away on holiday &#8211; a report on that to come!  I arrived at work to find that I&#8217;d been evicted from my desk and had to move &#8211; which wasted half a day!  And then I upset someone by sending an email with a SINGLE word in upper-case for emphasis.  So all in all, not a great start to the new working week.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well, I guess it can only get better!<\/p>\n",

But I had my first crash involving someone else today.<\/p>\n<p>It was nothing major.  I, on my bike, collided with a 10-ish-year-old girl, also on a bike.  There were no major injuries but it was quite a shock.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been pulling away from a roundabout.  Just past the exit, there was an unmarked crossing with an island.  I&#8217;d seen the family with a couple of kids on bikes, about to cross from a distance.  As I approached, the mother saw me and shouted to stop, and I pulled away from the roundabout as normal assuming that they would.<\/p>\n<p>As I got closer, it appeared that one of the girls wasn&#8217;t about to stop.  I THINK I remember<br \/>making eye contact, but if we did she must have thought that I would stop.  My initial thought was that SHE would stop.  Either that or speed up and get out of my way.  But she continued on at the same slow speed.  I&#8217;d committed to the gap on my left, in front of the girl, but it was shrinking, so I got on the brakes.  Too late though.  We collided.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really remember what happened then, but we all ended up standing at the side of the road.  The mother was more concerned with my welfare than that of her daughter.  I think she felt bad because, ultimately, it was the girl&#8217;s fault for crossing without looking.  She stood in silence holding her hand and looking mightily scared.  I had a bruised leg but kept my cool and wished them a good day once we&#8217;d established that everyone was OK.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to blame myself for it &#8211; something I&#8217;m usually pretty good at &#8211; but all I can come up with is that, had I judged it better, I could have avoided a collision; a collision that occurred because the girl crossed in front of me.<\/p>\n<p>It was a minor incident, but it&#8217;s made me cautious.  Maybe next time I&#8217;ll anticipate the family crossing and be slower.  If I was in a car it would have been much worse, so perhaps I&#8217;ll be driving more carefully in future too.<\/p>\n<p>This is not the first incident of children running out at me.  I know that the bike is quiet, but the incidents have occurred on pretty major roads and kids should be stopping and looking hard both ways before crossing.  Whatever happened to the green cross code?<\/p>\n<p>It was a bad start to my first day back at work after being away on holiday &#8211; a report on that to come!  I arrived at work to find that I&#8217;d been evicted from my desk and had to move &#8211; which wasted half a day!  And then I upset someone by sending an email with a SINGLE word in upper-case for emphasis.  So all in all, not a great start to the new working week.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well, I guess it can only get better!<\/p>\n",
