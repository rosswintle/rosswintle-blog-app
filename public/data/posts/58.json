I only found out about this at the weekend and it started on Monday.  The idea is to incentivise people to go and ride a bike for 10 minutes or 1 mile, by running a workplace competition, giving spot prizes to individuals who enter, and team prizes to the companies\/departments who get the highest percentage of staff on a bike!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really clever and seems to have lots of good backing.  They&#8217;ve sent me a goodie bag of lollipops, cycle computers, lights, keyrings, reflective strips and puncture repair kits, and have generally been very helpful in promoting it around the office.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Everyday Cycling<\/p>\n<p><\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.everydaycycling.com\/\">Everyday Cycling<\/a> have also just released more community features, like groups, blogs, messages and rankings.  Like social networking for cyclists.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really understand why this is of benefit over traditional social networking &#8211; just join a cycling group on Facebook or something?<\/p>\n<p>Plus, at the moment, the site is really SLOW, so I won&#8217;t be looking around for too long.<\/p>\n<p>Shame, maybe as it develops and comes out of beta it will be good, but for the time being I&#8217;m sticking with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikely.com\/\">Bikely<\/a> for routes, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mycyclinglog.com\/\">MyCyclingLog.com<\/a> for logging and, well, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/\">Facebook<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/magicroundabout\">Twitter<\/a> for social networking.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Update<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/><\/span><\/span>I think that when I wrote this it was my internet connection that was slow.

I only found out about this at the weekend and it started on Monday.  The idea is to incentivise people to go and ride a bike for 10 minutes or 1 mile, by running a workplace competition, giving spot prizes to individuals who enter, and team prizes to the companies\/departments who get the highest percentage of staff on a bike!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really clever and seems to have lots of good backing.  They&#8217;ve sent me a goodie bag of lollipops, cycle computers, lights, keyrings, reflective strips and puncture repair kits, and have generally been very helpful in promoting it around the office.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Everyday Cycling<\/p>\n<p><\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.everydaycycling.com\/\">Everyday Cycling<\/a> have also just released more community features, like groups, blogs, messages and rankings.

                "rendered": "<p>I quoted from the Bible&#8217;s book called &#8220;Exodus&#8221; only yesterday &#8211; here&#8217;s a bit again from the 10 commandments: &#8220;You shall have no other gods before me.  You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to see what this might mean in modern times.  We try to turn it into idolising things like wealth, fame, or work, and I&#8217;m sure that these are things we need to be careful not to become the focus of our lives, but somehow it doesn&#8217;t quite seem the same.  These don&#8217;t feel like Gods somehow.<\/p>\n<p>There are people out there that really do have other &#8220;Gods&#8221;.  Maybe they worship mother earth, or the rain gods, or the sun gods.  Lots of gods have been created to symbolise things that we can&#8217;t control and people ask them to control the things that we can&#8217;t control.  If I sacrifice a lamb to the rain God maybe he will send the rain we need for our crops?  Is our scorching weather and drought because I&#8217;ve been a bad person and the weather Gods are looking down on me<\/p>\n<p>As a new gardener lots of things start to take over your life.  Weather is one of them.  And it&#8217;s getting personal!  Who&#8217;s in control of all this, and how do I get them to send the weather I need?!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s annoying when it doesn&#8217;t rain.  I fear drought and our one 120l water butt will only last us a week or so.  But it&#8217;s also annoying when it&#8217;s cold, or cloudy.  Our plants love water, but they love heat and light too. <\/p>\n<p>Gardening really puts you in a position where you depend on the weather.  And it feels sometimes like it&#8217;s having a go at you.  I can clearly see how people saw drought and floods as punishment, prayed for rain, or for it to stop raining.  I can understand the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anthropomorphic\">anthropomorphisation<\/a> of nature.  I can understand the relationship that people have had with the elements.<\/p>\n<p>I can understand why these people had weather Gods, and that, somehow, makes the commandment all the more powerful.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not a 7-day creationist, but I love the imagery of the creation story in the book of Genesis in the Bible.  A book which clearly asserts that God, the God of Israel, and now the God of the world, made everything and has it all in his hands.  I love the little details intended to dispell the myths of other Gods, such as the storytellers throwaway comment that &#8220;He also made the stars&#8221; (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?book_id=1&amp;chapter=1&amp;verse=16&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse\">Gen 1:16<\/a>) &#8211; you know, just while He was at it, might as well make a few little stars too.<\/p>\n<p>And Jesus confirms both his deity and his power over nature in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Matthew%208:23-27;&amp;version=31;\">calming of the storm<\/a> and other such miracles.<\/p>\n<p>So, I have a new understanding of other Gods.  But I also have a continued faith in the one true God.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I quoted from the Bible&#8217;s book called &#8220;Exodus&#8221; only yesterday &#8211; here&#8217;s a bit again from the 10 commandments: &#8220;You shall have no other gods before me.  You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to see what this might mean in modern times.  We try to turn it into idolising things like wealth, fame, or work, and I&#8217;m sure that these are things we need to be careful not to become the focus of our lives, but somehow it doesn&#8217;t quite seem the same.  These don&#8217;t feel like Gods somehow.<\/p>\n<p>There are people out there that really do have other &#8220;Gods&#8221;.  Maybe they worship mother earth, or the rain gods, or the sun gods.  Lots of gods have been created to symbolise things that we can&#8217;t control and people ask them to control the things that we can&#8217;t control.  If I sacrifice a lamb to the rain God maybe he will send the rain we need for our crops?  Is our scorching weather and drought because I&#8217;ve been a bad person and the weather Gods are looking down on me<\/p>\n<p>As a new gardener lots of things start to take over your life.  Weather is one of them.  And it&#8217;s getting personal!  Who&#8217;s in control of all this, and how do I get them to send the weather I need?!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s annoying when it doesn&#8217;t rain.  I fear drought and our one 120l water butt will only last us a week or so.  But it&#8217;s also annoying when it&#8217;s cold, or cloudy.  Our plants love water, but they love heat and light too. <\/p>\n<p>Gardening really puts you in a position where you depend on the weather.  And it feels sometimes like it&#8217;s having a go at you.  I can clearly see how people saw drought and floods as punishment, prayed for rain, or for it to stop raining.  I can understand the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anthropomorphic\">anthropomorphisation<\/a> of nature.  I can understand the relationship that people have had with the elements.<\/p>\n<p>I can understand why these people had weather Gods, and that, somehow, makes the commandment all the more powerful.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not a 7-day creationist, but I love the imagery of the creation story in the book of Genesis in the Bible.  A book which clearly asserts that God, the God of Israel, and now the God of the world, made everything and has it all in his hands.  I love the little details intended to dispell the myths of other Gods, such as the storytellers throwaway comment that &#8220;He also made the stars&#8221; (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?book_id=1&amp;chapter=1&amp;verse=16&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse\">Gen 1:16<\/a>) &#8211; you know, just while He was at it, might as well make a few little stars too.<\/p>\n<p>And Jesus confirms both his deity and his power over nature in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Matthew%208:23-27;&amp;version=31;\">calming of the storm<\/a> and other such miracles.<\/p>\n<p>So, I have a new understanding of other Gods.  But I also have a continued faith in the one true God.<\/p>\n",

For those that don&#8217;t know what this means, I basically led the music for a church service; I picked the songs, did a little bit of arranging, made sure everyone knew what they were doing, organised the rehersal and introduced and led the songs themselves.  It&#8217;s important that this wasn&#8217;t something great that I did, I love my God and it was all about getting other people to connect with Him and show their adoration for Him.

And there&#8217;s lots of exciting news from friends with babies being born, people going off to become vicars\/ministers.<\/p>\n<p>I also led worship for the first time last week, which was very exciting.  For those that don&#8217;t know what this means, I basically led the music for a church service; I picked the songs, did a little bit of arranging, made sure everyone knew what they were doing, organised the rehersal and introduced and led the songs themselves.  It&#8217;s important that this wasn&#8217;t something great that I did, I love my God and it was all about getting other people to connect with Him and show their adoration for Him.  But it was an important event for me too, so I mention it here state that it went well and that I enjoyed it, and then I leave it.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><br \/>Life is good!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

Well, they are clip-on mud guards for road bikes that do not require eyelets to screw into or clearance between the brake calipers and the tyres.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m an all weather commuter (and rapidly becoming an all-weather trainer too) and Fuzzy, my Felt Road Bike, doesn&#8217;t have either eyelets or mudguard clearance.

However, the rubber fittings you see in the photo have done me proud, holding the fenders on with little movement through some of Swindon&#8217;s roughest roads.  The extra fittings for blade-style front forks are clever too, allowing secure attachment to oddly shaped aero forks, and they come with &#8220;permanent&#8221; fixings in the form of some cable-ties too.<\/p>\n<p>Riding with them is fine and you hardly notice them there.  There is an occasional squeak when you go over a bump and the blade rubs on the tyre, but a little careful alignment (by tweaking the position of the fittings slightly) mostly fixes this.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a pretty wet July so far and so they&#8217;ve had plenty of rain to cope with and I must say, they do a great job!  I&#8217;ve not had any spray come up at me and, unlike the previous crud catchers, the front blade follows the wheel, protecting me even on corners.  I have no experience of group riding so can&#8217;t make any claim about the guy behind me getting drenched.  I might have to go with the pro&#8217;s with their experience of that, however, glancing back, I can&#8217;t see much spray coming up at all!<\/p>\n<p>My only complaint so far is that you can bash them when track-standing.  You need to be careful to keep your foot out of the way when turning the front wheel a lot.  Somehow the difference is only a few centimeters, but it is a BIG difference.  Even so, when I have knocked the in this way, they&#8217;ve stayed on.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m really pleased with my blades.  If you&#8217;re thinking of buying some I would heartily recommend them.<\/p>\n<p>Now where&#8217;s those permanent fixings?<\/p>\n",

Well, they are clip-on mud guards for road bikes that do not require eyelets to screw into or clearance between the brake calipers and the tyres.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m an all weather commuter (and rapidly becoming an all-weather trainer too) and Fuzzy, my Felt Road Bike, doesn&#8217;t have either eyelets or mudguard clearance.  So when I got him I kitted him out with some &#8220;Crud Catcher&#8221; type mud guards.

But how do they perform?<\/p>\n<p>Opinions vary a lot, I&#8217;ve seen claims that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>they fall off at the slightest lump in the road;<\/li>\n<li>they stay on through all conditions;<\/li>\n<li>they&#8217;re fine for keeping you dry but shouldn&#8217;t be used in groups as the person behind will get drenched;<\/li>\n<li>they&#8217;re useless in heavy rain but OK for a light sprinkling;<\/li>\n<li>they&#8217;re not as good as real mudguards for keeping you dry;<\/li>\n<li>they&#8217;re a perfectly good replacement for normal guards and a very clever invention.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I guess I&#8217;ve had mine for two or three weeks now, through a fairly wet July and a couple of hundred miles of all-weather commuting and I will hereafter join with those who sing their praises!<\/p>\n<p>They were easy to fit and I used the &#8220;temporary fittings&#8221; so I could easily take them off if I didn&#8217;t like them.  However, the rubber fittings you see in the photo have done me proud, holding the fenders on with little movement through some of Swindon&#8217;s roughest roads.  The extra fittings for blade-style front forks are clever too, allowing secure attachment to oddly shaped aero forks, and they come with &#8220;permanent&#8221; fixings in the form of some cable-ties too.<\/p>\n<p>Riding with them is fine and you hardly notice them there.  There is an occasional squeak when you go over a bump and the blade rubs on the tyre, but a little careful alignment (by tweaking the position of the fittings slightly) mostly fixes this.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a pretty wet July so far and so they&#8217;ve had plenty of rain to cope with and I must say, they do a great job!  I&#8217;ve not had any spray come up at me and, unlike the previous crud catchers, the front blade follows the wheel, protecting me even on corners.  I have no experience of group riding so can&#8217;t make any claim about the guy behind me getting drenched.  I might have to go with the pro&#8217;s with their experience of that, however, glancing back, I can&#8217;t see much spray coming up at all!<\/p>\n<p>My only complaint so far is that you can bash them when track-standing.  You need to be careful to keep your foot out of the way when turning the front wheel a lot.  Somehow the difference is only a few centimeters, but it is a BIG difference.  Even so, when I have knocked the in this way, they&#8217;ve stayed on.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m really pleased with my blades.  If you&#8217;re thinking of buying some I would heartily recommend them.<\/p>\n<p>Now where&#8217;s those permanent fixings?<\/p>\n",

The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, the whole mountain trembled violently, and the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder. Then Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him.  The LORD descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain&#8230;And God spoke all these words:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cI am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall have no other gods before me.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cRemember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien within your gates&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>\u201cHonor your father and your mother&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not murder.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not commit adultery.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not steal.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cYou shall not covet &#8230; anything that belongs to your neighbor.\u201d <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear&#8230;<\/p>\n<p> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">This year&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><\/span>The internet was awash with gossip because the Joseph Rowntree Foundation had descended upon it. The news stories were served up from it and the internet trembled in anticipation at the announcement of their latest social research findings, and the sound of the journalists grew louder and louder. Then the journalists spoke and the voice of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation answered it.  The Joseph Rowntree Foundation descended to the internet and sent their press release to the news web sites&#8230;and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation spoke all these words:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I am the Jospeh Rowntree Foundation, who has surveyed 3,500 people, and have revealed a strong sense of unease about some of the changes shaping British society:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#8220;you shall build stronger communities;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not be selfish;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not be greedy consumers;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall have good moral values;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall have strong families;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not make victims of young people; and they shall not perpetrate anti-social behaviour;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not comsume too much drugs and alcohol;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall strive to remove poverty and inequality;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall be tolerant and inclusive of foreigners; and they shall respect you;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;you shall not partake in crime and violence.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>When the people saw the research report and heard the radio reports and read the newspaper commentators, they trembled with fear.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Nothing Changes<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I hope you get the point.  The lists have their differences, but it seems that &#8220;social evils&#8221; have changed little since the time of the Israelites wandering in the desert.<\/p>\n<p>As a Christian, I despair slightly.  God gave these commands in order to protect His people, to help them.  Jesus summed the laws that God gave as &#8216;<span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.&#8217; and &#8220;Love your neighbour as yourself&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Have we not learned?  And what will it take for God to get the point across to his people, the whole world?<\/p>\n<p><\/span>&#8220;Blessed are they whose ways are blameless, who walk according to the law of the LORD. Blessed are they who keep his statutes and seek him with all their heart.&#8221;<\/p>\n",

But I had my first crash involving someone else today.<\/p>\n<p>It was nothing major.  I, on my bike, collided with a 10-ish-year-old girl, also on a bike.  There were no major injuries but it was quite a shock.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been pulling away from a roundabout.  Just past the exit, there was an unmarked crossing with an island.  I&#8217;d seen the family with a couple of kids on bikes, about to cross from a distance.  As I approached, the mother saw me and shouted to stop, and I pulled away from the roundabout as normal assuming that they would.<\/p>\n<p>As I got closer, it appeared that one of the girls wasn&#8217;t about to stop.  I THINK I remember<br \/>making eye contact, but if we did she must have thought that I would stop.  My initial thought was that SHE would stop.  Either that or speed up and get out of my way.  But she continued on at the same slow speed.  I&#8217;d committed to the gap on my left, in front of the girl, but it was shrinking, so I got on the brakes.  Too late though.  We collided.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really remember what happened then, but we all ended up standing at the side of the road.  The mother was more concerned with my welfare than that of her daughter.  I think she felt bad because, ultimately, it was the girl&#8217;s fault for crossing without looking.  She stood in silence holding her hand and looking mightily scared.  I had a bruised leg but kept my cool and wished them a good day once we&#8217;d established that everyone was OK.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to blame myself for it &#8211; something I&#8217;m usually pretty good at &#8211; but all I can come up with is that, had I judged it better, I could have avoided a collision; a collision that occurred because the girl crossed in front of me.<\/p>\n<p>It was a minor incident, but it&#8217;s made me cautious.  Maybe next time I&#8217;ll anticipate the family crossing and be slower.  If I was in a car it would have been much worse, so perhaps I&#8217;ll be driving more carefully in future too.<\/p>\n<p>This is not the first incident of children running out at me.  I know that the bike is quiet, but the incidents have occurred on pretty major roads and kids should be stopping and looking hard both ways before crossing.  Whatever happened to the green cross code?<\/p>\n<p>It was a bad start to my first day back at work after being away on holiday &#8211; a report on that to come!  I arrived at work to find that I&#8217;d been evicted from my desk and had to move &#8211; which wasted half a day!  And then I upset someone by sending an email with a SINGLE word in upper-case for emphasis.  So all in all, not a great start to the new working week.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well, I guess it can only get better!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;ve had a few minor incidents on my commute to and from work, and a couple of falls off Fuzzy that were my own stupid fault and didn&#8217;t hurt anyone else.  But I had my first crash involving someone else today.<\/p>\n<p>It was nothing major.  I, on my bike, collided with a 10-ish-year-old girl, also on a bike.  There were no major injuries but it was quite a shock.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been pulling away from a roundabout.  Just past the exit, there was an unmarked crossing with an island.  I&#8217;d seen the family with a couple of kids on bikes, about to cross from a distance.  As I approached, the mother saw me and shouted to stop, and I pulled away from the roundabout as normal assuming that they would.<\/p>\n<p>As I got closer, it appeared that one of the girls wasn&#8217;t about to stop.  I THINK I remember<br \/>making eye contact, but if we did she must have thought that I would stop.  My initial thought was that SHE would stop.  Either that or speed up and get out of my way.  But she continued on at the same slow speed.  I&#8217;d committed to the gap on my left, in front of the girl, but it was shrinking, so I got on the brakes.  Too late though.  We collided.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really remember what happened then, but we all ended up standing at the side of the road.  The mother was more concerned with my welfare than that of her daughter.  I think she felt bad because, ultimately, it was the girl&#8217;s fault for crossing without looking.  She stood in silence holding her hand and looking mightily scared.  I had a bruised leg but kept my cool and wished them a good day once we&#8217;d established that everyone was OK.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to blame myself for it &#8211; something I&#8217;m usually pretty good at &#8211; but all I can come up with is that, had I judged it better, I could have avoided a collision; a collision that occurred because the girl crossed in front of me.<\/p>\n<p>It was a minor incident, but it&#8217;s made me cautious.  Maybe next time I&#8217;ll anticipate the family crossing and be slower.  If I was in a car it would have been much worse, so perhaps I&#8217;ll be driving more carefully in future too.<\/p>\n<p>This is not the first incident of children running out at me.  I know that the bike is quiet, but the incidents have occurred on pretty major roads and kids should be stopping and looking hard both ways before crossing.  Whatever happened to the green cross code?<\/p>\n<p>It was a bad start to my first day back at work after being away on holiday &#8211; a report on that to come!  I arrived at work to find that I&#8217;d been evicted from my desk and had to move &#8211; which wasted half a day!  And then I upset someone by sending an email with a SINGLE word in upper-case for emphasis.  So all in all, not a great start to the new working week.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well, I guess it can only get better!<\/p>\n",

Shopping is always interesting as we both have our little things we&#8217;re passionate about.  Fair trade, free range, recycled, compostable, organic, low-energy, locally sourced, etc.  And we&#8217;re fortunate enough to a) have the choice to buy these things b) be able to afford them!  So our shopping bill is probably quite high for a two-person household.<\/p>\n<p>We also seem to buy a LOT of cereals!  I eat a combination of muesli, crunchy oat cereal and corn flakes for breakfast, and I snack on cereal bars during the day (either bought, or all-natural, home-made from&#8230;oats, muesli, seeds, dried fruit, honey, egg whites, and apple juice &#8211; recipe available on request).  Cereals also last a long time so we stock up whenever we&#8217;re in the shops.  I reckon about a third of our trolley load was cereals!  Maybe I&#8217;m addicted to oats?<\/p>\n<p>We were also astonished to find cheap beer.  I mean CHEAP beer.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been using up some old, past-its-sell-by-date lager in beer traps to get the slugs in our garden (highly effective I might add!).  But we&#8217;ve run out, so I bought some Sainsbury&#8217;s &#8220;Basics&#8221; bitter.  For&#8230;wait for it&#8230;97p for 4 cans!!!<\/p>\n<p>This is cheaper than coke!  It&#8217;s probably cheaper than bottled water.  I&#8217;ve heard about such beer on the news, but to actually see it in the shops is astounding.<\/p>\n<p>Sally turned the cheap-beer thing into something light-hearted though by commenting that, because we&#8217;ve switched from lager to bitter, &#8220;we&#8217;ll probably catch the older, fatter slugs with beards now&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll wait and see!<\/p>\n",

I eat a combination of muesli, crunchy oat cereal and corn flakes for breakfast, and I snack on cereal bars during the day (either bought, or all-natural, home-made from&#8230;oats, muesli, seeds, dried fruit, honey, egg whites, and apple juice &#8211; recipe available on request).  Cereals also last a long time so we stock up whenever we&#8217;re in the shops.  I reckon about a third of our trolley load was cereals!  Maybe I&#8217;m addicted to oats?<\/p>\n<p>We were also astonished to find cheap beer.  I mean CHEAP beer.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been using up some old, past-its-sell-by-date lager in beer traps to get the slugs in our garden (highly effective I might add!).  But we&#8217;ve run out, so I bought some Sainsbury&#8217;s &#8220;Basics&#8221; bitter.  For&#8230;wait for it&#8230;97p for 4 cans!!!<\/p>\n<p>This is cheaper than coke!  It&#8217;s probably cheaper than bottled water.  I&#8217;ve heard about such beer on the news, but to actually see it in the shops is astounding.<\/p>\n<p>Sally turned the cheap-beer thing into something light-hearted though by commenting that, because we&#8217;ve switched from lager to bitter, &#8220;we&#8217;ll probably catch the older, fatter slugs with beards now&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll wait and see!<\/p>\n",

All prompted by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/t1mmyb\">t1mmyb<\/a>&#8216;s little note on Twitter the other day.<\/p>\n<p>I started out using Google Docs for tracking my times in a simple online spreadsheet.  This was OK but when it started getting big and unmanagable I started looking for something better, and decided to stick with www.bikejournal.com.  It&#8217;s a bit clunky but did a good job.<\/p>\n<p>But Tim pointed me at www.mycyclinglog.com.  A fab site which is slick, fast, looks nice and does some interesting things.  It also allows you to have a &#8220;badge&#8221; that you can stick on your blog (look right and down), it integrates with Facebook, and has RSS feeds.  I love it and I was an almost instant convert.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, in an odd kind of way, it&#8217;s reinvigorated my waning passion for cycling.  Tracking your times makes you want to improve your times!  Perhaps having them on public display will make me want to do that all the more!!<\/p>\n",

All prompted by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/t1mmyb\">t1mmyb<\/a>&#8216;s little note on Twitter the other day.<\/p>\n<p>I started out using Google Docs for tracking my times in a simple online spreadsheet.  This was OK but when it started getting big and unmanagable I started looking for something better, and decided to stick with www.bikejournal.com.  It&#8217;s a bit clunky but did a good job.<\/p>\n<p>But Tim pointed me at www.mycyclinglog.com.  A fab site which is slick, fast, looks nice and does some interesting things.  It also allows you to have a &#8220;badge&#8221; that you can stick on your blog (look right and down), it integrates with Facebook, and has RSS feeds.  I love it and I was an almost instant convert.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, in an odd kind of way, it&#8217;s reinvigorated my waning passion for cycling.  Tracking your times makes you want to improve your times!  Perhaps having them on public display will make me want to do that all the more!!<\/p>\n",
