                "rendered": "<h3>The way of things to come<\/h3>\n<p>We had a very nice long sleep &#8211; a feature that would be present in most of our days in Ireland.  We had spotted in our room an electronic pest control device and had heard some odd noises from above &#8211; we wondered if there may be rats, but these failed to materialise in any tangible way during the course of the week&#8230;phew.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>On waking, I had a really intense stomach pain for a few hours.  To the extent that we nearly headed to hospital.  After a while it started to go though, and I took my mind off it by programming some Geocaches into GPS.  We were learning as we went along with this &#8211; both about Geocaching and how to use the GPS, so it was a slow process.  One key thing we discovered was that we could input the co-ordinates for the caches in longitude and latitude (as given on geocaching.com) and then get the GPS receiver to translate these into nice Irish Grid references for us on the map.  This COULD be done by hand, but was much more accurate with the technology, and the Irish Grid references would prove invaluable in our hunting.<\/p>\n<p>We then headed off to Wicklow Town.  The Information Centre (and most things) were shut on Sunday.  But we found a pharmacy and another Super Valu (with another Tesco nearby), that was open, which was what we needed.<\/p>\n<p>As we came out of Super Valu the Irish rain came down, but &#8211; as expected, it had all but stopped by the time we got back to the car.  It was on and off all day&#8230;all week!  Light and heavy, wet and then dry again, blazing sunshine evaporating the surface water of recent showers in a shimmering cloud of steam.<\/p>\n<h3>How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?<\/h3>\n<p>We took the back roads from Wicklow to Rathdrum for our first bit of solo Geocaching: the Maria&#8217;s Drum multi-cache (spoliers lie ahead if you&#8217;re a Geocacher who may one day go to Ireland).<\/p>\n<p>Multi-caches have several parts and are usually treasure-hunt-like affairs, with places to explore and clues o solve to find the co-ordinates of the cache.  The first two steps were easy and took in the local high street and a memorial park.  We solved the clues and calculated the co-ordinates, but the third and final part was an unexpectedly long walk away.<\/p>\n<p>We finally arrived at a small roadside shrine to the blessed virgin (I think).  We followed the GPS, which, in the tree cover, wasn&#8217;t being particularly accurate.  We followed the decoded clue.  We rummaged in the trees, we searched the stone walls for little holes, and we hunted high and low, but to no avail.<\/p>\n<p>We eventually gave up and headed back up to the town, disappointed; Geocaching isn&#8217;t supposed to be like this, it&#8217;s fun, and exciting, the trail, the search, the find!!!  But no, we failed at the first attempt.  Did we not look hard enough?  Or was it not there?  We&#8217;ve logged our &#8220;Not Found&#8221; and are waiting to see.<\/p>\n<p>We did head back for another go on our way back out of Rathdrum in the car, but still couldn&#8217;t find it.  We&#8217;re convinced the cache has been removed.  I, personally, didn&#8217;t like rummaging around in a shrine to Mary &#8211; I&#8217;m a Christian, but I&#8217;m not into the reverance for Mary that catholics have, but I also appreciate that some people will have regarded that as a sacred site.  Perhaps that&#8217;s why the cache was removed?<\/p>\n<h3>The Beach<\/h3>\n<p>We grabbed an ice cream&#8230;this would become another habit of our holiday&#8230;and then headed back to the cottage.<\/p>\n<p>Dinner was followed by an attempted walk to the nearest beach.  Our first attempt was via a farm and track but, despite the existence of a track on the map, we weren&#8217;t sure if we had a right of way across the field.  So we abandoned the route.<\/p>\n<p>The second attempt was via the road through the nearby &#8220;Missionary Sisters'&#8221; place, however, this was clearly signposted as private ground.<\/p>\n<p>So we headed back down past the farm that we first tried, for a longer, on-road route.  But we went too far along the road &#8211; which had confused me, because the map clearly showed a turning on the right towards the beach.  It turned out that the path to the beach marked on the map as &#8220;other road&#8221;, was actually a gated, narrow, pedestrian path!  Grrr.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually we found the path, and got to the beach.  It was nice and secluded &#8211; out own private bay for 20 minutes &#8211; but there was lots of litter.  As we left, some bikers arrived at the end of the path.  I suspect there&#8217;s a lot of fires and parties that go on on that little patch of sand, and we were probably fortunate to have a secluded stroll.<\/p>\n<h3>Finding our way<\/h3>\n<p>Ireland is &#8220;just over there&#8221;, and most people speak English, but Ireland can be quite different.<\/p>\n<p>Wicklow is very scenic but feels tamed.  We have OS maps but paths are not easily findable and some paths and even roads, seem to be private.  It makes you realise how open and accessible the UK is and how good it is for countryside rambling.<\/p>\n<p>We were still finding our way on the first day of our holiday.<\/p>\n",

        "title": "A Week in Wicklow &#8211; Part 3: The Ways of Wicklow",
        "content": "<h3>The way of things to come<\/h3>\n<p>We had a very nice long sleep &#8211; a feature that would be present in most of our days in Ireland.  We had spotted in our room an electronic pest control device and had heard some odd noises from above &#8211; we wondered if there may be rats, but these failed to materialise in any tangible way during the course of the week&#8230;phew.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>On waking, I had a really intense stomach pain for a few hours.  To the extent that we nearly headed to hospital.  After a while it started to go though, and I took my mind off it by programming some Geocaches into GPS.  We were learning as we went along with this &#8211; both about Geocaching and how to use the GPS, so it was a slow process.  One key thing we discovered was that we could input the co-ordinates for the caches in longitude and latitude (as given on geocaching.com) and then get the GPS receiver to translate these into nice Irish Grid references for us on the map.  This COULD be done by hand, but was much more accurate with the technology, and the Irish Grid references would prove invaluable in our hunting.<\/p>\n<p>We then headed off to Wicklow Town.  The Information Centre (and most things) were shut on Sunday.  But we found a pharmacy and another Super Valu (with another Tesco nearby), that was open, which was what we needed.<\/p>\n<p>As we came out of Super Valu the Irish rain came down, but &#8211; as expected, it had all but stopped by the time we got back to the car.  It was on and off all day&#8230;all week!  Light and heavy, wet and then dry again, blazing sunshine evaporating the surface water of recent showers in a shimmering cloud of steam.<\/p>\n<h3>How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?<\/h3>\n<p>We took the back roads from Wicklow to Rathdrum for our first bit of solo Geocaching: the Maria&#8217;s Drum multi-cache (spoliers lie ahead if you&#8217;re a Geocacher who may one day go to Ireland).<\/p>\n<p>Multi-caches have several parts and are usually treasure-hunt-like affairs, with places to explore and clues o solve to find the co-ordinates of the cache.  The first two steps were easy and took in the local high street and a memorial park.  We solved the clues and calculated the co-ordinates, but the third and final part was an unexpectedly long walk away.<\/p>\n<p>We finally arrived at a small roadside shrine to the blessed virgin (I think).  We followed the GPS, which, in the tree cover, wasn&#8217;t being particularly accurate.  We followed the decoded clue.  We rummaged in the trees, we searched the stone walls for little holes, and we hunted high and low, but to no avail.<\/p>\n<p>We eventually gave up and headed back up to the town, disappointed; Geocaching isn&#8217;t supposed to be like this, it&#8217;s fun, and exciting, the trail, the search, the find!!!  But no, we failed at the first attempt.  Did we not look hard enough?  Or was it not there?  We&#8217;ve logged our &#8220;Not Found&#8221; and are waiting to see.<\/p>\n<p>We did head back for another go on our way back out of Rathdrum in the car, but still couldn&#8217;t find it.  We&#8217;re convinced the cache has been removed.  I, personally, didn&#8217;t like rummaging around in a shrine to Mary &#8211; I&#8217;m a Christian, but I&#8217;m not into the reverance for Mary that catholics have, but I also appreciate that some people will have regarded that as a sacred site.  Perhaps that&#8217;s why the cache was removed?<\/p>\n<h3>The Beach<\/h3>\n<p>We grabbed an ice cream&#8230;this would become another habit of our holiday&#8230;and then headed back to the cottage.<\/p>\n<p>Dinner was followed by an attempted walk to the nearest beach.  Our first attempt was via a farm and track but, despite the existence of a track on the map, we weren&#8217;t sure if we had a right of way across the field.  So we abandoned the route.<\/p>\n<p>The second attempt was via the road through the nearby &#8220;Missionary Sisters'&#8221; place, however, this was clearly signposted as private ground.<\/p>\n<p>So we headed back down past the farm that we first tried, for a longer, on-road route.  But we went too far along the road &#8211; which had confused me, because the map clearly showed a turning on the right towards the beach.  It turned out that the path to the beach marked on the map as &#8220;other road&#8221;, was actually a gated, narrow, pedestrian path!  Grrr.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually we found the path, and got to the beach.  It was nice and secluded &#8211; out own private bay for 20 minutes &#8211; but there was lots of litter.  As we left, some bikers arrived at the end of the path.  I suspect there&#8217;s a lot of fires and parties that go on on that little patch of sand, and we were probably fortunate to have a secluded stroll.<\/p>\n<h3>Finding our way<\/h3>\n<p>Ireland is &#8220;just over there&#8221;, and most people speak English, but Ireland can be quite different.<\/p>\n<p>Wicklow is very scenic but feels tamed.  We have OS maps but paths are not easily findable and some paths and even roads, seem to be private.  It makes you realise how open and accessible the UK is and how good it is for countryside rambling.<\/p>\n<p>We were still finding our way on the first day of our holiday.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<h3>It&#8217;s a Sign!!<\/h3>\n<p>First a note on Irish signs.  These aren&#8217;t lacking, but they are, we find, generally pretty rubbish.  They are badly placed, usually too small, occasionally not actually related to the place\/junction at which they&#8217;re located, and completely sporadic and unpredictable.  One minute a main road is signed, the next, you&#8217;re at a junction with no idea which way to turn.  This is not confined to the countryside: on our trip to Dublin last year we couldn&#8217;t find any signs for the main M1 motorway north to Belfast and spent 40 minutes driving through the suburbs.<\/p>\n<p>Someone should really have a word.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Boots or Shoes?<\/h3>\n<p>Anyway, we were feeling good today.  The forecast was for patchy rain and our target was Glendalough &#8211; &#8220;The valley of two lakes&#8221; &#8211; for some walking and Geocaching.  Morning discussion was of what sort of shoes to wear and what to take.  I suggested that we pack for a proper hike and see what happens.  Lovely wife seemed a bit more sceptical about my potential-hiking ambitions.<\/p>\n<p>We started with a quick trip to pick some information up from Wicklow&#8217;s information office and then headed straight from there to the mostly well-signposted Glendalough.<\/p>\n<h3>Glendalough and St Kevin<\/h3>\n<p>There was a bit of rain to start with but it soon cleared and we had a beautiful day of walking ahead.   Lovely wife wasn&#8217;t so keen to start with, but I encouraged her to take walking boots and a full rucksack.  I think she appreciated this in the end.<\/p>\n<p>Glendalough has a visitor centre, which is OK, but the interpretive bit wasn&#8217;t open and there wasn&#8217;t much in terms of information there, so we grabbed a walking routes map and a leaflet about the historic relics.  Total cost, 1 Euro!<\/p>\n<p>We took a quick trip round the ruins &#8211; these were impressive and old and mostly relating to St Kevin the information leaflet was, true to its name, informative, telling us some of the history and legends surrounding the site and St Kevin himself.  The gravestones were also fascinating, a huge variety of styles from across the years.  The location, in the heart of the glen, was very atmospheric, but the place was bustling with tourists.<\/p>\n<h3>Walking Glendalough<\/h3>\n<p>After a short time we set of on one of the walking routes.  These all seemed to be mostly well-paved and well sign-posted.  Previously in Ireland this has bothered me, but here it seemed fitting.  There&#8217;s a long board walk (a walk along raised wooden boards), which exists to protect the land from erosion&#8230;excellent stuff!  Walking on the marshland would not have been nice.  Sign posts and interpretative boards are there, but not over-done, making it feel slightly more wild.  The altitude and remoteness that you achieve also means that you feel like you&#8217;re doing some proper outdoorsy stuff.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than pick a single main route we made up our own route out of bits of the others &#8211; mostly in order to take in as much scenery and geocaching as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Once we&#8217;d left the busy shorter routes a lot of the people melted away and we were left pretty much to ourselves.  We climbed up a waterfall, walked through a forest, and up and over a hill onto the boardwalk.  This took us along a cliff edge with views that made the climb well worthwhile.<\/p>\n<h3>Spink and Kevin&#8217;s Dental Work<\/h3>\n<p>The first geocache, &#8220;Spink&#8221;, was a short walk uphill from the boardwalk.  It felt wrong walking over the peat and marshland when a clear trail had been provided to protect the land, but that&#8217;s what we did.  Our geocaching disappointment continued as this cache, which had been listed as &#8220;needing maintenance&#8221;, was not in its place at all.  Our lunch had been carried up in a biscuit tin and this was now empty, so we left that in the cache&#8217;s place, with a short note scribbled on a bit of paper.  At least there&#8217;s something there now!<\/p>\n<p>Back down to the boardwalk and along to the western extent of the path.  The second cache was here: a big army tin full of stuff, hiding&#8230;we won&#8217;t say where.  Finally&#8230;success!  We logged our visit and took a &#8220;travel bug&#8221; that was in there too, before trying to hide the cache again without other people in this busy spot seeing what we were doing.  We continued back down the path to the walk&#8217;s end and treated ourselves to an ice-cream.<\/p>\n<h3>Laragh and Home<\/h3>\n<p>Glendalough is sublime, by far the most expansive glen we&#8217;ve visited.  The terrain is varied, but never too challenging, and the occasional relic of times gone by gives you something to learn about too.<\/p>\n<p>We headed home via St Kevin&#8217;s Church, Laragh where another successful (and neatly-hidden) geocache &#8211; Kevin and the Blackbird &#8211; awaited us.  When it works it&#8217;s exciting and good fun!<\/p>\n<p>Back home for dinner, games, and relaxing.  A splendid day!  Very green, very beautiful, better than Northern Ireland, but still not as rugged and charming as the west.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h3>It&#8217;s a Sign!!<\/h3>\n<p>First a note on Irish signs.  These aren&#8217;t lacking, but they are, we find, generally pretty rubbish.  They are badly placed, usually too small, occasionally not actually related to the place\/junction at which they&#8217;re located, and completely sporadic and unpredictable.  One minute a main road is signed, the next, you&#8217;re at a junction with no idea which way to turn.  This is not confined to the countryside: on our trip to Dublin last year we couldn&#8217;t find any signs for the main M1 motorway north to Belfast and spent 40 minutes driving through the suburbs.<\/p>\n<p>Someone should really have a word.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Boots or Shoes?<\/h3>\n<p>Anyway, we were feeling good today.  The forecast was for patchy rain and our target was Glendalough &#8211; &#8220;The valley of two lakes&#8221; &#8211; for some walking and Geocaching.  Morning discussion was of what sort of shoes to wear and what to take.  I suggested that we pack for a proper hike and see what happens.  Lovely wife seemed a bit more sceptical about my potential-hiking ambitions.<\/p>\n<p>We started with a quick trip to pick some information up from Wicklow&#8217;s information office and then headed straight from there to the mostly well-signposted Glendalough.<\/p>\n<h3>Glendalough and St Kevin<\/h3>\n<p>There was a bit of rain to start with but it soon cleared and we had a beautiful day of walking ahead.   Lovely wife wasn&#8217;t so keen to start with, but I encouraged her to take walking boots and a full rucksack.  I think she appreciated this in the end.<\/p>\n<p>Glendalough has a visitor centre, which is OK, but the interpretive bit wasn&#8217;t open and there wasn&#8217;t much in terms of information there, so we grabbed a walking routes map and a leaflet about the historic relics.  Total cost, 1 Euro!<\/p>\n<p>We took a quick trip round the ruins &#8211; these were impressive and old and mostly relating to St Kevin the information leaflet was, true to its name, informative, telling us some of the history and legends surrounding the site and St Kevin himself.  The gravestones were also fascinating, a huge variety of styles from across the years.  The location, in the heart of the glen, was very atmospheric, but the place was bustling with tourists.<\/p>\n<h3>Walking Glendalough<\/h3>\n<p>After a short time we set of on one of the walking routes.  These all seemed to be mostly well-paved and well sign-posted.  Previously in Ireland this has bothered me, but here it seemed fitting.  There&#8217;s a long board walk (a walk along raised wooden boards), which exists to protect the land from erosion&#8230;excellent stuff!  Walking on the marshland would not have been nice.  Sign posts and interpretative boards are there, but not over-done, making it feel slightly more wild.  The altitude and remoteness that you achieve also means that you feel like you&#8217;re doing some proper outdoorsy stuff.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than pick a single main route we made up our own route out of bits of the others &#8211; mostly in order to take in as much scenery and geocaching as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Once we&#8217;d left the busy shorter routes a lot of the people melted away and we were left pretty much to ourselves.  We climbed up a waterfall, walked through a forest, and up and over a hill onto the boardwalk.  This took us along a cliff edge with views that made the climb well worthwhile.<\/p>\n<h3>Spink and Kevin&#8217;s Dental Work<\/h3>\n<p>The first geocache, &#8220;Spink&#8221;, was a short walk uphill from the boardwalk.  It felt wrong walking over the peat and marshland when a clear trail had been provided to protect the land, but that&#8217;s what we did.  Our geocaching disappointment continued as this cache, which had been listed as &#8220;needing maintenance&#8221;, was not in its place at all.  Our lunch had been carried up in a biscuit tin and this was now empty, so we left that in the cache&#8217;s place, with a short note scribbled on a bit of paper.  At least there&#8217;s something there now!<\/p>\n<p>Back down to the boardwalk and along to the western extent of the path.  The second cache was here: a big army tin full of stuff, hiding&#8230;we won&#8217;t say where.  Finally&#8230;success!  We logged our visit and took a &#8220;travel bug&#8221; that was in there too, before trying to hide the cache again without other people in this busy spot seeing what we were doing.  We continued back down the path to the walk&#8217;s end and treated ourselves to an ice-cream.<\/p>\n<h3>Laragh and Home<\/h3>\n<p>Glendalough is sublime, by far the most expansive glen we&#8217;ve visited.  The terrain is varied, but never too challenging, and the occasional relic of times gone by gives you something to learn about too.<\/p>\n<p>We headed home via St Kevin&#8217;s Church, Laragh where another successful (and neatly-hidden) geocache &#8211; Kevin and the Blackbird &#8211; awaited us.  When it works it&#8217;s exciting and good fun!<\/p>\n<p>Back home for dinner, games, and relaxing.  A splendid day!  Very green, very beautiful, better than Northern Ireland, but still not as rugged and charming as the west.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<h3>Radio, Weather and Late Rising<\/h3>\n<p>Two quick observations.<\/p>\n<p>Radio: Radio here is really good.  Both East Coast FM and RTE 2 have a really good mix of music.  Though, oddly, its all English music.<\/p>\n<p>Weather forecasts: We&#8217;ve got Freesat here, but it&#8217;s been really hard getting a decent forecast for the Republic of Ireland.  There don&#8217;t seem to be any Irish channels on Freesat, so we&#8217;re resorting to interpreting the BBC&#8217;s big charts (with the presenter usually stood right in front of the bit of map we&#8217;re interested in) and short snippets on the aforementioned radio.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well.  It&#8217;s mostly sunny with showers, and I guess that will continue.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Our rising time is getting later and later.  With the long days there&#8217;s not really much requirement to get up and out of the house early, so we&#8217;re taking our mornings pretty easy.<\/p>\n<h3>Powerscourt<\/h3>\n<p>Today&#8217;s forecast was sunshine and showers (who&#8217;d have guessed?!), so we decided to do something with an option of being indoors, so it was off a bit North to Powerscourt House and Gardens.  It&#8217;s recommended as a good place to see, and we had a voucher for 2 euro discount on tickets to the garden.<\/p>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t have any Geocaches for that area, so we looked up a few on my phone.  Mobile internet is fine here, though I&#8217;m not looking forward to my next bill and finding out how much it costs.<\/p>\n<p>Armed with the information we needed, we set out.  The drive was pretty easy and took us through some beautiful land.  The only problem being the random\/sporadic signposting again.  But we found Powerscourt and turned into the long drive &#8211; an avenue of huge beech trees.  Once into the car park, sporadic signposting took over again and we wandered into a small garden centre.  Eventually we decided that this wasn&#8217;t on the way to the gardens, so we headed out and back towards the drive.  There we did find the entrance to the house.<\/p>\n<p>Bizarrely, most of the parts of the building that are open to the public have been converted to shops.  It felt like a small, posh, boutiquey shopping mall.  The food court of this mall being the one of the most expensive cafe&#8217;s I&#8217;ve ever been in!  We sat and ate and extortionately expensive sandwich, and drank liquid gold&#8230;err, I mean, a cup of coffee before heading to the gardens.<\/p>\n<h3>Tidy = Dull<\/h3>\n<p>On the way out of the mall, there were a few interpretive boards, but I generally felt that information on the house and gardens was lacking.  We were given a small map with a few prescribed walks around the gardens to follow.  The gardens are nice enough, but not my cup of tea.  If you like pristine, neat, formal gardens, then you&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s amazing, but I prefer something a bit more on the wild side.<\/p>\n<p>I enjoyed the walk through the woodland with its spectacular, huge firs; the Japanese Gardens were nicely done, and I poked around at some of the smaller wildlife in the dolphin pond, but generally was underwhelmed.  The vista from the house of the surrounding hills and Sugar Loaf Mountain was spectacular too, but I was left wanting to get away from the house and up the mountain, rather than hanging around.<\/p>\n<h3>Learning about Logs<\/h3>\n<p>We grabbed our daily ice-cream fix and headed off to do some Geocaching.  First stop, the little town of Enniskerry for &#8220;Knocksink River Bend&#8221;.  The car park to Knocksink Forest Park was closed, and we couldn&#8217;t park outside, so we parked up back in Enniskerry and walked the short distance to the park.  Initially we were on the wrong side of the river and couldn&#8217;t see how to get across, but, after logging on on my mobile and checking the logs, we found that there was a bridge across, and after some meandering, we found the cache.<\/p>\n<p>We then walked back and further up the road to find &#8220;Fox Hall&#8221;, a 2-part multicache, a bit like a treasure hunt.  The first part needed good observation to spot a clue, and once found we used the cache notes to calculate the coordinates of the second cache.  Sadly, it seemed to be in a place where a BMX bike track has neatly been constructed and, with several young muggles around on their bikes, we decided not to disturb them.  Again checking the cache logs shows that we&#8217;re not the first to have this problem.<\/p>\n<p>We learned today that checking the logs, though it can reveal &#8220;spoilers&#8221;, can also be very helpful and worthwhile.<\/p>\n<h3>Tumbling Torrents, Tesco and Telly<\/h3>\n<p>Caching over, we headed back south to check out Powerscourt Waterfall.  This is a spectacular place and a huge, elegant waterfall.  I think we paid 5 euro each to get in, which seems expensive for a short, 1-hour visit.  I&#8217;d recommend taking a picnic or barbecue here and spending a long lunch in this fantastic setting, rather than paying it a flying visit.<\/p>\n<p>Home via the recognisable comforts of Tesco to pick up some dinner supplies and a lazy evening in front of the telly finished our day &#8211; just what we needed.<\/p>\n",

Though, oddly, its all English music.<\/p>\n<p>Weather forecasts: We&#8217;ve got Freesat here, but it&#8217;s been really hard getting a decent forecast for the Republic of Ireland.  There don&#8217;t seem to be any Irish channels on Freesat, so we&#8217;re resorting to interpreting the BBC&#8217;s big charts (with the presenter usually stood right in front of the bit of map we&#8217;re interested in) and short snippets on the aforementioned radio.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well.  It&#8217;s mostly sunny with showers, and I guess that will continue.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Our rising time is getting later and later.  With the long days there&#8217;s not really much requirement to get up and out of the house early, so we&#8217;re taking our mornings pretty easy.<\/p>\n<h3>Powerscourt<\/h3>\n<p>Today&#8217;s forecast was sunshine and showers (who&#8217;d have guessed?!), so we decided to do something with an option of being indoors, so it was off a bit North to Powerscourt House and Gardens.  It&#8217;s recommended as a good place to see, and we had a voucher for 2 euro discount on tickets to the garden.<\/p>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t have any Geocaches for that area, so we looked up a few on my phone.  Mobile internet is fine here, though I&#8217;m not looking forward to my next bill and finding out how much it costs.<\/p>\n<p>Armed with the information we needed, we set out.  The drive was pretty easy and took us through some beautiful land.  The only problem being the random\/sporadic signposting again.  But we found Powerscourt and turned into the long drive &#8211; an avenue of huge beech trees.  Once into the car park, sporadic signposting took over again and we wandered into a small garden centre.  Eventually we decided that this wasn&#8217;t on the way to the gardens, so we headed out and back towards the drive.  There we did find the entrance to the house.<\/p>\n<p>Bizarrely, most of the parts of the building that are open to the public have been converted to shops.  It felt like a small, posh, boutiquey shopping mall.  The food court of this mall being the one of the most expensive cafe&#8217;s I&#8217;ve ever been in!  We sat and ate and extortionately expensive sandwich, and drank liquid gold&#8230;err, I mean, a cup of coffee before heading to the gardens.<\/p>\n<h3>Tidy = Dull<\/h3>\n<p>On the way out of the mall, there were a few interpretive boards, but I generally felt that information on the house and gardens was lacking.  We were given a small map with a few prescribed walks around the gardens to follow.  The gardens are nice enough, but not my cup of tea.  If you like pristine, neat, formal gardens, then you&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s amazing, but I prefer something a bit more on the wild side.<\/p>\n<p>I enjoyed the walk through the woodland with its spectacular, huge firs; the Japanese Gardens were nicely done, and I poked around at some of the smaller wildlife in the dolphin pond, but generally was underwhelmed.  The vista from the house of the surrounding hills and Sugar Loaf Mountain was spectacular too, but I was left wanting to get away from the house and up the mountain, rather than hanging around.<\/p>\n<h3>Learning about Logs<\/h3>\n<p>We grabbed our daily ice-cream fix and headed off to do some Geocaching.  First stop, the little town of Enniskerry for &#8220;Knocksink River Bend&#8221;.  The car park to Knocksink Forest Park was closed, and we couldn&#8217;t park outside, so we parked up back in Enniskerry and walked the short distance to the park.  Initially we were on the wrong side of the river and couldn&#8217;t see how to get across, but, after logging on on my mobile and checking the logs, we found that there was a bridge across, and after some meandering, we found the cache.<\/p>\n<p>We then walked back and further up the road to find &#8220;Fox Hall&#8221;, a 2-part multicache, a bit like a treasure hunt.  The first part needed good observation to spot a clue, and once found we used the cache notes to calculate the coordinates of the second cache.  Sadly, it seemed to be in a place where a BMX bike track has neatly been constructed and, with several young muggles around on their bikes, we decided not to disturb them.  Again checking the cache logs shows that we&#8217;re not the first to have this problem.<\/p>\n<p>We learned today that checking the logs, though it can reveal &#8220;spoilers&#8221;, can also be very helpful and worthwhile.<\/p>\n<h3>Tumbling Torrents, Tesco and Telly<\/h3>\n<p>Caching over, we headed back south to check out Powerscourt Waterfall.  This is a spectacular place and a huge, elegant waterfall.  I think we paid 5 euro each to get in, which seems expensive for a short, 1-hour visit.  I&#8217;d recommend taking a picnic or barbecue here and spending a long lunch in this fantastic setting, rather than paying it a flying visit.<\/p>\n<p>Home via the recognisable comforts of Tesco to pick up some dinner supplies and a lazy evening in front of the telly finished our day &#8211; just what we needed.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<h3>Who Needs Signs?<\/h3>\n<p>Lots of rain overnight meant that we weren&#8217;t keen to rise early&#8230;again!  So we had another slow start and a nice bacon-and-eggs breakfast\/elevenses.  Yummy!  There wasn&#8217;t much in the plan, and the weather was possibly unpredictable weather, but expected to clear, so we again went for something with an indoor element &#8211; at least to start with.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Sally had been wanting to check out some Irish crafts, so we headed off to Avoca&#8217;s Handweaving centre, which we&#8217;d passed earlier in the week.  Our (by now indispensible) Ordnance Survey of Ireland, 1:50,000 scale, &#8220;Explorer&#8221; maps allowed us to take some fun, minor roads, and Sally was getting pretty good at navigating!  Who needs signs?!<\/p>\n<p>Once there, surprisingly, you can just walk right in to the small weaving factory and walk around.  There are a few boards explaining what&#8217;s going on, but it was weird just being able to wander about while people sat preparing and operating both manual and powered looms, weaving fine cloth.  Bizarre, but quite interesting.<\/p>\n<p>It was a much quicker trip then we thought it would be, even with a trip around the almost-as-expensive-as-Powerscourt shop.  So we quickly committed to doing a few more Geocaches as we headed towards Brittas Bay.<\/p>\n<h3>Three Bickerson&#8217;s and a Beach<\/h3>\n<p>Learning from yesterday, we&#8217;d logged on and checked the cache logs before leaving, and found nothiing to put us off.  We easily picked up Barron in the Sky, Ballymoyle Hill and End of our Drive &#8211; with much thanks to &#8220;The Bickersons&#8221; for placing easy-to-find caches in some great locations with some great views across the eastern coast that we wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have seen.  Our aim was to do Brittas Bay, near the South Car Park too, but the 4 Euro for the car park seemed a bit much for a short visit.<\/p>\n<p>A bit further up the road, the North Car Park had the barrier up, so we parked up and had a highly enjoyable half hour or so on the beach.  I did all the stupid, manly, show-off things that one does: skimming and throwing stones; dragging the lovely wife into the sea (paddling only); hand stands; and generally larking around, while she enjoyed my silliness and captured the scene on&#8230;err&#8230;what now passes for film.  On reflection, 4 Euro would be good value if you wanted to spend half a day, or a few hours, on a beautiful, clean, sandy beach, manned by lifeguards, which is virtually deserted on a sunny day in mid-June.<\/p>\n<p>An early finish meant home for tea and toast, leftover curry for dinner, and a chilled out evening.  I could quite get used to this holiday lark.<\/p>\n<h3>The Ups and Downs of Geocaching<\/h3>\n<p>Reflections on today: Geocaching has been sometimes frustrating and sometimes fun, but we are still learning, and it&#8217;s enabled us to get out to some places that we wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have been, and seen some good bits of history and some beautiful places.  It&#8217;s a good way to tap into locals&#8217; knowledge of where you can see interesting stuff!<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Green&#8221; side of us finds that it does involve a lot of driving though.  We&#8217;ve tried to pick caches near to places that we&#8217;re going anyway, but it&#8217;s often involved going out of our way to find places.  We&#8217;ve tried to walk as much as possible (one other good thing about Geocaching is that it gets you out walking) but perhaps cycle-caching would be better and worth promoting!<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re actually wondering what we&#8217;d have done this holiday without Geocaching.  I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;d have found places to see and things to do, but it&#8217;s certainly prevented us stitting around in the cottage and doing nothing.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h3>Who Needs Signs?<\/h3>\n<p>Lots of rain overnight meant that we weren&#8217;t keen to rise early&#8230;again!  So we had another slow start and a nice bacon-and-eggs breakfast\/elevenses.  Yummy!  There wasn&#8217;t much in the plan, and the weather was possibly unpredictable weather, but expected to clear, so we again went for something with an indoor element &#8211; at least to start with.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Sally had been wanting to check out some Irish crafts, so we headed off to Avoca&#8217;s Handweaving centre, which we&#8217;d passed earlier in the week.  Our (by now indispensible) Ordnance Survey of Ireland, 1:50,000 scale, &#8220;Explorer&#8221; maps allowed us to take some fun, minor roads, and Sally was getting pretty good at navigating!  Who needs signs?!<\/p>\n<p>Once there, surprisingly, you can just walk right in to the small weaving factory and walk around.  There are a few boards explaining what&#8217;s going on, but it was weird just being able to wander about while people sat preparing and operating both manual and powered looms, weaving fine cloth.  Bizarre, but quite interesting.<\/p>\n<p>It was a much quicker trip then we thought it would be, even with a trip around the almost-as-expensive-as-Powerscourt shop.  So we quickly committed to doing a few more Geocaches as we headed towards Brittas Bay.<\/p>\n<h3>Three Bickerson&#8217;s and a Beach<\/h3>\n<p>Learning from yesterday, we&#8217;d logged on and checked the cache logs before leaving, and found nothiing to put us off.  We easily picked up Barron in the Sky, Ballymoyle Hill and End of our Drive &#8211; with much thanks to &#8220;The Bickersons&#8221; for placing easy-to-find caches in some great locations with some great views across the eastern coast that we wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have seen.  Our aim was to do Brittas Bay, near the South Car Park too, but the 4 Euro for the car park seemed a bit much for a short visit.<\/p>\n<p>A bit further up the road, the North Car Park had the barrier up, so we parked up and had a highly enjoyable half hour or so on the beach.  I did all the stupid, manly, show-off things that one does: skimming and throwing stones; dragging the lovely wife into the sea (paddling only); hand stands; and generally larking around, while she enjoyed my silliness and captured the scene on&#8230;err&#8230;what now passes for film.  On reflection, 4 Euro would be good value if you wanted to spend half a day, or a few hours, on a beautiful, clean, sandy beach, manned by lifeguards, which is virtually deserted on a sunny day in mid-June.<\/p>\n<p>An early finish meant home for tea and toast, leftover curry for dinner, and a chilled out evening.  I could quite get used to this holiday lark.<\/p>\n<h3>The Ups and Downs of Geocaching<\/h3>\n<p>Reflections on today: Geocaching has been sometimes frustrating and sometimes fun, but we are still learning, and it&#8217;s enabled us to get out to some places that we wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have been, and seen some good bits of history and some beautiful places.  It&#8217;s a good way to tap into locals&#8217; knowledge of where you can see interesting stuff!<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Green&#8221; side of us finds that it does involve a lot of driving though.  We&#8217;ve tried to pick caches near to places that we&#8217;re going anyway, but it&#8217;s often involved going out of our way to find places.  We&#8217;ve tried to walk as much as possible (one other good thing about Geocaching is that it gets you out walking) but perhaps cycle-caching would be better and worth promoting!<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re actually wondering what we&#8217;d have done this holiday without Geocaching.  I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;d have found places to see and things to do, but it&#8217;s certainly prevented us stitting around in the cottage and doing nothing.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ve left out much detail but if you think any of what I&#8217;ve said is inappropriate then let me know and I&#8217;ll remove it.]<\/p>\n<h3>It&#8217;s Been on My Mind<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to write about cycle helmets for ages but recent events have brought to the fore my want to share what I think.<\/p>\n<p>A friend of mine was knocked off his bike and landed on his head, crushing a vertebrae.\u00a0 His helmet was severely damaged &#8211; his skull was intact.<\/p>\n<p>This has obviously made me think hard about cycling and helmet-wearing and I&#8217;ve been trying to crystallise my thoughts.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Background<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m obviously a keen cyclist, and I read lots on the internet, Twitter, and other people&#8217;s blogs, about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>pros and cons of wearing a helmet;<\/li>\n<li>pros and cons of helmet legislation;<\/li>\n<li>anecdotes about helmet wearing\/not-wearing;<\/li>\n<li>pros and cons of websites\/blogs\/people that talk about the pros and cons of wearing a helmet;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You get the idea.<\/p>\n<p>For those who don&#8217;t move in cycling circles, the safety benefits of cycle helmets are far from proven and they may even make injuries from an accident WORSE!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all explained, far better than I could ever explain it, on the <a title=\"CycleHelmets.org\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclehelmets.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Cycle Helmets Site<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Lidlessness<\/h3>\n<p>Anyway, other people seem to get very passionate about helmet wearing. \u00a0Most people, and cycling organisations, I&#8217;ve come across are &#8220;pro-helmet-choice&#8221;, or &#8220;anti-helmet-legislation&#8221;. \u00a0They are keen to educate people about the myth that a helmet makes you safer.<\/p>\n<p>What strikes me is that the balance seems to be a bit out.\u00a0 People who are pro-helmet-choice come across as being anti-helmet, even though some of them wear helmets.\u00a0 Some of what I read also paints those who don&#8217;t know about the inconclusive bike helmet science as being a bit daft.<\/p>\n<p>This annoys me somewhat as I used to be someone who thought that a helmet was obviously going to help protect you in a fall and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s stupid to think that way.<\/p>\n<h3>Out with it!<\/h3>\n<p>So, where am I at with the whole cycle helmet thing?\u00a0 Well:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I instinctively feel that I SHOULD wear one.\u00a0 The thought of my head hitting tarmac at speed doesn&#8217;t fill me with joyous expectation.\u00a0 I&#8217;d like my head to be protected.<\/li>\n<li>I read the current science and research as being inconclusive.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve not read it all in depth, but it seems to say that if I fall one way a helmet will protect me, and if I fall another way, a helmet will make my injuries worse.\u00a0 There appears to be no right or wrong.<\/li>\n<li>So&#8230;I wear a helmet for all my cycling.<\/li>\n<li>I am &#8220;pro-helmet-choice&#8221; &#8211; I am against making cycle helmet wearing compulsory as I believe that this would put people off cycling (this seems to be fairly well proven by statistics).<\/li>\n<li>I am very much pro-cycling.\u00a0 The benefits of cycling far outweigh the risks, and the risks clearly decrease as more people cycle.\u00a0 (See <a title=\"CTC's Safety in Numbers Campaign\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ctc.org.uk\/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=5225\" target=\"_blank\">CTC&#8217;s Safety in Numbers report<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m also pro- other cycle safety measures: training people to ride on the road; better cycle infrastructure; use of lights, colours and reflectives to make sure you&#8217;re seen; and riding confidently and learning to anticipate driver movements.\u00a0 How&#8217;s about we reduce the risk of falling or being hit in the first place?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>There are other aspects of this discussion, that I actually don&#8217;t feel I can answer, or even that they&#8217;re particularly important, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do I ride more dangerously, and take more risks because I&#8217;m wearing a helmet?<\/li>\n<li>Do vehicle drivers give me less room because I wear a helmet&#8230;and lycra&#8230;and reflectives!?!<\/li>\n<li>Are there better solutions to protecting your head whilst on a bike?\u00a0 Is there a different helmet design that could be used?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Recent Events<\/h3>\n<p>What happened to my friend has really brought home the whole cycling safety and helmets issue.\u00a0 I no longer have just statistics, studies and reports, I have a real person, that I know, who has had a week in hospital, is wearing a brace, and who will have 6 to 8 weeks of not being able to do much at all, and probably a lengthly period of recouperation after that.<\/p>\n<p>The studies say that wearing a helmet may increase the damage done in a nasty accident.\u00a0 But it may also save your life.<\/p>\n<p>My common sense says that in a minor accident my head will probably be better off with a helmet.<\/p>\n<p>And my personal experience is of a person who seems to have been spared injury because of a helmet.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that people have information and make a choice about helmet wearing.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that we offer people training on cycling on the road, build decent cycle lanes and infrastructure, and encourage more people onto bikes.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that we all, when driving vehicles, give room to cyclists and take extra care to look out for them. And DON&#8217;T pass them at any sort of junction&#8230;especially a roundabout!<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, I pray for my friend and his family, and I continue to wear my polystyrene &#8220;lid&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think?\u00a0 Would the inconclusive facts change your mind about helmets? Would the experience of my friend change your opinion?\u00a0 Or would it reinforce your existing opinion?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>[Prologue: At least one regular reader will know who&#8217;s involved in what I&#8217;m about to write. I&#8217;ve left out much detail but if you think any of what I&#8217;ve said is inappropriate then let me know and I&#8217;ll remove it.]<\/p>\n<h3>It&#8217;s Been on My Mind<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to write about cycle helmets for ages but recent events have brought to the fore my want to share what I think.<\/p>\n<p>A friend of mine was knocked off his bike and landed on his head, crushing a vertebrae.\u00a0 His helmet was severely damaged &#8211; his skull was intact.<\/p>\n<p>This has obviously made me think hard about cycling and helmet-wearing and I&#8217;ve been trying to crystallise my thoughts.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Background<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m obviously a keen cyclist, and I read lots on the internet, Twitter, and other people&#8217;s blogs, about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>pros and cons of wearing a helmet;<\/li>\n<li>pros and cons of helmet legislation;<\/li>\n<li>anecdotes about helmet wearing\/not-wearing;<\/li>\n<li>pros and cons of websites\/blogs\/people that talk about the pros and cons of wearing a helmet;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You get the idea.<\/p>\n<p>For those who don&#8217;t move in cycling circles, the safety benefits of cycle helmets are far from proven and they may even make injuries from an accident WORSE!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all explained, far better than I could ever explain it, on the <a title=\"CycleHelmets.org\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclehelmets.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Cycle Helmets Site<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Lidlessness<\/h3>\n<p>Anyway, other people seem to get very passionate about helmet wearing. \u00a0Most people, and cycling organisations, I&#8217;ve come across are &#8220;pro-helmet-choice&#8221;, or &#8220;anti-helmet-legislation&#8221;. \u00a0They are keen to educate people about the myth that a helmet makes you safer.<\/p>\n<p>What strikes me is that the balance seems to be a bit out.\u00a0 People who are pro-helmet-choice come across as being anti-helmet, even though some of them wear helmets.\u00a0 Some of what I read also paints those who don&#8217;t know about the inconclusive bike helmet science as being a bit daft.<\/p>\n<p>This annoys me somewhat as I used to be someone who thought that a helmet was obviously going to help protect you in a fall and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s stupid to think that way.<\/p>\n<h3>Out with it!<\/h3>\n<p>So, where am I at with the whole cycle helmet thing?\u00a0 Well:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I instinctively feel that I SHOULD wear one.\u00a0 The thought of my head hitting tarmac at speed doesn&#8217;t fill me with joyous expectation.\u00a0 I&#8217;d like my head to be protected.<\/li>\n<li>I read the current science and research as being inconclusive.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve not read it all in depth, but it seems to say that if I fall one way a helmet will protect me, and if I fall another way, a helmet will make my injuries worse.\u00a0 There appears to be no right or wrong.<\/li>\n<li>So&#8230;I wear a helmet for all my cycling.<\/li>\n<li>I am &#8220;pro-helmet-choice&#8221; &#8211; I am against making cycle helmet wearing compulsory as I believe that this would put people off cycling (this seems to be fairly well proven by statistics).<\/li>\n<li>I am very much pro-cycling.\u00a0 The benefits of cycling far outweigh the risks, and the risks clearly decrease as more people cycle.\u00a0 (See <a title=\"CTC's Safety in Numbers Campaign\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ctc.org.uk\/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=5225\" target=\"_blank\">CTC&#8217;s Safety in Numbers report<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m also pro- other cycle safety measures: training people to ride on the road; better cycle infrastructure; use of lights, colours and reflectives to make sure you&#8217;re seen; and riding confidently and learning to anticipate driver movements.\u00a0 How&#8217;s about we reduce the risk of falling or being hit in the first place?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>There are other aspects of this discussion, that I actually don&#8217;t feel I can answer, or even that they&#8217;re particularly important, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do I ride more dangerously, and take more risks because I&#8217;m wearing a helmet?<\/li>\n<li>Do vehicle drivers give me less room because I wear a helmet&#8230;and lycra&#8230;and reflectives!?!<\/li>\n<li>Are there better solutions to protecting your head whilst on a bike?\u00a0 Is there a different helmet design that could be used?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Recent Events<\/h3>\n<p>What happened to my friend has really brought home the whole cycling safety and helmets issue.\u00a0 I no longer have just statistics, studies and reports, I have a real person, that I know, who has had a week in hospital, is wearing a brace, and who will have 6 to 8 weeks of not being able to do much at all, and probably a lengthly period of recouperation after that.<\/p>\n<p>The studies say that wearing a helmet may increase the damage done in a nasty accident.\u00a0 But it may also save your life.<\/p>\n<p>My common sense says that in a minor accident my head will probably be better off with a helmet.<\/p>\n<p>And my personal experience is of a person who seems to have been spared injury because of a helmet.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that people have information and make a choice about helmet wearing.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that we offer people training on cycling on the road, build decent cycle lanes and infrastructure, and encourage more people onto bikes.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that we all, when driving vehicles, give room to cyclists and take extra care to look out for them. And DON&#8217;T pass them at any sort of junction&#8230;especially a roundabout!<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, I pray for my friend and his family, and I continue to wear my polystyrene &#8220;lid&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think?\u00a0 Would the inconclusive facts change your mind about helmets? Would the experience of my friend change your opinion?\u00a0 Or would it reinforce your existing opinion?<\/p>\n",

Our aim has been to be outdoors as much as we can, and do some hill walking if possible.  While we&#8217;ve certainly been to mountain height, we&#8217;ve still not really &#8220;climbed a mountain&#8221;, and so last night we planned a hike up Tonelagee (817m).<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But when we awoke we decided that the forecast, was, and always had been, better for Friday than for Thursday, so we put off the big walk until tomorrow.  So today was the backup plan&#8230;a trip up the military road, through Sally Gap, stopping off to do some shorter walks to pick up our last Geocaches.<\/p>\n<h3>Trooping and Paddock Hill<\/h3>\n<p>First stop, &#8220;Trooping&#8221; at the foot of Trooperstown Hill.  Not much of a climb from the Trooperstown car park to get to this, but we did have to carefully pick our way through lots of spiky gorse and muddy, marshy ground.  It was well worth it though, as we were treated to more great scenery, hidden away by a remote bit of river.<\/p>\n<p>Then, back to the car and up to &#8220;Paddock Hill&#8221;.  The recommended route is not from the south, as we did it, but there was a route on the map and we gave it a go.  It was mostly easy, but we lost the path at one point and ended up in what&#8217;s best described as a graveyard for old fir trees.  The cache was easily found on the summit to glorious views of the surrounding peaks (Scarr, Brockagh, Tonelagee) and some fierce, blustery winds.<\/p>\n<h3>Blown Away<\/h3>\n<p>Having bagged a minor peak (Paddock Hill is 357m and, I think, technically a mountain), we headed back to the car to find another place to park up and find some more.  We headed up to the Wicklow Gap, which is quite a climb up to 476m in the car.  We parked up and got out the car only to be nearly blown away.  We toyed with picking up Turlough Hill, a walk up to the reservoir at 692m, but the path was on the exposed side of the hill and we decided that it would either be to cold or to dangerous to head up in such a strong wind.<\/p>\n<p>So we opted to head down hill, and down wind, to &#8220;Wicklow Gold&#8221;.  This was along St Kevin&#8217;s Way, which, apparently, was once paved, but is now mostly boggy marsh.  This was another quick and easy one, though the walk back to the car &#8211; uphill and into the wind, while losing the path in some more boggy marshland &#8211; was not so pleasant.<\/p>\n<h3>Through the Gap<\/h3>\n<p>Weather was still not good so we decided to skip &#8220;Turlough Hill&#8221; and hit the military road.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, I hadn&#8217;t paid much attention to the detail of the map for this drive.  In my head it was a fairly main road and pretty straight.  But the military had other ideas when building it &#8211; mostly their idea was to build a road through the mountains, following the contours, peaking at 524m and crossing a barren and spectacular landscape.  The drive started well, and after a steady climb we got to take in Glenmacnass waterfall and to see Tonelagee a bit closer up.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after Glenmacnass though, the road got increasingly narrow, twisty and remote.  We drove for quite some time across a flatish moorland, surrounded by some high peaks.  It felt incredibly wild and it was exhilarating just being there.  The light played off the cliffs and hillsides, shadows of the clouds brought a moody, atmospheric feel to the place, and there was no one &#8211; no one! &#8211; for miles.  We were even treated to what felt like our own, personal rainbow.<\/p>\n<p>If you come to Wicklow, take time out to head up the military road through the Sally Gap.  I promise, it&#8217;s spectacular!<\/p>\n<p>We headed back from Enniskerry on the N11, wilderness behind us, and a fun evening of learning old card games, and remembering some old ones &#8211; shed, slam, nines and so on.<\/p>\n<p>One more full day to go &#8211; the forecast is still good for tomorrow, though I&#8217;m worried it will still be windy.  We will pack, rise early, and head to Tonelagee for a short hike.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h3>To Walk or not to Walk, that is the question<\/h3>\n<p>Despite it being predictably unpredictable, We&#8217;ve been trying our best to closely watch the weather this week.  Our aim has been to be outdoors as much as we can, and do some hill walking if possible.  While we&#8217;ve certainly been to mountain height, we&#8217;ve still not really &#8220;climbed a mountain&#8221;, and so last night we planned a hike up Tonelagee (817m).<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But when we awoke we decided that the forecast, was, and always had been, better for Friday than for Thursday, so we put off the big walk until tomorrow.  So today was the backup plan&#8230;a trip up the military road, through Sally Gap, stopping off to do some shorter walks to pick up our last Geocaches.<\/p>\n<h3>Trooping and Paddock Hill<\/h3>\n<p>First stop, &#8220;Trooping&#8221; at the foot of Trooperstown Hill.  Not much of a climb from the Trooperstown car park to get to this, but we did have to carefully pick our way through lots of spiky gorse and muddy, marshy ground.  It was well worth it though, as we were treated to more great scenery, hidden away by a remote bit of river.<\/p>\n<p>Then, back to the car and up to &#8220;Paddock Hill&#8221;.  The recommended route is not from the south, as we did it, but there was a route on the map and we gave it a go.  It was mostly easy, but we lost the path at one point and ended up in what&#8217;s best described as a graveyard for old fir trees.  The cache was easily found on the summit to glorious views of the surrounding peaks (Scarr, Brockagh, Tonelagee) and some fierce, blustery winds.<\/p>\n<h3>Blown Away<\/h3>\n<p>Having bagged a minor peak (Paddock Hill is 357m and, I think, technically a mountain), we headed back to the car to find another place to park up and find some more.  We headed up to the Wicklow Gap, which is quite a climb up to 476m in the car.  We parked up and got out the car only to be nearly blown away.  We toyed with picking up Turlough Hill, a walk up to the reservoir at 692m, but the path was on the exposed side of the hill and we decided that it would either be to cold or to dangerous to head up in such a strong wind.<\/p>\n<p>So we opted to head down hill, and down wind, to &#8220;Wicklow Gold&#8221;.  This was along St Kevin&#8217;s Way, which, apparently, was once paved, but is now mostly boggy marsh.  This was another quick and easy one, though the walk back to the car &#8211; uphill and into the wind, while losing the path in some more boggy marshland &#8211; was not so pleasant.<\/p>\n<h3>Through the Gap<\/h3>\n<p>Weather was still not good so we decided to skip &#8220;Turlough Hill&#8221; and hit the military road.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, I hadn&#8217;t paid much attention to the detail of the map for this drive.  In my head it was a fairly main road and pretty straight.  But the military had other ideas when building it &#8211; mostly their idea was to build a road through the mountains, following the contours, peaking at 524m and crossing a barren and spectacular landscape.  The drive started well, and after a steady climb we got to take in Glenmacnass waterfall and to see Tonelagee a bit closer up.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after Glenmacnass though, the road got increasingly narrow, twisty and remote.  We drove for quite some time across a flatish moorland, surrounded by some high peaks.  It felt incredibly wild and it was exhilarating just being there.  The light played off the cliffs and hillsides, shadows of the clouds brought a moody, atmospheric feel to the place, and there was no one &#8211; no one! &#8211; for miles.  We were even treated to what felt like our own, personal rainbow.<\/p>\n<p>If you come to Wicklow, take time out to head up the military road through the Sally Gap.  I promise, it&#8217;s spectacular!<\/p>\n<p>We headed back from Enniskerry on the N11, wilderness behind us, and a fun evening of learning old card games, and remembering some old ones &#8211; shed, slam, nines and so on.<\/p>\n<p>One more full day to go &#8211; the forecast is still good for tomorrow, though I&#8217;m worried it will still be windy.  We will pack, rise early, and head to Tonelagee for a short hike.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>I am&#8230;yes, really, I am getting there.<\/p>\n<p>Friday &#8211; our last day.  We&#8217;d previously planned a hike up to over 800m up the mountain known as Tonelagee.  Having abandoned this on Thursday we were up early with the aim of doing it on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>So, we packed our rucksacks and jumped in the car, back towards Glendalough heading back to towards Sally Gap and parking at Glenmacnass Car Park.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>One last sporadic sign<\/h3>\n<p>The map showed a path just a short distance from the car park, over a small river.  However, when we arrived, there was a sign explaining that &#8220;Member of the public should not cross the river as it is very dangerous&#8221;, or words to that effect.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;there&#8217;s a path up there, no bridge, and it doesn&#8217;t look very dangerous.  And what sort of dangerous?  Minefield dangerous?  Being-chased-by-a-raging-bull dangerous?  Or just standard hill walking dangerous?<\/p>\n<p>It was pretty windy again and we ummed and aaahed, walked up the river a bit to see what we could see&#8230;I even hopped across the stones to the other side to see what was hidden in the trees!  But ultimately we couldn&#8217;t see very much, and &#8220;dangerous&#8221; was looking like all we were going to get.<\/p>\n<p>So we decided to head down Glendalough and the National Park information centre.  Perhaps they have walking books for sale, or guides to the hills?  There were also other walking options should be run out of time and need them (we had a restaurant booked for 7pm which meant heading home at about 5pm).<\/p>\n<p>The information centre was a bit useless, being mostly a exhibition of taxidermy.   OK, that&#8217;s a bit harsh, there was lots of good information about the wildlife, but it was mostly wildlife that you&#8217;ll never see because you&#8217;re not allowed to walk anywhere!  Nothing about walking the hills though.<\/p>\n<h3>Camaderry<\/h3>\n<p>Time was ticking on and we had no more information about Tonelagee, so we decided to head up a lesser peak &#8211; Camaderry.  Path even clearer on the map, route up the sheltered and sunny side of the mountain and starting just outside the Glendalough car park.<\/p>\n<p>We quickly found the path, and the immediate problem of it being about a 1 in 3 climb for most of the first kilometre.  It was up up and more up, through the trees, without a warm up for the legs, and we rose from 150m to 450m in no time.<\/p>\n<p>The path continued across a plateau and then up a short almost-scramble to Camaderry&#8217;s south-east top at 677m.<\/p>\n<p>The shape of the mountain meant that you didn&#8217;t get such a great view down to Glendalough as you might have expected, but it was exhilarating being up so high.  Most of the mountains in Wicklow are hidden away behind smaller hills and false summits, but from up top, you could see just how mountainous it really is and you could easily pick out the three biggest peaks of Lugnaquillia, Mullaghcleevaun and the abandoned Tonelagee.<\/p>\n<p>The lack of other walkers meant that were had the summit cairn completely to ourselves, and we didn&#8217;t see another soul on the way up or down.<\/p>\n<p>The walk was great too, short, but with varied terrain: forest and firs; expanses of peat bog strewn with foxglove and ferns; and rocky paths.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, when you can find a safe way up, the hill walking in Wicklow turns out to be pretty good!<\/p>\n<p>Were were a bit concerned about the peat erosion.  Peat is a big carbon sink, and is easily eroded, damaging the natural environment and releasing the carbon, but we figured that following the path that was already very eroded can&#8217;t have been doing too much damage.  We can only guess that the erosion issue is one of the things that prevents hill walking being promoted more strongly here.<\/p>\n<h3>A Meal Out<\/h3>\n<p>We headed back down, which took no time, and scrubbed up back in the cottage ready for a meal out.  We&#8217;d been self-catering all week because food was very expensive, but we&#8217;d both had birthdays recently which were not really properly celebrated, and we&#8217;d promised ourselves a night out.<\/p>\n<p>Restaurants were even more expensive, but we bit the bullet and had booked into &#8220;The Wicklow Heather&#8221; in Laragh &#8211; back over towards Glendalough.<\/p>\n<p>We were not disappointed and had an excellent meal in a charmingly decorated setting.<\/p>\n<p>One thing that particularly amused me was that some tables, including ours, had a little rack of old, educational books, including once called &#8220;The Psychology of Eating&#8221; by Lewis R Wolberg, which, though written in the Thirties, said things like &#8220;This is not another fad diet book&#8221;, and could have been written yesterday.  I hadn&#8217;t realised that fad diets had been around so long.<\/p>\n<h3>Finishing off<\/h3>\n<p>After the meal it was hometime, packing, and cleaning the cottage before departure.  The trip home was uneventful.  It was a windy day so we bought seasickness tablets, but these ended up being unnecessary as we had a pleasant crossing back.<\/p>\n<p>It had been a great week of rest, walking, Geocaching, and exploring Co. Wicklow, and another fantastic week in Ireland &#8211; a country that I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll visit again and again.<\/p>\n<p>Highly recommended &#8211; but if you plan hiking, get as much information beforehand as you can, including good maps.  We&#8217;d recommend staying closer to Laragh than Wicklow Town, and with the exchange rate as it is, would recommend self catering, if you can find an appropriately sized cottage.<\/p>\n<p>For now, it&#8217;s back to the grindstone and the busyness of normal life.<\/p>\n<p>When&#8217;s the next holiday?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I am&#8230;yes, really, I am getting there.<\/p>\n<p>Friday &#8211; our last day.  We&#8217;d previously planned a hike up to over 800m up the mountain known as Tonelagee.  Having abandoned this on Thursday we were up early with the aim of doing it on Friday.<\/p>\n<p>So, we packed our rucksacks and jumped in the car, back towards Glendalough heading back to towards Sally Gap and parking at Glenmacnass Car Park.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>One last sporadic sign<\/h3>\n<p>The map showed a path just a short distance from the car park, over a small river.  However, when we arrived, there was a sign explaining that &#8220;Member of the public should not cross the river as it is very dangerous&#8221;, or words to that effect.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;there&#8217;s a path up there, no bridge, and it doesn&#8217;t look very dangerous.  And what sort of dangerous?  Minefield dangerous?  Being-chased-by-a-raging-bull dangerous?  Or just standard hill walking dangerous?<\/p>\n<p>It was pretty windy again and we ummed and aaahed, walked up the river a bit to see what we could see&#8230;I even hopped across the stones to the other side to see what was hidden in the trees!  But ultimately we couldn&#8217;t see very much, and &#8220;dangerous&#8221; was looking like all we were going to get.<\/p>\n<p>So we decided to head down Glendalough and the National Park information centre.  Perhaps they have walking books for sale, or guides to the hills?  There were also other walking options should be run out of time and need them (we had a restaurant booked for 7pm which meant heading home at about 5pm).<\/p>\n<p>The information centre was a bit useless, being mostly a exhibition of taxidermy.   OK, that&#8217;s a bit harsh, there was lots of good information about the wildlife, but it was mostly wildlife that you&#8217;ll never see because you&#8217;re not allowed to walk anywhere!  Nothing about walking the hills though.<\/p>\n<h3>Camaderry<\/h3>\n<p>Time was ticking on and we had no more information about Tonelagee, so we decided to head up a lesser peak &#8211; Camaderry.  Path even clearer on the map, route up the sheltered and sunny side of the mountain and starting just outside the Glendalough car park.<\/p>\n<p>We quickly found the path, and the immediate problem of it being about a 1 in 3 climb for most of the first kilometre.  It was up up and more up, through the trees, without a warm up for the legs, and we rose from 150m to 450m in no time.<\/p>\n<p>The path continued across a plateau and then up a short almost-scramble to Camaderry&#8217;s south-east top at 677m.<\/p>\n<p>The shape of the mountain meant that you didn&#8217;t get such a great view down to Glendalough as you might have expected, but it was exhilarating being up so high.  Most of the mountains in Wicklow are hidden away behind smaller hills and false summits, but from up top, you could see just how mountainous it really is and you could easily pick out the three biggest peaks of Lugnaquillia, Mullaghcleevaun and the abandoned Tonelagee.<\/p>\n<p>The lack of other walkers meant that were had the summit cairn completely to ourselves, and we didn&#8217;t see another soul on the way up or down.<\/p>\n<p>The walk was great too, short, but with varied terrain: forest and firs; expanses of peat bog strewn with foxglove and ferns; and rocky paths.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, when you can find a safe way up, the hill walking in Wicklow turns out to be pretty good!<\/p>\n<p>Were were a bit concerned about the peat erosion.  Peat is a big carbon sink, and is easily eroded, damaging the natural environment and releasing the carbon, but we figured that following the path that was already very eroded can&#8217;t have been doing too much damage.  We can only guess that the erosion issue is one of the things that prevents hill walking being promoted more strongly here.<\/p>\n<h3>A Meal Out<\/h3>\n<p>We headed back down, which took no time, and scrubbed up back in the cottage ready for a meal out.  We&#8217;d been self-catering all week because food was very expensive, but we&#8217;d both had birthdays recently which were not really properly celebrated, and we&#8217;d promised ourselves a night out.<\/p>\n<p>Restaurants were even more expensive, but we bit the bullet and had booked into &#8220;The Wicklow Heather&#8221; in Laragh &#8211; back over towards Glendalough.<\/p>\n<p>We were not disappointed and had an excellent meal in a charmingly decorated setting.<\/p>\n<p>One thing that particularly amused me was that some tables, including ours, had a little rack of old, educational books, including once called &#8220;The Psychology of Eating&#8221; by Lewis R Wolberg, which, though written in the Thirties, said things like &#8220;This is not another fad diet book&#8221;, and could have been written yesterday.  I hadn&#8217;t realised that fad diets had been around so long.<\/p>\n<h3>Finishing off<\/h3>\n<p>After the meal it was hometime, packing, and cleaning the cottage before departure.  The trip home was uneventful.  It was a windy day so we bought seasickness tablets, but these ended up being unnecessary as we had a pleasant crossing back.<\/p>\n<p>It had been a great week of rest, walking, Geocaching, and exploring Co. Wicklow, and another fantastic week in Ireland &#8211; a country that I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll visit again and again.<\/p>\n<p>Highly recommended &#8211; but if you plan hiking, get as much information beforehand as you can, including good maps.  We&#8217;d recommend staying closer to Laragh than Wicklow Town, and with the exchange rate as it is, would recommend self catering, if you can find an appropriately sized cottage.<\/p>\n<p>For now, it&#8217;s back to the grindstone and the busyness of normal life.<\/p>\n<p>When&#8217;s the next holiday?<\/p>\n",

Now, I did a computing A&#8217; level and in that we studied software testing and it was pretty much basic practice that you tested with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>valid data<\/li>\n<li>invalid data<\/li>\n<li>data from the boundary of validity<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, for a percentage value which only has valid values between 0 and 100 you would test with, say:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>20, 54 and 78<\/li>\n<li>-13, 1000<\/li>\n<li>-1, 0, 1, 99, 100, 101<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You didn&#8217;t say: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to test with the value 50 every time&#8221; because it would rarely tell you anything useful about whether or not your software functons.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m assured that the quality assurances processes for this software are excellent, however, to miss a simple case like this makes me wonder, not just what other simple errors may not be tested for in my expensive, best-in-class software, but what&#8217;s happened to software development processes that this is allowed to happen.<\/p>\n<p>Back to school folks&#8230;<\/p>\n",

I already had a nice outdoor waterproof that was quite expensive, but it wasn&#8217;t a cycling fit and it was grey &#8211; not good for standing out from the tarmac.<\/p>\n<p>So I managed to convince my lovely wife that I could spend a similar amount on a cycling jacket, on the basis that it would would be used pretty much every day for probably 3 of the four seasons.<\/p>\n<h3>Why the Windstopper<\/h3>\n<p>The one I had my eye on was the Gore Phantom Windstopper Jacket (2008), in bright red!  Here&#8217;s why:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Gore Windstopper fabric gets rave reviews everywhere and I wanted to give it a go.<\/li>\n<li>Red would make me stand out without looking too silly.<\/li>\n<li>The zip-off arms would make it suitable for, probably, autumn, winter and spring, if not bits of summer too.<\/li>\n<li>Gore&#8217;s Bikewear is generally considered to be top quality &#8211; this is a garment that would last<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s supposedly pretty waterproof as well as windproof, but in any case, not having wind chill would make being damp much less of a problem anyway<\/li>\n<li>Nice, quick-wicking softshell will be far nicer than my existing rubbery laminate waterproof, which gets wet on the inside pretty quickly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It took a bit of research and faffing around to find my size and the right colour at a reasonable price.  If you&#8217;re a XXXXXL or want dull grey or lemon yellow then you&#8217;re fine, but any reasonable sizes and colours are harder to come by. Eventually I visited <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tgstore.net\/\">The Gore Store <\/a>and placed an order.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;ve not been disappointed.<\/p>\n<h3>First Impressions and Fit<\/h3>\n<p>I was initially surprised at how thin and light the jacket was.  But the soft shell felt lovely.  I&#8217;d ordered a small expecting quite a close fit, and it was pretty much perfect; not so tight that I couldn&#8217;t wear something under it, but not so loose that it flaps around in the wind.<\/p>\n<p>I should probably point out here that, sadly, the &#8220;Windstopper&#8221; doesn&#8217;t miraculously <strong>STOP<\/strong> the wind, but it does act as a water-resistant, breathable layer that blocks chilly air, creating a little micro-climate around you.<\/p>\n<h3>Effective and Comfortable<\/h3>\n<p>And I have to say, it&#8217;s extremely effective.  One of the best things I can say about this jacket is that I don&#8217;t notice it&#8217;s there.  It&#8217;s light, comfortable, well-cut.  It really is breathable and doesn&#8217;t get damp, even when cycling far and fast.  Well, OK, maybe a little bit, but the Windstopper really does keep the chill out so that you don&#8217;t notice.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been out in a few downpours in it too and it&#8217;s performed admirably.  It&#8217;s NOT a waterproof, but it does a fine job of trying to keep out water and I&#8217;ve only ever been slightly damp inside after rain on my short commute.  Of course, the jacket dries out quickly too.<\/p>\n<p>I even happen to think it looks pretty cool.  It&#8217;s a sporty fit, and it&#8217;s a practical garment rather than a stylish one, but compared to my cheaper jackets it feels positively trendy.<\/p>\n<h3>Minor Issues<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had it through three seasons now and it&#8217;s been a delight.<\/p>\n<p>I had a little problem with the zip, which was sticky at first but seems to have worn in.  I&#8217;m a little baffled by the reflectives, which are on the arms facing forwards.  I&#8217;d have preferred something more on the back to keep me visible.  And there isn&#8217;t a zip-up pocket.  But these are small things in an otherwise brilliant bit of kit.<\/p>\n<h3>What to wear?<\/h3>\n<p>There are a lot of people who say you should be able to just cycle in your normal clothes, and you can.  But it&#8217;s my opinion that cycle-specific gear is a whole load more practical, safe, and comfortable if you want to ride fast and\/or far.  And this is a great piece of cycle gear that I reckon was money well spent!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h2>Gore Bikewear Phantom Windstopper Jacket (2008)<\/h2>\n<p>Those of you that have been reading for a while will know that <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/04\/06\/eeekim-a-shopaholic\/\">I&#8217;m not a big shopper<\/a>, but I do appreciate quality and usefulness, even if it&#8217;s at a price.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Back last year when it was cold and wet and windy, I was, I confess, coveting a decent cycling jacket.  I already had a nice outdoor waterproof that was quite expensive, but it wasn&#8217;t a cycling fit and it was grey &#8211; not good for standing out from the tarmac.<\/p>\n<p>So I managed to convince my lovely wife that I could spend a similar amount on a cycling jacket, on the basis that it would would be used pretty much every day for probably 3 of the four seasons.<\/p>\n<h3>Why the Windstopper<\/h3>\n<p>The one I had my eye on was the Gore Phantom Windstopper Jacket (2008), in bright red!  Here&#8217;s why:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Gore Windstopper fabric gets rave reviews everywhere and I wanted to give it a go.<\/li>\n<li>Red would make me stand out without looking too silly.<\/li>\n<li>The zip-off arms would make it suitable for, probably, autumn, winter and spring, if not bits of summer too.<\/li>\n<li>Gore&#8217;s Bikewear is generally considered to be top quality &#8211; this is a garment that would last<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s supposedly pretty waterproof as well as windproof, but in any case, not having wind chill would make being damp much less of a problem anyway<\/li>\n<li>Nice, quick-wicking softshell will be far nicer than my existing rubbery laminate waterproof, which gets wet on the inside pretty quickly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It took a bit of research and faffing around to find my size and the right colour at a reasonable price.  If you&#8217;re a XXXXXL or want dull grey or lemon yellow then you&#8217;re fine, but any reasonable sizes and colours are harder to come by. Eventually I visited <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tgstore.net\/\">The Gore Store <\/a>and placed an order.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;ve not been disappointed.<\/p>\n<h3>First Impressions and Fit<\/h3>\n<p>I was initially surprised at how thin and light the jacket was.  But the soft shell felt lovely.  I&#8217;d ordered a small expecting quite a close fit, and it was pretty much perfect; not so tight that I couldn&#8217;t wear something under it, but not so loose that it flaps around in the wind.<\/p>\n<p>I should probably point out here that, sadly, the &#8220;Windstopper&#8221; doesn&#8217;t miraculously <strong>STOP<\/strong> the wind, but it does act as a water-resistant, breathable layer that blocks chilly air, creating a little micro-climate around you.<\/p>\n<h3>Effective and Comfortable<\/h3>\n<p>And I have to say, it&#8217;s extremely effective.  One of the best things I can say about this jacket is that I don&#8217;t notice it&#8217;s there.  It&#8217;s light, comfortable, well-cut.  It really is breathable and doesn&#8217;t get damp, even when cycling far and fast.  Well, OK, maybe a little bit, but the Windstopper really does keep the chill out so that you don&#8217;t notice.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been out in a few downpours in it too and it&#8217;s performed admirably.  It&#8217;s NOT a waterproof, but it does a fine job of trying to keep out water and I&#8217;ve only ever been slightly damp inside after rain on my short commute.  Of course, the jacket dries out quickly too.<\/p>\n<p>I even happen to think it looks pretty cool.  It&#8217;s a sporty fit, and it&#8217;s a practical garment rather than a stylish one, but compared to my cheaper jackets it feels positively trendy.<\/p>\n<h3>Minor Issues<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had it through three seasons now and it&#8217;s been a delight.<\/p>\n<p>I had a little problem with the zip, which was sticky at first but seems to have worn in.  I&#8217;m a little baffled by the reflectives, which are on the arms facing forwards.  I&#8217;d have preferred something more on the back to keep me visible.  And there isn&#8217;t a zip-up pocket.  But these are small things in an otherwise brilliant bit of kit.<\/p>\n<h3>What to wear?<\/h3>\n<p>There are a lot of people who say you should be able to just cycle in your normal clothes, and you can.  But it&#8217;s my opinion that cycle-specific gear is a whole load more practical, safe, and comfortable if you want to ride fast and\/or far.  And this is a great piece of cycle gear that I reckon was money well spent!<\/p>\n",
