Actually, it was a really good exercise, and here&#8217;s why.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I was chatting with my friend Keiron today about text editors. I recently followed him in transitioning from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sublimetext.com\/\">Sublime Text<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jetbrains.com\/phpstorm\/\">PHPStorm<\/a>. But I explained to him that I&#8217;d been using Sublime Text for a big project recently and that sparked a bit of discussion.<\/p>\n<p>For one thing, switching BACK to the less-functional-but-much-faster Sublime has forced me to make it work better. I fixed an issue I had where SCSS files weren&#8217;t recognised, and suddenly I had both regular CSS text expansion\/completion back, and <a href=\"https:\/\/emmet.io\/\">Emmet<\/a>-style coding back working which was a boon for writing lots of CSS. (An animated GIF will eventually load below showing you Emmet-style coding &#8211; and check the amazing <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.emmet.io\/cheat-sheet\/\">cheat sheet<\/a> full of abbreviations!)<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2810\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/emmet-css.gif\" alt=\"Animated GIF of Emmet CSS expansions\" width=\"634\" height=\"462\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also made me realise how much I value certain aspects of PHPStorm. Probably the biggest example is having it auto-import classes for me. When you&#8217;re in Laravel and you type <code>Auth::something()<\/code> and you&#8217;ve not imported the <code>Auth<\/code> facade and you have think:<\/p>\n<p><em> &#8220;Where the hell is it? <code>Illuminate\\Something\\Somethingelse\\Facades\\User<\/code> or somewhere.&#8221; <\/em><\/p>\n<p>PHPStorm both points out that you&#8217;ve forgotten to import it, AND offers to help you fix it. Amazing. (After a while a GIF may load below showing you PHPStorm doing it&#8217;s thing!)<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2811\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/phpstorm-thing.gif\" alt=\"Animated GIF of PHPStorm doing its thing\" width=\"664\" height=\"508\" \/><\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;being forced to type <code>use Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Auth<\/code> every time or even just <code>use App\\User<\/code> or whatever, has really helped reinforce Laravel&#8217;s project structure in my &#8220;muscle memory&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be back in PHPStorm soon, but it&#8217;s good to know I&#8217;m still a mean coder in Sublime, and a better one for having switched to it for a short while.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re an advanced IDE user, try ditching it for a while. You might learn something, or you might find your old editor, with a bit of work, can be made to work OK after all.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>Coding News: I swapped my super-duper IDE for a less-functional text editor &#8211; you&#8217;ll never guess what happened next! Actually, it was a really good exercise, and here&#8217;s why.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I was chatting with my friend Keiron today about text editors. I recently followed him in transitioning from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sublimetext.com\/\">Sublime Text<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jetbrains.com\/phpstorm\/\">PHPStorm<\/a>. But I explained to him that I&#8217;d been using Sublime Text for a big project recently and that sparked a bit of discussion.<\/p>\n<p>For one thing, switching BACK to the less-functional-but-much-faster Sublime has forced me to make it work better. I fixed an issue I had where SCSS files weren&#8217;t recognised, and suddenly I had both regular CSS text expansion\/completion back, and <a href=\"https:\/\/emmet.io\/\">Emmet<\/a>-style coding back working which was a boon for writing lots of CSS. (An animated GIF will eventually load below showing you Emmet-style coding &#8211; and check the amazing <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.emmet.io\/cheat-sheet\/\">cheat sheet<\/a> full of abbreviations!)<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2810\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/emmet-css.gif\" alt=\"Animated GIF of Emmet CSS expansions\" width=\"634\" height=\"462\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also made me realise how much I value certain aspects of PHPStorm. Probably the biggest example is having it auto-import classes for me. When you&#8217;re in Laravel and you type <code>Auth::something()<\/code> and you&#8217;ve not imported the <code>Auth<\/code> facade and you have think:<\/p>\n<p><em> &#8220;Where the hell is it? <code>Illuminate\\Something\\Somethingelse\\Facades\\User<\/code> or somewhere.&#8221; <\/em><\/p>\n<p>PHPStorm both points out that you&#8217;ve forgotten to import it, AND offers to help you fix it. Amazing. (After a while a GIF may load below showing you PHPStorm doing it&#8217;s thing!)<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2811\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/phpstorm-thing.gif\" alt=\"Animated GIF of PHPStorm doing its thing\" width=\"664\" height=\"508\" \/><\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;being forced to type <code>use Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Auth<\/code> every time or even just <code>use App\\User<\/code> or whatever, has really helped reinforce Laravel&#8217;s project structure in my &#8220;muscle memory&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be back in PHPStorm soon, but it&#8217;s good to know I&#8217;m still a mean coder in Sublime, and a better one for having switched to it for a short while.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re an advanced IDE user, try ditching it for a while. You might learn something, or you might find your old editor, with a bit of work, can be made to work OK after all.<\/p>\n",

They&#x27;re not ALL that useful because most of the talk was a live demo of developer tools features.

I had mentioned that you could plug in a mobile device and &quot;inspect&quot; the contents of web pages showing on that device.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is easier on a Mac than on Windows, but it is possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a Mac you can plug an iOS device in and debug it from Safari as shown below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Screen-Recording-2017-11-09-at-10.08-am.gif\" alt=\"Animation showing how to open dev tools for an iOS device in Safari\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In Chrome you can plug in an Android device and run dev tools on it from inside Chrome.\u00a0 Instructions for that are in the <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/web\/tools\/chrome-devtools\/remote-debugging\/\">Dev Tools documentation<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#x27;s a few set-up steps you&#x27;ll need to take before this will work. On Windows you may need to install USB drivers, and in all cases you&#x27;ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.android.com\/studio\/debug\/dev-options.html\">enable developer options<\/a> and flip a toggle switch on the Android device.\u00a0 But you only do that once and then you&#x27;re ready to go!<\/p>\n",

I had mentioned that you could plug in a mobile device and &quot;inspect&quot; the contents of web pages showing on that device.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is easier on a Mac than on Windows, but it is possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a Mac you can plug an iOS device in and debug it from Safari as shown below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Screen-Recording-2017-11-09-at-10.08-am.gif\" alt=\"Animation showing how to open dev tools for an iOS device in Safari\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In Chrome you can plug in an Android device and run dev tools on it from inside Chrome.\u00a0 Instructions for that are in the <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/web\/tools\/chrome-devtools\/remote-debugging\/\">Dev Tools documentation<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#x27;s a few set-up steps you&#x27;ll need to take before this will work. On Windows you may need to install USB drivers, and in all cases you&#x27;ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.android.com\/studio\/debug\/dev-options.html\">enable developer options<\/a> and flip a toggle switch on the Android device.\u00a0 But you only do that once and then you&#x27;re ready to go!<\/p>\n",

I\u2019m going to be real in case it helps you feel more normal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve had umpteen birthdays to sort out in the last month, I\u2019ve been helping Sally finish her work off, and then picking up my own work for the last week, I\u2019m struggling with getting presents for everyone, I\u2019m feeling left out because so many Christmas activities are at the wrong times and I can\u2019t take part, I\u2019ve had a nasty cold, and I\u2019m finding parenting hard cos my kids would much rather spend time with their mum than with me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I LOVE celebrating people at birthdays, I LOVE celebrating Christmas. But I find the pressures and expectations of the \u2018holiday\u2019 season totally overwhelming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it\u2019s OK if you do too.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>So I did this thing on Facebook and it was pretty good fun, so I\u2019m writing it up here too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve been pretty terrible at Christmas wishes this year. December seems to get more crazy every year. This one has felt like the busiest ever, with the addition of a nephew, two children &#8211; one of whom has started going to bed later, a nasty cold, and busy workplaces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve had a few more restful days over Christmas, and I was reading \u201cnewsletters\u201d the other day from other people and was aware that we probably don\u2019t share all that much on social media relative to other people. I am acutely aware that some people are owed updates\/greetings\/even gifts from us! And those will come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for the time being, rather than write an long newsletter update of my own, I thought I\u2019d try a little experiment. I asked people on Facebook to use comments to ask me questions about my year, and those that weren&#8217;t too personal or difficult to answer got replies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was great, because it generated some good discussions, and allow me to throw questions back at people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve written that up in a slightly edited way here as a summary and as my &#8220;newsletter&#8221; to the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, feel free to ask MORE questions.&nbsp;Be creative. I hope this might be fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230;what do you want to know about my year?! Ask in the comments if your question isn&#8217;t covered below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What have I missed?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I don\u2019t really know. Which is why I\u2019m asking you!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What a good idea I have so many questions; some I\u2019ll share publically, some perhaps in other formats. Here\u2019s a starter: whats your favourite book, movie, TV and music of 2017?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Man, this is a hard question to answer. For one thing running your own business in a fast moving industry AND having two small kids that you love dearly means that I\u2019m not really hooked in to popular culture much. Or, at least, not grown-up popular culture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also I need to think back a whole year. Ok. Here goes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Book: probably from last Christmas when I was given the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Thrilling_Adventures_of_Lovelace_and_Babbage\">Ada Lovelace Graphic Novel<\/a>. A well-researched, funny, mostly-historical, thing that is also a work of art. The pages about George Boole had me giggling for about half an hour!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/1E452734-4D17-4E84-B0F5-FDCD250ED744.jpeg\" alt=\"Ada Lovelace Book\" class=\"wp-image-3001\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/1E452734-4D17-4E84-B0F5-FDCD250ED744.jpeg 4032w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/1E452734-4D17-4E84-B0F5-FDCD250ED744-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/1E452734-4D17-4E84-B0F5-FDCD250ED744-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/1E452734-4D17-4E84-B0F5-FDCD250ED744-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/1E452734-4D17-4E84-B0F5-FDCD250ED744-945x709.jpeg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/1E452734-4D17-4E84-B0F5-FDCD250ED744-600x450.jpeg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Movie&#8230; I honestly don\u2019t remember watching a whole movie. Well&#8230;other than Star Wars. So I guess I\u2019d have to say The Force Awakens, which we just re-watched in preparation for going to see The Last Jedi. NO SPOILERS!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TV&#8230; hmm&#8230; I\u2019m not much into Drama. And to be honest I probably listen to podcasts now instead. So I\u2019m going to leave my perpetual favourite piece of internet radio here: <a href=\"http:\/\/99PercentInvisible.org\">http:\/\/99PercentInvisible.org<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Music: partly because it\u2019s very much my style, but also partly because is got me through the year, I\u2019m sticking with Switchfoot. Their latest album took a bit of getting used to, but the depth is there if you give it time. \u201cI Won\u2019t Let You Go\u201d has made me cry. \u201cIf The House Burns Down Tonight\u201d has kept me mindful of what\u2019s important. And \u201clive it well\u201d has been the perpetual call to positive action, in the little things and the big.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube\">\n    <iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I Wont Let You Go - Official Lyric Video\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/pfUssvjj4rs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube\">\n    <iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Switchfoot - Live It Well (Album Version)\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Ov_lnXy7tkQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s your Favourite place to Camp at . What\u2019s your year been like? What\u2019s your Favourite chocolate?\ufeff<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We didn\u2019t camp this year, but probably either Greenbelt festival or a local place called Brinchcombe Farm. Though we did have a really lovely time at a campsite in&#8230;St Ives was it?&#8230;one year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Year has been good. Maybe I\u2019ll answer more another time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chocolate?

I\u2019ve had some lovely feedback from small charities that I\u2019ve done small pieces of work for. Stuff that they\u2019d be lost with if I hadn\u2019t been available. That\u2019s always a joy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Best day out was probably LegoLand which my sister partly paid for for my birthday. We went just with the boy and it was SO good to have a day with just the boy. But we also had a very lovely week-long holiday in Devon with old, good friends &#8211; that whole week was ace!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What things have brought you the most happiness this year (I promise this isn&#8217;t meant as a leading question)?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><\/strong><em>\ufeffNote: this question was from my sister-in-law who just had a baby!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The boy&#8217;s School report.

I saw a post about you helping her finish it and thought maybe she had changed jobs.\ufeff<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No change. Well&#8230;Sally finished a long maternity leave, which was quite a change. [Edited our details of Sally\u2019s work &#8211; this is my blog, not hers]. She works hard and cares a lot about her \u201ccraft\u201d. I\u2019m proud of her and what she does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m still \u201cCreator, Engineer, Advisor\u201d (I love my self-determined job title!) at my own business, Oikos.

Amazing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More seriously, I\u2019m not sure it counts as &#8220;this year&#8221; but I\u2019ve been learning that mind, body and spirit are much more closely linked that people say they are. That we have a real problem with what I\u2019ve come to call \u201cspiritual illiteracy\u201d&#8230; regardless of \u201creligion\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also learned about \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/notes\/blake-ross\/aphantasia-how-it-feels-to-be-blind-in-your-mind\/10156834777480504\/\">aphantasia<\/a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Exploding_head_syndrome\">exploding head syndrome<\/a>\u201d.

        "content": "\n<p>So I did this thing on Facebook and it was pretty good fun, so I\u2019m writing it up here too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve been pretty terrible at Christmas wishes this year. December seems to get more crazy every year. This one has felt like the busiest ever, with the addition of a nephew, two children &#8211; one of whom has started going to bed later, a nasty cold, and busy workplaces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve had a few more restful days over Christmas, and I was reading \u201cnewsletters\u201d the other day from other people and was aware that we probably don\u2019t share all that much on social media relative to other people. I am acutely aware that some people are owed updates\/greetings\/even gifts from us! And those will come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for the time being, rather than write an long newsletter update of my own, I thought I\u2019d try a little experiment. I asked people on Facebook to use comments to ask me questions about my year, and those that weren&#8217;t too personal or difficult to answer got replies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was great, because it generated some good discussions, and allow me to throw questions back at people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve written that up in a slightly edited way here as a summary and as my &#8220;newsletter&#8221; to the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, feel free to ask MORE questions.&nbsp;Be creative. I hope this might be fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230;what do you want to know about my year?! Ask in the comments if your question isn&#8217;t covered below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What have I missed?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I don\u2019t really know. Which is why I\u2019m asking you!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What a good idea I have so many questions; some I\u2019ll share publically, some perhaps in other formats. Here\u2019s a starter: whats your favourite book, movie, TV and music of 2017?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Man, this is a hard question to answer. For one thing running your own business in a fast moving industry AND having two small kids that you love dearly means that I\u2019m not really hooked in to popular culture much. Or, at least, not grown-up popular culture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also I need to think back a whole year. Ok. Here goes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Book: probably from last Christmas when I was given the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Thrilling_Adventures_of_Lovelace_and_Babbage\">Ada Lovelace Graphic Novel<\/a>. A well-researched, funny, mostly-historical, thing that is also a work of art. The pages about George Boole had me giggling for about half an hour!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/1E452734-4D17-4E84-B0F5-FDCD250ED744.jpeg\" alt=\"Ada Lovelace Book\" class=\"wp-image-3001\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/1E452734-4D17-4E84-B0F5-FDCD250ED744.jpeg 4032w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/1E452734-4D17-4E84-B0F5-FDCD250ED744-300x225.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/1E452734-4D17-4E84-B0F5-FDCD250ED744-768x576.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/1E452734-4D17-4E84-B0F5-FDCD250ED744-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/1E452734-4D17-4E84-B0F5-FDCD250ED744-945x709.jpeg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/1E452734-4D17-4E84-B0F5-FDCD250ED744-600x450.jpeg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Movie&#8230; I honestly don\u2019t remember watching a whole movie. Well&#8230;other than Star Wars. So I guess I\u2019d have to say The Force Awakens, which we just re-watched in preparation for going to see The Last Jedi. NO SPOILERS!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TV&#8230; hmm&#8230; I\u2019m not much into Drama. And to be honest I probably listen to podcasts now instead. So I\u2019m going to leave my perpetual favourite piece of internet radio here: <a href=\"http:\/\/99PercentInvisible.org\">http:\/\/99PercentInvisible.org<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Music: partly because it\u2019s very much my style, but also partly because is got me through the year, I\u2019m sticking with Switchfoot. Their latest album took a bit of getting used to, but the depth is there if you give it time. \u201cI Won\u2019t Let You Go\u201d has made me cry. \u201cIf The House Burns Down Tonight\u201d has kept me mindful of what\u2019s important. And \u201clive it well\u201d has been the perpetual call to positive action, in the little things and the big.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube\">\n    <iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"I Wont Let You Go - Official Lyric Video\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/pfUssvjj4rs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube\">\n    <iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Switchfoot - Live It Well (Album Version)\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Ov_lnXy7tkQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s your Favourite place to Camp at . What\u2019s your year been like? What\u2019s your Favourite chocolate?\ufeff<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We didn\u2019t camp this year, but probably either Greenbelt festival or a local place called Brinchcombe Farm. Though we did have a really lovely time at a campsite in&#8230;St Ives was it?&#8230;one year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Year has been good. Maybe I\u2019ll answer more another time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chocolate?

I\u2019ve had some lovely feedback from small charities that I\u2019ve done small pieces of work for. Stuff that they\u2019d be lost with if I hadn\u2019t been available. That\u2019s always a joy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Best day out was probably LegoLand which my sister partly paid for for my birthday. We went just with the boy and it was SO good to have a day with just the boy. But we also had a very lovely week-long holiday in Devon with old, good friends &#8211; that whole week was ace!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What things have brought you the most happiness this year (I promise this isn&#8217;t meant as a leading question)?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><\/strong><em>\ufeffNote: this question was from my sister-in-law who just had a baby!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The boy&#8217;s School report.

I saw a post about you helping her finish it and thought maybe she had changed jobs.\ufeff<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No change. Well&#8230;Sally finished a long maternity leave, which was quite a change. [Edited our details of Sally\u2019s work &#8211; this is my blog, not hers]. She works hard and cares a lot about her \u201ccraft\u201d. I\u2019m proud of her and what she does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m still \u201cCreator, Engineer, Advisor\u201d (I love my self-determined job title!) at my own business, Oikos. Still mostly building websites for charities and small businesses. My portfolio is a bit behind but you can read up at <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\">https:\/\/oikos.digital<\/a> (my own website remains neglected and terrible!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>One highlight and something you&#8217;ve learnt<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a few highlights listed in other questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve learnt that that picture of an opened pot with a number like \u201c6m\u201d on it on things like toothpaste and shower gel is an indication of the life of the product after opening! Amazing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More seriously, I\u2019m not sure it counts as &#8220;this year&#8221; but I\u2019ve been learning that mind, body and spirit are much more closely linked that people say they are. That we have a real problem with what I\u2019ve come to call \u201cspiritual illiteracy\u201d&#8230; regardless of \u201creligion\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also learned about \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/notes\/blake-ross\/aphantasia-how-it-feels-to-be-blind-in-your-mind\/10156834777480504\/\">aphantasia<\/a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Exploding_head_syndrome\">exploding head syndrome<\/a>\u201d.

I know it quite deeply, and I have opinions. And some big changes are coming up.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I want to talk about &#8220;Gutenberg&#8221;, which is the whizzy new &#8220;block-based&#8221; editor that is coming up in WordPress in the new year.\u00a0 I won&#8217;t describe it in detail because <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/gutenberg\/\">that&#8217;s been done elsewhere<\/a>, but if you&#8217;ve used SquareSpace or Medium, it&#8217;s quite a bit more like that.

But that&#8217;s for another post.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I was a USER of Gutenberg. I was trying to write <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/01\/2017-in-review-ask-me-anything\/\">a year-in-review post<\/a> that involved a lot of copying and pasting from Facebook, and I was doing it on an iPad. Now, I know that that&#8217;s not necessarily a common use case, but I know that this wouldn&#8217;t have been too hard in the normal WordPress editor.<\/p>\n<p>But wow was it hard in Gutenberg.<\/p>\n<p>Then, after giving up on the iPad, I switched to my laptop to finish it off. What I found there was that, for a post that is mostly just text, images and a couple of embedded videos, Gutenberg actually <em>gets in the way<\/em> of the writing experience.<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t expect this.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been trying hard to be a proponent of Gutenberg. It seems like it&#8217;s a good evolution of the WordPress software for the use case of blogging and straight-up content creation. I want to think it&#8217;s a good idea.<\/p>\n<p>I also know that the team who are making it have been working REALLY hard on it, engaging fantastically well with those who are testing and critiquing it, and that it&#8217;s still a work in progress and could still end up being the amazing writing tool that I want it to be.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also aware that I&#8217;m an a-typical user. I like to use my keyboard to write, without touching the mouse, and love the markdown-like shortcuts for headings and code and so on that were recently added to the WordPress editor. AND I know that there are some keyboard shortcuts, but I&#8217;ve not learned them yet (Where is the reference? Maybe not there yet.)<\/p>\n<p>But there was just something about all the extra user-interface popping up everywhere. The way that hovering over any paragraph made all these controls appear (a block for each paragraph creates too many pop-up controls). The way that the new-block interface and the block options are present so much of the time.<\/p>\n<p>I just wanted to write &#8211; and, I&#8217;m sad and sorry to say, Gutenberg got in the way, confused me, and I just wanted to turn it off.<\/p>\n<p>If a power user &#8211; someone who uses WordPress a lot and has high hopes for Gutenberg and wants to like it &#8211; finds it intrusive and complicated, then what will that mean for the every-day blogger?<\/p>\n<p>Gutenberg still has work to do to win me over. I hope the team building it can make it right.<\/p>\n",

I know it quite deeply, and I have opinions. And some big changes are coming up.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I want to talk about &#8220;Gutenberg&#8221;, which is the whizzy new &#8220;block-based&#8221; editor that is coming up in WordPress in the new year.\u00a0 I won&#8217;t describe it in detail because <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/gutenberg\/\">that&#8217;s been done elsewhere<\/a>, but if you&#8217;ve used SquareSpace or Medium, it&#8217;s quite a bit more like that. If you want to actually try it out then someone cleverly made a way for you to <a href=\"https:\/\/frontenberg.tomjn.com\/\">do just that<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_3066\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3066\" style=\"width: 676px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-3066 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Screen-Shot-2018-01-01-at-22.03.59-1024x618.png\" alt=\"Screengrab of WordPress's upcoming Gutenberg editor\" width=\"676\" height=\"408\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Screen-Shot-2018-01-01-at-22.03.59-1024x618.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Screen-Shot-2018-01-01-at-22.03.59-300x181.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Screen-Shot-2018-01-01-at-22.03.59-768x463.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Screen-Shot-2018-01-01-at-22.03.59-945x570.png 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Screen-Shot-2018-01-01-at-22.03.59-600x362.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-3066\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">WordPress&#8217;s upcoming Gutenberg editor<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>Some of you will be expecting me to dive into a deep discussion about my thoughts as a developer\/coder and meta-boxes and stuff like that. But that&#8217;s for another post.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I was a USER of Gutenberg. I was trying to write <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/01\/2017-in-review-ask-me-anything\/\">a year-in-review post<\/a> that involved a lot of copying and pasting from Facebook, and I was doing it on an iPad. Now, I know that that&#8217;s not necessarily a common use case, but I know that this wouldn&#8217;t have been too hard in the normal WordPress editor.<\/p>\n<p>But wow was it hard in Gutenberg.<\/p>\n<p>Then, after giving up on the iPad, I switched to my laptop to finish it off. What I found there was that, for a post that is mostly just text, images and a couple of embedded videos, Gutenberg actually <em>gets in the way<\/em> of the writing experience.<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t expect this.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been trying hard to be a proponent of Gutenberg. It seems like it&#8217;s a good evolution of the WordPress software for the use case of blogging and straight-up content creation. I want to think it&#8217;s a good idea.<\/p>\n<p>I also know that the team who are making it have been working REALLY hard on it, engaging fantastically well with those who are testing and critiquing it, and that it&#8217;s still a work in progress and could still end up being the amazing writing tool that I want it to be.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also aware that I&#8217;m an a-typical user. I like to use my keyboard to write, without touching the mouse, and love the markdown-like shortcuts for headings and code and so on that were recently added to the WordPress editor. AND I know that there are some keyboard shortcuts, but I&#8217;ve not learned them yet (Where is the reference? Maybe not there yet.)<\/p>\n<p>But there was just something about all the extra user-interface popping up everywhere. The way that hovering over any paragraph made all these controls appear (a block for each paragraph creates too many pop-up controls). The way that the new-block interface and the block options are present so much of the time.<\/p>\n<p>I just wanted to write &#8211; and, I&#8217;m sad and sorry to say, Gutenberg got in the way, confused me, and I just wanted to turn it off.<\/p>\n<p>If a power user &#8211; someone who uses WordPress a lot and has high hopes for Gutenberg and wants to like it &#8211; finds it intrusive and complicated, then what will that mean for the every-day blogger?<\/p>\n<p>Gutenberg still has work to do to win me over. I hope the team building it can make it right.<\/p>\n",

There&#8217;s now something like 8 birthdays of close (emotionally, not necessarily geographically) friends and family between the last week of November and the first week of December, including my son&#8217;s own.<\/p>\n<p>Add to that that both my wife and I were trying to get all sorts of things done at work before the holiday period started, and we got a nasty cold to fend off, and we were trying to make a trip to see relatives in Cambridge, Christmas really took a bit of a back seat.\u00a0 We didn&#8217;t really do much of anything with our church, and had little time to engage in the typical advent process of reflective preparation, and when Christmas finally landed, we had little energy for feasting and celebration.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been thinking that I wish this was all the other way&#8230;.that Christmas Day celebration marked the START of the time of preparation; that the time between Christmas and new year that many (but, yes, not all) people traditionally have off work to spend with family was when you got to pause and reflect; and that New Year itself, and not Christmas, was the culmination of it all.<\/p>\n<p>I then found myself talking with a good friend, who happens to be pretty in touch with the Anglican church calendar, about the church calendar. And he expressed, I think, a similar frustration. That the church&#8217;s activities in the run-up to Christmas don&#8217;t really fit with the activities of most families (or maybe just the particularly average, nuclear-type of family that I think we probably are) in the modern world, and that the advent time of reflection would be better suited to the week between Christmas and New Year.<\/p>\n<p>He also pointed out that most people do their reflecting on the year gone by and their preparing for the year ahead at that time anyway.<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;hmm&#8230;I&#8217;m just thinking out loud.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m under no illusion that I might be able to change Christmas, but it does seem that the expectations that the church puts on people don&#8217;t match with how a lot of people live out the month of December.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m rested, reflected, and hopefully prepared.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s do 2018!<\/p>\n",

There&#8217;s now something like 8 birthdays of close (emotionally, not necessarily geographically) friends and family between the last week of November and the first week of December, including my son&#8217;s own.<\/p>\n<p>Add to that that both my wife and I were trying to get all sorts of things done at work before the holiday period started, and we got a nasty cold to fend off, and we were trying to make a trip to see relatives in Cambridge, Christmas really took a bit of a back seat.\u00a0 We didn&#8217;t really do much of anything with our church, and had little time to engage in the typical advent process of reflective preparation, and when Christmas finally landed, we had little energy for feasting and celebration.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been thinking that I wish this was all the other way&#8230;.that Christmas Day celebration marked the START of the time of preparation; that the time between Christmas and new year that many (but, yes, not all) people traditionally have off work to spend with family was when you got to pause and reflect; and that New Year itself, and not Christmas, was the culmination of it all.<\/p>\n<p>I then found myself talking with a good friend, who happens to be pretty in touch with the Anglican church calendar, about the church calendar. And he expressed, I think, a similar frustration. That the church&#8217;s activities in the run-up to Christmas don&#8217;t really fit with the activities of most families (or maybe just the particularly average, nuclear-type of family that I think we probably are) in the modern world, and that the advent time of reflection would be better suited to the week between Christmas and New Year.<\/p>\n<p>He also pointed out that most people do their reflecting on the year gone by and their preparing for the year ahead at that time anyway.<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;hmm&#8230;I&#8217;m just thinking out loud.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m under no illusion that I might be able to change Christmas, but it does seem that the expectations that the church puts on people don&#8217;t match with how a lot of people live out the month of December.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m rested, reflected, and hopefully prepared.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s do 2018!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p><em>Laravel uses token auth by default, here&#8217;s how to switch it out for simple cookie-based auth for quick and easy API tinkering for logged-in users.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Note: I&#8217;m not a general PHP security expert. There may be good reasons not to do this aside from the fact that it&#8217;s not stateless (please comment if so!) and definitely use it over HTTPS if you can!!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been through this several times and I forget about it each time.\u00a0 So it&#8217;s worth writing down because it doesn&#8217;t seem to be well documented or explained even on Laracasts or Stack Overflow.<\/p>\n<h3>The issue<\/h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re in the early stages of creating a simple app and you want to allow some actions to be taken using AJAX so you want to write some simple API routes that will return JSON.<\/p>\n<p>Laravel has an <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.5\/routing#basic-routing\">api.php routes file<\/a> which automatically applies some useful middlewares to requests, such as request throttling, and returns responses in JSON with appropriate HTTP headers.\u00a0 But it also uses per-user token auth by default using a token guard. A part of the framework that doesn&#8217;t even seem to be documented.\u00a0 The best I could find was a few <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudways.com\/blog\/api-token-authentication-laravel-5-2\/\">tutorials<\/a>, and the alternative seems to be to implement oAuth2 using <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.5\/passport\">Passport<\/a>, which seems like overkill for smaller, simpler apps.<\/p>\n<p>So perhaps this method really is frowned upon because it&#8217;s not stateless and violates REST principles. In any case, I&#8217;m pragmatic and I want to get started with my requests. So I want to switch this out for session based auth.<\/p>\n<h3>The config in question<\/h3>\n<p><em>Note: this is Laravel 5.5 &#8211; things may have changed.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So you put your route into <code>routes\/api.php<\/code>\u00a0and you may note that that has the <code>auth:api<\/code>\u00a0middleware applied.\u00a0 Though I&#8217;m not quite sure (and am really struggling to find out) how this happens and exactly what gets applied.<\/p>\n<p>It also has a bunch of other middleware applied that we can control, as we&#8217;ll see later.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s deal with the latter first.\u00a0 The &#8220;other middleware&#8221; used are specified in <code>app\/Http\/Kernel.php<\/code><\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll see in there the <code>$middlewareGroups<\/code>\u00a0property which looks like this:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\nprotected $middlewareGroups = &#x5B;\r\n    'web' =&gt; &#x5B;\r\n        \\App\\Http\\Middleware\\EncryptCookies::class,\r\n        \\Illuminate\\Cookie\\Middleware\\AddQueuedCookiesToResponse::class,\r\n        \\Illuminate\\Session\\Middleware\\StartSession::class,\r\n        \/\/ \\Illuminate\\Session\\Middleware\\AuthenticateSession::class,\r\n        \\Illuminate\\View\\Middleware\\ShareErrorsFromSession::class,\r\n        \\App\\Http\\Middleware\\VerifyCsrfToken::class,\r\n        \\Illuminate\\Routing\\Middleware\\SubstituteBindings::class,\r\n    ],\r\n\r\n    'api' =&gt; &#x5B;\r\n        'throttle:60,1',\r\n        'bindings',\r\n    ],\r\n]\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>And you&#8217;ll hopefully note that there&#8217;s a <code>web<\/code> and an <code>api<\/code> group in here. The <code>api<\/code> group includes the throttling and something called bindings\u00a0that remains mysterious to me.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I THINK that the <code>auth:api<\/code> middleware that you see mentioned in <code>routes\/api.php<\/code> refers to the guards listed in <code>config\/auth.php<\/code>. These look like:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n'guards' =&gt; &#x5B;\r\n    'web'=&gt;&#x5B;\r\n        'driver'=&gt;'session',\r\n        'provider'=&gt;'users',\r\n    ],\r\n'api'=&gt;&#x5B;\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 'driver'=&gt;'token',\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 'provider'=&gt;'users',\r\n    ],\r\n],\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Note that the driver for the <code>api<\/code>\u00a0guard here is token.\u00a0 Now I think this refers to a per-user-token style of authentication (a bit like the method described <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/discuss\/channels\/laravel\/53-api-routes-auth-middleware-confusion\">here<\/a>), but this token-driver-auth is not, as far as I can tell, document ANYWHERE, even though it seems to be the default for routes in <code>routes\/api.php<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>So that what we seem to be dealing with. BUT&#8230;something either is not right with my understanding of the <code>auth:api<\/code>\u00a0middleware or it doesn&#8217;t work, or something else is going on that I don&#8217;t know about (and that no one seems to be able to tell me about).<\/p>\n<h3>The solution<\/h3>\n<p>Given what I found about the config, you&#8217;d think that the solution is to set the <code>api<\/code>\u00a0driver in <code>config\/auth.php<\/code>\u00a0to be <code>session<\/code>, but this doesn&#8217;t work.<\/p>\n<p>One reason this doesn&#8217;t work is that the other lot of middleware defined in <code>Kernel.php<\/code> doesn&#8217;t include the middleware needed to start sessions and use cookies.\u00a0 To do that you need to add the right middleware in <code>Kernel.php<\/code><\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n'api' =&gt; &#x5B;\r\n    \\App\\Http\\Middleware\\EncryptCookies::class,\r\n    \\Illuminate\\Cookie\\Middleware\\AddQueuedCookiesToResponse::class,\r\n    \\Illuminate\\Session\\Middleware\\StartSession::class, \r\n    'throttle:60,1',\r\n    'bindings',\r\n],\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>But this STILL doesn&#8217;t work.<\/p>\n<p>And in the absence of any further information about how the <code>auth:api<\/code>\u00a0middleware works, I can only get this working by changing <code>auth:api<\/code>\u00a0to just <code>auth<\/code>\u00a0in <code>routes\/api.php<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;steps to get this working<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add the cookies and session middlewares to the <code>api<\/code>\u00a0group in <code>Kernel.php<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Change <code>api:auth<\/code>\u00a0to just <code>api<\/code>\u00a0in <code>routes\/api.php<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Add your routes and controllers and away you go!<\/li>\n<li>Oh, and make sure you&#8217;re using HTTPS. You don&#8217;t want your cookies being intercepted!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Finally&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>If you know how the <code>auth:api<\/code>\u00a0middleware works, or if you can explain why any of what I&#8217;ve suggested is a bad idea, please leave comments.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><em>Laravel uses token auth by default, here&#8217;s how to switch it out for simple cookie-based auth for quick and easy API tinkering for logged-in users.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Note: I&#8217;m not a general PHP security expert. There may be good reasons not to do this aside from the fact that it&#8217;s not stateless (please comment if so!) and definitely use it over HTTPS if you can!!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been through this several times and I forget about it each time.\u00a0 So it&#8217;s worth writing down because it doesn&#8217;t seem to be well documented or explained even on Laracasts or Stack Overflow.<\/p>\n<h3>The issue<\/h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re in the early stages of creating a simple app and you want to allow some actions to be taken using AJAX so you want to write some simple API routes that will return JSON.<\/p>\n<p>Laravel has an <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.5\/routing#basic-routing\">api.php routes file<\/a> which automatically applies some useful middlewares to requests, such as request throttling, and returns responses in JSON with appropriate HTTP headers.\u00a0 But it also uses per-user token auth by default using a token guard. A part of the framework that doesn&#8217;t even seem to be documented.\u00a0 The best I could find was a few <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudways.com\/blog\/api-token-authentication-laravel-5-2\/\">tutorials<\/a>, and the alternative seems to be to implement oAuth2 using <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.5\/passport\">Passport<\/a>, which seems like overkill for smaller, simpler apps.<\/p>\n<p>So perhaps this method really is frowned upon because it&#8217;s not stateless and violates REST principles. In any case, I&#8217;m pragmatic and I want to get started with my requests. So I want to switch this out for session based auth.<\/p>\n<h3>The config in question<\/h3>\n<p><em>Note: this is Laravel 5.5 &#8211; things may have changed.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So you put your route into <code>routes\/api.php<\/code>\u00a0and you may note that that has the <code>auth:api<\/code>\u00a0middleware applied.\u00a0 Though I&#8217;m not quite sure (and am really struggling to find out) how this happens and exactly what gets applied.<\/p>\n<p>It also has a bunch of other middleware applied that we can control, as we&#8217;ll see later.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s deal with the latter first.\u00a0 The &#8220;other middleware&#8221; used are specified in <code>app\/Http\/Kernel.php<\/code><\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll see in there the <code>$middlewareGroups<\/code>\u00a0property which looks like this:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\nprotected $middlewareGroups = &#x5B;\r\n    'web' =&gt; &#x5B;\r\n        \\App\\Http\\Middleware\\EncryptCookies::class,\r\n        \\Illuminate\\Cookie\\Middleware\\AddQueuedCookiesToResponse::class,\r\n        \\Illuminate\\Session\\Middleware\\StartSession::class,\r\n        \/\/ \\Illuminate\\Session\\Middleware\\AuthenticateSession::class,\r\n        \\Illuminate\\View\\Middleware\\ShareErrorsFromSession::class,\r\n        \\App\\Http\\Middleware\\VerifyCsrfToken::class,\r\n        \\Illuminate\\Routing\\Middleware\\SubstituteBindings::class,\r\n    ],\r\n\r\n    'api' =&gt; &#x5B;\r\n        'throttle:60,1',\r\n        'bindings',\r\n    ],\r\n]\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>And you&#8217;ll hopefully note that there&#8217;s a <code>web<\/code> and an <code>api<\/code> group in here. The <code>api<\/code> group includes the throttling and something called bindings\u00a0that remains mysterious to me.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I THINK that the <code>auth:api<\/code> middleware that you see mentioned in <code>routes\/api.php<\/code> refers to the guards listed in <code>config\/auth.php<\/code>. These look like:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n'guards' =&gt; &#x5B;\r\n    'web'=&gt;&#x5B;\r\n        'driver'=&gt;'session',\r\n        'provider'=&gt;'users',\r\n    ],\r\n'api'=&gt;&#x5B;\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 'driver'=&gt;'token',\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 'provider'=&gt;'users',\r\n    ],\r\n],\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Note that the driver for the <code>api<\/code>\u00a0guard here is token.\u00a0 Now I think this refers to a per-user-token style of authentication (a bit like the method described <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/discuss\/channels\/laravel\/53-api-routes-auth-middleware-confusion\">here<\/a>), but this token-driver-auth is not, as far as I can tell, document ANYWHERE, even though it seems to be the default for routes in <code>routes\/api.php<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>So that what we seem to be dealing with. BUT&#8230;something either is not right with my understanding of the <code>auth:api<\/code>\u00a0middleware or it doesn&#8217;t work, or something else is going on that I don&#8217;t know about (and that no one seems to be able to tell me about).<\/p>\n<h3>The solution<\/h3>\n<p>Given what I found about the config, you&#8217;d think that the solution is to set the <code>api<\/code>\u00a0driver in <code>config\/auth.php<\/code>\u00a0to be <code>session<\/code>, but this doesn&#8217;t work.<\/p>\n<p>One reason this doesn&#8217;t work is that the other lot of middleware defined in <code>Kernel.php<\/code> doesn&#8217;t include the middleware needed to start sessions and use cookies.\u00a0 To do that you need to add the right middleware in <code>Kernel.php<\/code><\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n'api' =&gt; &#x5B;\r\n    \\App\\Http\\Middleware\\EncryptCookies::class,\r\n    \\Illuminate\\Cookie\\Middleware\\AddQueuedCookiesToResponse::class,\r\n    \\Illuminate\\Session\\Middleware\\StartSession::class, \r\n    'throttle:60,1',\r\n    'bindings',\r\n],\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>But this STILL doesn&#8217;t work.<\/p>\n<p>And in the absence of any further information about how the <code>auth:api<\/code>\u00a0middleware works, I can only get this working by changing <code>auth:api<\/code>\u00a0to just <code>auth<\/code>\u00a0in <code>routes\/api.php<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;steps to get this working<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add the cookies and session middlewares to the <code>api<\/code>\u00a0group in <code>Kernel.php<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Change <code>api:auth<\/code>\u00a0to just <code>api<\/code>\u00a0in <code>routes\/api.php<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Add your routes and controllers and away you go!<\/li>\n<li>Oh, and make sure you&#8217;re using HTTPS. You don&#8217;t want your cookies being intercepted!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Finally&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>If you know how the <code>auth:api<\/code>\u00a0middleware works, or if you can explain why any of what I&#8217;ve suggested is a bad idea, please leave comments.<\/p>\n",
