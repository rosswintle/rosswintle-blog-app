\u00a0And who&#8217;s flying the planes at that time of morning? \u00a0Weird.<\/li>\n<li>We did lots of looking online too, but trying hard to get an all-in-one package.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div>In the end we booked a Flight\/Car\/Hotel online with Expedia. \u00a0It was a bit above our budget but we really wanted to go to Sicily and had exhausted pretty much all other options.<\/div>\n<div>The package would have been cheaper had we booked with Alitalia, but we found out about their looming bankruptcy and paid over-the-odds to fly British Airways. \u00a0This had other advantages, such as being a direct flight, and departing at the more sensible hour of 8am. \u00a0Thanks to my dad for pointing out Alitalia&#8217;s troubles as we were about to head home and click the &#8220;Buy this holiday&#8221; button!!<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What we got<\/span><\/div>\n<div>A little more detail&#8230;<\/div>\n<div>We flew BA direct to Catania\/Fontarossa Airport on the East Coast of Sicily, then hired a small car, and headed south towards the ancient town of Syracuse.<\/div>\n<div>Our hotel &#8211; the simple, charming, out-in-the-country retreat of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.masseriadegliulivi.com\/\">Masseria Degli Ulivi<\/a> &#8211; was located just outside the nearby town of Noto &#8211; itself a beautiful and historic place worth exploring (and one of the highlights of the holiday, if I might say so).<\/div>\n<div>We were there for a week, driving round, exploring the Eastern side of the island, sampling the food and wine, and relaxing poolside and on the beach.<\/div>\n<div>It was a great, relaxing break.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Highlights<\/span><\/div>\n<div>There will be more about the holiday posted later, but if you don&#8217;t want the detail, here&#8217;s the stuff that you really should know if you want to know what we got up to, or if you fancy a trip to Sicily yourself.<\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.masseriadegliulivi.com\/\">The Hotel<\/a>, mentioned above, is a great place to chill out and explore the island &#8211; just watch out for the naughty puppy on site!<\/li>\n<li>Sicily is a very rural and traditional place &#8211; at least, the Eastern Coast is. \u00a0This means that everything shuts from about noon until about 4pm. \u00a0So MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A LUNCH PLAN. \u00a0I had a very stressful day driving around trying to find lunch with only a minimal grasp of the language. \u00a0It was not fun.<\/li>\n<li>In fact, the hotel didn&#8217;t offer lunch, so we were out and about most days. \u00a0The best way is to find a grocery or supermarket and get some supplies and make your own lunch. \u00a0Milano Salami is fantastic! \u00a0Don&#8217;t go for the sliced bread&#8230;yuk!<\/li>\n<li>We borrowed a Sat Nav system with European mapping from a friend. \u00a0This was hugely helpful and saved us hours of time, lots of faff, and probably lots of arguments too. \u00a0But, as always, use wisely! \u00a0They do get funny ideas about where to go sometimes. \u00a0If you think you need to stick to the main road, then sitck to it!<\/li>\n<li>Sicilians are lunatic drivers with little regard for the road. \u00a0Pay attention, drive with confidence, and give them a wide berth and you&#8217;ll a)\u00a0be fine b) witness some crazy overtaking and turning first hand!<\/li>\n<li>Driving on the continent for the first time wasn&#8217;t so hard, though turning at junctions was often confusing. \u00a0Having the car layout the other way around was probably more taxing for my head than the driving.<\/li>\n<li>Things that must be done: \u00a01) Climb Mt Etna (more detail on this later) 2) Visit Pantalica 3) Explore Syracuse on foot<\/li>\n<li>Food is generally good to excellent and you get what you pay for. \u00a0Coffee is awesome! \u00a0Local wine is also pretty incredible, but watch out &#8211; it&#8217;s strong too!<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t take any kangaroos with you. \u00a0 You&#8217;ll have to read on to find out why! \ud83d\ude09<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/05\/a-week-in-sicily-part-2-travel\/\">Read part two<\/a><\/div>\n",

\u00a0And who&#8217;s flying the planes at that time of morning? \u00a0Weird.<\/li>\n<li>We did lots of looking online too, but trying hard to get an all-in-one package.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div>In the end we booked a Flight\/Car\/Hotel online with Expedia. \u00a0It was a bit above our budget but we really wanted to go to Sicily and had exhausted pretty much all other options.<\/div>\n<div>The package would have been cheaper had we booked with Alitalia, but we found out about their looming bankruptcy and paid over-the-odds to fly British Airways. \u00a0This had other advantages, such as being a direct flight, and departing at the more sensible hour of 8am. \u00a0Thanks to my dad for pointing out Alitalia&#8217;s troubles as we were about to head home and click the &#8220;Buy this holiday&#8221; button!!<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What we got<\/span><\/div>\n<div>A little more detail&#8230;<\/div>\n<div>We flew BA direct to Catania\/Fontarossa Airport on the East Coast of Sicily, then hired a small car, and headed south towards the ancient town of Syracuse.<\/div>\n<div>Our hotel &#8211; the simple, charming, out-in-the-country retreat of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.masseriadegliulivi.com\/\">Masseria Degli Ulivi<\/a> &#8211; was located just outside the nearby town of Noto &#8211; itself a beautiful and historic place worth exploring (and one of the highlights of the holiday, if I might say so).<\/div>\n<div>We were there for a week, driving round, exploring the Eastern side of the island, sampling the food and wine, and relaxing poolside and on the beach.<\/div>\n<div>It was a great, relaxing break.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Highlights<\/span><\/div>\n<div>There will be more about the holiday posted later, but if you don&#8217;t want the detail, here&#8217;s the stuff that you really should know if you want to know what we got up to, or if you fancy a trip to Sicily yourself.<\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.masseriadegliulivi.com\/\">The Hotel<\/a>, mentioned above, is a great place to chill out and explore the island &#8211; just watch out for the naughty puppy on site!<\/li>\n<li>Sicily is a very rural and traditional place &#8211; at least, the Eastern Coast is. \u00a0This means that everything shuts from about noon until about 4pm. \u00a0So MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A LUNCH PLAN. \u00a0I had a very stressful day driving around trying to find lunch with only a minimal grasp of the language. \u00a0It was not fun.<\/li>\n<li>In fact, the hotel didn&#8217;t offer lunch, so we were out and about most days. \u00a0The best way is to find a grocery or supermarket and get some supplies and make your own lunch. \u00a0Milano Salami is fantastic! \u00a0Don&#8217;t go for the sliced bread&#8230;yuk!<\/li>\n<li>We borrowed a Sat Nav system with European mapping from a friend. \u00a0This was hugely helpful and saved us hours of time, lots of faff, and probably lots of arguments too. \u00a0But, as always, use wisely! \u00a0They do get funny ideas about where to go sometimes. \u00a0If you think you need to stick to the main road, then sitck to it!<\/li>\n<li>Sicilians are lunatic drivers with little regard for the road. \u00a0Pay attention, drive with confidence, and give them a wide berth and you&#8217;ll a)\u00a0be fine b) witness some crazy overtaking and turning first hand!<\/li>\n<li>Driving on the continent for the first time wasn&#8217;t so hard, though turning at junctions was often confusing. \u00a0Having the car layout the other way around was probably more taxing for my head than the driving.<\/li>\n<li>Things that must be done: \u00a01) Climb Mt Etna (more detail on this later) 2) Visit Pantalica 3) Explore Syracuse on foot<\/li>\n<li>Food is generally good to excellent and you get what you pay for. \u00a0Coffee is awesome! \u00a0Local wine is also pretty incredible, but watch out &#8211; it&#8217;s strong too!<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t take any kangaroos with you. \u00a0 You&#8217;ll have to read on to find out why! \ud83d\ude09<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/05\/a-week-in-sicily-part-2-travel\/\">Read part two<\/a><\/div>\n",

No. \u00a0So let&#8217;s do some work on balancing that out.<\/li>\n<li>Is my saddle straight? \u00a0Yes, and it&#8217;s at a good height too. \u00a0But I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m sat on it straight. \u00a0Maybe I sag to one side a little? \u00a0Have to think about my position there too.<\/li>\n<li>What about my feet? \u00a0Well, my cleats (the clips on the bottom of cycling shoes that clip into &#8220;clipless&#8221; pedals), weren&#8217;t in the same position on both feet &#8211; so I&#8217;ve adjusted them, and replaced the cleats at the same time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Will all this make a difference? \u00a0It&#8217;s hard to say right now as I&#8217;ve not done a longer ride for a while. \u00a0It will be interesting to see how things are now.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Of course, in the background the stretching and strength work that I don&#8217;t do enough of will have to continue too, and as the nights draw in perhaps I&#8217;ll get more opportunity to do that. \u00a0Then, come next spring, I&#8217;ll be REALLY fit and ready to go!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Maybe.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

No. \u00a0So let&#8217;s do some work on balancing that out.<\/li>\n<li>Is my saddle straight? \u00a0Yes, and it&#8217;s at a good height too. \u00a0But I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m sat on it straight. \u00a0Maybe I sag to one side a little? \u00a0Have to think about my position there too.<\/li>\n<li>What about my feet? \u00a0Well, my cleats (the clips on the bottom of cycling shoes that clip into &#8220;clipless&#8221; pedals), weren&#8217;t in the same position on both feet &#8211; so I&#8217;ve adjusted them, and replaced the cleats at the same time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Will all this make a difference? \u00a0It&#8217;s hard to say right now as I&#8217;ve not done a longer ride for a while. \u00a0It will be interesting to see how things are now.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Of course, in the background the stretching and strength work that I don&#8217;t do enough of will have to continue too, and as the nights draw in perhaps I&#8217;ll get more opportunity to do that. \u00a0Then, come next spring, I&#8217;ll be REALLY fit and ready to go!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Maybe.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",
