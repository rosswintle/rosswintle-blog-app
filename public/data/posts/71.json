But it\u2019s a trajectory I don\u2019t like. And I need to start moving the line the other way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t like giving away all the data to some tracking app, but they do seem to be really useful helpers for this kind of thing. So I have accepted it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have <a href=\"https:\/\/loseit.com\/\">an app ready to go<\/a> (the same one Adam was using, I think?)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve never tracked calories before.

We had a great time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that, as I relax and unwind, and the adrenaline that&#8217;s been keeping everything at bay dissipates, and the major life stuff is put aside, things come crashing down and the minor annoyances of life are suddenly much more noticable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And other than appliances and customer service, the other thing that really bugged me while on holiday was that you need a flippin&#8217; app or website registration for SO many things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Get a voucher for a meal at a restaurant: Download an app and register.<\/li><li>Check which beaches are safe to swim at: Probably on a website, but the encouragement was to download the app.<\/li><li>Get a map for the forest park: OK, this didn&#8217;t NEED an app, but, again, it was encouraged and signposted when paper maps were not.<\/li><li>Hire a scooter: Download app and register.<\/li><li>Scan a non-standard QR code on a box of cereal. I didn&#8217;t have to do this, but I was curious. Apparently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.packaginginsights.com\/news\/kelloggs-smartphone-detectable-cereal-boxes-championed-as-game-changer-for-blind-consumer-inclusivity.html\">it&#8217;s great for accessibility<\/a>, and could be some wonderful tech, but it&#8217;s proprietary tech that&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/edent\/status\/1411732397314486278\">not without issues<\/a> and, really, an app to read a colorful QR code?<\/li><li>Trying to find out when the next bus is: the app was optional, but again, encouraged. And it had neat real-time bus-tracking features too.<\/li><li>Buying tickets for the aquarium: this probably legitimately needed registration, but was still ANOTHER account I had to create while mobile.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And don&#8217;t get me started on parking. I now have JustPark, RingGo, PhoneAndPay, PayByPhone, and Apcoa Connect and they all forget who I am and fail in every possible way when ALL I WANT TO DO IS PAY \u00a33 TO PARK MY CAR!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The friction that tech has brought to all of these things seems to be huge. Downloading apps on mobile data isn&#8217;t nice. Registering for anything that requires a password isn&#8217;t nice (yes I use a password manager, and no it&#8217;s not very helpful in these scenarios). Confirming identity by email is a mess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can we make this better?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Use lightweight, progressive web apps, that I can open in a regular browser, without an app download.<\/li><li>Allow some way to do the thing without creating an account, or allowing me to create an account later. Surely someone has fixed the spam and fraud issues by now?<\/li><li>Find some better way than passwords for login. Login with Apple\/Google seems to help here, but isn&#8217;t always implemented and I&#8217;m not entirely sure if I like its magic.<\/li><li>Go and actually user test your applications and websites in real life scenarios &#8211; like, I want to book a ticket to the aquarium from the beach. Or I want to frickin pay \u00a33 to park my frickin&#8217; car in a frickin&#8217; car park and we can land a car-sized rover on Mars using a rocket-powered hovering crane so why can&#8217;t I reset my password right now. I feel like so many of these apps are tested in offices and never actually taken into the real world and used in a real-world scenario.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I dunno. There are some hard problems here. But there are some awesome opportunities to use tech to make things easier and better for people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we MUST reduce the friction of trying to do these things to grasp those opportunites and not just frustrate people who are trying to enjoy their holiday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&lt;\/rant><\/p>\n",

We had a great time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that, as I relax and unwind, and the adrenaline that&#8217;s been keeping everything at bay dissipates, and the major life stuff is put aside, things come crashing down and the minor annoyances of life are suddenly much more noticable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And other than appliances and customer service, the other thing that really bugged me while on holiday was that you need a flippin&#8217; app or website registration for SO many things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Get a voucher for a meal at a restaurant: Download an app and register.<\/li><li>Check which beaches are safe to swim at: Probably on a website, but the encouragement was to download the app.<\/li><li>Get a map for the forest park: OK, this didn&#8217;t NEED an app, but, again, it was encouraged and signposted when paper maps were not.<\/li><li>Hire a scooter: Download app and register.<\/li><li>Scan a non-standard QR code on a box of cereal. I didn&#8217;t have to do this, but I was curious. Apparently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.packaginginsights.com\/news\/kelloggs-smartphone-detectable-cereal-boxes-championed-as-game-changer-for-blind-consumer-inclusivity.html\">it&#8217;s great for accessibility<\/a>, and could be some wonderful tech, but it&#8217;s proprietary tech that&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/edent\/status\/1411732397314486278\">not without issues<\/a> and, really, an app to read a colorful QR code?<\/li><li>Trying to find out when the next bus is: the app was optional, but again, encouraged. And it had neat real-time bus-tracking features too.<\/li><li>Buying tickets for the aquarium: this probably legitimately needed registration, but was still ANOTHER account I had to create while mobile.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And don&#8217;t get me started on parking. I now have JustPark, RingGo, PhoneAndPay, PayByPhone, and Apcoa Connect and they all forget who I am and fail in every possible way when ALL I WANT TO DO IS PAY \u00a33 TO PARK MY CAR!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The friction that tech has brought to all of these things seems to be huge. Downloading apps on mobile data isn&#8217;t nice. Registering for anything that requires a password isn&#8217;t nice (yes I use a password manager, and no it&#8217;s not very helpful in these scenarios). Confirming identity by email is a mess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can we make this better?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Use lightweight, progressive web apps, that I can open in a regular browser, without an app download.<\/li><li>Allow some way to do the thing without creating an account, or allowing me to create an account later. Surely someone has fixed the spam and fraud issues by now?<\/li><li>Find some better way than passwords for login. Login with Apple\/Google seems to help here, but isn&#8217;t always implemented and I&#8217;m not entirely sure if I like its magic.<\/li><li>Go and actually user test your applications and websites in real life scenarios &#8211; like, I want to book a ticket to the aquarium from the beach. Or I want to frickin pay \u00a33 to park my frickin&#8217; car in a frickin&#8217; car park and we can land a car-sized rover on Mars using a rocket-powered hovering crane so why can&#8217;t I reset my password right now. I feel like so many of these apps are tested in offices and never actually taken into the real world and used in a real-world scenario.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I dunno. There are some hard problems here. But there are some awesome opportunities to use tech to make things easier and better for people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we MUST reduce the friction of trying to do these things to grasp those opportunites and not just frustrate people who are trying to enjoy their holiday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&lt;\/rant><\/p>\n",

Having decided to put off manifest v3 support (a browser extension thing that I will need to do at some point) I\u2019m focussing on making the tool more \u201cframeworky\u201d and building an internal plugin\/addon API.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This won&#8217;t be something that the public can build for. At least, not initially. But it will allow me to apply a standard structure to many of the various &#8220;features&#8221; of Turbo Admin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the existing features are currently in separate JS files\/classes. But they are &#8220;pulled in&#8221; to the appropriate bits of palette code in an ad-hoc way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the new code structure, they will register themselves and offer up features to the palette system, and they will (mostly) use a standard API to interact with the command palette. For example, they will be able to add items, save the palette state and clear it, and provide keyword-based &#8220;search modes&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These search modes are where most of the future power will lie. Typing &#8220;posts&#8221; will search posts using the REST API. Typing &#8220;plugin&#8221; could search your plugins. Typing &#8220;user&#8221; could initiate a user search. Or (and this is HUGE for me &#8211; and maybe for you!) typing &#8220;order&#8221; or &#8220;customer&#8221; could search WooCommerce!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of these features are prototyped and living in branches in Git. Adding this core API is what will free me up to pull them all together into the product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230; how do you do this in JavaScript?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frameworky JavaScript<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a PHP coder. So my natural instinct was to do something object-oriented. JavaScript is sort-of object oriented too. So I was hoping this would work. But it&#8217;s been a strange journey. How do I take my knowledge of how to structure large PHP apps, and turn it into JS architecture?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One issue here is that very few tutorials seem to guide you through architecting with a given language. They show you the principles, but rarely build anything substantial where you get to see the principles applied at scale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m figuring this out from scratch. And yes, I made mistakes along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve ended up with an abstract class approach where each &#8220;plugin&#8221; inherits and extends the functionality of a base, abstract &#8220;plugin&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems that getting the level of abstraction right when you&#8217;re architecting something like this is REALLY difficult. And I&#8217;ve swung both ways. Sometimes with lots of duplicate\/boilerplate code. And sometimes with lots of classes and objects flying around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels important to get it right, so that I don&#8217;t have to re-work all my plugins later. So the pressure is on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to show you REAMS of code, but here&#8217;s an example of the kind of place I&#8217;m at:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"859\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-1024x859.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11341\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-1024x859.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-300x252.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-768x644.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-1536x1288.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x.png 1894w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing this sort of OO in JS feels very weird. I&#8217;m not quite sure it&#8217;s the right approach, and I&#8217;ve heard people frowning on JS classes (is that just a React thing?). But it works a treat, and I&#8217;m pretty sure this will soon allow me to start &#8220;merging in&#8221; all the various prototype code that I have lying around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, evening by evening, little by little, it will start coming together, and the full power of command-pallette-driven WordPress and WooCommerce will reveal itself!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, if you like this sound of all this, please <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/try.html\">give it a try (for free!)<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/turbo-admin\/#reviews\">review it<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/turbo-admin\/hfafpihfemmbjhppilebphmcpepglkfp?hl=en-GB\">rate it<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">go and buy a license<\/a>, or share it with a friend or colleague, or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/turboadmn\">Tweet me<\/a> something nice. This is a labour of love, and every ker-ching of a sale is an encouragement that I&#8217;m doing something useful. All these features will be in a free update in the future, so buy now to get locked in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for following along and for all your support.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I\u2019m FINALLY getting around to chipping away at <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a>&#8216;s next steps. Having decided to put off manifest v3 support (a browser extension thing that I will need to do at some point) I\u2019m focussing on making the tool more \u201cframeworky\u201d and building an internal plugin\/addon API.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This won&#8217;t be something that the public can build for. At least, not initially. But it will allow me to apply a standard structure to many of the various &#8220;features&#8221; of Turbo Admin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the existing features are currently in separate JS files\/classes. But they are &#8220;pulled in&#8221; to the appropriate bits of palette code in an ad-hoc way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the new code structure, they will register themselves and offer up features to the palette system, and they will (mostly) use a standard API to interact with the command palette. For example, they will be able to add items, save the palette state and clear it, and provide keyword-based &#8220;search modes&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These search modes are where most of the future power will lie. Typing &#8220;posts&#8221; will search posts using the REST API. Typing &#8220;plugin&#8221; could search your plugins. Typing &#8220;user&#8221; could initiate a user search. Or (and this is HUGE for me &#8211; and maybe for you!) typing &#8220;order&#8221; or &#8220;customer&#8221; could search WooCommerce!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of these features are prototyped and living in branches in Git. Adding this core API is what will free me up to pull them all together into the product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230; how do you do this in JavaScript?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frameworky JavaScript<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a PHP coder. So my natural instinct was to do something object-oriented. JavaScript is sort-of object oriented too. So I was hoping this would work. But it&#8217;s been a strange journey. How do I take my knowledge of how to structure large PHP apps, and turn it into JS architecture?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One issue here is that very few tutorials seem to guide you through architecting with a given language. They show you the principles, but rarely build anything substantial where you get to see the principles applied at scale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m figuring this out from scratch. And yes, I made mistakes along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve ended up with an abstract class approach where each &#8220;plugin&#8221; inherits and extends the functionality of a base, abstract &#8220;plugin&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems that getting the level of abstraction right when you&#8217;re architecting something like this is REALLY difficult. And I&#8217;ve swung both ways. Sometimes with lots of duplicate\/boilerplate code. And sometimes with lots of classes and objects flying around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels important to get it right, so that I don&#8217;t have to re-work all my plugins later. So the pressure is on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to show you REAMS of code, but here&#8217;s an example of the kind of place I&#8217;m at:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"859\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-1024x859.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11341\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-1024x859.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-300x252.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-768x644.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-1536x1288.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x.png 1894w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing this sort of OO in JS feels very weird. I&#8217;m not quite sure it&#8217;s the right approach, and I&#8217;ve heard people frowning on JS classes (is that just a React thing?). But it works a treat, and I&#8217;m pretty sure this will soon allow me to start &#8220;merging in&#8221; all the various prototype code that I have lying around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, evening by evening, little by little, it will start coming together, and the full power of command-pallette-driven WordPress and WooCommerce will reveal itself!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, if you like this sound of all this, please <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/try.html\">give it a try (for free!)<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/turbo-admin\/#reviews\">review it<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/turbo-admin\/hfafpihfemmbjhppilebphmcpepglkfp?hl=en-GB\">rate it<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">go and buy a license<\/a>, or share it with a friend or colleague, or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/turboadmn\">Tweet me<\/a> something nice. This is a labour of love, and every ker-ching of a sale is an encouragement that I&#8217;m doing something useful. All these features will be in a free update in the future, so buy now to get locked in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for following along and for all your support.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>Today I&#8217;m tidying up an old draft post on the topic of minimalism for posting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t really think of myself as minimalist. I&#8217;m not a clean desk person. Our home is big on &#8220;floordrobes&#8221;. We are slightly-chaotic, creative, mad-professor types. (Well, I should only speak for myself but&#8230;)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet I have a feeling if I embraced it, minimalism would really be my thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I loved <a href=\"https:\/\/thingsworthlearning.show\/episodes\/minimalism-with-diana-scharf\">this Podcast<\/a> from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stauffermatt\">Matt Stauffer<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DianaWebdev\">Diana Scharf<\/a>, it really piqued my interest and got me wondering what more I can do to embrace minimalism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m particularly challeneged by the idea that everything you own has an ongoing cost: looking after it; having a space for it; fixing it if it breaks; finding it if its lost; moving it if you move home. Posessions have a small ongoing cognitive load.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my first thoughts was about books. I don&#8217;t really need books. I have an eReader now and much as I dislike not actually OWNING my books, it saves on all the space and is SO much easier to travel with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m really keen to start ditching physical books!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I had other thoughts about focus and distraction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My Phone&#8217;s Homescreen<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I&#8217;ve really noticed is how distracting my phone is. So in an attempt to clean this up I wondered if I could somehow just delete all my app icons (or put them in the hidden away app library thing) and use Siri or Spotlight (search) to go straight to the thing I want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t ready to completely embrace this, and wanted a back-out plan &#8211; I&#8217;m not ready to delete my crafted layouts and groups of apps that are in muscle memory. So I thought I&#8217;d keep my app screens for now, and just add one as the &#8220;home&#8221; screen with no apps on. I added a couple of nice widgets, but the vast majority of the apps are gone.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-473x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11345\" width=\"305\" height=\"660\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-473x1024.jpg 473w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-139x300.jpg 139w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-768x1663.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-709x1536.jpg 709w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-946x2048.jpg 946w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324.jpg 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>When I&#8217;m disciplined about sticking to this one screen it&#8217;s AWESOME. I should probably delete all my app pages and just do this all the time. But I can&#8217;t bring myself to do it yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a really neat trick though. Swipe down, search for what you want. Go straight there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So much better than scrolling and getting distracted before I&#8217;ve even started the task I set out to achieve!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recommended.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sticking with keys &#8211; a journey<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve long been working on the same idea for my (MacBook) laptop. I switch apps a LOT. I don&#8217;t want to use the dock. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/apple.stackexchange.com\/questions\/59556\/is-there-a-way-to-completely-disable-dock\">the dock can just disappear entirely<\/a> for all I care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alt-Tab-ing my way through apps is a simple way to stay on the keyboard for switching apps. And pairing that with using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alfredapp.com\/\">Alfred<\/a> (or Apple&#8217;s Spotlight) is great. But I&#8217;ve often wondered if I could do better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hyper Keys<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I&#8217;d heard about &#8211; mostly from <a href=\"https:\/\/syntax.fm\/show\/315\/hasty-treat-hyper-productivity-with-keyboard-shortcuts-window-management\">the Syntax.fm podcast<\/a> &#8211; is making your caps-lock key a hyper key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I was sceptical about re-mapping my caps-lock key for another purpose. But I really don&#8217;t miss it one bit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is a &#8220;hyper key&#8221;? Well the idea is that you map caps-lock to ALL the other meta-keys being pressed at once. On a Mac this is Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Option. You need special tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/karabiner-elements.pqrs.org\/\">Karabiner Elements<\/a> to do this, but once you have you can then use another tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/folivora.ai\/\">Better Touch Tool<\/a> to map Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Option-&lt;some-key> to do things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly have a whole keyboard of new shortcuts open up to you with Hyper-Something!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I set about mapping Hyper-&lt;key> to applications so that I could go straight to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hyper-F opens Firefox<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hyper-P opens PHPStorm<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hyper-W opens Wavebox<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hyper-I opens iTerm<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>and so on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Direct access to apps. Sweet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I loved this approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even Hyper Keys are a bit limited. I know I&#8217;ll sound selfish, but I wanted MORE!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stream Deck<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So I tried out Elgato&#8217;s Stream Deck.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First as an app on my phone. This has a small subscription cost, but is a good way to try out the principle of a custom keypad without investing in the reasonably expensive hardware.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It worked REALLY nicely. So, as a treat to myself when I got my new job last year, I bought a proper Stream Deak (the 15-key version) in a sale. And it works really great. Go straight to any app without typing, remembering keyboard shortcuts, or multiple alt-tabs. It keeps me focussed on what I want to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a certain amount of remembering to use the Stream Deck at first. Alt-tab is STRONG in my muscle-memory! But it&#8217;s physical presence actually helps, drawing me back to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with different pages of buttons I have a setup for when I&#8217;m on a call, for when I&#8217;m in my code editor, and shortcuts for opening websites and GitHub repos. It&#8217;s a great tool. Elgato&#8217;s software is pretty terrible (come on folks, do better!!), but this is also a recommended for going straight to apps without passing Go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with Stream Deck is&#8230; you need your Stream Deck. I don&#8217;t have it when I&#8217;m not in my office. And I&#8217;m not paying for the app if I also have the hardware. Annoying!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I still like the Hyper-Key approach too. Even though it is a bit clumsy to set up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">R-Cmd<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To finish off this journey then, one day I saw <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/rcmd-app-switcher\/id1596283165?mt=12\">R-Cmd<\/a>&#8230; a really simple MacApp that says &#8220;Hey, stuff caps-lock, it&#8217;s the Right-Cmd key that you don&#8217;t need&#8221; (really, you don&#8217;t) &#8220;so here&#8217;s a really simple app that lets you set Right-Cmd-&lt;key> as a key to open an app.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my Hyper-key setup, but SO much easier and with one app controlling it. Sure, it&#8217;s not as configurable, but I LOVE this way of doing things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Am I completely, over-the-top obsessed with avoiding my mouse and pressing too many keys? YES! Unashamedly. For something I literally do hundreds of times a day, the ergonomics and minimalism in this are great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, finally, finally&#8230; if you want to take this to the next level then you need to read &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/tighten.com\/blog\/how-to-train-your-keyboard\/\">How to Train Your Keyboard<\/a>&#8221; (which also has <a href=\"https:\/\/twentypercent.fm\/episodes\/andrew-morgan-train-your-keyboard\">an accompanying podcast episode<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now go, be productive and ditch YOUR mouse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Today I&#8217;m tidying up an old draft post on the topic of minimalism for posting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t really think of myself as minimalist. I&#8217;m not a clean desk person. Our home is big on &#8220;floordrobes&#8221;. We are slightly-chaotic, creative, mad-professor types. (Well, I should only speak for myself but&#8230;)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet I have a feeling if I embraced it, minimalism would really be my thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I loved <a href=\"https:\/\/thingsworthlearning.show\/episodes\/minimalism-with-diana-scharf\">this Podcast<\/a> from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stauffermatt\">Matt Stauffer<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DianaWebdev\">Diana Scharf<\/a>, it really piqued my interest and got me wondering what more I can do to embrace minimalism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m particularly challeneged by the idea that everything you own has an ongoing cost: looking after it; having a space for it; fixing it if it breaks; finding it if its lost; moving it if you move home. Posessions have a small ongoing cognitive load.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my first thoughts was about books. I don&#8217;t really need books. I have an eReader now and much as I dislike not actually OWNING my books, it saves on all the space and is SO much easier to travel with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m really keen to start ditching physical books!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I had other thoughts about focus and distraction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My Phone&#8217;s Homescreen<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I&#8217;ve really noticed is how distracting my phone is. So in an attempt to clean this up I wondered if I could somehow just delete all my app icons (or put them in the hidden away app library thing) and use Siri or Spotlight (search) to go straight to the thing I want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t ready to completely embrace this, and wanted a back-out plan &#8211; I&#8217;m not ready to delete my crafted layouts and groups of apps that are in muscle memory. So I thought I&#8217;d keep my app screens for now, and just add one as the &#8220;home&#8221; screen with no apps on. I added a couple of nice widgets, but the vast majority of the apps are gone.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-473x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11345\" width=\"305\" height=\"660\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-473x1024.jpg 473w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-139x300.jpg 139w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-768x1663.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-709x1536.jpg 709w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-946x2048.jpg 946w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324.jpg 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>When I&#8217;m disciplined about sticking to this one screen it&#8217;s AWESOME. I should probably delete all my app pages and just do this all the time. But I can&#8217;t bring myself to do it yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a really neat trick though. Swipe down, search for what you want. Go straight there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So much better than scrolling and getting distracted before I&#8217;ve even started the task I set out to achieve!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recommended.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sticking with keys &#8211; a journey<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve long been working on the same idea for my (MacBook) laptop. I switch apps a LOT. I don&#8217;t want to use the dock. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/apple.stackexchange.com\/questions\/59556\/is-there-a-way-to-completely-disable-dock\">the dock can just disappear entirely<\/a> for all I care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alt-Tab-ing my way through apps is a simple way to stay on the keyboard for switching apps. And pairing that with using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alfredapp.com\/\">Alfred<\/a> (or Apple&#8217;s Spotlight) is great. But I&#8217;ve often wondered if I could do better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hyper Keys<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I&#8217;d heard about &#8211; mostly from <a href=\"https:\/\/syntax.fm\/show\/315\/hasty-treat-hyper-productivity-with-keyboard-shortcuts-window-management\">the Syntax.fm podcast<\/a> &#8211; is making your caps-lock key a hyper key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I was sceptical about re-mapping my caps-lock key for another purpose. But I really don&#8217;t miss it one bit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is a &#8220;hyper key&#8221;? Well the idea is that you map caps-lock to ALL the other meta-keys being pressed at once. On a Mac this is Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Option. You need special tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/karabiner-elements.pqrs.org\/\">Karabiner Elements<\/a> to do this, but once you have you can then use another tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/folivora.ai\/\">Better Touch Tool<\/a> to map Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Option-&lt;some-key> to do things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly have a whole keyboard of new shortcuts open up to you with Hyper-Something!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I set about mapping Hyper-&lt;key> to applications so that I could go straight to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hyper-F opens Firefox<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hyper-P opens PHPStorm<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hyper-W opens Wavebox<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hyper-I opens iTerm<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>and so on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Direct access to apps. Sweet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I loved this approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even Hyper Keys are a bit limited. I know I&#8217;ll sound selfish, but I wanted MORE!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stream Deck<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So I tried out Elgato&#8217;s Stream Deck.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First as an app on my phone. This has a small subscription cost, but is a good way to try out the principle of a custom keypad without investing in the reasonably expensive hardware.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It worked REALLY nicely. So, as a treat to myself when I got my new job last year, I bought a proper Stream Deak (the 15-key version) in a sale. And it works really great. Go straight to any app without typing, remembering keyboard shortcuts, or multiple alt-tabs. It keeps me focussed on what I want to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a certain amount of remembering to use the Stream Deck at first. Alt-tab is STRONG in my muscle-memory! But it&#8217;s physical presence actually helps, drawing me back to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with different pages of buttons I have a setup for when I&#8217;m on a call, for when I&#8217;m in my code editor, and shortcuts for opening websites and GitHub repos. It&#8217;s a great tool. Elgato&#8217;s software is pretty terrible (come on folks, do better!!), but this is also a recommended for going straight to apps without passing Go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with Stream Deck is&#8230; you need your Stream Deck. I don&#8217;t have it when I&#8217;m not in my office. And I&#8217;m not paying for the app if I also have the hardware. Annoying!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I still like the Hyper-Key approach too. Even though it is a bit clumsy to set up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">R-Cmd<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To finish off this journey then, one day I saw <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/rcmd-app-switcher\/id1596283165?mt=12\">R-Cmd<\/a>&#8230; a really simple MacApp that says &#8220;Hey, stuff caps-lock, it&#8217;s the Right-Cmd key that you don&#8217;t need&#8221; (really, you don&#8217;t) &#8220;so here&#8217;s a really simple app that lets you set Right-Cmd-&lt;key> as a key to open an app.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my Hyper-key setup, but SO much easier and with one app controlling it. Sure, it&#8217;s not as configurable, but I LOVE this way of doing things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Am I completely, over-the-top obsessed with avoiding my mouse and pressing too many keys? YES! Unashamedly. For something I literally do hundreds of times a day, the ergonomics and minimalism in this are great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, finally, finally&#8230; if you want to take this to the next level then you need to read &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/tighten.com\/blog\/how-to-train-your-keyboard\/\">How to Train Your Keyboard<\/a>&#8221; (which also has <a href=\"https:\/\/twentypercent.fm\/episodes\/andrew-morgan-train-your-keyboard\">an accompanying podcast episode<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now go, be productive and ditch YOUR mouse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

Here&#8217;s my thoughts on the idea of selling it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Too many independent software projects are being bought up. I&#8217;m determined for it to stay indie &#8211; for now at least!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I enjoy making it and I learn from making it. Perhaps a buyer would pay me to keep working on it? Or I could just find another project. But it&#8217;s my little hobby thing for now.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It&#8217;s definitely a thing that I make, in part at least, for myself to use! I <em>literally<\/em> use it <em>all<\/em> the time. I used it to log in to this site and start writing this post. I don&#8217;t want someone else to own the roadmap. I know what <em>I<\/em> want it to be. I don&#8217;t want it to be a lead generator or a nice add-on business to something much bigger. I want it to be a useful tool for WordPress users.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>There&#8217;s a really nice group of dedicated customers (THANK YOU!) who love the product. I like being able to serve them personally.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It&#8217;s not (yet) in a state where I think it&#8217;s worth someone buying from me! It has lots of potential, but I want to realise more of that by myself before I would consider it something that is sellable. So I won&#8217;t rule it out in the future. But the buyer would have to promise to keep it what it is.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be benefits to it having a bigger owner. Development might be faster. Support too (but support requests are SO rare).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m honestly flattered by the offers. Maybe one day it will make sense to sell it? But for now it&#8217;s staying with me. I hope that&#8217;s OK.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If people want to keep making me offers, I&#8217;m totally happy to receive them. It&#8217;s a very lovely and encouraging thing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if customers think I <em>should<\/em> sell it, let me know. I&#8217;d be keen to hear what you think.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>One of the reasons I keep on with <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a> is that I&#8217;ve had some <em>major<\/em> validation of the idea in the form of investment offers and even &#8211; no, I can&#8217;t believe it either &#8211; offers to buy it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been really encouraged by these offers. Here&#8217;s my thoughts on the idea of selling it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Too many independent software projects are being bought up. I&#8217;m determined for it to stay indie &#8211; for now at least!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I enjoy making it and I learn from making it. Perhaps a buyer would pay me to keep working on it? Or I could just find another project. But it&#8217;s my little hobby thing for now.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It&#8217;s definitely a thing that I make, in part at least, for myself to use! I <em>literally<\/em> use it <em>all<\/em> the time. I used it to log in to this site and start writing this post. I don&#8217;t want someone else to own the roadmap. I know what <em>I<\/em> want it to be. I don&#8217;t want it to be a lead generator or a nice add-on business to something much bigger. I want it to be a useful tool for WordPress users.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>There&#8217;s a really nice group of dedicated customers (THANK YOU!) who love the product. I like being able to serve them personally.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It&#8217;s not (yet) in a state where I think it&#8217;s worth someone buying from me! It has lots of potential, but I want to realise more of that by myself before I would consider it something that is sellable. So I won&#8217;t rule it out in the future. But the buyer would have to promise to keep it what it is.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be benefits to it having a bigger owner. Development might be faster. Support too (but support requests are SO rare).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m honestly flattered by the offers. Maybe one day it will make sense to sell it? But for now it&#8217;s staying with me. I hope that&#8217;s OK.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If people want to keep making me offers, I&#8217;m totally happy to receive them. It&#8217;s a very lovely and encouraging thing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if customers think I <em>should<\/em> sell it, let me know. I&#8217;d be keen to hear what you think.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>So Elon bought Twitter. And lots of people are attempting to take their social presence elsewhere. Which is a good idea. But to me seems futile, in the short term at least.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I would genuinely love to see a move towards a more open technology based on common protocols and where people own their own information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love <a href=\"https:\/\/micro.blog\/\">Micro.blog<\/a> (which is often the answer when people propose &#8220;can&#8217;t we just aggregate RSS feeds somehow?&#8221;). I&#8217;m sometimes <a href=\"https:\/\/micro.blog\/ross\">over there<\/a> for starters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve tried Mastodon several times as <a href=\"https:\/\/fosstodon.org\/ross\">@ross@fosstodon.org<\/a> (previously <a href=\"https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@magicroundabout\">@magicroundabout@mastodon.social<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I recently found the fun-looking collection of tools over at <a href=\"https:\/\/omg.lol\/\">omg.lol<\/a> where I signed up as <a href=\"https:\/\/rw.omg.lol\/\">rw.omg.lol<\/a> with a &#8220;status log&#8221; at <a href=\"https:\/\/omg.lol\/@rw\">omg.lol\/@rw<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we\u2019ve seen this attempted exodus to the promised land many times before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without a proper mass migration of people and organisations to another service, it doesn\u2019t stick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You end up with people cross posting to multiple services to reach all the people that they want to reach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then as a reader I\u2019m checking multiple services and seeing the same things. The signal\/noise ratio goes down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And most people get fed up and end up back where they were before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes huge discipline and sacrifice by a large number of people simultaneously to have the right effect.&nbsp;This is hard to achieve. I&nbsp;don\u2019t&nbsp;understand how a mass migration to not-Twitter happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(I&#8217;m aware that the use of &#8220;sacrifice&#8221; here may seem odd, but for all their flaws, the big social networks have real, genuine value for people, so you do often give something up when you move somewhere quieter. You could, however, replace &#8220;discipline and sacrifice&#8221; with &#8220;not-giving-a-crappery&#8221; if you want to.&nbsp;That\u2019s&nbsp;definitely also an option for how to leave. To simply not care.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people are flocking to Mastodon. My personal issue with Mastodon specifically is that I feel like&nbsp;I\u2019m&nbsp;either putting my social presence in the hands of a total stranger with an unknown business model and no clue as to the service\u2019s sustainability.&nbsp;Or I have the pain and cost of running\/managing my own server.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I don&#8217;t mind paying a little for a social presence that has value, but Mastodon simply hasn&#8217;t had that for me yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I prefer the <a href=\"https:\/\/micro.blog\/\">micro.blog<\/a> model. It\u2019s been around for a while and <a href=\"https:\/\/micro.blog\/manton\">Manton<\/a> seems to have built a sustainable indie platform. You can bring your own \u201cCMS\u201d and he does the following\/feed\/comment bits. Or you can use the very simple posting\/blogging system that he&#8217;s built for a small fee.&nbsp;It\u2019s&nbsp;all based on open&nbsp;standards and <a href=\"https:\/\/indieweb.org\/\">indieweb<\/a>&nbsp;protocols, but it has the simplicity of setup that an everyday internet user needs to get started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not saying I wouldn\u2019t love a mass migration to happen.&nbsp;I\u2019ve just seen so many attempts now and none seem to have been particularly successful, and I don&#8217;t see why this one would either.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a big change to happen, I think either the platform has to spontaneously combust itself or it falls out of fashion by a long period of attrition and fades from the public consciousness over time. Facebook may even be at the start of this. Time will tell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps, one day, we will look back and remember that thing we all used called Twitter the same way we remember Geocities and MySpace. But I struggle to see how that will be next week or next month. It will be in many years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These occasional reconnaissance missions are good. I&#8217;m respectful of them. And grateful for them. They will eventually lead the charge away. So do look around. See if you feel at home elsewhere. And look me up elsewhere in the coming weeks too. The more of you that are elsewhere, the less I will think that I still need the big networks.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>So Elon bought Twitter. And lots of people are attempting to take their social presence elsewhere. Which is a good idea. But to me seems futile, in the short term at least.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I would genuinely love to see a move towards a more open technology based on common protocols and where people own their own information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love <a href=\"https:\/\/micro.blog\/\">Micro.blog<\/a> (which is often the answer when people propose &#8220;can&#8217;t we just aggregate RSS feeds somehow?&#8221;). I&#8217;m sometimes <a href=\"https:\/\/micro.blog\/ross\">over there<\/a> for starters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve tried Mastodon several times as <a href=\"https:\/\/fosstodon.org\/ross\">@ross@fosstodon.org<\/a> (previously <a href=\"https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@magicroundabout\">@magicroundabout@mastodon.social<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I recently found the fun-looking collection of tools over at <a href=\"https:\/\/omg.lol\/\">omg.lol<\/a> where I signed up as <a href=\"https:\/\/rw.omg.lol\/\">rw.omg.lol<\/a> with a &#8220;status log&#8221; at <a href=\"https:\/\/omg.lol\/@rw\">omg.lol\/@rw<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we\u2019ve seen this attempted exodus to the promised land many times before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without a proper mass migration of people and organisations to another service, it doesn\u2019t stick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You end up with people cross posting to multiple services to reach all the people that they want to reach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then as a reader I\u2019m checking multiple services and seeing the same things. The signal\/noise ratio goes down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And most people get fed up and end up back where they were before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes huge discipline and sacrifice by a large number of people simultaneously to have the right effect.&nbsp;This is hard to achieve. I&nbsp;don\u2019t&nbsp;understand how a mass migration to not-Twitter happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(I&#8217;m aware that the use of &#8220;sacrifice&#8221; here may seem odd, but for all their flaws, the big social networks have real, genuine value for people, so you do often give something up when you move somewhere quieter. You could, however, replace &#8220;discipline and sacrifice&#8221; with &#8220;not-giving-a-crappery&#8221; if you want to.&nbsp;That\u2019s&nbsp;definitely also an option for how to leave. To simply not care.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people are flocking to Mastodon. My personal issue with Mastodon specifically is that I feel like&nbsp;I\u2019m&nbsp;either putting my social presence in the hands of a total stranger with an unknown business model and no clue as to the service\u2019s sustainability.&nbsp;Or I have the pain and cost of running\/managing my own server.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I don&#8217;t mind paying a little for a social presence that has value, but Mastodon simply hasn&#8217;t had that for me yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I prefer the <a href=\"https:\/\/micro.blog\/\">micro.blog<\/a> model. It\u2019s been around for a while and <a href=\"https:\/\/micro.blog\/manton\">Manton<\/a> seems to have built a sustainable indie platform. You can bring your own \u201cCMS\u201d and he does the following\/feed\/comment bits. Or you can use the very simple posting\/blogging system that he&#8217;s built for a small fee.&nbsp;It\u2019s&nbsp;all based on open&nbsp;standards and <a href=\"https:\/\/indieweb.org\/\">indieweb<\/a>&nbsp;protocols, but it has the simplicity of setup that an everyday internet user needs to get started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not saying I wouldn\u2019t love a mass migration to happen.&nbsp;I\u2019ve just seen so many attempts now and none seem to have been particularly successful, and I don&#8217;t see why this one would either.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a big change to happen, I think either the platform has to spontaneously combust itself or it falls out of fashion by a long period of attrition and fades from the public consciousness over time. Facebook may even be at the start of this. Time will tell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps, one day, we will look back and remember that thing we all used called Twitter the same way we remember Geocities and MySpace. But I struggle to see how that will be next week or next month. It will be in many years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These occasional reconnaissance missions are good. I&#8217;m respectful of them. And grateful for them. They will eventually lead the charge away. So do look around. See if you feel at home elsewhere. And look me up elsewhere in the coming weeks too. The more of you that are elsewhere, the less I will think that I still need the big networks.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been on Mastodon for a little longer that most, and I&#8217;ve taken some time to look into how it works. So I&#8217;m a little ahead of the curve. And lots of people are asking questions about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a ton of posts about it. But perhaps you trust me more than other random strangers? Here&#8217;s my take.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My thing is: You don&#8217;t have to move to it. You can stay on Twitter (though there are MANY good reasons not to right now). You can also move to other places like Tumblr. Or stay on Instagram or Facebook. You really don&#8217;t have to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you probably want to make an informed choice. So here&#8217;s my general info.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, Mastodon is quite a lot like Twitter, but it also has a lot of differences<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mastodon has different &#8220;servers&#8221; (sometimes called &#8220;instances&#8221;). Each server is like a little self-contained mini-Twitter. BUT, servers can talk to each other. You will hear this called &#8220;federation&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some people say it&#8217;s &#8220;like email&#8221; because if you have GMail you can send and receive messages to someone with Outlook. And it IS like that, but there are other things about the server that you are on that are important.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>So if you sign up for an account on, say, <a href=\"https:\/\/mastodon.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mastodon.social<\/a> (which I wouldn&#8217;t recommend because it&#8217;s overloaded), you can see posts by me on the server that I&#8217;m on: <a href=\"https:\/\/fosstodon.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fosstodon.org<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Each server has its own rules (these are on the &#8220;about&#8221; page for the server). So check these out before you join. My server, for example, forbids a thing called &#8220;s**tposting&#8221; and &#8220;spam&#8221;. Generally these rules are A Good Thing(TM).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You also get to see a &#8220;local feed&#8221; from your own server. So if you&#8217;re into, say, bollards, and you joins the <a href=\"https:\/\/bollards.lol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bollards.lol<\/a> server then your local feed will be full of people talking about bollards. This may or may not be of interest to you. (Other servers are available.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can move servers. But not, like, every day. And there are limitations to it. Like, your posts don&#8217;t move with you, but your followers do.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mastodon has the appearance of being &#8220;free as in beer&#8221;. But it is costing someone &#8211; the person running the server &#8211; money to run it and time to moderate it. So please, please, PLEASE consider sending your server admins a few \u00a3s to support them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>There&#8217;s no ads or algorithms. &#8220;Likes&#8221; don&#8217;t influence who sees something. There&#8217;s no &#8220;Look! Here&#8217;s a post from someone that someone you follow follows liked.&#8221; Or &#8220;Here&#8217;s a random video of a bollard that you&#8217;re seeing just, because, well, Bollards are cool right now.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I will take further questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But not about bollards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry if you love bollards.<\/p>\n",

And lots of people are asking questions about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a ton of posts about it. But perhaps you trust me more than other random strangers? Here&#8217;s my take.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My thing is: You don&#8217;t have to move to it. You can stay on Twitter (though there are MANY good reasons not to right now). You can also move to other places like Tumblr. Or stay on Instagram or Facebook. You really don&#8217;t have to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you probably want to make an informed choice. So here&#8217;s my general info.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, Mastodon is quite a lot like Twitter, but it also has a lot of differences<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mastodon has different &#8220;servers&#8221; (sometimes called &#8220;instances&#8221;). Each server is like a little self-contained mini-Twitter. BUT, servers can talk to each other. You will hear this called &#8220;federation&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some people say it&#8217;s &#8220;like email&#8221; because if you have GMail you can send and receive messages to someone with Outlook. And it IS like that, but there are other things about the server that you are on that are important.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>So if you sign up for an account on, say, <a href=\"https:\/\/mastodon.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mastodon.social<\/a> (which I wouldn&#8217;t recommend because it&#8217;s overloaded), you can see posts by me on the server that I&#8217;m on: <a href=\"https:\/\/fosstodon.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fosstodon.org<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Each server has its own rules (these are on the &#8220;about&#8221; page for the server). So check these out before you join. My server, for example, forbids a thing called &#8220;s**tposting&#8221; and &#8220;spam&#8221;. Generally these rules are A Good Thing(TM).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You also get to see a &#8220;local feed&#8221; from your own server. So if you&#8217;re into, say, bollards, and you joins the <a href=\"https:\/\/bollards.lol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bollards.lol<\/a> server then your local feed will be full of people talking about bollards. This may or may not be of interest to you. (Other servers are available.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can move servers. But not, like, every day. And there are limitations to it. Like, your posts don&#8217;t move with you, but your followers do.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mastodon has the appearance of being &#8220;free as in beer&#8221;. But it is costing someone &#8211; the person running the server &#8211; money to run it and time to moderate it. So please, please, PLEASE consider sending your server admins a few \u00a3s to support them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>There&#8217;s no ads or algorithms. &#8220;Likes&#8221; don&#8217;t influence who sees something. There&#8217;s no &#8220;Look! Here&#8217;s a post from someone that someone you follow follows liked.&#8221; Or &#8220;Here&#8217;s a random video of a bollard that you&#8217;re seeing just, because, well, Bollards are cool right now.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I will take further questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But not about bollards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry if you love bollards.<\/p>\n",

And early on I suggested that &#8220;WordlePress&#8221; should be a thing. So I made something that may fit the name. Here&#8217;s how it works:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress core has over 900 global PHP functions with four underscore-separated &#8220;parts&#8221;, such as `wp_get_attachment_image`. This is a &#8220;function&#8221;, and each of the parts is a &#8220;word&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Aim of the game<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each day (changing at midnight UTC) WordlePress selects a new 4-part function for you to guess. You need to guess all 4 &#8220;words&#8221; correctly to win.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also the option to guess a randomly picked function name from the list to practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you win, or give up, the answer is shown and the documentation for the function is linked. So this is an educational tool too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The function list is from (I think) WordPress 5.9, released in January 2022. If it helps this is just after the first beta of the full-site editing feature was added to core.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to play<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter your word guesses in the four input boxes and click &#8220;Guess&#8221;. The result boxes will tell you how many of them are correct:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A green box means you got the right word in the right position<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>An orange box means you got a word that is in the function, but it&#8217;s in the wrong position<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim is to get all four result boxes to green!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Words and suggestions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\">The game<\/a> helps you by only allowing words from the list of functions to be entered. There are 695 valid words and the game shows you how many you have not guessed with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To further help you, there is a &#8220;Suggest&#8221; button. This will choose random words from the unused words list for you and put them in the input boxes. If you have correctly guessed a word this is kept in the correct place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will notice that the input boxes sometimes have coloured highlights:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Red: You tried this word before and it&#8217;s not in the function<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Orange: You tried this word before and it&#8217;s in the function, but you didn&#8217;t get the right place<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Green: You&#8217;ve found this word in the correct place<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The game saves your progress across reloads but does not keep any player stats yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Limitations\/roadmap<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, no, I&#8217;m not a designer. The game works but the UI needs improvement. I&#8217;m well aware of that. But it&#8217;s still perfectly playable for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve hacked this together fairly quickly (it&#8217;s not my finest code!) and some of the interaction is quite complex so I&#8217;m making not claims about the accessibility of this game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve had a request to add a color-blind-friendly mode, and that will probably come soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d love to add some player stats and an option to share your result to social media.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Technology<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This game is built on a single HTML page (with some JS files loaded too) using vanilla CSS and a combination of vanilla JavaScript and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alpinejs.dev\/\">AlpineJS<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s hosted on Netlify.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been hacked together quickly so is not my finest code and needs some refactoring!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested I previously <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/03\/wordlepress-and-nerding-out-about-wordpress-function-names\/\">wrote some stuff about how I made this<\/a> with some &#8220;interesting&#8221; stats on WordPress function names.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contact\/suggestions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have feedback or suggestions then please drop me a line &#8211; probably on social media. You can find all my details at <a href=\"https:\/\/rw.omg.lol\/\">https:\/\/rw.omg.lol\/<\/a>. Just bear in mind this is a fun side-project, don&#8217;t expect first-class support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for playing! I hope you have fun and learn something.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Announcing (or re-announcing) <a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/\">WordlePress<\/a>: a silly function-name guessing game for WordPress developers (and anyone else stupid enough to try).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This post serves as the help page\/instructions for WordlePress until I get some proper help up on the actual WordlePress site.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year, the daily Wordle puzzle was all the rage. And early on I suggested that &#8220;WordlePress&#8221; should be a thing. So I made something that may fit the name. Here&#8217;s how it works:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress core has over 900 global PHP functions with four underscore-separated &#8220;parts&#8221;, such as `wp_get_attachment_image`. This is a &#8220;function&#8221;, and each of the parts is a &#8220;word&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Aim of the game<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each day (changing at midnight UTC) WordlePress selects a new 4-part function for you to guess. You need to guess all 4 &#8220;words&#8221; correctly to win.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also the option to guess a randomly picked function name from the list to practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you win, or give up, the answer is shown and the documentation for the function is linked. So this is an educational tool too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The function list is from (I think) WordPress 5.9, released in January 2022. If it helps this is just after the first beta of the full-site editing feature was added to core.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to play<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter your word guesses in the four input boxes and click &#8220;Guess&#8221;. The result boxes will tell you how many of them are correct:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A green box means you got the right word in the right position<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>An orange box means you got a word that is in the function, but it&#8217;s in the wrong position<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim is to get all four result boxes to green!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Words and suggestions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\">The game<\/a> helps you by only allowing words from the list of functions to be entered. There are 695 valid words and the game shows you how many you have not guessed with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To further help you, there is a &#8220;Suggest&#8221; button. This will choose random words from the unused words list for you and put them in the input boxes. If you have correctly guessed a word this is kept in the correct place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will notice that the input boxes sometimes have coloured highlights:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Red: You tried this word before and it&#8217;s not in the function<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Orange: You tried this word before and it&#8217;s in the function, but you didn&#8217;t get the right place<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Green: You&#8217;ve found this word in the correct place<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The game saves your progress across reloads but does not keep any player stats yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Limitations\/roadmap<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, no, I&#8217;m not a designer. The game works but the UI needs improvement. I&#8217;m well aware of that. But it&#8217;s still perfectly playable for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve hacked this together fairly quickly (it&#8217;s not my finest code!) and some of the interaction is quite complex so I&#8217;m making not claims about the accessibility of this game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve had a request to add a color-blind-friendly mode, and that will probably come soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d love to add some player stats and an option to share your result to social media.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Technology<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This game is built on a single HTML page (with some JS files loaded too) using vanilla CSS and a combination of vanilla JavaScript and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alpinejs.dev\/\">AlpineJS<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s hosted on Netlify.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been hacked together quickly so is not my finest code and needs some refactoring!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested I previously <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/03\/wordlepress-and-nerding-out-about-wordpress-function-names\/\">wrote some stuff about how I made this<\/a> with some &#8220;interesting&#8221; stats on WordPress function names.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contact\/suggestions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have feedback or suggestions then please drop me a line &#8211; probably on social media. You can find all my details at <a href=\"https:\/\/rw.omg.lol\/\">https:\/\/rw.omg.lol\/<\/a>. Just bear in mind this is a fun side-project, don&#8217;t expect first-class support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for playing! I hope you have fun and learn something.<\/p>\n",

The lack of investment sucks. The rich getting richer sucks. People need good jobs that pay well. Get what you deserve!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for ministers saying &#8220;we can&#8217;t raise taxes when people are struggling&#8221;: you absolutely can &#8211; tax the people who AREN&#8217;T struggling. Tax the millionaires and billionaires. Tax the corporations making massive profits. There are options here. Do it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might say: &#8220;But Ross, aren&#8217;t you doing OK? You have a good IT job and stuff. What if they come and tax you?&#8221; And I reply: &#8220;Yes! I&#8217;m VERY fortunate and privileged. And I&#8217;d actually CELEBRATE being able to pay more tax if I knew it was going to front-line workers and not into the grimy hands of already-rich people who milk off the state with their corrupt business schemes.&#8221; ?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a whole thing about how we talk about tax. That tax is bad because it takes from us. We need to turn that around. Being able to pay a lot of tax is a privilege. I get to GIVE from what I earn to pay for OUR nurses, OUR teachers, OUR bin collectors.

Tax the millionaires and billionaires. Tax the corporations making massive profits. There are options here. Do it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might say: &#8220;But Ross, aren&#8217;t you doing OK? You have a good IT job and stuff. What if they come and tax you?&#8221; And I reply: &#8220;Yes! I&#8217;m VERY fortunate and privileged. And I&#8217;d actually CELEBRATE being able to pay more tax if I knew it was going to front-line workers and not into the grimy hands of already-rich people who milk off the state with their corrupt business schemes.&#8221; ?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a whole thing about how we talk about tax. That tax is bad because it takes from us. We need to turn that around. Being able to pay a lot of tax is a privilege. I get to GIVE from what I earn to pay for OUR nurses, OUR teachers, OUR bin collectors. Let&#8217;s make that GOOD!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1603321062367764481\/analytics\"><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1603321062367764481\/analytics\"><\/a><\/p>\n",
