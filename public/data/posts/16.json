And at home, when I\u2019m outside, I\u2019m usually gardening, cycling, walking or doing something else with purpose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this all means that I rarely get to be barefoot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will probably sound like a really odd thing, but I REALLY liked walking around barefoot on the grass and (this will surprise some but&#8230;) the beach on holiday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like things that connect me to the earth. Cycling and gardening means I have to pay attention to weather. Gardening and growing food also puts you very much in touch with the seasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like cooking (even though Sally does most of it) and baking. \u00a0I like the processes of brewing tea and filter coffee. I like the slowness of making sourdough bread which is a thing which, when starter and dough, feels very much \u201calive\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Computers and the internet are great, brilliant, amazing things. But there\u2019s something special about just feeling the grass beneath your feet.<\/p>\n",

And at home, when I\u2019m outside, I\u2019m usually gardening, cycling, walking or doing something else with purpose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this all means that I rarely get to be barefoot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will probably sound like a really odd thing, but I REALLY liked walking around barefoot on the grass and (this will surprise some but&#8230;) the beach on holiday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like things that connect me to the earth. Cycling and gardening means I have to pay attention to weather. Gardening and growing food also puts you very much in touch with the seasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like cooking (even though Sally does most of it) and baking. \u00a0I like the processes of brewing tea and filter coffee. I like the slowness of making sourdough bread which is a thing which, when starter and dough, feels very much \u201calive\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Computers and the internet are great, brilliant, amazing things. But there\u2019s something special about just feeling the grass beneath your feet.<\/p>\n",

This also involved a highly complex import of existing content scraped from <a href=\"http:\/\/archive.shipoffools.com\/mystery\/index.html\">hundreds of HTML files<\/a>. I also themed <a href=\"https:\/\/vanillaforums.com\/en\/software\/\">Vanilla Forums<\/a> for <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.shipoffools.com\/\">this project\u2019s community side<\/a>, and advised on GDPR, SEO and a bunch of other things.<\/li>\n<li>I\u2019m working on phase&#8230;err&#8230;7 perhaps (?) of a custom Laravel-based food ordering system that uses some hefty amount of <a href=\"https:\/\/vuejs.org\/\">Vue.js<\/a> and a big bunch of custom logic.<\/li>\n<li>I\u2019m about to launch a site for a Devon-based charity that\u2019s a simple <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elegantthemes.com\/gallery\/divi\/\">Divi-based<\/a> WordPress brochure site. But I\u2019m excited because, effectively, I was the visual designer on this and it ACTUALLY LOOKS REALLY NICE!! (Or so I think)<\/li>\n<li>I have two other small Divi-based sites on the go for local organisations\/people. One involves some clever data manipulation and image migration\/import work.<\/li>\n<li>I have a WordPress plugin extension to write to enable custom postcode lookup functionality on a <a href=\"https:\/\/ninjaforms.com\/\">Ninja Form<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>I\u2019m providing ad-hoc support to a number of clients &#8211; mostly WordPress stuff, but sometimes diving into UX, hosting, security, site migrations, domains and DNS, email deliverability, and general IT support.<\/li>\n<li>I\u2019m trying to get an important client email out about the new \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/gutenberg\/\">Gutenberg<\/a>\u201d editor in WordPress (amongst other things) which needs me to edit a screencast video first.<\/li>\n<li>In my spare time I\u2019m building SchoolBot and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/about-kownter\/\">Kownter<\/a> as side projects (amongst other things that have fallen by the wayside), and trying to keep my \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/\">Press Ups<\/a>\u201d video tutorials going too. Oh and there\u2019s (hugely unexciting secret WordPress project) happening too.<\/li>\n<li>Fielding whatever support, hosting, minor changes and prospective client queries come in on a day-to-day basis.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So there we go&#8230;keeps me busy with family and household stuff around too!<\/p>\n",

And I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve done one specific combination of three of them. But never more than that.<\/p>\n<p>And I needed at least four of them. And the GDPR fields in MailChimp are new and, well, let&#8217;s say they seem to have been shoe-horned in in a bit of a hurry.<\/p>\n<p>Now&#8230;let&#8217;s go down the rabbit hole&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Bloom integrates with regular MailChimp, but won&#8217;t let you use groups.\u00a0 To do that you need to use a &#8220;custom HTML form&#8221; in the Bloom opt-in which you copy and paste from MailChimp&#8217;s embedded forms section.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with that is that in a pop-up (we have a good case for using a pop-up, it&#8217;s OK!) is that the GDPR text and fields make the form really long and it won&#8217;t fit nicely on a smaller screen.<\/p>\n<p>So I tried reducing the form to just an email input and a button, and then sending that input to a WPForms form using a URL parameter to autocomplete the email field on the &#8220;full&#8221; form. Great! That works really nicely.<\/p>\n<p>Only&#8230;WPForms doesn&#8217;t send the GDPR opt-in fields. Rats! I assume Gravity Forms won&#8217;t do this either.<\/p>\n<p>So maybe, rather than linking the Bloom opt-in to an on-site form, I&#8217;ll link it to an off-site form. That will work!<\/p>\n<p>Only, I want the subscriber to sign up to a specific group, and it turns out that <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/help\/automatically-add-subscribers-to-a-group-at-signup\/\">you sort-of can&#8217;t have a pre-selected group on MailChimps own, hosted forms<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So what am I left with? Taking a MailChimp embedded form, sticking it in a WordPress page, editing the HTML of the form to make the required group pre-selected and hiding the group selection from the user and linking my Bloom pop-up to that page.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s pretty gross. But it does work.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m hoping that at some point MailChimp&#8217;s API will work nicer with the GDPR fields. It seems to have the ability to send &#8220;marketing_permissions&#8221; with a new subscriber, but it&#8217;s not clear how you get the ID&#8217;s needed to send. When this does work nicely, hopefully WPForms or Bloom or Gravity Forms will integrate with it and let me do this properly.<\/p>\n<p>For now&#8230;making a simple form requires a humongous kludge.<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to the internet, everybody!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h3>Because some things on the internet are inexplicably hard to do<\/h3>\n<p>Gosh, what a frustrating afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>This is a case of knowing the individual parts of a task pretty well, but not having put all the parts together in this particular way before.<\/p>\n<p>Today I needed\/wanted to create a simple email sign-up\/opt-in form with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The excellent Elegant Themes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elegantthemes.com\/plugins\/bloom\/\">Bloom email sign-up plugin<\/a>\u00a0(though it could have been pretty much any email sign-up plugin)<\/li>\n<li>A regular MailChimp List<\/li>\n<li>MailChimp groups<\/li>\n<li>MailChimp&#8217;s new GDPR fields<\/li>\n<li>and when I got stuck, <a href=\"http:\/\/wpforms.com\/\">WPForms<\/a> too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I reckon I&#8217;ve combined two of these things together in several different combinations. And I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve done one specific combination of three of them. But never more than that.<\/p>\n<p>And I needed at least four of them. And the GDPR fields in MailChimp are new and, well, let&#8217;s say they seem to have been shoe-horned in in a bit of a hurry.<\/p>\n<p>Now&#8230;let&#8217;s go down the rabbit hole&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Bloom integrates with regular MailChimp, but won&#8217;t let you use groups.\u00a0 To do that you need to use a &#8220;custom HTML form&#8221; in the Bloom opt-in which you copy and paste from MailChimp&#8217;s embedded forms section.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with that is that in a pop-up (we have a good case for using a pop-up, it&#8217;s OK!) is that the GDPR text and fields make the form really long and it won&#8217;t fit nicely on a smaller screen.<\/p>\n<p>So I tried reducing the form to just an email input and a button, and then sending that input to a WPForms form using a URL parameter to autocomplete the email field on the &#8220;full&#8221; form. Great! That works really nicely.<\/p>\n<p>Only&#8230;WPForms doesn&#8217;t send the GDPR opt-in fields. Rats! I assume Gravity Forms won&#8217;t do this either.<\/p>\n<p>So maybe, rather than linking the Bloom opt-in to an on-site form, I&#8217;ll link it to an off-site form. That will work!<\/p>\n<p>Only, I want the subscriber to sign up to a specific group, and it turns out that <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/help\/automatically-add-subscribers-to-a-group-at-signup\/\">you sort-of can&#8217;t have a pre-selected group on MailChimps own, hosted forms<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So what am I left with? Taking a MailChimp embedded form, sticking it in a WordPress page, editing the HTML of the form to make the required group pre-selected and hiding the group selection from the user and linking my Bloom pop-up to that page.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s pretty gross. But it does work.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m hoping that at some point MailChimp&#8217;s API will work nicer with the GDPR fields. It seems to have the ability to send &#8220;marketing_permissions&#8221; with a new subscriber, but it&#8217;s not clear how you get the ID&#8217;s needed to send. When this does work nicely, hopefully WPForms or Bloom or Gravity Forms will integrate with it and let me do this properly.<\/p>\n<p>For now&#8230;making a simple form requires a humongous kludge.<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to the internet, everybody!<\/p>\n",

So I guess I should write about what I do!<\/p>\n<p>Some of my bio\u2019s and \u201cAbout\u201d pages are a bit out of date &#8211; I must remedy that. For now, here\u2019s some of the things I\u2019m up to right now.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #23282d; font-size: 1.6em; font-weight: 600;\">Technology<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a software developer who happens to mostly build websites and web applications, because that\u2019s where I can make money making software on a freelance basis in the sector I want to work in. I\u2019d love to do more back-end, data processing, and general coding stuff really.<\/p>\n<p>I mostly develop with WordPress, but also use Laravel and \u00a0other PHP things. WordPress knowledge is pretty deep, and I do some highly technical projects with lots of data wrangling and custom user interface. But I also build small sites for small organisations using page builders.<\/p>\n<p>(Note to page-builder-haters: Yes, really I do! It\u2019s the pragmatic choice for smaller budgets.)<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m proficient in a whole load of the back-end web stack from how CPUs work, through language compilation and execution, right up to server operations and how HTTP works. Though some knowledge will be old and there are some holes in knowledge in some places&#8230;it\u2019s a broad field.<\/p>\n<p>I know JavaScript reasonably well but don\u2019t like it and struggle to see how you would build any significant back-end application with it &#8211; but I know people do! I\u2019ve been trying to #learnToLoveJS, but it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s not my kind of language at all.<\/p>\n<p>I prefer functional, declarative and typed languages. I prefer a language to tell me I got something wrong than to guess what I meant. But also, I never got to running JS as a process outside the browser, so I\u2019m still mostly using it for DOM manipulation in the browser, and stepping it up to doing node.js seems like a big jump to me.<\/p>\n<p>I have a MacBook and an iPhone, but these are tools and I\u2019m not wedded to either of them.<\/p>\n<h2>Work and business<\/h2>\n<p>I run my own company to do my software development, but I also work with groups of other freelancers on larger projects.<\/p>\n<p>Though highly technical, I love working with people and using technology to solve people\u2019s problems.<\/p>\n<p>I do some amount of user interface and user experience work, but I\u2019m not a visual designer and those kinds of \u00a0artistic flourishes are out-sourced.<\/p>\n<p>I care about my work and business a lot, but I\u2019m not set on growth. I have a good flow of work, mostly through recommendations and referrals. It\u2019s a mildly-profitable, bootstrapped business, not a hard-and-fast startup.<\/p>\n<h2>On the side<\/h2>\n<p>I sometimes learn new tech, or practice existing tech, by building small side projects. I have a few of these on the go at any one time. My current focusses are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/about-kownter\/\">Kownter<\/a>: Simple, self-hosted, privacy aware analytics<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/08\/about-schoolbot\/\">SchoolBot<\/a>: a parent information system that started as a chatbot, but will hopefully become more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Life<\/h2>\n<p>I have a wife and two small children; I work flexibly to look after the kids and life mostly revolves around them. I love to cycle &#8211; though I\u2019m mostly just commuting at the moment. We have a large-ish garden that we try to grow stuff in, and we are part of a small local church.<\/p>\n<p>Its a pretty busy life. More on the specifics soon!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>The other day <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/08\/what-i-do\/\">I wrote about writing about what I do<\/a>. So I guess I should write about what I do!<\/p>\n<p>Some of my bio\u2019s and \u201cAbout\u201d pages are a bit out of date &#8211; I must remedy that. For now, here\u2019s some of the things I\u2019m up to right now.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #23282d; font-size: 1.6em; font-weight: 600;\">Technology<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a software developer who happens to mostly build websites and web applications, because that\u2019s where I can make money making software on a freelance basis in the sector I want to work in. I\u2019d love to do more back-end, data processing, and general coding stuff really.<\/p>\n<p>I mostly develop with WordPress, but also use Laravel and \u00a0other PHP things. WordPress knowledge is pretty deep, and I do some highly technical projects with lots of data wrangling and custom user interface. But I also build small sites for small organisations using page builders.<\/p>\n<p>(Note to page-builder-haters: Yes, really I do! It\u2019s the pragmatic choice for smaller budgets.)<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m proficient in a whole load of the back-end web stack from how CPUs work, through language compilation and execution, right up to server operations and how HTTP works. Though some knowledge will be old and there are some holes in knowledge in some places&#8230;it\u2019s a broad field.<\/p>\n<p>I know JavaScript reasonably well but don\u2019t like it and struggle to see how you would build any significant back-end application with it &#8211; but I know people do! I\u2019ve been trying to #learnToLoveJS, but it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s not my kind of language at all.<\/p>\n<p>I prefer functional, declarative and typed languages. I prefer a language to tell me I got something wrong than to guess what I meant. But also, I never got to running JS as a process outside the browser, so I\u2019m still mostly using it for DOM manipulation in the browser, and stepping it up to doing node.js seems like a big jump to me.<\/p>\n<p>I have a MacBook and an iPhone, but these are tools and I\u2019m not wedded to either of them.<\/p>\n<h2>Work and business<\/h2>\n<p>I run my own company to do my software development, but I also work with groups of other freelancers on larger projects.<\/p>\n<p>Though highly technical, I love working with people and using technology to solve people\u2019s problems.<\/p>\n<p>I do some amount of user interface and user experience work, but I\u2019m not a visual designer and those kinds of \u00a0artistic flourishes are out-sourced.<\/p>\n<p>I care about my work and business a lot, but I\u2019m not set on growth. I have a good flow of work, mostly through recommendations and referrals. It\u2019s a mildly-profitable, bootstrapped business, not a hard-and-fast startup.<\/p>\n<h2>On the side<\/h2>\n<p>I sometimes learn new tech, or practice existing tech, by building small side projects. I have a few of these on the go at any one time. My current focusses are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/about-kownter\/\">Kownter<\/a>: Simple, self-hosted, privacy aware analytics<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/08\/about-schoolbot\/\">SchoolBot<\/a>: a parent information system that started as a chatbot, but will hopefully become more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Life<\/h2>\n<p>I have a wife and two small children; I work flexibly to look after the kids and life mostly revolves around them. I love to cycle &#8211; though I\u2019m mostly just commuting at the moment. We have a large-ish garden that we try to grow stuff in, and we are part of a small local church.<\/p>\n<p>Its a pretty busy life. More on the specifics soon!<\/p>\n",

And I find a lot of it hard to consume because of the realities of living with small children around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some things that are hard to do when you have small children and are relatively dedicated to helping bring them up:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Wake when your body wants to, or at a correct point in the sleep cycle for waking up nicely<\/li><li>Get a full, uninterrupted night\u2019s sleep<\/li><li>Adopt a consistent morning routine<\/li><li>Adopt a consistent evening routine<\/li><li>Work from home without interruption (unless you have a dedicated space, which even then <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/m3ktsl6_Rpg\">can be invaded<\/a>!)<\/li><li>Have a relaxing holiday<\/li><li>Meditate, pray or do exercise in the home on a regular basis and without a child coming along and asking \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d or \u201cMe have a go?\u201d, jumping on you, pushing you over, making you laugh or otherwise getting in the way<\/li><li>Binge watch anything, or commit to watching anything on TV on a regular basis that isn\u2019t Hey Duggee or The Octonauts<\/li><li>Plan your life to anything like a daily or sub-daily level for any great length of time<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, some of these things can be hugely joyful. Having a 2.5 year old try to join in your yoga or exercise is hilarious. \u00a0And I <del>secretly<\/del> openly love Hey Duggee &#8211; it bright, colourful, happy, charming and so much better than loads of other stuff on TV.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yes, some other far-more-organised parents than I manage to do lots of these things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But gosh it\u2019s hard seeing what others are able to do, or recommend you do, to improve your life when you\u2019re so busy improving the lives of other little people that depend on you.<\/p>\n",

But it has been a revelation to me that it\u2019s possible for people to just breeze through life ignoring how that thing is made, or why that thing doesn\u2019t comply with the rules, or the fact that that apostrophe isn\u2019t in the right place, or what others might think of what they do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week I have been struggling with a company who do important legal and regulatory stuff for Oikos. I will not name names, and I will not list the catalogue of small errors that have beset the process. But I really do find myself wondering how you get into this kind of field without having a high level of attention to detail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, forgive me if I\u2019m a bit slow sometimes with my work. It sometimes means I\u2019m trying to do something right. Because I\u2019d rather be right than fast.<br\/><\/p>\n",

But it has been a revelation to me that it\u2019s possible for people to just breeze through life ignoring how that thing is made, or why that thing doesn\u2019t comply with the rules, or the fact that that apostrophe isn\u2019t in the right place, or what others might think of what they do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week I have been struggling with a company who do important legal and regulatory stuff for Oikos. I will not name names, and I will not list the catalogue of small errors that have beset the process. But I really do find myself wondering how you get into this kind of field without having a high level of attention to detail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, forgive me if I\u2019m a bit slow sometimes with my work. It sometimes means I\u2019m trying to do something right. Because I\u2019d rather be right than fast.<br\/><\/p>\n",

It\u2019s actually properly difficult to tell the difference between my young son\u2019s drawings and my own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do find some kinds of drawing fun. I tried to get into <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/category\/sketching\/\">sketching<\/a> for a while (and will have a go again sometime, I\u2019m sure).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, I took the boy to a cartoon-drawing workshop in a library.

And I kinda made a vow to not get involved in school communications. Mostly because the primary job of school staff is educating and caring for children to do, and they don\u2019t want some geeky parent turning up with bright ideas that will probably make their lives more complicated.  In short: I don\u2019t want to cause trouble.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like churches and councils and various other public organisations that do way more than just sell stuff, schools have difficult communications challenges.  They have lots of information about lots of different things, and any one person is only interested in a small amount of it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organising and presenting this information such that people can see what they need without the stuff that they don\u2019t need getting in the way is very difficult. And, while I have some ideas for improving it, I don\u2019t have ideas for fixing the whole problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m a parent now, and so getting the information that a parent needs for day-to-day schooling is what concerns me most.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting way in which I see parents trying to get the information they need is to collaborate. Parents\u2019 Facebook groups pop up, and parents ask each other questions in these groups, and with several hundred parents, answers can arrive quite quickly. This is great!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I\u2019m also a software developer, and so when I see the same problem appearing repeatedly and being solved repeatedly, my instinct is to make it more efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see questions that are frequently being asked, and people having to wait for answers, I wonder how we can get people the answers more efficiently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Surveying the landscape<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a school comms expert, so there&#8217;s probably lots missing here. But from what I can tell there are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Tools that send information to parents, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.schoop.co.uk\/\">Schoop<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parentmail.co.uk\/\">ParentMail<\/a><\/li><li>Tools that contain some information, but who&#8217;s primary purpose is elsewhere, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parentpay.com\/\">ParentPay<\/a><\/li><li>Generic content management systems, like WordPress or Drupal or paid services like SquareSpace that can be used for a website for any kind of organisation. These systems are not school-specific.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>What I&#8217;ve been unable to find is a school-shaped content management system that stores and presents information that parents and other people interested in a school might want to see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few things that seem to advertise themselves as content management systems for schools, but they don&#8217;t seem to be huge advancement on standard CMS&#8217;s like WordPress and Joomla.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And anyway, I don&#8217;t think I wanted to a system for managing &#8220;content&#8221; as much as a systems for managing &#8220;information&#8221; &#8211; information that is specific to schools that can be presented in a variety of different ways, in order to fix the challenge of answering repeated similar questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enter &#8220;SchoolBot&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the idea of SchoolBot came before my ideas about an information system emerged from it.  I didn&#8217;t want to get involved in my own kid&#8217;s primary school website, but I wanted to make the information on it more easily accessible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The people were asking questions on Facebook. And I&#8217;d been tinkering with Facebook Messenger &#8220;Bots&#8221; on another project. Bots are computer programs that can automatically respond to people using Facebook Messenger or other instant messaging systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I wondered if I could create a Messenger &#8220;bot&#8221; that could use information from the school website to answer peoples&#8217; questions without them even leaving Facebook &#8211; which for many people is the main way that they use the internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/TGOOfe-kWts?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<figcaption>Initial schoolbot tests (on a non-school day!)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial SchoolBot was built in just a few hours, but Facebook Messenger was on a bit of a lockdown in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica investigations so it wasn&#8217;t available on Messenger to start with. And it was limited to a couple of initial functions like telling you the school meals for the day, and giving you term dates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, SchoolBot has become able to answer more questions, and generally be smarter. And it&#8217;s now connected to Facebook Messenger too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re thinking it, this is NOT &#8220;Artificial Intelligence&#8221;. It&#8217;s actually really quite dumb. But it&#8217;s clever enough to have the veil of something intelligent-looking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a parent &#8211; and yes, I&#8217;m currently the only parent that has access to it &#8211; it&#8217;s a super quick way to ask those essential parent questions and get responses in super quick time. And it&#8217;s fun too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A central &#8220;brain&#8221; for parent information<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SchoolBot did start out as just a simple parent-information chatbot. But it had the information behind it stored in a small database.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I quickly realised that I could use this information in other ways that could be really helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the information in a database, I could not only respond to messenger questions, but I could generate text or tables for a website, or even &#8211; given a suitable template &#8211; printable PDFs!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2144\" height=\"1344\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4067\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test.png 2144w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-300x188.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-768x481.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-1024x642.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-945x592.png 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-600x376.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2144px) 100vw, 2144px\" \/><figcaption>A test of getting data from SchoolBot into a web page &#8211; this uses actual SchoolBot data<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Both of these things are important.  I totally understand the need for things like school meal menus to be in printable format for people that need them. And it seems that most documents start as PDFs, then these are uploaded to the website &#8211; which isn&#8217;t great because PDF&#8217;s on websites are really hard to use, especially on mobile devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So rather than having the information in MS Word <strong>and<\/strong> on the website <strong>and<\/strong> in the SchoolBot database too (and possibly other places), you could just have it in one place &#8211; the central SchoolBot &#8220;brain&#8221; &#8211; and all the other things can be generated from that!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Technical geekery note: yes, the aim here is to have the data available on an API and create widgets and so on that consume that API &#8211; in the screengrab above I&#8217;ve built a simple WordPress plugin that uses SchoolBot data in shortcodes. And yes, the holiday dates are derived from the term dates! You didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d store the same information twice did you?!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SchoolBot also gathers feedback. It keeps a tally of how many times it has been asked questions that it can answer.  And questions that it does not know how to answer are logged so the system can be improved by feeding it more data! Both of these things could be used by a school to improve parent communications by helping them recognise what parents need to know, or what information is hard to get hold of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The impact on community<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In all of this I&#8217;m really aware that, if this ever actually becomes a useful thing, I might be taking something important away. The Facebook group is a source of community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People answering other people&#8217;s questions is a way to connect parents outside of the school run. Who knows what relationships might have sprung up just by someone spotting someone else at the school gate and saying &#8220;Oh, hi. You helped me out the other day!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if the benefits of quick answers to questions outweigh the potential negative effects of removing the Q&amp;A from the group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t even know if the messenger bot part of SchoolBot will be something that people use. Though the centralised data aspects of it remain useful, even without the messenger-related parts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It still feels like a useful thing. So I&#8217;m going to forge ahead and see what I can make of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s the status of SchoolBot?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s very much in development, but like many of my side projects, it exists in a somewhat-usable form and competes with other projects for my attention.  Currently only I can use it. But there&#8217;s no reason why, in its current form, it couldn&#8217;t be put to the public to test.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that would involve me being a geeky parent turning up with bright ideas that will probably make teacher&#8217;s lives more complicated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hmm\u2026<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I am NOT getting involved in school communications\u2026but\u2026<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have school children now. And I kinda made a vow to not get involved in school communications. Mostly because the primary job of school staff is educating and caring for children to do, and they don\u2019t want some geeky parent turning up with bright ideas that will probably make their lives more complicated.  In short: I don\u2019t want to cause trouble.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like churches and councils and various other public organisations that do way more than just sell stuff, schools have difficult communications challenges.  They have lots of information about lots of different things, and any one person is only interested in a small amount of it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organising and presenting this information such that people can see what they need without the stuff that they don\u2019t need getting in the way is very difficult. And, while I have some ideas for improving it, I don\u2019t have ideas for fixing the whole problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m a parent now, and so getting the information that a parent needs for day-to-day schooling is what concerns me most.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting way in which I see parents trying to get the information they need is to collaborate. Parents\u2019 Facebook groups pop up, and parents ask each other questions in these groups, and with several hundred parents, answers can arrive quite quickly. This is great!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I\u2019m also a software developer, and so when I see the same problem appearing repeatedly and being solved repeatedly, my instinct is to make it more efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see questions that are frequently being asked, and people having to wait for answers, I wonder how we can get people the answers more efficiently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Surveying the landscape<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a school comms expert, so there&#8217;s probably lots missing here. But from what I can tell there are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Tools that send information to parents, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.schoop.co.uk\/\">Schoop<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parentmail.co.uk\/\">ParentMail<\/a><\/li><li>Tools that contain some information, but who&#8217;s primary purpose is elsewhere, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parentpay.com\/\">ParentPay<\/a><\/li><li>Generic content management systems, like WordPress or Drupal or paid services like SquareSpace that can be used for a website for any kind of organisation. These systems are not school-specific.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>What I&#8217;ve been unable to find is a school-shaped content management system that stores and presents information that parents and other people interested in a school might want to see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few things that seem to advertise themselves as content management systems for schools, but they don&#8217;t seem to be huge advancement on standard CMS&#8217;s like WordPress and Joomla.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And anyway, I don&#8217;t think I wanted to a system for managing &#8220;content&#8221; as much as a systems for managing &#8220;information&#8221; &#8211; information that is specific to schools that can be presented in a variety of different ways, in order to fix the challenge of answering repeated similar questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enter &#8220;SchoolBot&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the idea of SchoolBot came before my ideas about an information system emerged from it.  I didn&#8217;t want to get involved in my own kid&#8217;s primary school website, but I wanted to make the information on it more easily accessible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The people were asking questions on Facebook. And I&#8217;d been tinkering with Facebook Messenger &#8220;Bots&#8221; on another project. Bots are computer programs that can automatically respond to people using Facebook Messenger or other instant messaging systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I wondered if I could create a Messenger &#8220;bot&#8221; that could use information from the school website to answer peoples&#8217; questions without them even leaving Facebook &#8211; which for many people is the main way that they use the internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/TGOOfe-kWts?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<figcaption>Initial schoolbot tests (on a non-school day!)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial SchoolBot was built in just a few hours, but Facebook Messenger was on a bit of a lockdown in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica investigations so it wasn&#8217;t available on Messenger to start with. And it was limited to a couple of initial functions like telling you the school meals for the day, and giving you term dates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, SchoolBot has become able to answer more questions, and generally be smarter. And it&#8217;s now connected to Facebook Messenger too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re thinking it, this is NOT &#8220;Artificial Intelligence&#8221;. It&#8217;s actually really quite dumb. But it&#8217;s clever enough to have the veil of something intelligent-looking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a parent &#8211; and yes, I&#8217;m currently the only parent that has access to it &#8211; it&#8217;s a super quick way to ask those essential parent questions and get responses in super quick time. And it&#8217;s fun too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A central &#8220;brain&#8221; for parent information<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SchoolBot did start out as just a simple parent-information chatbot. But it had the information behind it stored in a small database.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I quickly realised that I could use this information in other ways that could be really helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the information in a database, I could not only respond to messenger questions, but I could generate text or tables for a website, or even &#8211; given a suitable template &#8211; printable PDFs!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2144\" height=\"1344\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4067\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test.png 2144w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-300x188.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-768x481.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-1024x642.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-945x592.png 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-600x376.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2144px) 100vw, 2144px\" \/><figcaption>A test of getting data from SchoolBot into a web page &#8211; this uses actual SchoolBot data<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Both of these things are important.  I totally understand the need for things like school meal menus to be in printable format for people that need them. And it seems that most documents start as PDFs, then these are uploaded to the website &#8211; which isn&#8217;t great because PDF&#8217;s on websites are really hard to use, especially on mobile devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So rather than having the information in MS Word <strong>and<\/strong> on the website <strong>and<\/strong> in the SchoolBot database too (and possibly other places), you could just have it in one place &#8211; the central SchoolBot &#8220;brain&#8221; &#8211; and all the other things can be generated from that!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Technical geekery note: yes, the aim here is to have the data available on an API and create widgets and so on that consume that API &#8211; in the screengrab above I&#8217;ve built a simple WordPress plugin that uses SchoolBot data in shortcodes. And yes, the holiday dates are derived from the term dates! You didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d store the same information twice did you?!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SchoolBot also gathers feedback. It keeps a tally of how many times it has been asked questions that it can answer.  And questions that it does not know how to answer are logged so the system can be improved by feeding it more data! Both of these things could be used by a school to improve parent communications by helping them recognise what parents need to know, or what information is hard to get hold of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The impact on community<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In all of this I&#8217;m really aware that, if this ever actually becomes a useful thing, I might be taking something important away. The Facebook group is a source of community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People answering other people&#8217;s questions is a way to connect parents outside of the school run. Who knows what relationships might have sprung up just by someone spotting someone else at the school gate and saying &#8220;Oh, hi. You helped me out the other day!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if the benefits of quick answers to questions outweigh the potential negative effects of removing the Q&amp;A from the group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t even know if the messenger bot part of SchoolBot will be something that people use. Though the centralised data aspects of it remain useful, even without the messenger-related parts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It still feels like a useful thing. So I&#8217;m going to forge ahead and see what I can make of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s the status of SchoolBot?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s very much in development, but like many of my side projects, it exists in a somewhat-usable form and competes with other projects for my attention.  Currently only I can use it. But there&#8217;s no reason why, in its current form, it couldn&#8217;t be put to the public to test.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that would involve me being a geeky parent turning up with bright ideas that will probably make teacher&#8217;s lives more complicated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hmm\u2026<\/p>\n",
