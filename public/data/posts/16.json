So I guess I should write about what I do!<\/p>\n<p>Some of my bio\u2019s and \u201cAbout\u201d pages are a bit out of date &#8211; I must remedy that. For now, here\u2019s some of the things I\u2019m up to right now.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #23282d; font-size: 1.6em; font-weight: 600;\">Technology<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a software developer who happens to mostly build websites and web applications, because that\u2019s where I can make money making software on a freelance basis in the sector I want to work in. I\u2019d love to do more back-end, data processing, and general coding stuff really.<\/p>\n<p>I mostly develop with WordPress, but also use Laravel and \u00a0other PHP things. WordPress knowledge is pretty deep, and I do some highly technical projects with lots of data wrangling and custom user interface. But I also build small sites for small organisations using page builders.<\/p>\n<p>(Note to page-builder-haters: Yes, really I do! It\u2019s the pragmatic choice for smaller budgets.)<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m proficient in a whole load of the back-end web stack from how CPUs work, through language compilation and execution, right up to server operations and how HTTP works. Though some knowledge will be old and there are some holes in knowledge in some places&#8230;it\u2019s a broad field.<\/p>\n<p>I know JavaScript reasonably well but don\u2019t like it and struggle to see how you would build any significant back-end application with it &#8211; but I know people do! I\u2019ve been trying to #learnToLoveJS, but it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s not my kind of language at all.<\/p>\n<p>I prefer functional, declarative and typed languages. I prefer a language to tell me I got something wrong than to guess what I meant. But also, I never got to running JS as a process outside the browser, so I\u2019m still mostly using it for DOM manipulation in the browser, and stepping it up to doing node.js seems like a big jump to me.<\/p>\n<p>I have a MacBook and an iPhone, but these are tools and I\u2019m not wedded to either of them.<\/p>\n<h2>Work and business<\/h2>\n<p>I run my own company to do my software development, but I also work with groups of other freelancers on larger projects.<\/p>\n<p>Though highly technical, I love working with people and using technology to solve people\u2019s problems.<\/p>\n<p>I do some amount of user interface and user experience work, but I\u2019m not a visual designer and those kinds of \u00a0artistic flourishes are out-sourced.<\/p>\n<p>I care about my work and business a lot, but I\u2019m not set on growth. I have a good flow of work, mostly through recommendations and referrals. It\u2019s a mildly-profitable, bootstrapped business, not a hard-and-fast startup.<\/p>\n<h2>On the side<\/h2>\n<p>I sometimes learn new tech, or practice existing tech, by building small side projects. I have a few of these on the go at any one time. My current focusses are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/about-kownter\/\">Kownter<\/a>: Simple, self-hosted, privacy aware analytics<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/08\/about-schoolbot\/\">SchoolBot<\/a>: a parent information system that started as a chatbot, but will hopefully become more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Life<\/h2>\n<p>I have a wife and two small children; I work flexibly to look after the kids and life mostly revolves around them. I love to cycle &#8211; though I\u2019m mostly just commuting at the moment. We have a large-ish garden that we try to grow stuff in, and we are part of a small local church.<\/p>\n<p>Its a pretty busy life. More on the specifics soon!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>The other day <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/08\/what-i-do\/\">I wrote about writing about what I do<\/a>. So I guess I should write about what I do!<\/p>\n<p>Some of my bio\u2019s and \u201cAbout\u201d pages are a bit out of date &#8211; I must remedy that. For now, here\u2019s some of the things I\u2019m up to right now.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #23282d; font-size: 1.6em; font-weight: 600;\">Technology<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a software developer who happens to mostly build websites and web applications, because that\u2019s where I can make money making software on a freelance basis in the sector I want to work in. I\u2019d love to do more back-end, data processing, and general coding stuff really.<\/p>\n<p>I mostly develop with WordPress, but also use Laravel and \u00a0other PHP things. WordPress knowledge is pretty deep, and I do some highly technical projects with lots of data wrangling and custom user interface. But I also build small sites for small organisations using page builders.<\/p>\n<p>(Note to page-builder-haters: Yes, really I do! It\u2019s the pragmatic choice for smaller budgets.)<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m proficient in a whole load of the back-end web stack from how CPUs work, through language compilation and execution, right up to server operations and how HTTP works. Though some knowledge will be old and there are some holes in knowledge in some places&#8230;it\u2019s a broad field.<\/p>\n<p>I know JavaScript reasonably well but don\u2019t like it and struggle to see how you would build any significant back-end application with it &#8211; but I know people do! I\u2019ve been trying to #learnToLoveJS, but it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s not my kind of language at all.<\/p>\n<p>I prefer functional, declarative and typed languages. I prefer a language to tell me I got something wrong than to guess what I meant. But also, I never got to running JS as a process outside the browser, so I\u2019m still mostly using it for DOM manipulation in the browser, and stepping it up to doing node.js seems like a big jump to me.<\/p>\n<p>I have a MacBook and an iPhone, but these are tools and I\u2019m not wedded to either of them.<\/p>\n<h2>Work and business<\/h2>\n<p>I run my own company to do my software development, but I also work with groups of other freelancers on larger projects.<\/p>\n<p>Though highly technical, I love working with people and using technology to solve people\u2019s problems.<\/p>\n<p>I do some amount of user interface and user experience work, but I\u2019m not a visual designer and those kinds of \u00a0artistic flourishes are out-sourced.<\/p>\n<p>I care about my work and business a lot, but I\u2019m not set on growth. I have a good flow of work, mostly through recommendations and referrals. It\u2019s a mildly-profitable, bootstrapped business, not a hard-and-fast startup.<\/p>\n<h2>On the side<\/h2>\n<p>I sometimes learn new tech, or practice existing tech, by building small side projects. I have a few of these on the go at any one time. My current focusses are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/about-kownter\/\">Kownter<\/a>: Simple, self-hosted, privacy aware analytics<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/08\/about-schoolbot\/\">SchoolBot<\/a>: a parent information system that started as a chatbot, but will hopefully become more<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Life<\/h2>\n<p>I have a wife and two small children; I work flexibly to look after the kids and life mostly revolves around them. I love to cycle &#8211; though I\u2019m mostly just commuting at the moment. We have a large-ish garden that we try to grow stuff in, and we are part of a small local church.<\/p>\n<p>Its a pretty busy life. More on the specifics soon!<\/p>\n",

But it has been a revelation to me that it\u2019s possible for people to just breeze through life ignoring how that thing is made, or why that thing doesn\u2019t comply with the rules, or the fact that that apostrophe isn\u2019t in the right place, or what others might think of what they do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week I have been struggling with a company who do important legal and regulatory stuff for Oikos. I will not name names, and I will not list the catalogue of small errors that have beset the process. But I really do find myself wondering how you get into this kind of field without having a high level of attention to detail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, forgive me if I\u2019m a bit slow sometimes with my work. It sometimes means I\u2019m trying to do something right. Because I\u2019d rather be right than fast.<br\/><\/p>\n",

But it has been a revelation to me that it\u2019s possible for people to just breeze through life ignoring how that thing is made, or why that thing doesn\u2019t comply with the rules, or the fact that that apostrophe isn\u2019t in the right place, or what others might think of what they do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week I have been struggling with a company who do important legal and regulatory stuff for Oikos. I will not name names, and I will not list the catalogue of small errors that have beset the process. But I really do find myself wondering how you get into this kind of field without having a high level of attention to detail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, forgive me if I\u2019m a bit slow sometimes with my work.

And documenting the day to day requires quick, simple publishing of stuff that may not be finished or properly thought through (and I\u2019m \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2015\/07\/highly-sensitive\/\">Highly Sensitive<\/a>\u201d so I think things through a LOT!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;maybe that\u2019s a change I need to make.

But it\u2019s hard because the content I consume always make my content feel low value, not as good, unworthy of being published. So I\u2019m constantly catching up. And I catch up by consuming content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a vicious circle!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m currently feeling quite motivated to create.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m terrible at short form content but that\u2019s what I want to make more of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m scared of putting out something that\u2019s not good enough, but I keep being reminded that I need to just start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\u2019m conscious of time &#8211; I know I keep on about it but being a parent sucks time for both consuming and creating content. So one really does need to be prioritised if it\u2019s to get time and attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recent move of lots of people off of Twitter and Facebook and onto more open platforms like <a href=\"Http:\/\/micro.blog\/\">Micro.blog<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/joinmastodon.org\/\">Mastodon<\/a>, and things being said by wise people like <a href=\"https:\/\/timetable.manton.org\/2018\/08\/episode-113-focus-on-smaller-networks\/\">Manton Reece<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/robbell.podbean.com\/e\/episode-200-1528694547\/\">Rob Bell<\/a>\u00a0have really made me want to just make stuff again, and to make it on platforms I own and control, so that it\u2019s properly MINE!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love my blog, I\u2019ve always loved writing and sharing.

                "rendered": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I am NOT getting involved in school communications\u2026but\u2026<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have school children now. And I kinda made a vow to not get involved in school communications. Mostly because the primary job of school staff is educating and caring for children to do, and they don\u2019t want some geeky parent turning up with bright ideas that will probably make their lives more complicated.  In short: I don\u2019t want to cause trouble.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like churches and councils and various other public organisations that do way more than just sell stuff, schools have difficult communications challenges.  They have lots of information about lots of different things, and any one person is only interested in a small amount of it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organising and presenting this information such that people can see what they need without the stuff that they don\u2019t need getting in the way is very difficult. And, while I have some ideas for improving it, I don\u2019t have ideas for fixing the whole problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m a parent now, and so getting the information that a parent needs for day-to-day schooling is what concerns me most.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting way in which I see parents trying to get the information they need is to collaborate. Parents\u2019 Facebook groups pop up, and parents ask each other questions in these groups, and with several hundred parents, answers can arrive quite quickly. This is great!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I\u2019m also a software developer, and so when I see the same problem appearing repeatedly and being solved repeatedly, my instinct is to make it more efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see questions that are frequently being asked, and people having to wait for answers, I wonder how we can get people the answers more efficiently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Surveying the landscape<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a school comms expert, so there&#8217;s probably lots missing here. But from what I can tell there are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Tools that send information to parents, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.schoop.co.uk\/\">Schoop<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parentmail.co.uk\/\">ParentMail<\/a><\/li><li>Tools that contain some information, but who&#8217;s primary purpose is elsewhere, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parentpay.com\/\">ParentPay<\/a><\/li><li>Generic content management systems, like WordPress or Drupal or paid services like SquareSpace that can be used for a website for any kind of organisation. These systems are not school-specific.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>What I&#8217;ve been unable to find is a school-shaped content management system that stores and presents information that parents and other people interested in a school might want to see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few things that seem to advertise themselves as content management systems for schools, but they don&#8217;t seem to be huge advancement on standard CMS&#8217;s like WordPress and Joomla.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And anyway, I don&#8217;t think I wanted to a system for managing &#8220;content&#8221; as much as a systems for managing &#8220;information&#8221; &#8211; information that is specific to schools that can be presented in a variety of different ways, in order to fix the challenge of answering repeated similar questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enter &#8220;SchoolBot&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the idea of SchoolBot came before my ideas about an information system emerged from it.  I didn&#8217;t want to get involved in my own kid&#8217;s primary school website, but I wanted to make the information on it more easily accessible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The people were asking questions on Facebook. And I&#8217;d been tinkering with Facebook Messenger &#8220;Bots&#8221; on another project. Bots are computer programs that can automatically respond to people using Facebook Messenger or other instant messaging systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I wondered if I could create a Messenger &#8220;bot&#8221; that could use information from the school website to answer peoples&#8217; questions without them even leaving Facebook &#8211; which for many people is the main way that they use the internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/TGOOfe-kWts?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<figcaption>Initial schoolbot tests (on a non-school day!)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial SchoolBot was built in just a few hours, but Facebook Messenger was on a bit of a lockdown in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica investigations so it wasn&#8217;t available on Messenger to start with. And it was limited to a couple of initial functions like telling you the school meals for the day, and giving you term dates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, SchoolBot has become able to answer more questions, and generally be smarter. And it&#8217;s now connected to Facebook Messenger too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re thinking it, this is NOT &#8220;Artificial Intelligence&#8221;. It&#8217;s actually really quite dumb. But it&#8217;s clever enough to have the veil of something intelligent-looking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a parent &#8211; and yes, I&#8217;m currently the only parent that has access to it &#8211; it&#8217;s a super quick way to ask those essential parent questions and get responses in super quick time. And it&#8217;s fun too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A central &#8220;brain&#8221; for parent information<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SchoolBot did start out as just a simple parent-information chatbot. But it had the information behind it stored in a small database.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I quickly realised that I could use this information in other ways that could be really helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the information in a database, I could not only respond to messenger questions, but I could generate text or tables for a website, or even &#8211; given a suitable template &#8211; printable PDFs!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2144\" height=\"1344\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4067\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test.png 2144w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-300x188.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-768x481.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-1024x642.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-945x592.png 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-600x376.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2144px) 100vw, 2144px\" \/><figcaption>A test of getting data from SchoolBot into a web page &#8211; this uses actual SchoolBot data<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Both of these things are important.  I totally understand the need for things like school meal menus to be in printable format for people that need them. And it seems that most documents start as PDFs, then these are uploaded to the website &#8211; which isn&#8217;t great because PDF&#8217;s on websites are really hard to use, especially on mobile devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So rather than having the information in MS Word <strong>and<\/strong> on the website <strong>and<\/strong> in the SchoolBot database too (and possibly other places), you could just have it in one place &#8211; the central SchoolBot &#8220;brain&#8221; &#8211; and all the other things can be generated from that!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Technical geekery note: yes, the aim here is to have the data available on an API and create widgets and so on that consume that API &#8211; in the screengrab above I&#8217;ve built a simple WordPress plugin that uses SchoolBot data in shortcodes. And yes, the holiday dates are derived from the term dates! You didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d store the same information twice did you?!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SchoolBot also gathers feedback. It keeps a tally of how many times it has been asked questions that it can answer.  And questions that it does not know how to answer are logged so the system can be improved by feeding it more data! Both of these things could be used by a school to improve parent communications by helping them recognise what parents need to know, or what information is hard to get hold of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The impact on community<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In all of this I&#8217;m really aware that, if this ever actually becomes a useful thing, I might be taking something important away. The Facebook group is a source of community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People answering other people&#8217;s questions is a way to connect parents outside of the school run. Who knows what relationships might have sprung up just by someone spotting someone else at the school gate and saying &#8220;Oh, hi. You helped me out the other day!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if the benefits of quick answers to questions outweigh the potential negative effects of removing the Q&amp;A from the group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t even know if the messenger bot part of SchoolBot will be something that people use. Though the centralised data aspects of it remain useful, even without the messenger-related parts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It still feels like a useful thing. So I&#8217;m going to forge ahead and see what I can make of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s the status of SchoolBot?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s very much in development, but like many of my side projects, it exists in a somewhat-usable form and competes with other projects for my attention.  Currently only I can use it. But there&#8217;s no reason why, in its current form, it couldn&#8217;t be put to the public to test.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that would involve me being a geeky parent turning up with bright ideas that will probably make teacher&#8217;s lives more complicated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hmm\u2026<\/p>\n",

And I kinda made a vow to not get involved in school communications. Mostly because the primary job of school staff is educating and caring for children to do, and they don\u2019t want some geeky parent turning up with bright ideas that will probably make their lives more complicated.  In short: I don\u2019t want to cause trouble.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like churches and councils and various other public organisations that do way more than just sell stuff, schools have difficult communications challenges.  They have lots of information about lots of different things, and any one person is only interested in a small amount of it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organising and presenting this information such that people can see what they need without the stuff that they don\u2019t need getting in the way is very difficult. And, while I have some ideas for improving it, I don\u2019t have ideas for fixing the whole problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m a parent now, and so getting the information that a parent needs for day-to-day schooling is what concerns me most.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting way in which I see parents trying to get the information they need is to collaborate. Parents\u2019 Facebook groups pop up, and parents ask each other questions in these groups, and with several hundred parents, answers can arrive quite quickly. This is great!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I\u2019m also a software developer, and so when I see the same problem appearing repeatedly and being solved repeatedly, my instinct is to make it more efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see questions that are frequently being asked, and people having to wait for answers, I wonder how we can get people the answers more efficiently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Surveying the landscape<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a school comms expert, so there&#8217;s probably lots missing here. But from what I can tell there are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Tools that send information to parents, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.schoop.co.uk\/\">Schoop<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parentmail.co.uk\/\">ParentMail<\/a><\/li><li>Tools that contain some information, but who&#8217;s primary purpose is elsewhere, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parentpay.com\/\">ParentPay<\/a><\/li><li>Generic content management systems, like WordPress or Drupal or paid services like SquareSpace that can be used for a website for any kind of organisation. These systems are not school-specific.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>What I&#8217;ve been unable to find is a school-shaped content management system that stores and presents information that parents and other people interested in a school might want to see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few things that seem to advertise themselves as content management systems for schools, but they don&#8217;t seem to be huge advancement on standard CMS&#8217;s like WordPress and Joomla.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And anyway, I don&#8217;t think I wanted to a system for managing &#8220;content&#8221; as much as a systems for managing &#8220;information&#8221; &#8211; information that is specific to schools that can be presented in a variety of different ways, in order to fix the challenge of answering repeated similar questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enter &#8220;SchoolBot&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the idea of SchoolBot came before my ideas about an information system emerged from it.  I didn&#8217;t want to get involved in my own kid&#8217;s primary school website, but I wanted to make the information on it more easily accessible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The people were asking questions on Facebook. And I&#8217;d been tinkering with Facebook Messenger &#8220;Bots&#8221; on another project. Bots are computer programs that can automatically respond to people using Facebook Messenger or other instant messaging systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I wondered if I could create a Messenger &#8220;bot&#8221; that could use information from the school website to answer peoples&#8217; questions without them even leaving Facebook &#8211; which for many people is the main way that they use the internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/TGOOfe-kWts?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<figcaption>Initial schoolbot tests (on a non-school day!)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial SchoolBot was built in just a few hours, but Facebook Messenger was on a bit of a lockdown in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica investigations so it wasn&#8217;t available on Messenger to start with. And it was limited to a couple of initial functions like telling you the school meals for the day, and giving you term dates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, SchoolBot has become able to answer more questions, and generally be smarter. And it&#8217;s now connected to Facebook Messenger too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re thinking it, this is NOT &#8220;Artificial Intelligence&#8221;. It&#8217;s actually really quite dumb. But it&#8217;s clever enough to have the veil of something intelligent-looking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a parent &#8211; and yes, I&#8217;m currently the only parent that has access to it &#8211; it&#8217;s a super quick way to ask those essential parent questions and get responses in super quick time. And it&#8217;s fun too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A central &#8220;brain&#8221; for parent information<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SchoolBot did start out as just a simple parent-information chatbot. But it had the information behind it stored in a small database.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I quickly realised that I could use this information in other ways that could be really helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the information in a database, I could not only respond to messenger questions, but I could generate text or tables for a website, or even &#8211; given a suitable template &#8211; printable PDFs!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2144\" height=\"1344\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4067\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test.png 2144w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-300x188.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-768x481.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-1024x642.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-945x592.png 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/schoolbot-web-test-600x376.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2144px) 100vw, 2144px\" \/><figcaption>A test of getting data from SchoolBot into a web page &#8211; this uses actual SchoolBot data<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Both of these things are important.  I totally understand the need for things like school meal menus to be in printable format for people that need them. And it seems that most documents start as PDFs, then these are uploaded to the website &#8211; which isn&#8217;t great because PDF&#8217;s on websites are really hard to use, especially on mobile devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So rather than having the information in MS Word <strong>and<\/strong> on the website <strong>and<\/strong> in the SchoolBot database too (and possibly other places), you could just have it in one place &#8211; the central SchoolBot &#8220;brain&#8221; &#8211; and all the other things can be generated from that!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Technical geekery note: yes, the aim here is to have the data available on an API and create widgets and so on that consume that API &#8211; in the screengrab above I&#8217;ve built a simple WordPress plugin that uses SchoolBot data in shortcodes. And yes, the holiday dates are derived from the term dates! You didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d store the same information twice did you?!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SchoolBot also gathers feedback. It keeps a tally of how many times it has been asked questions that it can answer.  And questions that it does not know how to answer are logged so the system can be improved by feeding it more data! Both of these things could be used by a school to improve parent communications by helping them recognise what parents need to know, or what information is hard to get hold of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The impact on community<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In all of this I&#8217;m really aware that, if this ever actually becomes a useful thing, I might be taking something important away. The Facebook group is a source of community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People answering other people&#8217;s questions is a way to connect parents outside of the school run. Who knows what relationships might have sprung up just by someone spotting someone else at the school gate and saying &#8220;Oh, hi. You helped me out the other day!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if the benefits of quick answers to questions outweigh the potential negative effects of removing the Q&amp;A from the group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t even know if the messenger bot part of SchoolBot will be something that people use. Though the centralised data aspects of it remain useful, even without the messenger-related parts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It still feels like a useful thing. So I&#8217;m going to forge ahead and see what I can make of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s the status of SchoolBot?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s very much in development, but like many of my side projects, it exists in a somewhat-usable form and competes with other projects for my attention.  Currently only I can use it. But there&#8217;s no reason why, in its current form, it couldn&#8217;t be put to the public to test.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that would involve me being a geeky parent turning up with bright ideas that will probably make teacher&#8217;s lives more complicated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hmm\u2026<\/p>\n",

You need to go all in. They aren&#8217;t intended to be mashed up with traditional HTML page reloads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I then tried to work out how to use the Axios HTTP client library to do my delete action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And was that easy?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well&#8230;hmm&#8230;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Axios\/AJAX thing was actually pretty simple. I&#8217;ll give you that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I was then faced with the propsect of having to delete the <code>thing<\/code>\u00a0from my list of things stored as data in the top-level component instance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the problem with this is that this data is a nested array that comes from PHP via JSON.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I know some people complain that PHP arrays are trying to be all things to all men, but from a developer happiness point of view they are pretty nice and I&#8217;ve got very used to their flexibility and ease of use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But getting them from PHP into JS isn&#8217;t so simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my case I have a list of things for each day of the week. But not every day needs a list. So I can have:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">[<br\/>  1 => [<br\/>          'thing1',<br\/>          'thing2'<br\/>  ],<br\/>  3 => [<br\/>          'thing3',<br\/>          'thing4'<br\/>  ]<br\/>]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can have this in JavaScript too. Sort of.\u00a0 JavaScript doesn&#8217;t like the gaps &#8211; note in the image below the <code>empty<\/code>\u00a0slots and the length:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3778\" width=\"316\" height=\"84\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08.png 632w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08-300x80.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08-600x159.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;to get between PHP and JS we generally use JSON as a kind of intermediate format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And JSON doesn&#8217;t have arrays with indexes. JSON arrays have no specific indices. They always start at zero and subsequent elements are indexed with the next integer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to get around this, PHP&#8217;s <code>json_encode()<\/code>\u00a0function works out if the PHP array is compatible with JSON. If it is then it spits out a JSON array. And if it isn&#8217;t then it spits out a JSON OBJECT!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a valid JSON array &#8211; zero-indexed and all sequential keys:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">> $a = [ 0 => 'a', 1 => 'b' ];<br\/>> echo json_encode( $a );<br\/>[\"a\",\"b\"]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a non-JSON compatible array:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">> $b = [ 1 => 'a', 2 => 'b' ];<br\/>> echo json_encode( $b );<br\/>{\"1\":\"a\",\"2\":\"b\"}<br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Fun! Now I note that you can add the <code>JSON_FORCE_OBJECT<\/code>\u00a0flag to always convert PHP arrays to JSON objects, even if they are JSON-array compatible. But for the most part, you sometime get an array in JSON, and you sometimes get an object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And my list of things, not being JSON-array compatible, was being spat out as an object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s my issue: JavaScript objects aren&#8217;t really iterable. You can&#8217;t easily loop over them. I mean, yes, you can get the keys, and you can use <code>for...of<\/code>\u00a0or <code>for...in<\/code>\u00a0or something. But sometimes you&#8217;ll get properties you don&#8217;t want (such as a Vue <code>__ob__<\/code>\u00a0observer property) and&#8230;well&#8230;objects just aren&#8217;t really intended to be used in this way. Objects are objects, not lists or arrays.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what to do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I could use <code>JSON_FORCE_OBJECT<\/code>\u00a0and treat ALL my arrays as objects and deal with it. That would probably be OK. But then I&#8217;m stuck using objects for lists of things in JS and that&#8217;s not right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or I could try to make all my PHP arrays JSON compatible. So my list would be zero-indexed and sequential, like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">[<br\/>  0 => [],<br\/>  1 => [<br\/>    'thing1',<br\/>    'thing2'<br\/>  ],<br\/>  2 => [],<br\/>  3 => [<br\/>    'thing3',<br\/>    'thing4'<br\/>  ]<br\/>]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>But enforcing this inside PHP doesn&#8217;t seem like the right thing to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or I could try to find a way to convert JSON objects that only have numeric keys back into JS arrays. But that still has issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, I think, is a major pain point and frustration for me.\u00a0 Once my data is in the right places and in the right types of data structure, I know what I&#8217;m doing and can work quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But moving data between the different parts of these multi-part systems is hard to get right. And doing it in a scalable and maintainable way is even harder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday I also had problems with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JavaScript scope<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>How how how How HOW do\u00a0I pass a variable to a lexically-out-of-scope callback, like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">function deleteThingFromData( thingToDelete ) {<br\/>  newData = _.mapValues( data, myOutOfScopeCallback );<br\/>  data = newData;<br\/>}<br\/><br\/>function myOutOfScopeCallback( dataItem ) {<br\/>  \/\/ Needs access to thingToDelete!<br\/>}<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">this<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>this is perpetually not my friend. Nothing in programming should be called <code>this<\/code>, especially when its meaning can vary so wildly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday I got caught by the fact that <code>this<\/code>\u00a0inside an arrow function is different to <code>this<\/code>\u00a0with a normal function.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#learnToLoveJs<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, my delete now works (YAY!), and I&#8217;m still motivated to #learnToLoveJS, but gosh it&#8217;s hard work.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/06\/adding-a-delete-link-to-a-vue-component-representing-a-laravel-model\/\">Yesterday<\/a> I was struggling with getting Vue components to do non-AJAXy things and wondering why on earth this was so difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conclusion I came to, with the help of some good people on Twitter, is that if you&#8217;re using a component-based reactive framework like Vue, you don&#8217;t want to be half-hearted about it. You need to go all in. They aren&#8217;t intended to be mashed up with traditional HTML page reloads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I then tried to work out how to use the Axios HTTP client library to do my delete action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And was that easy?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well&#8230;hmm&#8230;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Axios\/AJAX thing was actually pretty simple. I&#8217;ll give you that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I was then faced with the propsect of having to delete the <code>thing<\/code>\u00a0from my list of things stored as data in the top-level component instance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the problem with this is that this data is a nested array that comes from PHP via JSON.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I know some people complain that PHP arrays are trying to be all things to all men, but from a developer happiness point of view they are pretty nice and I&#8217;ve got very used to their flexibility and ease of use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But getting them from PHP into JS isn&#8217;t so simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my case I have a list of things for each day of the week. But not every day needs a list. So I can have:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">[<br\/>  1 => [<br\/>          'thing1',<br\/>          'thing2'<br\/>  ],<br\/>  3 => [<br\/>          'thing3',<br\/>          'thing4'<br\/>  ]<br\/>]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can have this in JavaScript too. Sort of.\u00a0 JavaScript doesn&#8217;t like the gaps &#8211; note in the image below the <code>empty<\/code>\u00a0slots and the length:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3778\" width=\"316\" height=\"84\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08.png 632w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08-300x80.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08-600x159.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;to get between PHP and JS we generally use JSON as a kind of intermediate format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And JSON doesn&#8217;t have arrays with indexes. JSON arrays have no specific indices. They always start at zero and subsequent elements are indexed with the next integer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to get around this, PHP&#8217;s <code>json_encode()<\/code>\u00a0function works out if the PHP array is compatible with JSON. If it is then it spits out a JSON array. And if it isn&#8217;t then it spits out a JSON OBJECT!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a valid JSON array &#8211; zero-indexed and all sequential keys:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">> $a = [ 0 => 'a', 1 => 'b' ];<br\/>> echo json_encode( $a );<br\/>[\"a\",\"b\"]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a non-JSON compatible array:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">> $b = [ 1 => 'a', 2 => 'b' ];<br\/>> echo json_encode( $b );<br\/>{\"1\":\"a\",\"2\":\"b\"}<br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Fun! Now I note that you can add the <code>JSON_FORCE_OBJECT<\/code>\u00a0flag to always convert PHP arrays to JSON objects, even if they are JSON-array compatible. But for the most part, you sometime get an array in JSON, and you sometimes get an object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And my list of things, not being JSON-array compatible, was being spat out as an object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s my issue: JavaScript objects aren&#8217;t really iterable. You can&#8217;t easily loop over them. I mean, yes, you can get the keys, and you can use <code>for...of<\/code>\u00a0or <code>for...in<\/code>\u00a0or something. But sometimes you&#8217;ll get properties you don&#8217;t want (such as a Vue <code>__ob__<\/code>\u00a0observer property) and&#8230;well&#8230;objects just aren&#8217;t really intended to be used in this way. Objects are objects, not lists or arrays.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what to do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I could use <code>JSON_FORCE_OBJECT<\/code>\u00a0and treat ALL my arrays as objects and deal with it. That would probably be OK. But then I&#8217;m stuck using objects for lists of things in JS and that&#8217;s not right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or I could try to make all my PHP arrays JSON compatible. So my list would be zero-indexed and sequential, like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">[<br\/>  0 => [],<br\/>  1 => [<br\/>    'thing1',<br\/>    'thing2'<br\/>  ],<br\/>  2 => [],<br\/>  3 => [<br\/>    'thing3',<br\/>    'thing4'<br\/>  ]<br\/>]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>But enforcing this inside PHP doesn&#8217;t seem like the right thing to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or I could try to find a way to convert JSON objects that only have numeric keys back into JS arrays. But that still has issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, I think, is a major pain point and frustration for me.\u00a0 Once my data is in the right places and in the right types of data structure, I know what I&#8217;m doing and can work quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But moving data between the different parts of these multi-part systems is hard to get right. And doing it in a scalable and maintainable way is even harder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday I also had problems with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JavaScript scope<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>How how how How HOW do\u00a0I pass a variable to a lexically-out-of-scope callback, like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">function deleteThingFromData( thingToDelete ) {<br\/>  newData = _.mapValues( data, myOutOfScopeCallback );<br\/>  data = newData;<br\/>}<br\/><br\/>function myOutOfScopeCallback( dataItem ) {<br\/>  \/\/ Needs access to thingToDelete!<br\/>}<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">this<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>this is perpetually not my friend. Nothing in programming should be called <code>this<\/code>, especially when its meaning can vary so wildly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday I got caught by the fact that <code>this<\/code>\u00a0inside an arrow function is different to <code>this<\/code>\u00a0with a normal function.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#learnToLoveJs<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, my delete now works (YAY!), and I&#8217;m still motivated to #learnToLoveJS, but gosh it&#8217;s hard work.<\/p>\n",
