This happens every other month, and we had one last night.<\/p>\n<p>One item on the agenda was an initiative called &#8216;Back to Church Sunday&#8217;.  This is a Sunday in September that has been picked out as a day to invite people that used to go to church back to church.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what I think of this.  Surely every Sunday is potentially a &#8220;Back to Church&#8221; Sunday, or a &#8220;Go to Church for the First Time&#8221; Sunday.  And I think I&#8217;d rather have ongoing encouragement to invite friends along than only be encouraged to do it on a specific day.  Churches should ALWAYS be open for people to come back to.<\/p>\n<p>Also, what will the service be like?  I&#8217;m expecting it to be &#8220;special&#8221;, which doesn&#8217;t seem right because what if the people we invite come back the next Sunday and find it&#8217;s different?<\/p>\n<p>It IS a good initiative &#8211; as you can see, it&#8217;s already got me thinking about how open our church is to newcomers, and what I can do to try get better at asking people along.  I will support it and try to join in.  And maybe doing a one off event like this will kick-start something bigger and ongoing.<\/p>\n<p>But I think we need more than just one day for this&#8230;it should be an ongoing part of our Christian lives.<\/p>\n",

This happens every other month, and we had one last night.<\/p>\n<p>One item on the agenda was an initiative called &#8216;Back to Church Sunday&#8217;.  This is a Sunday in September that has been picked out as a day to invite people that used to go to church back to church.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what I think of this.  Surely every Sunday is potentially a &#8220;Back to Church&#8221; Sunday, or a &#8220;Go to Church for the First Time&#8221; Sunday.  And I think I&#8217;d rather have ongoing encouragement to invite friends along than only be encouraged to do it on a specific day.  Churches should ALWAYS be open for people to come back to.<\/p>\n<p>Also, what will the service be like?  I&#8217;m expecting it to be &#8220;special&#8221;, which doesn&#8217;t seem right because what if the people we invite come back the next Sunday and find it&#8217;s different?<\/p>\n<p>It IS a good initiative &#8211; as you can see, it&#8217;s already got me thinking about how open our church is to newcomers, and what I can do to try get better at asking people along.  I will support it and try to join in.  And maybe doing a one off event like this will kick-start something bigger and ongoing.<\/p>\n<p>But I think we need more than just one day for this&#8230;it should be an ongoing part of our Christian lives.<\/p>\n",

Using less energy is cheaper and uses less of the finite resources of the earth.  It makes sense to reduce consumption, reuse where possible and recycle materials rather than chuck them in landfill.<\/p>\n<p>So when we were in Comet the other day and noticed that the cost of those little household energy meters had come down significantly, we had a short discussion and decided to buy one.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, at first, you defeat the point by going round turning everything on to see how much it uses.  The fun of this quickly wears off, however, and the device remains sat on a worktop somewhere, showing us our electricity usage.<\/p>\n<p>It was very easy to set up and it&#8217;s been very useful.  Lots of people talk about taking things off standby, and I&#8217;m sure this has an important part to play, especially as these things, if left on, are on 24&#215;7.  But the most interesting things for us have been the effect of lights!  You can really see the difference with low-power bulbs.  But most of all, the multiple little spotlights that are used in our kitchen and bathroom use LOTS of energy.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been fun for a while and the novelty does soon wear off, but it&#8217;s good to have the meter on, and it&#8217;s been good to find out what the real energy guzzlers are in our house.<\/p>\n<p>And maybe, just maybe, we&#8217;ll be doing a little bit more to save the planet because of it.<\/p>\n",

Using less energy is cheaper and uses less of the finite resources of the earth.  It makes sense to reduce consumption, reuse where possible and recycle materials rather than chuck them in landfill.<\/p>\n<p>So when we were in Comet the other day and noticed that the cost of those little household energy meters had come down significantly, we had a short discussion and decided to buy one.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, at first, you defeat the point by going round turning everything on to see how much it uses.  The fun of this quickly wears off, however, and the device remains sat on a worktop somewhere, showing us our electricity usage.<\/p>\n<p>It was very easy to set up and it&#8217;s been very useful.  Lots of people talk about taking things off standby, and I&#8217;m sure this has an important part to play, especially as these things, if left on, are on 24&#215;7.  But the most interesting things for us have been the effect of lights!  You can really see the difference with low-power bulbs.  But most of all, the multiple little spotlights that are used in our kitchen and bathroom use LOTS of energy.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been fun for a while and the novelty does soon wear off, but it&#8217;s good to have the meter on, and it&#8217;s been good to find out what the real energy guzzlers are in our house.<\/p>\n<p>And maybe, just maybe, we&#8217;ll be doing a little bit more to save the planet because of it.<\/p>\n",

I think the BBC are quite good at reporting the news, but the other day I saw an piece on the telly that I thought was very poor and unfair.<\/p>\n<p>It was about how life expectancy is much higher in the south of England than in the north.<\/p>\n<p>My immediate thought was that this was related to money.  People in the posh south-west are almost certainly better off than those in the industrial north, and that money buys them a healthier lifestyle.  Pertty simple and, though it raises issues of class and equality, not really a huge revelation.<\/p>\n<p>To try to make their point &#8211; and I can&#8217;t really remember what the point was, the BBC visited Manchester and somewhere in Dorset to interview people.<\/p>\n<p>But rather than do this in a fair and balanced way they went to a pub in Manchester, to ask people how much they smoke and drink, and then to a gym in Dorset, to ask people about their exercise and eating habits.<\/p>\n<p>Well&#8230;.errr&#8230;..D&#8217;uh!!!!  Of course you&#8217;ll speak to completely different sorts of people in those two different places.  And the sorts of responses that you&#8217;d get &#8211; especially when edited down to get the responses that you WANT to get &#8211; are going to be pretty predictable.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that the presenter claimed that people in the North were more &#8220;at risk&#8221; than those in the south. &#8220;At risk&#8221;?  Of what?  Dying?  I think you&#8217;ll find that that&#8217;s something we&#8217;re all at risk of I&#8217;m afraid, regardless of where we live.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, of course it&#8217;s sad that life expectancy is lower in the North and maybe we should look at how we can address that balance.  Perhaps we can better redistribute wealth, or try to change our culture somehow.  These things are complex!<\/p>\n<p>But I was annoyed and astounded at the way the article had been fiddled to make the point.  I shall be watching the news more carefully in future!<\/p>\n",

People in the posh south-west are almost certainly better off than those in the industrial north, and that money buys them a healthier lifestyle.  Pertty simple and, though it raises issues of class and equality, not really a huge revelation.<\/p>\n<p>To try to make their point &#8211; and I can&#8217;t really remember what the point was, the BBC visited Manchester and somewhere in Dorset to interview people.<\/p>\n<p>But rather than do this in a fair and balanced way they went to a pub in Manchester, to ask people how much they smoke and drink, and then to a gym in Dorset, to ask people about their exercise and eating habits.<\/p>\n<p>Well&#8230;.errr&#8230;..D&#8217;uh!!!!  Of course you&#8217;ll speak to completely different sorts of people in those two different places.  And the sorts of responses that you&#8217;d get &#8211; especially when edited down to get the responses that you WANT to get &#8211; are going to be pretty predictable.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that the presenter claimed that people in the North were more &#8220;at risk&#8221; than those in the south. &#8220;At risk&#8221;?  Of what?  Dying?  I think you&#8217;ll find that that&#8217;s something we&#8217;re all at risk of I&#8217;m afraid, regardless of where we live.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, of course it&#8217;s sad that life expectancy is lower in the North and maybe we should look at how we can address that balance.  Perhaps we can better redistribute wealth, or try to change our culture somehow.  These things are complex!<\/p>\n<p>But I was annoyed and astounded at the way the article had been fiddled to make the point.  I shall be watching the news more carefully in future!<\/p>\n",

All prompted by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/t1mmyb\">t1mmyb<\/a>&#8216;s little note on Twitter the other day.<\/p>\n<p>I started out using Google Docs for tracking my times in a simple online spreadsheet.  This was OK but when it started getting big and unmanagable I started looking for something better, and decided to stick with www.bikejournal.com.  It&#8217;s a bit clunky but did a good job.<\/p>\n<p>But Tim pointed me at www.mycyclinglog.com.  A fab site which is slick, fast, looks nice and does some interesting things.  It also allows you to have a &#8220;badge&#8221; that you can stick on your blog (look right and down), it integrates with Facebook, and has RSS feeds.  I love it and I was an almost instant convert.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, in an odd kind of way, it&#8217;s reinvigorated my waning passion for cycling.  Tracking your times makes you want to improve your times!  Perhaps having them on public display will make me want to do that all the more!!<\/p>\n",

All prompted by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/t1mmyb\">t1mmyb<\/a>&#8216;s little note on Twitter the other day.<\/p>\n<p>I started out using Google Docs for tracking my times in a simple online spreadsheet.  This was OK but when it started getting big and unmanagable I started looking for something better, and decided to stick with www.bikejournal.com.  It&#8217;s a bit clunky but did a good job.<\/p>\n<p>But Tim pointed me at www.mycyclinglog.com.  A fab site which is slick, fast, looks nice and does some interesting things.  It also allows you to have a &#8220;badge&#8221; that you can stick on your blog (look right and down), it integrates with Facebook, and has RSS feeds.  I love it and I was an almost instant convert.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, in an odd kind of way, it&#8217;s reinvigorated my waning passion for cycling.  Tracking your times makes you want to improve your times!  Perhaps having them on public display will make me want to do that all the more!!<\/p>\n",

Shopping is always interesting as we both have our little things we&#8217;re passionate about.  Fair trade, free range, recycled, compostable, organic, low-energy, locally sourced, etc.  And we&#8217;re fortunate enough to a) have the choice to buy these things b) be able to afford them!  So our shopping bill is probably quite high for a two-person household.<\/p>\n<p>We also seem to buy a LOT of cereals!  I eat a combination of muesli, crunchy oat cereal and corn flakes for breakfast, and I snack on cereal bars during the day (either bought, or all-natural, home-made from&#8230;oats, muesli, seeds, dried fruit, honey, egg whites, and apple juice &#8211; recipe available on request).  Cereals also last a long time so we stock up whenever we&#8217;re in the shops.  I reckon about a third of our trolley load was cereals!  Maybe I&#8217;m addicted to oats?<\/p>\n<p>We were also astonished to find cheap beer.  I mean CHEAP beer.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been using up some old, past-its-sell-by-date lager in beer traps to get the slugs in our garden (highly effective I might add!).  But we&#8217;ve run out, so I bought some Sainsbury&#8217;s &#8220;Basics&#8221; bitter.  For&#8230;wait for it&#8230;97p for 4 cans!!!<\/p>\n<p>This is cheaper than coke!  It&#8217;s probably cheaper than bottled water.  I&#8217;ve heard about such beer on the news, but to actually see it in the shops is astounding.<\/p>\n<p>Sally turned the cheap-beer thing into something light-hearted though by commenting that, because we&#8217;ve switched from lager to bitter, &#8220;we&#8217;ll probably catch the older, fatter slugs with beards now&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll wait and see!<\/p>\n",

Shopping is always interesting as we both have our little things we&#8217;re passionate about.  Fair trade, free range, recycled, compostable, organic, low-energy, locally sourced, etc.  And we&#8217;re fortunate enough to a) have the choice to buy these things b) be able to afford them!  So our shopping bill is probably quite high for a two-person household.<\/p>\n<p>We also seem to buy a LOT of cereals!  I eat a combination of muesli, crunchy oat cereal and corn flakes for breakfast, and I snack on cereal bars during the day (either bought, or all-natural, home-made from&#8230;oats, muesli, seeds, dried fruit, honey, egg whites, and apple juice &#8211; recipe available on request).  Cereals also last a long time so we stock up whenever we&#8217;re in the shops.  I reckon about a third of our trolley load was cereals!  Maybe I&#8217;m addicted to oats?<\/p>\n<p>We were also astonished to find cheap beer.  I mean CHEAP beer.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been using up some old, past-its-sell-by-date lager in beer traps to get the slugs in our garden (highly effective I might add!).  But we&#8217;ve run out, so I bought some Sainsbury&#8217;s &#8220;Basics&#8221; bitter.  For&#8230;wait for it&#8230;97p for 4 cans!!!<\/p>\n<p>This is cheaper than coke!  It&#8217;s probably cheaper than bottled water.  I&#8217;ve heard about such beer on the news, but to actually see it in the shops is astounding.<\/p>\n<p>Sally turned the cheap-beer thing into something light-hearted though by commenting that, because we&#8217;ve switched from lager to bitter, &#8220;we&#8217;ll probably catch the older, fatter slugs with beards now&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll wait and see!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>I&#8217;ve had a few minor incidents on my commute to and from work, and a couple of falls off Fuzzy that were my own stupid fault and didn&#8217;t hurt anyone else.  But I had my first crash involving someone else today.<\/p>\n<p>It was nothing major.  I, on my bike, collided with a 10-ish-year-old girl, also on a bike.  There were no major injuries but it was quite a shock.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been pulling away from a roundabout.  Just past the exit, there was an unmarked crossing with an island.  I&#8217;d seen the family with a couple of kids on bikes, about to cross from a distance.  As I approached, the mother saw me and shouted to stop, and I pulled away from the roundabout as normal assuming that they would.<\/p>\n<p>As I got closer, it appeared that one of the girls wasn&#8217;t about to stop.  I THINK I remember<br \/>making eye contact, but if we did she must have thought that I would stop.  My initial thought was that SHE would stop.  Either that or speed up and get out of my way.  But she continued on at the same slow speed.  I&#8217;d committed to the gap on my left, in front of the girl, but it was shrinking, so I got on the brakes.  Too late though.  We collided.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really remember what happened then, but we all ended up standing at the side of the road.  The mother was more concerned with my welfare than that of her daughter.  I think she felt bad because, ultimately, it was the girl&#8217;s fault for crossing without looking.  She stood in silence holding her hand and looking mightily scared.  I had a bruised leg but kept my cool and wished them a good day once we&#8217;d established that everyone was OK.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to blame myself for it &#8211; something I&#8217;m usually pretty good at &#8211; but all I can come up with is that, had I judged it better, I could have avoided a collision; a collision that occurred because the girl crossed in front of me.<\/p>\n<p>It was a minor incident, but it&#8217;s made me cautious.  Maybe next time I&#8217;ll anticipate the family crossing and be slower.  If I was in a car it would have been much worse, so perhaps I&#8217;ll be driving more carefully in future too.<\/p>\n<p>This is not the first incident of children running out at me.  I know that the bike is quiet, but the incidents have occurred on pretty major roads and kids should be stopping and looking hard both ways before crossing.  Whatever happened to the green cross code?<\/p>\n<p>It was a bad start to my first day back at work after being away on holiday &#8211; a report on that to come!  I arrived at work to find that I&#8217;d been evicted from my desk and had to move &#8211; which wasted half a day!  And then I upset someone by sending an email with a SINGLE word in upper-case for emphasis.  So all in all, not a great start to the new working week.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well, I guess it can only get better!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;ve had a few minor incidents on my commute to and from work, and a couple of falls off Fuzzy that were my own stupid fault and didn&#8217;t hurt anyone else.  But I had my first crash involving someone else today.<\/p>\n<p>It was nothing major.  I, on my bike, collided with a 10-ish-year-old girl, also on a bike.  There were no major injuries but it was quite a shock.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been pulling away from a roundabout.  Just past the exit, there was an unmarked crossing with an island.  I&#8217;d seen the family with a couple of kids on bikes, about to cross from a distance.  As I approached, the mother saw me and shouted to stop, and I pulled away from the roundabout as normal assuming that they would.<\/p>\n<p>As I got closer, it appeared that one of the girls wasn&#8217;t about to stop.  I THINK I remember<br \/>making eye contact, but if we did she must have thought that I would stop.  My initial thought was that SHE would stop.  Either that or speed up and get out of my way.  But she continued on at the same slow speed.  I&#8217;d committed to the gap on my left, in front of the girl, but it was shrinking, so I got on the brakes.  Too late though.  We collided.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really remember what happened then, but we all ended up standing at the side of the road.  The mother was more concerned with my welfare than that of her daughter.  I think she felt bad because, ultimately, it was the girl&#8217;s fault for crossing without looking.  She stood in silence holding her hand and looking mightily scared.  I had a bruised leg but kept my cool and wished them a good day once we&#8217;d established that everyone was OK.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to blame myself for it &#8211; something I&#8217;m usually pretty good at &#8211; but all I can come up with is that, had I judged it better, I could have avoided a collision; a collision that occurred because the girl crossed in front of me.<\/p>\n<p>It was a minor incident, but it&#8217;s made me cautious.  Maybe next time I&#8217;ll anticipate the family crossing and be slower.  If I was in a car it would have been much worse, so perhaps I&#8217;ll be driving more carefully in future too.<\/p>\n<p>This is not the first incident of children running out at me.  I know that the bike is quiet, but the incidents have occurred on pretty major roads and kids should be stopping and looking hard both ways before crossing.  Whatever happened to the green cross code?<\/p>\n<p>It was a bad start to my first day back at work after being away on holiday &#8211; a report on that to come!  I arrived at work to find that I&#8217;d been evicted from my desk and had to move &#8211; which wasted half a day!  And then I upset someone by sending an email with a SINGLE word in upper-case for emphasis.  So all in all, not a great start to the new working week.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well, I guess it can only get better!<\/p>\n",
