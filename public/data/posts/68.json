We stalled a bit while we chose a mortgage but that&#8217;s applied for, the legal stuff has all moved along as it should, the survey is now done, and it seems that nothing can now stand in the way of our purchase (famous last words&#8230;you read them here!).<\/p>\n<p>My main feeling, other then excitement, is the completely overwhelming amount of information that&#8217;s involved.  We requested some extra reports and searches because the house:<br \/>&#8211; is near a flood plain (far enough from it to be safe though),<br \/>&#8211; is near the site of an old refuse site,<br \/>&#8211; has recently had an extension built.<\/p>\n<p>So we have the following documentation:<br \/>&#8211; an environmental report,<br \/>&#8211; a water and drainage report,<br \/>&#8211; a survey and homebuyers report,<br \/>&#8211; the information pack from the seller,<br \/>&#8211; all the mortgage information,<br \/>&#8211; information on buildings and contents insurance.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, today we&#8217;ve received a couple of quotes and information packs for life assurance and payment protection.  And my brain has just overloaded.  I can&#8217;t take any more!!!<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been some discussion recently about things called home information packs that the seller is supposed to put together.  I believe these are becoming mandatory for 3-bedroom houses just this week (if only we&#8217;d waited!!).  What a good idea this is! If our purchase had fallen through the searches we&#8217;ve done and paid for would have to be re-done and re-paid-for.  With a Home Information Pack it&#8217;s all done once and by the seller, which seems to make a whole world of sense to me.<\/p>\n<p>We are excited, we are thankful for the hugely privileged position that we find ourselves in in being able to buy a house in the first place, we&#8217;re particularly thankful for the house that we&#8217;ve found that meets our needs so well&#8230;but my brain really is quite full up now and I need a rest.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>A while ago I mentioned that we&#8217;d had an offer accepted on a house!  A quick update is due.<\/p>\n<p>The process has been moving along quite well.  We stalled a bit while we chose a mortgage but that&#8217;s applied for, the legal stuff has all moved along as it should, the survey is now done, and it seems that nothing can now stand in the way of our purchase (famous last words&#8230;you read them here!).<\/p>\n<p>My main feeling, other then excitement, is the completely overwhelming amount of information that&#8217;s involved.  We requested some extra reports and searches because the house:<br \/>&#8211; is near a flood plain (far enough from it to be safe though),<br \/>&#8211; is near the site of an old refuse site,<br \/>&#8211; has recently had an extension built.<\/p>\n<p>So we have the following documentation:<br \/>&#8211; an environmental report,<br \/>&#8211; a water and drainage report,<br \/>&#8211; a survey and homebuyers report,<br \/>&#8211; the information pack from the seller,<br \/>&#8211; all the mortgage information,<br \/>&#8211; information on buildings and contents insurance.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, today we&#8217;ve received a couple of quotes and information packs for life assurance and payment protection.  And my brain has just overloaded.  I can&#8217;t take any more!!!<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been some discussion recently about things called home information packs that the seller is supposed to put together.  I believe these are becoming mandatory for 3-bedroom houses just this week (if only we&#8217;d waited!!).  What a good idea this is! If our purchase had fallen through the searches we&#8217;ve done and paid for would have to be re-done and re-paid-for.  With a Home Information Pack it&#8217;s all done once and by the seller, which seems to make a whole world of sense to me.<\/p>\n<p>We are excited, we are thankful for the hugely privileged position that we find ourselves in in being able to buy a house in the first place, we&#8217;re particularly thankful for the house that we&#8217;ve found that meets our needs so well&#8230;but my brain really is quite full up now and I need a rest.<\/p>\n",

But that all seems to have changed lately.<\/p>\n<p>The last two weeks, since getting back from Greenbelt, have been one physical problem after another.  Starting with what appeared to be food poisoning or a stomach bug of some sort, morphing into a &#8220;flu-like virus&#8221; which has kept me in bed for most of this week, and then, having finally recovered from that, I did my back in, to the extent that I could hardly move last night (and I almost certainly shouldn&#8217;t be using a computer right now).<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been sick, aching, tired, emotionally drained and now in a huge amount of pain, for nearly two weeks.  Add this to the couple of weeks I had off earlier in the year for my stress\/depression (I&#8217;ll write a &#8220;whatever happened to post at some point&#8221;), and it&#8217;s been a pretty bad year for me health-wise.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, there are positives to take from all of this.  When I first started having my flu-like symptoms I said to Sally &#8220;I&#8217;m not very good at being ill&#8221;.  By which I meant that, my response to being unwell isn&#8217;t always very good.  I feel like I give up quite easily, but in reality I think I push myself too hard when I&#8217;m ill.  I&#8217;m NOT good at stopping and resting and doing nothing.  I feel guilty about not being at work and so I throw myself back into it too quickly.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve been learning about these things.  I started to recover last weekend and took up too much too quickly and the bug came back to get me as a result.  So I had a whole week off, and even when I started to feel myself again I made use of the doctor&#8217;s sick note and rested.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned to leave alone things that need doing around the house (it&#8217;s a bit of a tip at the moment but I don&#8217;t care!!!).  I&#8217;ve learned the pleasure of sitting still and reading a book.  I&#8217;ve learned not to feel guilty about not being at work &#8211; the world continues to turn even when I&#8217;m sat in bed doing nothing.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve prayed a lot, I&#8217;ve chilled out a lot.  Sally&#8217;s been fantastic, as have others who have rallied round to help me out.  It&#8217;s taken a long time but I do think it&#8217;s nearly over and I&#8217;m looking forward to carrying on normally, but with a few lessons learned.<\/p>\n",

But that all seems to have changed lately.<\/p>\n<p>The last two weeks, since getting back from Greenbelt, have been one physical problem after another.  Starting with what appeared to be food poisoning or a stomach bug of some sort, morphing into a &#8220;flu-like virus&#8221; which has kept me in bed for most of this week, and then, having finally recovered from that, I did my back in, to the extent that I could hardly move last night (and I almost certainly shouldn&#8217;t be using a computer right now).<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been sick, aching, tired, emotionally drained and now in a huge amount of pain, for nearly two weeks.  Add this to the couple of weeks I had off earlier in the year for my stress\/depression (I&#8217;ll write a &#8220;whatever happened to post at some point&#8221;), and it&#8217;s been a pretty bad year for me health-wise.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, there are positives to take from all of this.  When I first started having my flu-like symptoms I said to Sally &#8220;I&#8217;m not very good at being ill&#8221;.  By which I meant that, my response to being unwell isn&#8217;t always very good.  I feel like I give up quite easily, but in reality I think I push myself too hard when I&#8217;m ill.  I&#8217;m NOT good at stopping and resting and doing nothing.  I feel guilty about not being at work and so I throw myself back into it too quickly.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve been learning about these things.  I started to recover last weekend and took up too much too quickly and the bug came back to get me as a result.  So I had a whole week off, and even when I started to feel myself again I made use of the doctor&#8217;s sick note and rested.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned to leave alone things that need doing around the house (it&#8217;s a bit of a tip at the moment but I don&#8217;t care!!!).  I&#8217;ve learned the pleasure of sitting still and reading a book.  I&#8217;ve learned not to feel guilty about not being at work &#8211; the world continues to turn even when I&#8217;m sat in bed doing nothing.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve prayed a lot, I&#8217;ve chilled out a lot.  Sally&#8217;s been fantastic, as have others who have rallied round to help me out.  It&#8217;s taken a long time but I do think it&#8217;s nearly over and I&#8217;m looking forward to carrying on normally, but with a few lessons learned.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m sure I missed out on a lot of gags by not being familiar with some of the literary classics on which it&#8217;s quite heavily based (Bronte and Shakespear getting lots of mentions), but I still found it amusing and entertaining.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s clever in the sense that the book mashes together reality and fiction.  It&#8217;s set in Swindon, but it&#8217;s not quite the Swindon we know&#8230;or the United Kingdom that we know, for that matter.  Names, places, events, often sound familiar, but have been taken into a slightly-alternative reality. This skipping between reality and fiction is also a topic of the book.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not very good at reading, and it took so long that I&#8217;m sure I missed out on some meta-narratives, and was not able to appreciate the intricacies of the book.  But it was still a very entertaining read.<\/p>\n<p>Would I read it again? Or the next book in the series?  Possibly, but I was troubled throughout by the fact that I wasn&#8217;t quite getting it all because of my lack of literary knowledge, so I certainly won&#8217;t go straight to the library.

I&#8217;m sure I missed out on a lot of gags by not being familiar with some of the literary classics on which it&#8217;s quite heavily based (Bronte and Shakespear getting lots of mentions), but I still found it amusing and entertaining.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s clever in the sense that the book mashes together reality and fiction.  It&#8217;s set in Swindon, but it&#8217;s not quite the Swindon we know&#8230;or the United Kingdom that we know, for that matter.  Names, places, events, often sound familiar, but have been taken into a slightly-alternative reality. This skipping between reality and fiction is also a topic of the book.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not very good at reading, and it took so long that I&#8217;m sure I missed out on some meta-narratives, and was not able to appreciate the intricacies of the book.  But it was still a very entertaining read.<\/p>\n<p>Would I read it again? Or the next book in the series?  Possibly, but I was troubled throughout by the fact that I wasn&#8217;t quite getting it all because of my lack of literary knowledge, so I certainly won&#8217;t go straight to the library.  Recommend for the quirky, clever, and well-read reader.<\/p>\n",

Relevant Magazine doesn&#8217;t always hit the mark (more below) but this article explains an important difference between what the author calls &#8220;charity&#8221; (giving to help people in need) and &#8220;justice&#8221; (trying to fix the things that make charity needed).  It&#8217;s worth reading, thinking about, and taking action on.<\/p>\n<p>Having spoken at some length about &#8220;Christian&#8221; media in my Greenbelt post, I now mention Relevant Magazine again.  Relevant is a very-American media company who are publishing a couple of magazines, some books and resources, and a website, mostly aimed at a Christian audience but, as with Greenbelt, you could get lots from it if you weren&#8217;t following God in any kind of way.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes it misses the mark totally, but if you ignore the American-ness, the vast amounts of advertising (someone&#8217;s got to pay to make these things happen), and some of the less useful articles, there&#8217;s some useful, interesting, thought-provoking, and sometimes challenging stuff in there.<\/p>\n<p>I hope this article was in one of those categories.<\/p>\n",

Relevant is a very-American media company who are publishing a couple of magazines, some books and resources, and a website, mostly aimed at a Christian audience but, as with Greenbelt, you could get lots from it if you weren&#8217;t following God in any kind of way.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes it misses the mark totally, but if you ignore the American-ness, the vast amounts of advertising (someone&#8217;s got to pay to make these things happen), and some of the less useful articles, there&#8217;s some useful, interesting, thought-provoking, and sometimes challenging stuff in there.<\/p>\n<p>I hope this article was in one of those categories.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>Last weekend was my first outing to the festival known as &#8220;Greenbelt&#8221;.  In fact, it was my first real festival outing anywhere.<\/p>\n<p>Greenbelt is a music and arts festival.  But it needs a little bit more categorisation than that.  I shall explain.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A note on sub-cultures<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m always careful about talking about &#8220;Christian&#8221; stuff in a way that makes it sound like there&#8217;s a whole faith-based sub-culture around.  But the truth is that there IS.  There is music that you won&#8217;t have come across if you&#8217;re not a Christian.  There are books and magazines targeted at those of the faith.  There are websites and organisations and a whole host of other things. I think that, to some extent, this is OK and helpful.  It&#8217;s the same with cycling.  It&#8217;s probably the same with Kung Fu and plumbing and&#8230;well, every specialist activity probably has some sort of specialist media targeted at it.<\/p>\n<p>What I think is important is that we don&#8217;t get so wrapped up in the Christian sub-culture that we ignore everything else, or worse, label everything else as bad or evil in some way.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind I&#8217;ll try to describe my impressions of Greenbelt.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Impressions of the festival<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Before I went to Greenbelt I was under the impression that it was mostly attended by people who would call themselves Christians of one sort or another.  Yet I was led to believe that it was not an overtly &#8220;Christian&#8221; festival.  You&#8217;d fit in quite well if you weren&#8217;t a church go-er at all.<\/p>\n<p>To some extent those initial impressions turned out to be true.  However, when I arrived, I found myself swinging the other way.  There seems to be LOTS of stuff targeted specifically at Christians.  As time went on I found myself swinging back to the middle ground.  You can&#8217;t miss the stuff that&#8217;s overtly Christian, but I reckon you can safely attend and enjoy the festival without having any of this forced upon you.<\/p>\n<p>I did enjoy the festival, though I struggled with the social dynamics of trying to get a group of people to meet up at certain times when they all had plans that changed by the hour.  I think next time I&#8217;ll go with the aim of being more independent and if other people want to arrange to meet me at certain times then that&#8217;s fine.<\/p>\n<p>The weather for the festival was fantastic.  Sun and warmth and dryness for a few days with it clouding over for the last day.  As an introduction to festival life it was a very good one.  The company was excellent too and we got to meet up, catch up, and generally have fun with some of our best friends who had gathered from around the country.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Festival Discoveries<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We probably didn&#8217;t actually see or do as much as I thought we would.  We were quite selective and, often, got turned out of full-up venues.  Though we did discover, or re-discover, the following artists:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/michaelmcdermott\">Michael McDermott<\/a> &#8211; American accoustic rock guy with an edgy voice and some great tunes and songs.  Probably my highlight.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.martynjoseph.com\">Martyn Joseph<\/a> &#8211; We&#8217;re already big fans and he&#8217;s a Greenbelt regular so of course he was there and of course we went to see him.  He was mostly running a show where he interviewed other singer songwriters, but he did play a short set in the music shop tent.  He seems to be having a bit of a mid-life crisis; he&#8217;s started playing up-beat rock and roll (as opposed to his usual hard political folk).  But I like this.  He&#8217;s releasing a new album called &#8220;Vegas&#8221; in September and the stuff he played from it sounded really good.  Looking forward to a proper gig in November!<\/li>\n<li>John Bell &#8211; One of the leaders of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iona.org.uk\/\">Iona community<\/a>, gets a mention for being a REALLY good speaker.  He did a great talk looking at how we can interpret stories from Genesis and apply them to our faith that we live today.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/kathrynwilliams\">Kathryn Williams<\/a> &#8211; Referred to by one of my friends as one of the few &#8220;proper famous&#8221; people at Greenbelt.  I love this ladies voice and songs and dry wit, but I thought the overall performance needed polishing.  I think she was very nervous about performing a solo live show.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.coremagazine.org\/\">Core Magazine<\/a> &#8211; who look like an attempt at an english version of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.relevantmagazine.com\">Relevant Magazine<\/a>.  Compare the straplines &#8220;God, Life, Progressive Culture&#8221; (for Relevant) and &#8220;Life, Spirit, Adventure&#8221; (for Core).  I think this is a worthy venture and I wish them every success.  Unfortunately they don&#8217;t seem to have updated the website since April, so who knows what the status of it is.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.iainarcher.co.uk\/\">Iain Archer<\/a> &#8211; who&#8217;s one of those artists (like the Shins) who sounds a bit dull on CD but, as I&#8217;ve just found, does a great live show.  Perhaps I&#8217;ll look up some of his newer stuff.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",

        "content": "<p>Last weekend was my first outing to the festival known as &#8220;Greenbelt&#8221;.  In fact, it was my first real festival outing anywhere.<\/p>\n<p>Greenbelt is a music and arts festival.  But it needs a little bit more categorisation than that.  I shall explain.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A note on sub-cultures<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m always careful about talking about &#8220;Christian&#8221; stuff in a way that makes it sound like there&#8217;s a whole faith-based sub-culture around.  But the truth is that there IS.  There is music that you won&#8217;t have come across if you&#8217;re not a Christian.  There are books and magazines targeted at those of the faith.  There are websites and organisations and a whole host of other things. I think that, to some extent, this is OK and helpful.  It&#8217;s the same with cycling.  It&#8217;s probably the same with Kung Fu and plumbing and&#8230;well, every specialist activity probably has some sort of specialist media targeted at it.<\/p>\n<p>What I think is important is that we don&#8217;t get so wrapped up in the Christian sub-culture that we ignore everything else, or worse, label everything else as bad or evil in some way.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind I&#8217;ll try to describe my impressions of Greenbelt.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Impressions of the festival<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Before I went to Greenbelt I was under the impression that it was mostly attended by people who would call themselves Christians of one sort or another.  Yet I was led to believe that it was not an overtly &#8220;Christian&#8221; festival.  You&#8217;d fit in quite well if you weren&#8217;t a church go-er at all.<\/p>\n<p>To some extent those initial impressions turned out to be true.  However, when I arrived, I found myself swinging the other way.  There seems to be LOTS of stuff targeted specifically at Christians.  As time went on I found myself swinging back to the middle ground.  You can&#8217;t miss the stuff that&#8217;s overtly Christian, but I reckon you can safely attend and enjoy the festival without having any of this forced upon you.<\/p>\n<p>I did enjoy the festival, though I struggled with the social dynamics of trying to get a group of people to meet up at certain times when they all had plans that changed by the hour.  I think next time I&#8217;ll go with the aim of being more independent and if other people want to arrange to meet me at certain times then that&#8217;s fine.<\/p>\n<p>The weather for the festival was fantastic.  Sun and warmth and dryness for a few days with it clouding over for the last day.  As an introduction to festival life it was a very good one.  The company was excellent too and we got to meet up, catch up, and generally have fun with some of our best friends who had gathered from around the country.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Festival Discoveries<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We probably didn&#8217;t actually see or do as much as I thought we would.  We were quite selective and, often, got turned out of full-up venues.  Though we did discover, or re-discover, the following artists:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/michaelmcdermott\">Michael McDermott<\/a> &#8211; American accoustic rock guy with an edgy voice and some great tunes and songs.  Probably my highlight.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.martynjoseph.com\">Martyn Joseph<\/a> &#8211; We&#8217;re already big fans and he&#8217;s a Greenbelt regular so of course he was there and of course we went to see him.  He was mostly running a show where he interviewed other singer songwriters, but he did play a short set in the music shop tent.  He seems to be having a bit of a mid-life crisis; he&#8217;s started playing up-beat rock and roll (as opposed to his usual hard political folk).  But I like this.  He&#8217;s releasing a new album called &#8220;Vegas&#8221; in September and the stuff he played from it sounded really good.  Looking forward to a proper gig in November!<\/li>\n<li>John Bell &#8211; One of the leaders of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iona.org.uk\/\">Iona community<\/a>, gets a mention for being a REALLY good speaker.  He did a great talk looking at how we can interpret stories from Genesis and apply them to our faith that we live today.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/kathrynwilliams\">Kathryn Williams<\/a> &#8211; Referred to by one of my friends as one of the few &#8220;proper famous&#8221; people at Greenbelt.  I love this ladies voice and songs and dry wit, but I thought the overall performance needed polishing.  I think she was very nervous about performing a solo live show.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.coremagazine.org\/\">Core Magazine<\/a> &#8211; who look like an attempt at an english version of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.relevantmagazine.com\">Relevant Magazine<\/a>.  Compare the straplines &#8220;God, Life, Progressive Culture&#8221; (for Relevant) and &#8220;Life, Spirit, Adventure&#8221; (for Core).  I think this is a worthy venture and I wish them every success.  Unfortunately they don&#8217;t seem to have updated the website since April, so who knows what the status of it is.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.iainarcher.co.uk\/\">Iain Archer<\/a> &#8211; who&#8217;s one of those artists (like the Shins) who sounds a bit dull on CD but, as I&#8217;ve just found, does a great live show.  Perhaps I&#8217;ll look up some of his newer stuff.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>A friend of mine used to keep notes on books she had read and films she had seen.  I hope to occasionally jot down what I think of books, films, maybe music here.  Not reviews, but reminders to me of what the thing was about and what I thought of it.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve just finished reading &#8220;Velvet Elvis: Repainting the Christian Faith&#8221;, kindly loaned to me by a friend.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a book about&#8230;well, I&#8217;m not sure what.  It&#8217;s a general overview of what the author &#8211; the &#8220;pastor&#8221; of a large, fairly liberal church in Michigan &#8211; thinks about Christianity I suppose.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a controversial book for some.  I agreed with most of it but had problems with some things.  I&#8217;ll just give a very quick overview of the chapters (or &#8220;movements&#8221; as he calls them).  Forgive any use of church jargon that you don&#8217;t understand, it&#8217;s hard to talk about these things in a brief way without using words that either mean nothing or are loaded with meaning.<\/p>\n<p>The chapters have names, not numbers, and are as follows:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Jump <\/span>is about the building blocks of faith.  He touches on &#8220;creeds&#8221; (statements of faith) and explains how they are useful but need to be flexible (like springs, not bricks), and why it&#8217;s OK to have questions and why joy is important.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Yoke<\/span> is about different teachings, truth, and how it&#8217;s important to interpret the Bible.  By this he means both understanding what the writings would have meant to their original audience 2000 years ago, and in terms of re-applying what is said to our culture today.  His biblical, historical and cultural knowledge shines through the whole book and is very interesting.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">True<\/span>. I suspect this is a controversial chapter and I found it difficult myself &#8211; especially his notion of finding truth around us.  I agree that you can find elements of truth outside of what&#8217;s written in the Bible but he seems to think that, if it seems OK to you then you can call it truth.  I&#8217;m a bit more fundamental in that I think there is an ultimate truth to find, and that you can find things that are &#8220;good&#8221; outside of that truth, but not all the &#8220;good&#8221; things are &#8220;true&#8221;, or indeed helpful.  I do agree that we are too inflexible with our beliefs and application of truth and that this is bad, but I found Bell to be too soft with the general notion of truth itself.<\/p>\n<p>Other bits of this chapter were good with stuff about how God is everywhere but we don&#8217;t always recognise it, and about taking our faith with us into our whole lives&#8230;good stuff!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Tassels<\/span> is about being real with ourselves and healing of the soul.  There&#8217;s some of Rob Bell&#8217;s story of how he came to lead this huge church and then have a bit of a breakdown and what that all meant for him and how God helped him through it.  He explains how we also need to go through a similar process sometimes.  Pretty nitty-gritty stuff that&#8217;s easy to read and hard to actually be real with, but full of great truth.  Includes a great section about the sabbath!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dust <\/span>is about &#8220;discipleship&#8221;; that is, being called by and following in the teachings and life of Jesus.  Again, lots of historical and cultural background make some very interesting reading but other then a good feeling about being chosen, I didn&#8217;t feel it challenged me much.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">New<\/span> is about grace and the process of being &#8220;made new&#8221; which happens when we believe in Jesus.  Essentially about how we get forgiven for &#8220;sin&#8221; (the wrong stuff we&#8217;ve done)<br \/>and how, if we believe in Jesus, this happens by what God has done and not by anything that we do.  It&#8217;s about being who we were meant to be and making the world more like it was meant to be.  There&#8217;s a call to action in there somewhere and a challenge to be people who &#8220;bring heaven to earth&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Good<\/span> continues the theme talking about renewal and how heaven isn&#8217;t somewhere that we will be going, but rather somewhere that the earth will one day be.  It&#8217;s coming here, rather than we&#8217;re going there.  Rob Bell&#8217;s real frustration seems to come out here as he talks about what the &#8220;church&#8221; should be.  This is what it&#8217;s all about.  Creeds, teachings, truth, healing of the soul, discipleship, grace, all leading to us &#8211; people that follow Jesus &#8211; being people who lead a life of serving God and serving others in order to bring the goodness of heaven to earth.  Phew.<\/p>\n<p>I enjoyed the book.  It was a good and easy read.  Rob Bell writes in a very conversational style and obviously is a very knowledgeable and wise man.  I&#8217;d love to read more of his explaining of the Bible and the Jewish culture and traditions.<\/p>\n<p>A few things I didn&#8217;t like &#8211; aside from where I didn&#8217;t necessarily agree with him.<\/p>\n<p>I think he overuses metaphor.  Bricks, tassels, velvet Elvises, superpastors, tour guides.  It peters out after a while but at the start he really overdoes it, stretching the analogies further than the springs on his trampoline.<\/p>\n<p>And I think he&#8217;s not challenging enough.  He makes some good points but, as I said before, a warm feeling is about all I got.  Maybe it&#8217;s the conversational tone?  It made me want to think about things, not to actually change them.<\/p>\n<p>The overall feeling I&#8217;m left with is that he should be writing a different book.  Perhaps if he focussed more on the history and less on the philosophy I&#8217;d find him a better read?  But then, if he did that he&#8217;d be writing a completely different book.  And I think I quite liked the book.  But I might need a second read to be sure.  Martin, can I borrow it a bit longer???<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Book: Velvet Elvis by Rob Bell",
        "content": "<p>A friend of mine used to keep notes on books she had read and films she had seen.  I hope to occasionally jot down what I think of books, films, maybe music here.  Not reviews, but reminders to me of what the thing was about and what I thought of it.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve just finished reading &#8220;Velvet Elvis: Repainting the Christian Faith&#8221;, kindly loaned to me by a friend.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a book about&#8230;well, I&#8217;m not sure what.  It&#8217;s a general overview of what the author &#8211; the &#8220;pastor&#8221; of a large, fairly liberal church in Michigan &#8211; thinks about Christianity I suppose.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a controversial book for some.  I agreed with most of it but had problems with some things.  I&#8217;ll just give a very quick overview of the chapters (or &#8220;movements&#8221; as he calls them).  Forgive any use of church jargon that you don&#8217;t understand, it&#8217;s hard to talk about these things in a brief way without using words that either mean nothing or are loaded with meaning.<\/p>\n<p>The chapters have names, not numbers, and are as follows:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Jump <\/span>is about the building blocks of faith.  He touches on &#8220;creeds&#8221; (statements of faith) and explains how they are useful but need to be flexible (like springs, not bricks), and why it&#8217;s OK to have questions and why joy is important.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Yoke<\/span> is about different teachings, truth, and how it&#8217;s important to interpret the Bible.  By this he means both understanding what the writings would have meant to their original audience 2000 years ago, and in terms of re-applying what is said to our culture today.  His biblical, historical and cultural knowledge shines through the whole book and is very interesting.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">True<\/span>. I suspect this is a controversial chapter and I found it difficult myself &#8211; especially his notion of finding truth around us.  I agree that you can find elements of truth outside of what&#8217;s written in the Bible but he seems to think that, if it seems OK to you then you can call it truth.  I&#8217;m a bit more fundamental in that I think there is an ultimate truth to find, and that you can find things that are &#8220;good&#8221; outside of that truth, but not all the &#8220;good&#8221; things are &#8220;true&#8221;, or indeed helpful.  I do agree that we are too inflexible with our beliefs and application of truth and that this is bad, but I found Bell to be too soft with the general notion of truth itself.<\/p>\n<p>Other bits of this chapter were good with stuff about how God is everywhere but we don&#8217;t always recognise it, and about taking our faith with us into our whole lives&#8230;good stuff!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Tassels<\/span> is about being real with ourselves and healing of the soul.  There&#8217;s some of Rob Bell&#8217;s story of how he came to lead this huge church and then have a bit of a breakdown and what that all meant for him and how God helped him through it.  He explains how we also need to go through a similar process sometimes.  Pretty nitty-gritty stuff that&#8217;s easy to read and hard to actually be real with, but full of great truth.  Includes a great section about the sabbath!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dust <\/span>is about &#8220;discipleship&#8221;; that is, being called by and following in the teachings and life of Jesus.  Again, lots of historical and cultural background make some very interesting reading but other then a good feeling about being chosen, I didn&#8217;t feel it challenged me much.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">New<\/span> is about grace and the process of being &#8220;made new&#8221; which happens when we believe in Jesus.  Essentially about how we get forgiven for &#8220;sin&#8221; (the wrong stuff we&#8217;ve done)<br \/>and how, if we believe in Jesus, this happens by what God has done and not by anything that we do.  It&#8217;s about being who we were meant to be and making the world more like it was meant to be.  There&#8217;s a call to action in there somewhere and a challenge to be people who &#8220;bring heaven to earth&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Good<\/span> continues the theme talking about renewal and how heaven isn&#8217;t somewhere that we will be going, but rather somewhere that the earth will one day be.  It&#8217;s coming here, rather than we&#8217;re going there.  Rob Bell&#8217;s real frustration seems to come out here as he talks about what the &#8220;church&#8221; should be.  This is what it&#8217;s all about.  Creeds, teachings, truth, healing of the soul, discipleship, grace, all leading to us &#8211; people that follow Jesus &#8211; being people who lead a life of serving God and serving others in order to bring the goodness of heaven to earth.  Phew.<\/p>\n<p>I enjoyed the book.  It was a good and easy read.  Rob Bell writes in a very conversational style and obviously is a very knowledgeable and wise man.  I&#8217;d love to read more of his explaining of the Bible and the Jewish culture and traditions.<\/p>\n<p>A few things I didn&#8217;t like &#8211; aside from where I didn&#8217;t necessarily agree with him.<\/p>\n<p>I think he overuses metaphor.  Bricks, tassels, velvet Elvises, superpastors, tour guides.  It peters out after a while but at the start he really overdoes it, stretching the analogies further than the springs on his trampoline.<\/p>\n<p>And I think he&#8217;s not challenging enough.  He makes some good points but, as I said before, a warm feeling is about all I got.  Maybe it&#8217;s the conversational tone?  It made me want to think about things, not to actually change them.<\/p>\n<p>The overall feeling I&#8217;m left with is that he should be writing a different book.  Perhaps if he focussed more on the history and less on the philosophy I&#8217;d find him a better read?  But then, if he did that he&#8217;d be writing a completely different book.  And I think I quite liked the book.  But I might need a second read to be sure.  Martin, can I borrow it a bit longer???<\/p>\n",

A company that I&#8217;ve gone to in the past to get work done under warranty and to get servicing done in order to get the &#8220;Peugeot&#8221; stamp in the book.  I also had no reason to think that any other garage was going to give me better service.<\/p>\n<p>Having said that, the service was pretty bad.  In the past they have:<br \/> &#8211; failed to diagnose a serious fault;<br \/> &#8211; charged me vast labour charges for trivial jobs that I could have done myself;<br \/> &#8211; consistently not called me when they said they would &#8211; I always have to chase them on the phone;<br \/> &#8211; generally not shown much interest in customer service at all.<\/p>\n<p>I THINK that some of this is because they&#8217;re just too busy, but it leads to a complete lack of <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">trust<\/span> in their ability to do a good job.<\/p>\n<p>So, on the recommendation of several friends, I took my car to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.crossstreetgarage.co.uk\/\">Cross Street Garage<\/a> in Swindon.  I explained the situation, that the Peugeot people wanted to strip down a cylinder just to diagnose my rattle &#8211; which, in my opinion didn&#8217;t seem to be coming from the cylinders &#8211; and charge me upwards of \u00a3400 for doing it.  They said they would take a look and give me a call later on.<\/p>\n<p>And&#8230;true to their promise, they took a look.  The guy on the phone was actually the guy that took a look, and he said the rattle was coming from the top of the engine and that it was probably a spark-plug or an injector loose.  I gave him the go-ahead to do some further looking at it and he said he&#8217;d call me back.<\/p>\n<p>And&#8230;he called me back.  It WAS a loose spark plug.  He&#8217;s tightened it up and would charge me about \u00a330 labour for doing it.<\/p>\n<p>Now, that is what I expect from an &#8220;expert&#8221;.  This man not only saved me over \u00a3350 by taking a sensible approach to diagnosing the fault, but he&#8217;s done exactly what he said he would.  He may well have lost some money by not doing the bigger job, but he has my trust.  And my trust will win him more work in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Reflecting on this then; I work in the customer service industry &#8211; OK, I&#8217;m third line, which means that there are two layers of people our customers need to go through before they get to deal with me &#8211; but I have the chance to set, meet, and exceed, my customer&#8217;s expectations.  I&#8217;m incredibly busy, but doing these little jobs for people gets their trust, and makes them come back for more.<\/p>\n<p>There are probably loads of stories out there like this and it&#8217;s important to those of us that deal with customers that we&#8217;re constantly challenged by them.<\/p>\n<p>In the mean time &#8211; I think out car&#8217;s due a service now.  I wonder which garage I&#8217;ll be taking it to?!<\/p>\n",

In the past they have:<br \/> &#8211; failed to diagnose a serious fault;<br \/> &#8211; charged me vast labour charges for trivial jobs that I could have done myself;<br \/> &#8211; consistently not called me when they said they would &#8211; I always have to chase them on the phone;<br \/> &#8211; generally not shown much interest in customer service at all.<\/p>\n<p>I THINK that some of this is because they&#8217;re just too busy, but it leads to a complete lack of <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">trust<\/span> in their ability to do a good job.<\/p>\n<p>So, on the recommendation of several friends, I took my car to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.crossstreetgarage.co.uk\/\">Cross Street Garage<\/a> in Swindon.  I explained the situation, that the Peugeot people wanted to strip down a cylinder just to diagnose my rattle &#8211; which, in my opinion didn&#8217;t seem to be coming from the cylinders &#8211; and charge me upwards of \u00a3400 for doing it.  They said they would take a look and give me a call later on.<\/p>\n<p>And&#8230;true to their promise, they took a look.  The guy on the phone was actually the guy that took a look, and he said the rattle was coming from the top of the engine and that it was probably a spark-plug or an injector loose.  I gave him the go-ahead to do some further looking at it and he said he&#8217;d call me back.<\/p>\n<p>And&#8230;he called me back.  It WAS a loose spark plug.  He&#8217;s tightened it up and would charge me about \u00a330 labour for doing it.<\/p>\n<p>Now, that is what I expect from an &#8220;expert&#8221;.  This man not only saved me over \u00a3350 by taking a sensible approach to diagnosing the fault, but he&#8217;s done exactly what he said he would.  He may well have lost some money by not doing the bigger job, but he has my trust.  And my trust will win him more work in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Reflecting on this then; I work in the customer service industry &#8211; OK, I&#8217;m third line, which means that there are two layers of people our customers need to go through before they get to deal with me &#8211; but I have the chance to set, meet, and exceed, my customer&#8217;s expectations.  I&#8217;m incredibly busy, but doing these little jobs for people gets their trust, and makes them come back for more.<\/p>\n<p>There are probably loads of stories out there like this and it&#8217;s important to those of us that deal with customers that we&#8217;re constantly challenged by them.<\/p>\n<p>In the mean time &#8211; I think out car&#8217;s due a service now.  I wonder which garage I&#8217;ll be taking it to?!<\/p>\n",
        "excerpt": "<p>Back in this post at the end of June I mentioned that &#8220;[our car&#8217;s] engine has developed a nasty rattle which the garage want \u00a3200 just to take apart and diagnose (and then another \u00a3200 to put it back together).&#8221; I wanted to reflect on the process we went through to get this fixed.

Something was said during the TV commentary for the &#8220;prologue&#8221; (the time-trial around London to establish the leader before they properly set off) that sounded a bit weird.   They said that the cyclists were doing a two-hour warm-up on a turbo trainer before doing the time trial to get their heart rate up to optimal levels.<\/p>\n<p>This sounded weird because my heart rate shoots up pretty quickly when I start exercising so why it would take those guys 2 hours was a bit baffling.  And wouldn&#8217;t they be knackered after 2 hours?<\/p>\n<p>Well, today I did my longest cycle ride to date, to the village of Cholsey near Didcot, clocking 34.4 miles in just under 2 hours &#8211; a more than half-decent average of 17.7mph over the whole 2 hours!).  And what was weird was that I kinda got used to working hard and going fast.  After about an hour, I felt great &#8211; not tired as I thought I would be, and was able to sustain some pretty high speeds (for me) on the flat.  It was like, after warming up for some time some extra strength and energy kicked in.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m a novice sportsman and I don&#8217;t know what phenomenon caused this, but I certainly see how a long warm up period can really set you up for a longer ride.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty chuffed today.  I set out expecting  to average about 15mph.  My goal was to get there, not to get there quickly.  So do do under 2 hours was great &#8211; even with a tail wind and with it being more downhill than up.<\/p>\n<p>I might even be up to getting to Bath in a couple of weeks time?<\/p>\n<p>For those that care, the route is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikely.com\/maps\/bike-path\/64354\">here<\/a>.  Great weather, great scenery.  Oh, and I chickened out and got the train home.  Not ready for 70 milers just yet!<\/p>\n",

Something was said during the TV commentary for the &#8220;prologue&#8221; (the time-trial around London to establish the leader before they properly set off) that sounded a bit weird.   They said that the cyclists were doing a two-hour warm-up on a turbo trainer before doing the time trial to get their heart rate up to optimal levels.<\/p>\n<p>This sounded weird because my heart rate shoots up pretty quickly when I start exercising so why it would take those guys 2 hours was a bit baffling.  And wouldn&#8217;t they be knackered after 2 hours?<\/p>\n<p>Well, today I did my longest cycle ride to date, to the village of Cholsey near Didcot, clocking 34.4 miles in just under 2 hours &#8211; a more than half-decent average of 17.7mph over the whole 2 hours!).  And what was weird was that I kinda got used to working hard and going fast.  After about an hour, I felt great &#8211; not tired as I thought I would be, and was able to sustain some pretty high speeds (for me) on the flat.  It was like, after warming up for some time some extra strength and energy kicked in.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m a novice sportsman and I don&#8217;t know what phenomenon caused this, but I certainly see how a long warm up period can really set you up for a longer ride.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty chuffed today.  I set out expecting  to average about 15mph.  My goal was to get there, not to get there quickly.  So do do under 2 hours was great &#8211; even with a tail wind and with it being more downhill than up.<\/p>\n<p>I might even be up to getting to Bath in a couple of weeks time?<\/p>\n<p>For those that care, the route is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikely.com\/maps\/bike-path\/64354\">here<\/a>.  Great weather, great scenery.  Oh, and I chickened out and got the train home.  Not ready for 70 milers just yet!<\/p>\n",
