                "rendered": "<p>A couple of days&#8217; delay, but here&#8217;s part three.<\/p>\n<p>Today we find that you don&#8217;t have to use Twitter&#8217;s web site to use Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike Facebook, the makers of Twitter have allowed you to connect using other tools, and given others the ability to develop programs with which you can interact with Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>And people, in quite large numbers, have stepped up to the plate and developed lots of tools for using Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>The <a title=\"Twitter Fan Wiki\" href=\"http:\/\/twitter.pbworks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Fan Wiki<\/a> that I mentioned the other day lists many of them, but here&#8217;s a selection that I&#8217;ve used.\u00a0 Note that I&#8217;m not a Mac or iPhone user and there are plenty of tools for those gadgets. Some of the best tools use Adobe&#8217;s Air technology which sounds scary but isn&#8217;t and is worth installing.<\/p>\n<h3>Tweetdeck<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Tweetdeck\" href=\"http:\/\/www.tweetdeck.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Tweetdeck<\/a> is a pretty comprehensive Adobe Air tool that has many unique features.\u00a0 It allows you to create groups to split your &#8220;follows&#8221; up.\u00a0 It&#8217;s great if you follow lots of others and need to organise their messages.\u00a0 You can include searches and visit user profiles from the tool too.\u00a0 But, possibly one if the best things about it, is it now allows you to keep up with Facebook statuses too!<\/p>\n<p>Downsides?\u00a0 It takes up a lot of your screen and so is quite intrusive, and I didn&#8217;t find it particularly intuitive &#8211; and I couldn&#8217;t find a user guide!!<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>Tweetdeck has quickly grown and now contains lots of extra stuff.\u00a0 It can show you Facebook and Linked-In updates and pulls all that information together into a single application, which is quite neat.\u00a0 The problem with this is that Tweetdeck is growing as an application.\u00a0 It&#8217;s slower and still, in my opinion, a bit clunky.\u00a0 It doesn&#8217;t always get things right!\u00a0 Oh, and there&#8217;s an iPhone\/iPod Touch app too!<\/p>\n<h3>Twitterfox<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Twitterfox\" href=\"http:\/\/twitterfox.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitterfox<\/a> is a plug in for the Firefox Web Browser that sits in the corner and notifies you of messages being posted by those you follow.\u00a0 It&#8217;s pretty simple and much less intrusive and sits really nicely alongside your web browsing.<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>Twitterfox is now called &#8220;Echofon&#8221; and has a pretty neat and free iPhone\/iPod Touch application too.\u00a0 Worth checking out.<\/p>\n<h3>Twhirl<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Thwirl\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twhirl.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twhirl<\/a>, like Tweetdeck, is based on Adobe Air.\u00a0 It&#8217;s pretty and colourful and easy to set up and use.\u00a0 Simpler and more intuitive than Tweetdeck, but less powerful.\u00a0 A good tool for a new Twitterer.<\/p>\n<h3>TwitterGadget<\/h3>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t use Firefox but DO use iGoogle and want something integrated into your browser, then you can include the <a title=\"TwitterGadget\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twittergadget.com\" target=\"_blank\">TwitterGadget<\/a> on your iGoogle homepage.\u00a0 There are alternatives but this is the best I&#8217;ve found and it works pretty well.\u00a0 Though it&#8217;ll never be as good as a desktop application.<\/p>\n<h3>Twittai<\/h3>\n<p>At one point I wondered if there was a better way to do mobile Twitter than through a mini browser (You can go to http:\/\/m.twitter.com\/ if you have mobile internet), and I found <a title=\"Twittai\" href=\"http:\/\/twittai.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twittai<\/a>, which, as long as your phone has Java, and most do these days, does a splendid job.\u00a0 It&#8217;s disappeared from the Fan Wiki, but seems to still be available at its own website.<\/p>\n<p>There are LOADS more tools and I&#8217;ve not had anywhere near enough time to play with more than a few of them, but hopefully these tools are of some use to some of you.<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>My use of Twittai has dwindled as I&#8217;ve discovered <a title=\"Snaptu\" href=\"http:\/\/www.snaptu.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Snaptu<\/a>.\u00a0 Snaptu is a Java app that you can run on your mobile that has little plugins for things like Facebook, Twitter and reading news and sports results.\u00a0 It&#8217;s surprisingly good!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>A couple of days&#8217; delay, but here&#8217;s part three.<\/p>\n<p>Today we find that you don&#8217;t have to use Twitter&#8217;s web site to use Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike Facebook, the makers of Twitter have allowed you to connect using other tools, and given others the ability to develop programs with which you can interact with Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>And people, in quite large numbers, have stepped up to the plate and developed lots of tools for using Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>The <a title=\"Twitter Fan Wiki\" href=\"http:\/\/twitter.pbworks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Fan Wiki<\/a> that I mentioned the other day lists many of them, but here&#8217;s a selection that I&#8217;ve used.\u00a0 Note that I&#8217;m not a Mac or iPhone user and there are plenty of tools for those gadgets. Some of the best tools use Adobe&#8217;s Air technology which sounds scary but isn&#8217;t and is worth installing.<\/p>\n<h3>Tweetdeck<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Tweetdeck\" href=\"http:\/\/www.tweetdeck.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Tweetdeck<\/a> is a pretty comprehensive Adobe Air tool that has many unique features.\u00a0 It allows you to create groups to split your &#8220;follows&#8221; up.\u00a0 It&#8217;s great if you follow lots of others and need to organise their messages.\u00a0 You can include searches and visit user profiles from the tool too.\u00a0 But, possibly one if the best things about it, is it now allows you to keep up with Facebook statuses too!<\/p>\n<p>Downsides?\u00a0 It takes up a lot of your screen and so is quite intrusive, and I didn&#8217;t find it particularly intuitive &#8211; and I couldn&#8217;t find a user guide!!<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>Tweetdeck has quickly grown and now contains lots of extra stuff.\u00a0 It can show you Facebook and Linked-In updates and pulls all that information together into a single application, which is quite neat.\u00a0 The problem with this is that Tweetdeck is growing as an application.\u00a0 It&#8217;s slower and still, in my opinion, a bit clunky.\u00a0 It doesn&#8217;t always get things right!\u00a0 Oh, and there&#8217;s an iPhone\/iPod Touch app too!<\/p>\n<h3>Twitterfox<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Twitterfox\" href=\"http:\/\/twitterfox.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitterfox<\/a> is a plug in for the Firefox Web Browser that sits in the corner and notifies you of messages being posted by those you follow.\u00a0 It&#8217;s pretty simple and much less intrusive and sits really nicely alongside your web browsing.<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>Twitterfox is now called &#8220;Echofon&#8221; and has a pretty neat and free iPhone\/iPod Touch application too.\u00a0 Worth checking out.<\/p>\n<h3>Twhirl<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Thwirl\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twhirl.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twhirl<\/a>, like Tweetdeck, is based on Adobe Air.\u00a0 It&#8217;s pretty and colourful and easy to set up and use.\u00a0 Simpler and more intuitive than Tweetdeck, but less powerful.\u00a0 A good tool for a new Twitterer.<\/p>\n<h3>TwitterGadget<\/h3>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t use Firefox but DO use iGoogle and want something integrated into your browser, then you can include the <a title=\"TwitterGadget\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twittergadget.com\" target=\"_blank\">TwitterGadget<\/a> on your iGoogle homepage.\u00a0 There are alternatives but this is the best I&#8217;ve found and it works pretty well.\u00a0 Though it&#8217;ll never be as good as a desktop application.<\/p>\n<h3>Twittai<\/h3>\n<p>At one point I wondered if there was a better way to do mobile Twitter than through a mini browser (You can go to http:\/\/m.twitter.com\/ if you have mobile internet), and I found <a title=\"Twittai\" href=\"http:\/\/twittai.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twittai<\/a>, which, as long as your phone has Java, and most do these days, does a splendid job.\u00a0 It&#8217;s disappeared from the Fan Wiki, but seems to still be available at its own website.<\/p>\n<p>There are LOADS more tools and I&#8217;ve not had anywhere near enough time to play with more than a few of them, but hopefully these tools are of some use to some of you.<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>My use of Twittai has dwindled as I&#8217;ve discovered <a title=\"Snaptu\" href=\"http:\/\/www.snaptu.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Snaptu<\/a>.\u00a0 Snaptu is a Java app that you can run on your mobile that has little plugins for things like Facebook, Twitter and reading news and sports results.\u00a0 It&#8217;s surprisingly good!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>[If this gets picked up in the feed, sorry!\u00a0 This was the last post in the series and it never properly got finished.\u00a0 Better late than never.]<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve said a bit about what Twitter is and how it can be used.\u00a0 This final post acknowledges that, thought Twitter is very useful for certain things (and not very useful for a lot of other things), that occasional usefulness can come at a price&#8230;the world can follow you and see what you are saying\/thinking\/doing.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the guidelines that I stick to when thinking about how I use Twitter.<\/p>\n<h3>Openness<\/h3>\n<p>I guess the key here is that the world is watching, and you shouldn&#8217;t say anything that you wouldn&#8217;t mind being seen by anyone, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a friend or relative;<\/li>\n<li>a colleague or employer (or a former or potential employer);<\/li>\n<li>the press!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Most of the interesting people I follow talk about a specialist subject like cycling in an impersonal way.\u00a0 Either that or they share fairly trivial stuff about their lives.<\/p>\n<p>If it really comes to it you can &#8220;go private&#8221; (so you need to authorise people to follow you), and don&#8217;t forget there&#8217;s a delete button if you Tweet something you probably shouldn&#8217;t have.<\/p>\n<h3>Real names and searches<\/h3>\n<p>Remember that your username and tweets can be picked up by searches and other tools too!\u00a0 Do you want people Googling your name to find you on Twitter and subsequently everything you&#8217;ve ever Tweeted?<\/p>\n<p>I, personally, am slightly enigmatic in my online presence, choosing not to reveal my real name.\u00a0 Perhaps you&#8217;re happy with everything public, but you should at least think if that&#8217;s actually the case.<\/p>\n<h3>Followers<\/h3>\n<p>Some people think that follower numbers are the key.\u00a0 The more followers you have the more popular you are.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t buy this at all and would MUCH rather go for quality over quantity.\u00a0 But if you may be wanting to promote yourself or an organisation, in which case quantity is good!<\/p>\n<p>Even if your Tweets are public, Twitter will email you when you get a new follower and this is quite handy if you&#8217;re managing your followers.<\/p>\n<p>And managing followers can be important.\u00a0 Like email, Twitter is subject to &#8220;spam&#8221; or junk messages and followers and there are people you may want to &#8220;block&#8221; from following you.\u00a0 This is easily done with the click of a button.<\/p>\n<p>Spam was a real problem in Twitter&#8217;s early days, but it&#8217;s more under control now.\u00a0 That&#8217;s not to say that it still doesn&#8217;t exist and can be annoying.<\/p>\n<h3>Closing thoughts<\/h3>\n<p>Some people deride Twitter for being a waste of time and full of irrelevant nonsense.\u00a0 I can understand that people think this but I think it&#8217;s unfair of them to dismiss it so easily.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve found it to be quite useful in sharing information both from my locality and with common interests.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve found good tyre suppliers, made useful links with charitable organisations, been inspired by fellow cyclists and Christians, and I use it to keep up to date with a few friends too.<\/p>\n<p>I find it simpler and easier to use than Facebook, and, in some respects, more fun.<\/p>\n<p>But you do have to work at it somewhat.<\/p>\n<p>There are dangers to being public (which, remember, is not compulsory), but with a little wisdom Twitter can be useful and fun.<\/p>\n<p>As a final note, this post contained some wisdom &#8211; there is plenty more out there and some of it will conflict.\u00a0 They key thing is to work out what you want to achieve using Twitter and use it as a tool for that.<\/p>\n<p>See you online!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>It&#8217;s with some trepidation that I approach writing an article about my church mens&#8217; walking weekend.\u00a0 There are so many traps to fall into.\u00a0 Worn out cliches about men in caves and male bonding.\u00a0 Stereotypes of football-loving and beer-swigging blokes.\u00a0 And the risk of appearing sexist as I try to explain my way around the differences between men and women.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve decided to avoid trying to answer the question I&#8217;ve been asked so many times&#8230;&#8221;Why is it men only?&#8221;\u00a0 Let&#8217;s just start with the fact that, once a year, the men, and only the men, of our church are invited to head off together for a weekend of walking, eating and socialising.<\/p>\n<p>And, despite loving the outdoors, I&#8217;ve managed to miss this event for as long as I&#8217;ve been at the church.\u00a0 So, as soon as I learned the date of this years weekend I was booked on, and nothing was going to stop me.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Day 1<\/h3>\n<p>The early start came at the end of a long week but I was up and out of the door and looking forward to arriving in Devon for our first trek.<\/p>\n<p>We convened at the services on the way for a much needed coffee and some introductions before proceeding to Shipley Bridge for a days walking on Dartmoor.\u00a0 The walk started with a picturesque rise up a pretty valley with a sparkling, bubbling stream and we quickly lost the two budding photographers in the group.<\/p>\n<p>They soon caught us up again but their hobby was just one example of what was great about the weekend; though us men do have a lot in common, there was great diversity in the group.\u00a0 I spoke to chemists, martial arts instructors, magistrates, accountants, and several ordained ministers (all, bizarrely called David) and what a wealth of interests, wit and wisdom.\u00a0 It was great to get introduced to some friends of friends who had come along and to get to know better some people from USBC.\u00a0 There was rarely a dull moment.<\/p>\n<p>The highlight of the day was surely Tim&#8217;s lunchtime &#8220;dive&#8221; to retrieve a camera lens filter from the bottom of the river.\u00a0 Quite how it got there and why someone with a longer arm didn&#8217;t help out I don&#8217;t recall.<\/p>\n<p>After about 8 miles or so we were back at the cars and a short drive took us to the beautiful town of Salcombe.\u00a0 The Youth Hostel we were staying in was up a windy road in a building shared with a National Trust property.\u00a0 It was a great location with excellent views and I promptly chose a bed with a sea view.<\/p>\n<p>Now you might think that this sounds like an out-of-the-way, remote, beautiful location and that with all the peace and quiet, sea air, and a hard day&#8217;s walking behind us, we&#8217;d have a great night&#8217;s sleep.\u00a0 But noooooo.\u00a0 It soon became apparent that some of the party were in training for the 2012 Olympic snoring team.\u00a0 Rumour has it that I even took my duvet and de-camped to a sofa in the hostel&#8217;s lounge &#8211; much to the surprise of some children who wanted to watch the TV early the next morning.<\/p>\n<h3>Day 2<\/h3>\n<p>We awoke to glorious sunshine over the south Devon coast.\u00a0 The YHA put on a plentiful breakfast and did a good trade in ear plugs.\u00a0 We congregated with our rucksacks and began day 2.<\/p>\n<p>The walk was west along the south-west coast path to Hope (this is the name of the town, in case you were wondering) and then back, inland through Malborough, to Salcombe.<\/p>\n<p>I confess that I don&#8217;t remember much of the walk.\u00a0 The weather was glorious, the scenery spectacular, the conversation interesting, and racing the youngest of the group uphill extremely exhausting.\u00a0 Mental note: don&#8217;t try that again.\u00a0 Another mental note &#8211; don&#8217;t ever enter a competition with Steve&#8230;he&#8217;s a blatant cheat!<\/p>\n<p>We stopped for lunch in Hope Bay, a few popped to the pub briefly, and some others got lost and needed rounding up.<\/p>\n<p>The walk back wasn&#8217;t quite so interesting, though we saw lots of sheep and I got to hear what an abomination bungalows are.\u00a0 We were all quite glad to get back to the hostel for a cup of coffee.<\/p>\n<p>It was at around this point that someone started talking about 4-dimensional objects and I got dragged into giving a science lesson convering some of the trickier aspects of physics.\u00a0 An experience that has stuck with me.\u00a0 (Note to men: You all know about the theory of relativity now, so I&#8217;ll be preparing next years lesson on quantum physics!)<\/p>\n<p>Dinner was reasonable.\u00a0 After Buttermere YHA, my hopes for the hostel were a little high and probably not quite met.\u00a0 The evening ended with quizes, and games and I learned to play &#8220;Bucket King&#8221;&#8230;ask Tim if you REALLY want to know.<\/p>\n<p>The second night&#8217;s sleep was much better &#8211; I reckon most didn&#8217;t have the energy for snoring!<\/p>\n<h3>Day 3<\/h3>\n<p>Mixing it up a little, Sunday&#8217;s trip was across Salcome Estuary on a small ferry.\u00a0 The walking was slightly less energetic, and we explored the sandy beach and watched small dinghy&#8217;s racing.<\/p>\n<p>We gathered on a small grassy mound and were led in some devotions, songs, prayers and a simple service of communion.\u00a0 I confess that I was slightly self-concious, but it was good to be praising God in the open air on such a glorious day.<\/p>\n<p>We walked, east this time, round the coastal path and had lunch on a beautiful bay where some even unexpectedly indulged in a little swim.\u00a0 I&#8217;m hoping that someone brings a bigger towel next year, for the sake of anyone who was looking on!<\/p>\n<p>I was sad to leave that cove and start the final part of our expedition, but the weekened was drawing to a close.<\/p>\n<p>The walk back seemed long and slow, but we eventually arrived back at the cars.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d had a thoroughly enjoyable weekend with some great people, making new friends, and exploring the beautiful south coast of England.\u00a0 I was tired but refreshed.\u00a0 And already looking forward to next year&#8217;s trip!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>It&#8217;s with some trepidation that I approach writing an article about my church mens&#8217; walking weekend.\u00a0 There are so many traps to fall into.\u00a0 Worn out cliches about men in caves and male bonding.\u00a0 Stereotypes of football-loving and beer-swigging blokes.\u00a0 And the risk of appearing sexist as I try to explain my way around the differences between men and women.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve decided to avoid trying to answer the question I&#8217;ve been asked so many times&#8230;&#8221;Why is it men only?&#8221;\u00a0 Let&#8217;s just start with the fact that, once a year, the men, and only the men, of our church are invited to head off together for a weekend of walking, eating and socialising.<\/p>\n<p>And, despite loving the outdoors, I&#8217;ve managed to miss this event for as long as I&#8217;ve been at the church.\u00a0 So, as soon as I learned the date of this years weekend I was booked on, and nothing was going to stop me.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Day 1<\/h3>\n<p>The early start came at the end of a long week but I was up and out of the door and looking forward to arriving in Devon for our first trek.<\/p>\n<p>We convened at the services on the way for a much needed coffee and some introductions before proceeding to Shipley Bridge for a days walking on Dartmoor.\u00a0 The walk started with a picturesque rise up a pretty valley with a sparkling, bubbling stream and we quickly lost the two budding photographers in the group.<\/p>\n<p>They soon caught us up again but their hobby was just one example of what was great about the weekend; though us men do have a lot in common, there was great diversity in the group.\u00a0 I spoke to chemists, martial arts instructors, magistrates, accountants, and several ordained ministers (all, bizarrely called David) and what a wealth of interests, wit and wisdom.\u00a0 It was great to get introduced to some friends of friends who had come along and to get to know better some people from USBC.\u00a0 There was rarely a dull moment.<\/p>\n<p>The highlight of the day was surely Tim&#8217;s lunchtime &#8220;dive&#8221; to retrieve a camera lens filter from the bottom of the river.\u00a0 Quite how it got there and why someone with a longer arm didn&#8217;t help out I don&#8217;t recall.<\/p>\n<p>After about 8 miles or so we were back at the cars and a short drive took us to the beautiful town of Salcombe.\u00a0 The Youth Hostel we were staying in was up a windy road in a building shared with a National Trust property.\u00a0 It was a great location with excellent views and I promptly chose a bed with a sea view.<\/p>\n<p>Now you might think that this sounds like an out-of-the-way, remote, beautiful location and that with all the peace and quiet, sea air, and a hard day&#8217;s walking behind us, we&#8217;d have a great night&#8217;s sleep.\u00a0 But noooooo.\u00a0 It soon became apparent that some of the party were in training for the 2012 Olympic snoring team.\u00a0 Rumour has it that I even took my duvet and de-camped to a sofa in the hostel&#8217;s lounge &#8211; much to the surprise of some children who wanted to watch the TV early the next morning.<\/p>\n<h3>Day 2<\/h3>\n<p>We awoke to glorious sunshine over the south Devon coast.\u00a0 The YHA put on a plentiful breakfast and did a good trade in ear plugs.\u00a0 We congregated with our rucksacks and began day 2.<\/p>\n<p>The walk was west along the south-west coast path to Hope (this is the name of the town, in case you were wondering) and then back, inland through Malborough, to Salcombe.<\/p>\n<p>I confess that I don&#8217;t remember much of the walk.\u00a0 The weather was glorious, the scenery spectacular, the conversation interesting, and racing the youngest of the group uphill extremely exhausting.\u00a0 Mental note: don&#8217;t try that again.\u00a0 Another mental note &#8211; don&#8217;t ever enter a competition with Steve&#8230;he&#8217;s a blatant cheat!<\/p>\n<p>We stopped for lunch in Hope Bay, a few popped to the pub briefly, and some others got lost and needed rounding up.<\/p>\n<p>The walk back wasn&#8217;t quite so interesting, though we saw lots of sheep and I got to hear what an abomination bungalows are.\u00a0 We were all quite glad to get back to the hostel for a cup of coffee.<\/p>\n<p>It was at around this point that someone started talking about 4-dimensional objects and I got dragged into giving a science lesson convering some of the trickier aspects of physics.\u00a0 An experience that has stuck with me.\u00a0 (Note to men: You all know about the theory of relativity now, so I&#8217;ll be preparing next years lesson on quantum physics!)<\/p>\n<p>Dinner was reasonable.\u00a0 After Buttermere YHA, my hopes for the hostel were a little high and probably not quite met.\u00a0 The evening ended with quizes, and games and I learned to play &#8220;Bucket King&#8221;&#8230;ask Tim if you REALLY want to know.<\/p>\n<p>The second night&#8217;s sleep was much better &#8211; I reckon most didn&#8217;t have the energy for snoring!<\/p>\n<h3>Day 3<\/h3>\n<p>Mixing it up a little, Sunday&#8217;s trip was across Salcome Estuary on a small ferry.\u00a0 The walking was slightly less energetic, and we explored the sandy beach and watched small dinghy&#8217;s racing.<\/p>\n<p>We gathered on a small grassy mound and were led in some devotions, songs, prayers and a simple service of communion.\u00a0 I confess that I was slightly self-concious, but it was good to be praising God in the open air on such a glorious day.<\/p>\n<p>We walked, east this time, round the coastal path and had lunch on a beautiful bay where some even unexpectedly indulged in a little swim.\u00a0 I&#8217;m hoping that someone brings a bigger towel next year, for the sake of anyone who was looking on!<\/p>\n<p>I was sad to leave that cove and start the final part of our expedition, but the weekened was drawing to a close.<\/p>\n<p>The walk back seemed long and slow, but we eventually arrived back at the cars.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d had a thoroughly enjoyable weekend with some great people, making new friends, and exploring the beautiful south coast of England.\u00a0 I was tired but refreshed.\u00a0 And already looking forward to next year&#8217;s trip!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>The infrequency with which I write about politics does not to justice to how important I think it is.\u00a0 The last few weeks have been fairly tumuluous politically and today I got to vote in the European elections so maybe it&#8217;s time to reflect a little on things.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Where I stand<\/h3>\n<p>Before you get carried away &#8211; I&#8217;m NOT standing in the European elections.\u00a0 Phew!<\/p>\n<p>But I did a little political orientation test night and came out as slightly &#8220;left&#8221; and slightly &#8220;libertarian&#8221;, somewhere near Ghandi I think.<\/p>\n<p>I place a large amount of value in honesty and trustworhtiness, and I dislike party politics and the bickering we so often see that, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, wastes time and money and gets in the way of government of our country.<\/p>\n<p>I like my leaders to be good at making decisions about things and sticking to those decisions once made, but I also believe that it&#8217;s OK to get things wrong and that humility, apologies and a desire to learn from mistakes and put things right counts for much too.<\/p>\n<h3>Expenses<\/h3>\n<p>So from that you can probably guess that I&#8217;m not hugely impressed with the expenses scandal.\u00a0 On two fronts:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The system is bloody awful.\u00a0 Any commercial organisation would have a strict policy on what is and isn&#8217;t allowed, expenses-wise, backed up by a bunch of people who check expenses about that policy.\u00a0 Repeated breach of policy results in disciplinary action&#8230;and so on.\u00a0 What&#8217;s so hard?\u00a0 Why is our government not run like a business?\u00a0 We can&#8217;t see money leaking away like this!<\/li>\n<li>The MPs, at least those who&#8217;ve been caught being naughty, are dishonest and untrustworthy.\u00a0 They&#8217;ve manipulated the system for personal gain.\u00a0 If I did this with my expenses I&#8217;d be fired!\u00a0 But more than that, I wouldn&#8217;t do that with my expenses because it&#8217;s WRONG!\u00a0 But worse than that, it shows how out of touch politicians are.\u00a0 There are people that can&#8217;t afford their rent or mortgage, yet alone for gardeners, cleaners, or huge amounts of expensive food.\u00a0 It is, frankly, unjust.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve worked on customer site for months at a time.\u00a0 It&#8217;s tough leading a double life in two different places and having somewhere nice to live makes it much nicer.\u00a0 But there are limits.<\/p>\n<h3>Our PM<\/h3>\n<p>As I write, James Purnell has just resigned from government and called for Gordon Brown to step down, and I&#8217;ve no doubt that our Prime Minister will not last the weekend in his post.<\/p>\n<p>I actually like Gordon Brown, I think he has potential to be a good PM.\u00a0 But I find that he&#8217;s useless at making decisions.\u00a0 He seems to sway between opinions and not make his mind up, or make his mind up too late.\u00a0 In contrast, David Cameron is quick, sharp, decisive.\u00a0 I&#8217;m not sure either has enough well-defined policies for me to want to vote for them. Despite being a leftie, if given the choice I think I&#8217;d vote Cameron!<\/p>\n<h3>So who to vote for<\/h3>\n<p>But, no&#8230;I can&#8217;t bring myself to vote Tory.\u00a0 The expenses stuff has just reinforced that they&#8217;re mostly rich people who don&#8217;t have a clue about the real world.<\/p>\n<p>I probably should vote Labour, but I think the party is in disarray and I can&#8217;t bring myself to do that either.<\/p>\n<p>BNP and UKIP are definite no-go areas.\u00a0 So of the well-known parties I&#8217;m left with Lib Dems and Greens.<\/p>\n<p>Both of which are quite appealing!<\/p>\n<h3>So&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>Of course, I&#8217;m not saying what I decided.\u00a0 I DID vote though, I think it&#8217;s hugely important to be a part of the political process.\u00a0 I shall be making sure my elected representatives do represent me too by writing and expressing my views.<\/p>\n<p>And I shall be praying.\u00a0 Our leaders need any help they can get right now!<\/p>\n",

Despite being a leftie, if given the choice I think I&#8217;d vote Cameron!<\/p>\n<h3>So who to vote for<\/h3>\n<p>But, no&#8230;I can&#8217;t bring myself to vote Tory.\u00a0 The expenses stuff has just reinforced that they&#8217;re mostly rich people who don&#8217;t have a clue about the real world.<\/p>\n<p>I probably should vote Labour, but I think the party is in disarray and I can&#8217;t bring myself to do that either.<\/p>\n<p>BNP and UKIP are definite no-go areas.\u00a0 So of the well-known parties I&#8217;m left with Lib Dems and Greens.<\/p>\n<p>Both of which are quite appealing!<\/p>\n<h3>So&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>Of course, I&#8217;m not saying what I decided.\u00a0 I DID vote though, I think it&#8217;s hugely important to be a part of the political process.\u00a0 I shall be making sure my elected representatives do represent me too by writing and expressing my views.<\/p>\n<p>And I shall be praying.\u00a0 Our leaders need any help they can get right now!<\/p>\n",

Does he want a high-five?\u00a0 What should I do?<\/p>\n<p>No time to change my mind now&#8230;I&#8217;m going.\u00a0 I&#8217;ll give a cheery &#8220;Thanks mate&#8221; as I go past.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Thanks mate!!!!!!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Hang on.\u00a0 What WAS he doing?\u00a0 I know I&#8217;ll look back.<\/p>\n<p>CRIKEY!!! He&#8217;s just completed a right turn into that field.\u00a0 I could have been run down!!!<\/p>\n<p>Oo-err.<\/p>\n<p>In hindsight, the poor tractor driver did exactly the right thing and gave the clearest possible signal that he could.\u00a0 I simply didn&#8217;t get it.\u00a0 I&#8217;m not used to seeing hand signals from vehicles, and I&#8217;m not used to seeing vehicles turn right where there&#8217;s nowhere to turn into.<\/p>\n<p>Still, I&#8217;m safe, and I&#8217;ve learned something.<\/p>\n<p>Stupid cyclists!!!<\/p>\n",

Does he want a high-five?\u00a0 What should I do?<\/p>\n<p>No time to change my mind now&#8230;I&#8217;m going.\u00a0 I&#8217;ll give a cheery &#8220;Thanks mate&#8221; as I go past.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Thanks mate!!!!!!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Hang on.\u00a0 What WAS he doing?\u00a0 I know I&#8217;ll look back.<\/p>\n<p>CRIKEY!!! He&#8217;s just completed a right turn into that field.\u00a0 I could have been run down!!!<\/p>\n<p>Oo-err.<\/p>\n<p>In hindsight, the poor tractor driver did exactly the right thing and gave the clearest possible signal that he could.\u00a0 I simply didn&#8217;t get it.\u00a0 I&#8217;m not used to seeing hand signals from vehicles, and I&#8217;m not used to seeing vehicles turn right where there&#8217;s nowhere to turn into.<\/p>\n<p>Still, I&#8217;m safe, and I&#8217;ve learned something.<\/p>\n<p>Stupid cyclists!!!<\/p>\n",

Partly because I want to remember what&#8217;s happened, so that I can refer back when I need to.  And partly for the benefit of others.  When people want to know what our holiday in such-and-such a place was like, where we stayed and ate, and what we enjoyed and learned, I can just refer them here.<\/p>\n<p>So comes my write up of a week in Wicklow, on the East Coast of Ireland.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Introduction: Cottages and Caches<\/h3>\n<p>We love Ireland.  I&#8217;ve visited the Dingle Peninsula in the south-west twice now, once with lovely wife and once, many years ago, with others.  We&#8217;ve done Northern Ireland, and so, this year, we thought we&#8217;d try the east coast.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d heard good things about Wicklow and there&#8217;s a national park with some mountains in, so we booked some time off, a small cottage, and a ferry, and planned our trip away.<\/p>\n<p>Finding a cottage for two is hard.  Most are much bigger, or really pokey and small, so we booked into a 4-bed cottage, accepting the extra cost as the price for some extra space.<\/p>\n<p>We got online and bought some Ordnance Survey of Ireland, 1:50,000, &#8220;Explorer&#8221; maps, and a Harvey map of the Wicklow Mountains.  We ordered a book of mountain walks too, but it didn&#8217;t arrive in time.  Our experience of walking in Ireland is that it&#8217;s not as easy as the UK &#8211; land is less accessible, paths are not as clear, and maps are not as easy to get hold of, so we wanted as much information as we could get up front.<\/p>\n<p>We also managed to get hold of a GPS receiver.  After our long weekend in the Lakes with some friends who introduced us to the &#8220;sport&#8221; of Geocaching, we&#8217;ve been wanting to incorporate some geocaching of our own into a holiday.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, our birthdays are both in early June and some very kind people clubbed together to get us a Garmin eTrex Legend H: slightly above the basic model with mapping capability and some geocaching features.<\/p>\n<p>We printed out details of a pile of caches before we went, as access to the Internet and a printer was not expected to be easy to find.<\/p>\n<p>So, booked, packed, equipped, and informed, we expectantly headed to bed early on Friday night.<\/p>\n",

Partly because I want to remember what&#8217;s happened, so that I can refer back when I need to.  And partly for the benefit of others.  When people want to know what our holiday in such-and-such a place was like, where we stayed and ate, and what we enjoyed and learned, I can just refer them here.<\/p>\n<p>So comes my write up of a week in Wicklow, on the East Coast of Ireland.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Introduction: Cottages and Caches<\/h3>\n<p>We love Ireland.  I&#8217;ve visited the Dingle Peninsula in the south-west twice now, once with lovely wife and once, many years ago, with others.  We&#8217;ve done Northern Ireland, and so, this year, we thought we&#8217;d try the east coast.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d heard good things about Wicklow and there&#8217;s a national park with some mountains in, so we booked some time off, a small cottage, and a ferry, and planned our trip away.<\/p>\n<p>Finding a cottage for two is hard.  Most are much bigger, or really pokey and small, so we booked into a 4-bed cottage, accepting the extra cost as the price for some extra space.<\/p>\n<p>We got online and bought some Ordnance Survey of Ireland, 1:50,000, &#8220;Explorer&#8221; maps, and a Harvey map of the Wicklow Mountains.  We ordered a book of mountain walks too, but it didn&#8217;t arrive in time.  Our experience of walking in Ireland is that it&#8217;s not as easy as the UK &#8211; land is less accessible, paths are not as clear, and maps are not as easy to get hold of, so we wanted as much information as we could get up front.<\/p>\n<p>We also managed to get hold of a GPS receiver.  After our long weekend in the Lakes with some friends who introduced us to the &#8220;sport&#8221; of Geocaching, we&#8217;ve been wanting to incorporate some geocaching of our own into a holiday.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, our birthdays are both in early June and some very kind people clubbed together to get us a Garmin eTrex Legend H: slightly above the basic model with mapping capability and some geocaching features.<\/p>\n<p>We printed out details of a pile of caches before we went, as access to the Internet and a printer was not expected to be easy to find.<\/p>\n<p>So, booked, packed, equipped, and informed, we expectantly headed to bed early on Friday night.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<h3>An Early Start<\/h3>\n<p>It was an early start on the first Saturday.  Holidays shouldn&#8217;t start so early, but as my sister said, it meant that we didn&#8217;t just spend the whole day travelling, and we got there with some hours to relax and find our way around before bedtime.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>We were crossing from Fishguard to Rosslare on the Ferry with our little car.  We toyed with doing Rail-Sail, which worked out pretty cheap, but by the time you&#8217;ve taken into account hiring a car at the other end and the inflexibility of having to carry all your luggage, the ferry wasn&#8217;t too bad in terms of value.<\/p>\n<h3>On and on<\/h3>\n<p>The M4 goes on much longer than I thought.  And Wales goes on much further than that!  I know that this is a generalisation, but people drive crazy in Wales &#8211; they go much faster than mandatory speed limits, even where these are explicitly for safety reasons.<\/p>\n<p>Traffic was very quiet so early in the morning and we arrived nice and early.  Ports aren&#8217;t great places to have to spend a couple of hours, but we waited around at Fishguard, enjoying a cuppa and a pastry, and passing the time with a game of cribbage (which we&#8217;ve recently discovered).<\/p>\n<h3>Food for thought<\/h3>\n<p>Eventually we got going.  The crossing &#8211; on the &#8220;express&#8221; ferry &#8211; was good (actually, in hindsight and with the experience of the crossing back, it wasn&#8217;t THAT good) but we both felt sea sick &#8211; which has never happened to me before.  At first we wondered if we were hungry, so we ordered some nice-looking pies, but nether of us could face eating more than half of it.  We resorted to standing on deck, and wishing it would be over quickly.<\/p>\n<p>We were on time into Rosslare.  We disembarked and had a quick and easy, journey to Blackditch &#8211; our home for the week &#8211; via the surprisingly-large town of Arklow.  The good old Irish supermarket &#8220;Supa Value&#8221; is still here but, further down the road was evidence that Tesco is taking over this country too.  Food is EXPENSIVE here &#8211; the weak pound contributes, but even so, the number of Euros we were paying was high!!!<\/p>\n<h3>Cottages and Games<\/h3>\n<p>Blackditch turned out to be less of a village and more an un-signed collection of houses.  We drove passed at first but eventually worked out where we needed to be and we were welcomed by our landlord for the week.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shamrockcottages.co.uk\/properties\/wicklow\/wicklow-1\/\">The cottage<\/a> we stayed in was lovely and the pictures on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shamrockcottages.co.uk\/\">Shamrock Cottages<\/a> website didn&#8217;t do it justice.  We were expecting much smaller bedrooms, but the whole place was much bigger than we expected.<\/p>\n<p>The weather was fine and we sat outside and had a restful afternoon.  The evening was spent playing my new, birthday-present card game, Munchkin: A possibly slightly over-complicated parody of fantasy role-playing games, which is fun but, we thing, more fun with 3 or more players.<\/p>\n<p>After an early morning we had an early night and were looking forward to exploring County Wicklow in the days to come.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h3>An Early Start<\/h3>\n<p>It was an early start on the first Saturday.  Holidays shouldn&#8217;t start so early, but as my sister said, it meant that we didn&#8217;t just spend the whole day travelling, and we got there with some hours to relax and find our way around before bedtime.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>We were crossing from Fishguard to Rosslare on the Ferry with our little car.  We toyed with doing Rail-Sail, which worked out pretty cheap, but by the time you&#8217;ve taken into account hiring a car at the other end and the inflexibility of having to carry all your luggage, the ferry wasn&#8217;t too bad in terms of value.<\/p>\n<h3>On and on<\/h3>\n<p>The M4 goes on much longer than I thought.  And Wales goes on much further than that!  I know that this is a generalisation, but people drive crazy in Wales &#8211; they go much faster than mandatory speed limits, even where these are explicitly for safety reasons.<\/p>\n<p>Traffic was very quiet so early in the morning and we arrived nice and early.  Ports aren&#8217;t great places to have to spend a couple of hours, but we waited around at Fishguard, enjoying a cuppa and a pastry, and passing the time with a game of cribbage (which we&#8217;ve recently discovered).<\/p>\n<h3>Food for thought<\/h3>\n<p>Eventually we got going.  The crossing &#8211; on the &#8220;express&#8221; ferry &#8211; was good (actually, in hindsight and with the experience of the crossing back, it wasn&#8217;t THAT good) but we both felt sea sick &#8211; which has never happened to me before.  At first we wondered if we were hungry, so we ordered some nice-looking pies, but nether of us could face eating more than half of it.  We resorted to standing on deck, and wishing it would be over quickly.<\/p>\n<p>We were on time into Rosslare.  We disembarked and had a quick and easy, journey to Blackditch &#8211; our home for the week &#8211; via the surprisingly-large town of Arklow.  The good old Irish supermarket &#8220;Supa Value&#8221; is still here but, further down the road was evidence that Tesco is taking over this country too.  Food is EXPENSIVE here &#8211; the weak pound contributes, but even so, the number of Euros we were paying was high!!!<\/p>\n<h3>Cottages and Games<\/h3>\n<p>Blackditch turned out to be less of a village and more an un-signed collection of houses.  We drove passed at first but eventually worked out where we needed to be and we were welcomed by our landlord for the week.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shamrockcottages.co.uk\/properties\/wicklow\/wicklow-1\/\">The cottage<\/a> we stayed in was lovely and the pictures on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shamrockcottages.co.uk\/\">Shamrock Cottages<\/a> website didn&#8217;t do it justice.  We were expecting much smaller bedrooms, but the whole place was much bigger than we expected.<\/p>\n<p>The weather was fine and we sat outside and had a restful afternoon.  The evening was spent playing my new, birthday-present card game, Munchkin: A possibly slightly over-complicated parody of fantasy role-playing games, which is fun but, we thing, more fun with 3 or more players.<\/p>\n<p>After an early morning we had an early night and were looking forward to exploring County Wicklow in the days to come.<\/p>\n",
