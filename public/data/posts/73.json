We started out on Sustrans&#8217; National Cycle route 45, which is great BUT, in their wonderful efforts to get you off road as much as possible they don&#8217;t half put you on some narrow and gravelly tracks.  You can&#8217;t get much speed up at all on some of these.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; the NCN is a GREAT thing but sometimes you have to be a bit creative to get where you want in the way that you want.<\/p>\n<p>Good ride though!<\/p>\n",

We were feeling good so carried on to South Cerney and came back via Purton!  Sal was pretty knackered by the end of it but other than a bit of pain from rubbing shorts and a warm glow I was pretty OK.<\/p>\n<p>Route is on Google maps <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.co.uk\/maps\/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;amp;z=11&amp;ll=51.618017,-1.860123&amp;spn=0.188015,0.460739&amp;om=1&amp;msid=108876964125384530584.000001123e145258fa26d&amp;msa=0\">here<\/a>.   I couldn&#8217;t work out how to extend an existing line so I ended up with 6 lines but should give you some idea of the route.<\/p>\n<p>We managed to avoid the nearby <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.co.uk\/maps\/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;om=1&amp;z=17&amp;ll=51.578303,-1.808367&amp;spn=0.00294,0.007199&amp;t=k&amp;msid=108876964125384530584.000001123e145258fa26d&amp;msa=0\">low flying aircraft<\/a> &#8211; which I suspect won&#8217;t be on the aerial footage for ever but it is for now.<\/p>\n<p>One thing that bothered me today.  We started out on Sustrans&#8217; National Cycle route 45, which is great BUT, in their wonderful efforts to get you off road as much as possible they don&#8217;t half put you on some narrow and gravelly tracks.  You can&#8217;t get much speed up at all on some of these.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; the NCN is a GREAT thing but sometimes you have to be a bit creative to get where you want in the way that you want.<\/p>\n<p>Good ride though!<\/p>\n",

There was no reason for it. I can only put it in the category of &#8220;depression&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Theories:<br \/>1) a combination of tiredness, stress, fighting off a bug, giving blood on Wednesday night, and hundred other things&#8230;I&#8217;ve not slept well for about 3 nights now.<br \/>2) my hay fever tablets.  I take loratadine, and have been on them on-and-off for a week or two.  After Googling them Sally found that they can cause depression.  Perhaps taking them after giving blood (and thus having a higher concentration of the stuff in my blood) made me really low.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway.  We eventually decided to both stay at home (which I feel very bad about).  We&#8217;ve sat around in the garden, read the paper, enjoyed the nesting birds (more later), and written a few letters.<\/p>\n<p>I can now empathise with people who&#8217;ve had depression.

There was no reason for it. I can only put it in the category of &#8220;depression&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Theories:<br \/>1) a combination of tiredness, stress, fighting off a bug, giving blood on Wednesday night, and hundred other things&#8230;I&#8217;ve not slept well for about 3 nights now.<br \/>2) my hay fever tablets.  I take loratadine, and have been on them on-and-off for a week or two.  After Googling them Sally found that they can cause depression.  Perhaps taking them after giving blood (and thus having a higher concentration of the stuff in my blood) made me really low.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway.  We eventually decided to both stay at home (which I feel very bad about).  We&#8217;ve sat around in the garden, read the paper, enjoyed the nesting birds (more later), and written a few letters.<\/p>\n<p>I can now empathise with people who&#8217;ve had depression.  It was scary feeling out of control of my emotions.  Just crying for no reason at all!<\/p>\n<p>I can only hope that it doesn&#8217;t come back.<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s been a big move, from the centre of London to a small, new town in the west.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve long been sceptical of Swindon but I&#8217;m starting to see what a good move it is.<\/p>\n<p>Things I&#8217;m (re)discovering: cycling, gyms, the outdoors, gardens, being involved in a music group at church.<\/p>\n<p>My intention is to record some of my discoveries, trials, and successes.  More for my own benefit than that of others.  But perhaps someone else will find it useful too?<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll wait and see.  I give it a month.<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s been a big move, from the centre of London to a small, new town in the west.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve long been sceptical of Swindon but I&#8217;m starting to see what a good move it is.<\/p>\n<p>Things I&#8217;m (re)discovering: cycling, gyms, the outdoors, gardens, being involved in a music group at church.<\/p>\n<p>My intention is to record some of my discoveries, trials, and successes.  More for my own benefit than that of others.  But perhaps someone else will find it useful too?<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll wait and see.  I give it a month.<\/p>\n",
