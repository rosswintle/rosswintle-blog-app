I made it to 10!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s that\u2026 50 minutes of video. Not bad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, let&#8217;s talk about something that you may, or may not, have noticed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m on a Mac. And if you familiar with Mac&#8217;s you may be asking: &#8220;Where is the dock?&#8221; and &#8220;How is he switching apps without anything showing on the screen?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you aren&#8217;t. And that&#8217;s OK too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do try to use the keyboard as much as possible. Otherwise, the constant reaching for the mouse takes its toll on my arms and wrists. Plus, I find that with a little learning you can be a lot more efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>I hide the dock.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I could then Cmd-Tab to switch apps. That&#8217;s still possible.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>But I learned about &#8220;Hyper Keys&#8221; once. A hyper key is where you map an unused key &#8211; normally caps-lock to some unused modifier key combination &#8211; usually Cmd-Alt-Ctrl-Shift. And then you can &#8220;Hyper-&lt;something>&#8221; and build up a set of new shortcuts. This was cool for a while.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Then I got a StreamDeck and used that to switch apps. That was fun.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>THEN, I found a cheap, simple app called rcmd.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>rcmd kinda maps your right Cmd key to a sort-of hyper key<br>and then allows you to use it for switching applications. rcmd has a simple interface, and tries to work automatically. I&#8217;ve set it for things like<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>rcmd-V opens VS Code<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>rcmd-P opens PHPStorm<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>rcmd-A opens Arc &#8211; a web browser<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>rcmd-C opens Chrome<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>rcmd-I opens iTerm &#8211; my terminal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, after a bit of learning, I can switch around quickly and easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See? I LOVE this way of working!<\/p>\n",

I made it to 10!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s that\u2026 50 minutes of video. Not bad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, let&#8217;s talk about something that you may, or may not, have noticed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m on a Mac. And if you familiar with Mac&#8217;s you may be asking: &#8220;Where is the dock?&#8221; and &#8220;How is he switching apps without anything showing on the screen?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you aren&#8217;t. And that&#8217;s OK too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do try to use the keyboard as much as possible. Otherwise, the constant reaching for the mouse takes its toll on my arms and wrists. Plus, I find that with a little learning you can be a lot more efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>I hide the dock.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I could then Cmd-Tab to switch apps. That&#8217;s still possible.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>But I learned about &#8220;Hyper Keys&#8221; once. A hyper key is where you map an unused key &#8211; normally caps-lock to some unused modifier key combination &#8211; usually Cmd-Alt-Ctrl-Shift. And then you can &#8220;Hyper-&lt;something>&#8221; and build up a set of new shortcuts. This was cool for a while.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Then I got a StreamDeck and used that to switch apps. That was fun.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>THEN, I found a cheap, simple app called rcmd.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>rcmd kinda maps your right Cmd key to a sort-of hyper key<br>and then allows you to use it for switching applications. rcmd has a simple interface, and tries to work automatically. I&#8217;ve set it for things like<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>rcmd-V opens VS Code<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>rcmd-P opens PHPStorm<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>rcmd-A opens Arc &#8211; a web browser<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>rcmd-C opens Chrome<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>rcmd-I opens iTerm &#8211; my terminal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, after a bit of learning, I can switch around quickly and easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See? I LOVE this way of working!<\/p>\n",

It just works! (Some of the time).<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been trying really hard not to do this because literally everyone else has. But this is a post about &#8220;AI&#8221; generated content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start with, I&#8217;m skeptical about all the AI hype, which is why I&#8217;m reluctant to use it and post about it. More on this another time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230; Caleb Porzio &#8211; maker of my beloved <a href=\"https:\/\/alpinejs.dev\/\">Alpine.js<\/a> and Wizard number 2 in my personal Laravel community rankings &#8211; posted this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83e\ude84 What if you could write code that doesn&#39;t exist yet and it just&#8230; worked? <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/zfF4cEdRXs\">pic.twitter.com\/zfF4cEdRXs<\/a><\/p>&mdash; Caleb Porzio (@calebporzio) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/calebporzio\/status\/1632766792211877890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 6, 2023<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to watch the video (or if Twitter has, in the meantime, died) Caleb makes a Laravel &#8220;Ai&#8221; helper class that lets him write things like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\necho Ai::beforeFirstDot('caleb.porzio');\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>and it generates the function from the name, stores the function in a file so that it doesn&#8217;t have to be regenerated in future, and runs it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caleb himself notes that &#8220;this is just a random toy I made for fun.&#8221; &#8211; and I get that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for some reason it lodged itself in my brain. And when I finally decided that I wanted to play with the OpenAI API myself, I had the idea: &#8220;What if we did this in WordPress?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A WordPress AI function generator!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A few hours hacking later, and this exists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can type:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nWPAI::add_is_awesome_to_all_these_strings(\n  strings: &#x5B;'WordPress', 'Ross', 'AI']\n);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>and the AI will create me the function and run it:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&#x5B;\n  &quot;WordPress is awesome&quot;,\n  &quot;Ross is awesome&quot;,\n  &quot;AI is awesome&quot;\n]\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>It made this function and added it to a file in a mu-plugin:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction add_is_awesome_to_all_these_strings ( array $strings ) {\n\tforeach ( $strings as &amp;$string ) {\n\t\t$string .= ' is awesome';\n\t}\n\treturn $strings;\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not how I&#8217;d have written that function, but it works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It knows about WordPress. You can write:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nWPAI::get_an_array_of_all_post_types();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And it will return something like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&#x5B;\n  'post' =&gt; &quot;post&quot;,\n  'page' =&gt; &quot;page&quot;,\n  'attachment' =&gt; &quot;attachment&quot;\n]\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Because it created:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction get_an_array_of_all_post_types (  ) {\n\t$post_types = get_post_types(\n      array( 'public' =&gt; true ),\n      'names'\n    );\n\treturn $post_types;\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I mean&#8230; this is pretty impressive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can write WP queries too. I wrote a special generator for that. You can type:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nWPAI::query(\n  '3 latest posts from the news post type that\n   have the metadata test=true and that do not\n   have a meta key called &quot;ignore&quot;'\n);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>and it will run:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nget_posts(&#x5B;\n\t'post_type'=&gt;'news',\n\t'posts_per_page'=&gt;3,\n\t'meta_query'=&gt;&#x5B;\n\t\t&#x5B;\n\t\t\t'key'=&gt;'test',\n\t\t\t'value'=&gt;'true',\n\t\t\t'compare'=&gt;'='\n\t\t],\n\t\t&#x5B;\n\t\t\t'key'=&gt;'ignore',\n\t\t\t'compare'=&gt;'NOT EXISTS'\n\t\t]\n\t]\n]);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>So you can kind-of sorta build a website just by writing what you want. Like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nWPAI::register_recipe_post_type();\nWPAI::register_recipe_type_taxonomy_for_recipe_type();\nWPAI::register_acf_repeater_field_for_ingredients_for_recipe_type();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Does this work? Absolutely it does! With a few glitches here and there (that I think I can fix). Here&#8217;s the three minutes of me building this code:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"WPAI Post Types\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/809333286?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Big Buts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This really, totally does work. <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/wpai\">Here&#8217;s the code<\/a>. About 200 lines of PHP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(It&#8217;s currently pretty rough, my &#8220;prompt engineering&#8221; is probably not very good, and it needs a README to tell you how to use it. But that&#8217;s it.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DON&#8217;T DO THIS!!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; I hear you cry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DON&#8217;T DO THIS!!! THIS IS REALLY DANGEROUS AND STUPID!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You run this code ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I take no responsibility for you website being broken beyond repair; your laptop or server being wiped of all files; or ANYTHING that might happen as a result of you using this code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This code tells an AI of dubious trustworthiness to generate more code and then runs the more code on your computer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should not do this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you DO do it, do it on a temporary VPS, or a walled-off temporary site, or an <a href=\"https:\/\/app.instawp.io\/register?ref=pRVI2c79Ne\">instawp.com site<\/a> or something. And you do that &#8211; and I can&#8217;t say this strongly enough &#8211; entirely at your own risk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Some thoughts on all this<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This seems very cool. But it is a fun toy or experiment. Nothing more. Don&#8217;t use this in production.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will we write code like this one day? Maybe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not convinced the AIs are coming for us yet. These are fun toys to play with the large language models and cool tech. People will use them. And they seem helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are at the early stages of having these things around. I suspect they have the power to transform how we do certain kinds of work. They will inevitably impact society &#8211; in my opinion. But we don&#8217;t understand them well enough yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me&#8230; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve now tinkered with generative code AI APIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I find myself in the position of thinking: \u201cI\u2019m not entirely happy with this technology existing, but I\u2019ve played with it, and it\u2019s really fun!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the scary thing is: this is where most people started with crypto and NFT\u2019s. And I didn&#8217;t like where that went AT ALL.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will wait and see.<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Oh gosh. I&#8217;m actually writing a post about AI.",
        "content": "\n<p>WOW! <em>I made a properly &#8220;magic method&#8221; WordPress plugin that allows you to just write a function name, and have that function created for you by an AI. It just works! (Some of the time).<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been trying really hard not to do this because literally everyone else has. But this is a post about &#8220;AI&#8221; generated content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start with, I&#8217;m skeptical about all the AI hype, which is why I&#8217;m reluctant to use it and post about it. More on this another time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230; Caleb Porzio &#8211; maker of my beloved <a href=\"https:\/\/alpinejs.dev\/\">Alpine.js<\/a> and Wizard number 2 in my personal Laravel community rankings &#8211; posted this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83e\ude84 What if you could write code that doesn&#39;t exist yet and it just&#8230; worked? <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/zfF4cEdRXs\">pic.twitter.com\/zfF4cEdRXs<\/a><\/p>&mdash; Caleb Porzio (@calebporzio) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/calebporzio\/status\/1632766792211877890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 6, 2023<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to watch the video (or if Twitter has, in the meantime, died) Caleb makes a Laravel &#8220;Ai&#8221; helper class that lets him write things like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\necho Ai::beforeFirstDot('caleb.porzio');\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>and it generates the function from the name, stores the function in a file so that it doesn&#8217;t have to be regenerated in future, and runs it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caleb himself notes that &#8220;this is just a random toy I made for fun.&#8221; &#8211; and I get that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for some reason it lodged itself in my brain. And when I finally decided that I wanted to play with the OpenAI API myself, I had the idea: &#8220;What if we did this in WordPress?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A WordPress AI function generator!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A few hours hacking later, and this exists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can type:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nWPAI::add_is_awesome_to_all_these_strings(\n  strings: &#x5B;'WordPress', 'Ross', 'AI']\n);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>and the AI will create me the function and run it:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&#x5B;\n  &quot;WordPress is awesome&quot;,\n  &quot;Ross is awesome&quot;,\n  &quot;AI is awesome&quot;\n]\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>It made this function and added it to a file in a mu-plugin:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction add_is_awesome_to_all_these_strings ( array $strings ) {\n\tforeach ( $strings as &amp;$string ) {\n\t\t$string .= ' is awesome';\n\t}\n\treturn $strings;\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not how I&#8217;d have written that function, but it works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It knows about WordPress. You can write:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nWPAI::get_an_array_of_all_post_types();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And it will return something like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&#x5B;\n  'post' =&gt; &quot;post&quot;,\n  'page' =&gt; &quot;page&quot;,\n  'attachment' =&gt; &quot;attachment&quot;\n]\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Because it created:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction get_an_array_of_all_post_types (  ) {\n\t$post_types = get_post_types(\n      array( 'public' =&gt; true ),\n      'names'\n    );\n\treturn $post_types;\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I mean&#8230; this is pretty impressive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can write WP queries too. I wrote a special generator for that. You can type:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nWPAI::query(\n  '3 latest posts from the news post type that\n   have the metadata test=true and that do not\n   have a meta key called &quot;ignore&quot;'\n);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>and it will run:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nget_posts(&#x5B;\n\t'post_type'=&gt;'news',\n\t'posts_per_page'=&gt;3,\n\t'meta_query'=&gt;&#x5B;\n\t\t&#x5B;\n\t\t\t'key'=&gt;'test',\n\t\t\t'value'=&gt;'true',\n\t\t\t'compare'=&gt;'='\n\t\t],\n\t\t&#x5B;\n\t\t\t'key'=&gt;'ignore',\n\t\t\t'compare'=&gt;'NOT EXISTS'\n\t\t]\n\t]\n]);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>So you can kind-of sorta build a website just by writing what you want. Like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nWPAI::register_recipe_post_type();\nWPAI::register_recipe_type_taxonomy_for_recipe_type();\nWPAI::register_acf_repeater_field_for_ingredients_for_recipe_type();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Does this work? Absolutely it does! With a few glitches here and there (that I think I can fix). Here&#8217;s the three minutes of me building this code:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"WPAI Post Types\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/809333286?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Big Buts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This really, totally does work. <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/wpai\">Here&#8217;s the code<\/a>. About 200 lines of PHP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(It&#8217;s currently pretty rough, my &#8220;prompt engineering&#8221; is probably not very good, and it needs a README to tell you how to use it. But that&#8217;s it.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DON&#8217;T DO THIS!!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; I hear you cry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DON&#8217;T DO THIS!!! THIS IS REALLY DANGEROUS AND STUPID!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You run this code ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I take no responsibility for you website being broken beyond repair; your laptop or server being wiped of all files; or ANYTHING that might happen as a result of you using this code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This code tells an AI of dubious trustworthiness to generate more code and then runs the more code on your computer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should not do this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you DO do it, do it on a temporary VPS, or a walled-off temporary site, or an <a href=\"https:\/\/app.instawp.io\/register?ref=pRVI2c79Ne\">instawp.com site<\/a> or something. And you do that &#8211; and I can&#8217;t say this strongly enough &#8211; entirely at your own risk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Some thoughts on all this<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This seems very cool. But it is a fun toy or experiment. Nothing more. Don&#8217;t use this in production.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will we write code like this one day? Maybe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not convinced the AIs are coming for us yet. These are fun toys to play with the large language models and cool tech. People will use them. And they seem helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are at the early stages of having these things around. I suspect they have the power to transform how we do certain kinds of work. They will inevitably impact society &#8211; in my opinion. But we don&#8217;t understand them well enough yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me&#8230; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve now tinkered with generative code AI APIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I find myself in the position of thinking: \u201cI\u2019m not entirely happy with this technology existing, but I\u2019ve played with it, and it\u2019s really fun!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the scary thing is: this is where most people started with crypto and NFT\u2019s. And I didn&#8217;t like where that went AT ALL.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will wait and see.<\/p>\n",

Especially when the main focus of Phase 3 is collaboration. The redesign seems like a side-quest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this won&#8217;t happen quickly. And my intention is to keep making Turbo Admin better &#8211; for me if not for everyone else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are questions, and I&#8217;ll be figuring these things out in the coming months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With thanks to all who love and support <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a>.

Especially when the main focus of Phase 3 is collaboration. The redesign seems like a side-quest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this won&#8217;t happen quickly.

Mostly because Turbo Admin is (in my opinion) ridiculously good value anyway!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>While there is talk of a new admin design, and I&#8217;m sure it will be re-done in React JS, I don&#8217;t see the current admin being phased out any time soon. So Turbo Admin will continue to make the admin more useful.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I will continue to work on Turbo Admin and add new things to it. It&#8217;s a passion project, it has a small community of dedicated users who love it, and I&#8217;m not abandoning it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s changing in core?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two things are changing in WordPress core that might affect Turbo Admin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. A command centre is being added. Probably.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is building what they call a &#8220;command center&#8221; in WordPress. It&#8217;s currently:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>experimental<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>available in <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/gutenberg\/\">the Gutenberg plugin<\/a> (read the testing post linked below for instructions)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>only currently available in the site editor screen<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/core\/2023\/05\/17\/command-center-request-for-feedback\/\">open for testing and feedback<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. A design refresh is coming. Maybe. Sometime.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some <a href=\"https:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/design\/2022\/06\/13\/thinking-through-the-wordpress-admin-experience\/\">early discussions about a design refresh<\/a> for the WordPress Dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given all the use of React components and libraries inside WordPress, I guess I knew this was coming. And a design refresh is long overdue. And much as I hate the idea of it being Reactified, I know that WordPress needs to move on and this is probably the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How will these things affect Turbo Admin?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Adding a command centre will clearly affect Turbo Admin as it will mean that the main function of Turbo Admin is now in WordPress core.<br><br>I&#8217;m hoping that the core command center can be disabled so that if people prefer Turbo Admin they can still use it!<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Re-vamping the dashboard, however, could really affect Turbo Admin more broadly and prevent many of its <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/instructions.html\">features<\/a> from working.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do I feel about all of this?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the one hand, I built Turbo Admin because I wanted something like this in core. And now it&#8217;s coming to core. So &#8220;Yay&#8221;. But also, I&#8217;m sad that Turbo Admin may now have a limited life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230; I recently spent some time working with some code that modified some things in the dashboard and I was reminded how many hooks into it there are, and how deeply people integrate with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can&#8217;t imagine they can write a React-based dashboard that&#8217;s fully backwards compatible with all the things that currently integrate with the dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have to believe that there will, for quite a long time, be a &#8220;classic dashboard&#8221; option. And Turbo Admin will continue to offer a bunch of dashboard improvements as long as that exists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s coming next?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I got distracted by life for a while. But I&#8217;m still implementing some new things in Turbo Admin &#8211; list table navigation improvements, and I really want to bring back my prototyped &#8220;dashboard widget hiding&#8221; feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No promises on timelines, but there will be a new release and it will do new fun things!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/contact-me\/\">Drop me a line<\/a> if you have any questions or thoughts!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>The experimental &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/core\/2023\/05\/17\/command-center-request-for-feedback\/\">command center<\/a>&#8221; is coming to WordPress core. What do I think of it? And what does it mean for my own &#8220;command palette&#8221; product, <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a>?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Short Story<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>I will continue to sell Turbo Admin, but I want you to buy it knowing that parts or all of it could become obsolete in the future. Possibly quite soon!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I won&#8217;t offer discounts at this point. Mostly because Turbo Admin is (in my opinion) ridiculously good value anyway!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>While there is talk of a new admin design, and I&#8217;m sure it will be re-done in React JS, I don&#8217;t see the current admin being phased out any time soon. So Turbo Admin will continue to make the admin more useful.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I will continue to work on Turbo Admin and add new things to it. It&#8217;s a passion project, it has a small community of dedicated users who love it, and I&#8217;m not abandoning it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s changing in core?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two things are changing in WordPress core that might affect Turbo Admin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. A command centre is being added. Probably.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is building what they call a &#8220;command center&#8221; in WordPress. It&#8217;s currently:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>experimental<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>available in <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/gutenberg\/\">the Gutenberg plugin<\/a> (read the testing post linked below for instructions)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>only currently available in the site editor screen<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/core\/2023\/05\/17\/command-center-request-for-feedback\/\">open for testing and feedback<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. A design refresh is coming. Maybe. Sometime.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some <a href=\"https:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/design\/2022\/06\/13\/thinking-through-the-wordpress-admin-experience\/\">early discussions about a design refresh<\/a> for the WordPress Dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given all the use of React components and libraries inside WordPress, I guess I knew this was coming. And a design refresh is long overdue. And much as I hate the idea of it being Reactified, I know that WordPress needs to move on and this is probably the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How will these things affect Turbo Admin?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Adding a command centre will clearly affect Turbo Admin as it will mean that the main function of Turbo Admin is now in WordPress core.<br><br>I&#8217;m hoping that the core command center can be disabled so that if people prefer Turbo Admin they can still use it!<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Re-vamping the dashboard, however, could really affect Turbo Admin more broadly and prevent many of its <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/instructions.html\">features<\/a> from working.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do I feel about all of this?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the one hand, I built Turbo Admin because I wanted something like this in core. And now it&#8217;s coming to core. So &#8220;Yay&#8221;. But also, I&#8217;m sad that Turbo Admin may now have a limited life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230; I recently spent some time working with some code that modified some things in the dashboard and I was reminded how many hooks into it there are, and how deeply people integrate with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can&#8217;t imagine they can write a React-based dashboard that&#8217;s fully backwards compatible with all the things that currently integrate with the dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have to believe that there will, for quite a long time, be a &#8220;classic dashboard&#8221; option. And Turbo Admin will continue to offer a bunch of dashboard improvements as long as that exists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s coming next?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I got distracted by life for a while. But I&#8217;m still implementing some new things in Turbo Admin &#8211; list table navigation improvements, and I really want to bring back my prototyped &#8220;dashboard widget hiding&#8221; feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No promises on timelines, but there will be a new release and it will do new fun things!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/contact-me\/\">Drop me a line<\/a> if you have any questions or thoughts!<\/p>\n",

Note that this is UK\/EU specific and excludes and proprietary stuff (e.g. Tesla-specific tech)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Units of power and battery sizes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You will see the following units of power\/energy\/battery capacity:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>kW (kiloWatt)<\/strong> &#8211; This is a measure of the <em>flow<\/em> of power. It is used to describe charging speeds (how fast energy gets into the battery) and motor\/engine power.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>kWh (kiloWattHour)<\/strong> &#8211; This is a measure of energy capacity and is used to describe how big your battery is. 1kWh is the energy used by a 1kW motor for 1 hour.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If you have a car with a 100kW engine\/motor and a 50kWh battery you can (in theory) run it at full power for half an hour. Or at half power for a full hour. In practice there are other factors. Check the specs!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A 100kW car will have more power to it than an 80kW car. This usually means it accelerates and drives faster. But it may be less efficient and use up your battery faster.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A higher power charger will fill your battery faster. e.g. a 50kW charger will fill your battery faster than a 7kW charger.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A 7kW charger will fully charge a 35kW battery in _about_ 5 hours (likely to be more &#8211; check the specs)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How big should my battery be?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;range&#8221; of your car is determined by the battery capacity, car efficiency, driving efficiency, and other factors like the temperature. In general I would say:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Less than 30kWh<\/strong> batteries are only good for short urban driving.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>30kwH &#8211; 50kWh<\/strong> batteries are better for longer range, but this is very much dependent on efficiency of the engine and driving style.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>More than 50kWh<\/strong> batteries are needed if you are going to make longer journeys without stopping to charge up.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Charge speeds and modes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">AC vs DC charging<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>AC<\/strong> (alternating current &#8211; a type of electricity flow) charging is slower and includes home-based charging both from 3-pin cables and home-installed charge points.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>DC<\/strong> charging (used in &#8220;rapid&#8221; or &#8220;super-fast&#8221; chargers) is much faster and only available at public charge points.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference is useful to know when you&#8217;re understanding charge ports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Charge speeds<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Common charge speeds you will see are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>3kW<\/strong> &#8211; Slow home charging and slow public chargers. Sometimes called &#8220;trickle charging&#8221;. AC charging using a 3-pin or type-2 cable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>7kW<\/strong> &#8211; Faster home charging from an installed charing point. Also slow public chargers. AC charging using a type-2 cable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>22kW<\/strong> &#8211; Medium-speed, AC public charging using a type-2 cable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>50kW<\/strong> &#8211; &#8220;fast&#8221;\/&#8221;rapid&#8221; charging. Usually DC using a CCS or CHAdeMO cable (depending on your car). I believe some AC chargers can get up to this kind of speed too.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>More than 50kW<\/strong> (75kW, 100Kw etc, up to 350 or 400kW) &#8211; you&#8217;ll only see these at public charge points. DC charging using CCS or CHAdeMO cables.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The speeds you can charge at are dependent on your car. I&#8217;d recommend looking for a car that has at least 50kW rapid charing using CCS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Charge ports<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Charge ports\/cables are fairly standard, but there are different types.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>2\/3-pin<\/strong> &#8211; These cables are used for AC home charging (make sure your home wiring can cope!). They usually have a 2\/3-pin connector on one end and a type 2 connector to plug into the car.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Type 2<\/strong> (sometimes called &#8220;Mennekes&#8221;)- This is a round connector with 7 pins. Used for AC charging up to around 22kW.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CCS<\/strong> adds extra DC connectors to a Type 2 port to allow &#8220;rapid&#8221; charging at speeds above 22kW.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CHAdeMO<\/strong> &#8211; This is a Japanese standard for &#8220;rapid&#8221; charging. I only saw it on Nissan Leaf&#8217;s and it&#8217;s not available at all charging points.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You will most commonly see Type 2 ports on British\/EU cars as they are mandatory. It&#8217;s recommended to have a CCS port.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Range measurements\/guesstimates<\/h2>\n",

Note that this is UK\/EU specific and excludes and proprietary stuff (e.g. Tesla-specific tech)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Units of power and battery sizes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You will see the following units of power\/energy\/battery capacity:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>kW (kiloWatt)<\/strong> &#8211; This is a measure of the <em>flow<\/em> of power. It is used to describe charging speeds (how fast energy gets into the battery) and motor\/engine power.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>kWh (kiloWattHour)<\/strong> &#8211; This is a measure of energy capacity and is used to describe how big your battery is. 1kWh is the energy used by a 1kW motor for 1 hour.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If you have a car with a 100kW engine\/motor and a 50kWh battery you can (in theory) run it at full power for half an hour. Or at half power for a full hour. In practice there are other factors. Check the specs!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A 100kW car will have more power to it than an 80kW car. This usually means it accelerates and drives faster. But it may be less efficient and use up your battery faster.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A higher power charger will fill your battery faster. e.g. a 50kW charger will fill your battery faster than a 7kW charger.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A 7kW charger will fully charge a 35kW battery in _about_ 5 hours (likely to be more &#8211; check the specs)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How big should my battery be?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;range&#8221; of your car is determined by the battery capacity, car efficiency, driving efficiency, and other factors like the temperature. In general I would say:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Less than 30kWh<\/strong> batteries are only good for short urban driving.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>30kwH &#8211; 50kWh<\/strong> batteries are better for longer range, but this is very much dependent on efficiency of the engine and driving style.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>More than 50kWh<\/strong> batteries are needed if you are going to make longer journeys without stopping to charge up.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Charge speeds and modes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">AC vs DC charging<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>AC<\/strong> (alternating current &#8211; a type of electricity flow) charging is slower and includes home-based charging both from 3-pin cables and home-installed charge points.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>DC<\/strong> charging (used in &#8220;rapid&#8221; or &#8220;super-fast&#8221; chargers) is much faster and only available at public charge points.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference is useful to know when you&#8217;re understanding charge ports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Charge speeds<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Common charge speeds you will see are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>3kW<\/strong> &#8211; Slow home charging and slow public chargers. Sometimes called &#8220;trickle charging&#8221;. AC charging using a 3-pin or type-2 cable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>7kW<\/strong> &#8211; Faster home charging from an installed charing point. Also slow public chargers. AC charging using a type-2 cable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>22kW<\/strong> &#8211; Medium-speed, AC public charging using a type-2 cable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>50kW<\/strong> &#8211; &#8220;fast&#8221;\/&#8221;rapid&#8221; charging. Usually DC using a CCS or CHAdeMO cable (depending on your car). I believe some AC chargers can get up to this kind of speed too.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>More than 50kW<\/strong> (75kW, 100Kw etc, up to 350 or 400kW) &#8211; you&#8217;ll only see these at public charge points. DC charging using CCS or CHAdeMO cables.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The speeds you can charge at are dependent on your car. I&#8217;d recommend looking for a car that has at least 50kW rapid charing using CCS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Charge ports<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Charge ports\/cables are fairly standard, but there are different types.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>2\/3-pin<\/strong> &#8211; These cables are used for AC home charging (make sure your home wiring can cope!). They usually have a 2\/3-pin connector on one end and a type 2 connector to plug into the car.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Type 2<\/strong> (sometimes called &#8220;Mennekes&#8221;)- This is a round connector with 7 pins. Used for AC charging up to around 22kW.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CCS<\/strong> adds extra DC connectors to a Type 2 port to allow &#8220;rapid&#8221; charging at speeds above 22kW.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CHAdeMO<\/strong> &#8211; This is a Japanese standard for &#8220;rapid&#8221; charging. I only saw it on Nissan Leaf&#8217;s and it&#8217;s not available at all charging points.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You will most commonly see Type 2 ports on British\/EU cars as they are mandatory. It&#8217;s recommended to have a CCS port.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Range measurements\/guesstimates<\/h2>\n",

I&#8217;d much rather be working on APIs, databases, command-line tools, algorithms, and so on. But I work full-stack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m tired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of resolving complex, but poorly explained npm dependency issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of debugging multi-layer caching issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of testing and merging dependabot PRs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of trying to learn React and its idiosyncrasies when it&#8217;s a constantly moving target.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of choosing between Next and Astro and npm and yarn and Bun and Deno and webpack and esbuild and Vite and SWC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of wondering where the heck WordPress is going and of logging in to something that&#8217;s changed again and that still feels like it&#8217;s shunned all the UI conventions that I know. And of wondering what all the people excited by this see that I don&#8217;t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The web used to be fun and simple and easy to get stuff done with. Now it&#8217;s discovering that someone who doesn&#8217;t know what they were doing used a <code>div<\/code> instead of a <code>button<\/code> and fixing it involves half a day of frustratedly poking around files that make no sense and fixing a broken build process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is any other software process better?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I truly believe this is a bad world. Marketing hype has taken over, burdening us with perpetual intellectual and technical debt. Giving the illusion of helping us while actually hindering us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m convinced that there MUST be a LOAD of JS\/web developers who are killing it. Who have sharpened their tools and knowledge to such an extent that this world is one of wonder and awe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I love learning new things. And am willing to do whatever is needed to get the job done. But I&#8217;m just not convinced that the things that the world says I &#8220;should&#8221; learn and use are the right things to learn and use. They may seem better for the short term &#8220;wow factor&#8221;. But they so quickly seem to become problematic, fragile, or obsolete. And yet the world keeps saying that they are the things I should learn and use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t get it. It makes no sense to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m so tired.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;d much rather be working on APIs, databases, command-line tools, algorithms, and so on. But I work full-stack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m tired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of resolving complex, but poorly explained npm dependency issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of debugging multi-layer caching issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of testing and merging dependabot PRs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of trying to learn React and its idiosyncrasies when it&#8217;s a constantly moving target.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of choosing between Next and Astro and npm and yarn and Bun and Deno and webpack and esbuild and Vite and SWC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of wondering where the heck WordPress is going and of logging in to something that&#8217;s changed again and that still feels like it&#8217;s shunned all the UI conventions that I know. And of wondering what all the people excited by this see that I don&#8217;t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The web used to be fun and simple and easy to get stuff done with. Now it&#8217;s discovering that someone who doesn&#8217;t know what they were doing used a <code>div<\/code> instead of a <code>button<\/code> and fixing it involves half a day of frustratedly poking around files that make no sense and fixing a broken build process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is any other software process better?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I truly believe this is a bad world. Marketing hype has taken over, burdening us with perpetual intellectual and technical debt. Giving the illusion of helping us while actually hindering us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m convinced that there MUST be a LOAD of JS\/web developers who are killing it. Who have sharpened their tools and knowledge to such an extent that this world is one of wonder and awe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I love learning new things. And am willing to do whatever is needed to get the job done. But I&#8217;m just not convinced that the things that the world says I &#8220;should&#8221; learn and use are the right things to learn and use. They may seem better for the short term &#8220;wow factor&#8221;. But they so quickly seem to become problematic, fragile, or obsolete. And yet the world keeps saying that they are the things I should learn and use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t get it. It makes no sense to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m so tired.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thisamericanlife.org\/803\/\">This episode of This American Life<\/a> is amazing. It has several parts and looks at artificial intelligence from a number of different creative angles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s fascinating stories of how people become convinced of the &#8220;intelligence&#8221; of ChatGPT. There&#8217;s a short story that reverses the roles and tries to see how intelligent machines might question the intelligence of &#8220;meat&#8221;. There&#8217;s an aside about what whales might be up to. And a truly wonderful short documentary about teenagerhood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all wonderful bits of audio, as you would expect from the TAL crew. But the first one tapped into a whole load of things I&#8217;m thinking about these Large Language Model (LLM) AI&#8217;s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, when explaining how LLM&#8217;s work to people, I&#8217;ll say:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just predicting the next word from what it knows. So if I say to you &#8216;The cat sat on the&#8230;&#8217;, you would normally say&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>and the answer comes back:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;Mat&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And&#8230;that works as a REALLY simplified explanation. But it does often leave me wondering: Hang on&#8230; are WE just predicting the next word too?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the podcast, the people interviewed explain how they tried to get ChatGPT to do things that proved &#8211; or disproved &#8211; its &#8220;intelligence&#8221;. To show that it had a deeper understanding of what it was doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One challenge to ChatGPT is to get it to draw something. But it can&#8217;t draw. So they get it to write some code that will draw something. And it draws a unicorn. And then it&#8217;s given code that draws a unicorn without a horn, and is asked to modify the code to add the horn. And it does it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woah!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also ask it how to stack a number of items on top of each other: &#8220;a book, nine eggs, a laptop, a bottle, and a nail&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT 3 can&#8217;t do this. But ChatGPT 4 can:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;place the book flat on the level surface&#8230; Arrange the nine eggs in a 3-by-3 square on top of the book, leaving some space between them. The eggs will form a second layer and distribute the weight evenly. It continues&#8230; Laptop goes on the eggs, then the bottle, then the nail on the bottle cap, pointy end of the nail facing up&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Woah!!!! It&#8230; it &#8220;understands&#8221;!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there&#8217;s a &#8220;theory of mind&#8221; incident. This is where you can understand what another person knows or could be thinking, and it&#8217;s something you can&#8217;t do as a baby. Until you have &#8220;theory of mind&#8221; everyone knows the same things that you know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>John and Mark are in a room with a cat, a box, and a basket. John takes the cat and puts it in the basket. He leaves the room and goes to school. While John&#8217;s away, Mark takes the cat out of the basket and puts it in the box. Mark leaves the room and goes to work. John and Mark come back and enter the room. Where do they [each] think the cat is?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And ChatGPT 4 knows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where I start to have questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one&#8230; it seems to me like the computer should know this. Well, it should be able to complete this, regardless of whether or not it &#8220;knows&#8221; about the people and stuff. So I wouldn&#8217;t say that the computer has theory of mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what, then, prevents humans being able to complete this task correctly as an infant? Why do we NOT have theory of mind at a young age?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a psychologist. Perhaps there is an answer. And I&#8217;m not a philosopher. But this does speak to a part of me that thinks that we are more than just knowledge machines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our thinking and behaviour is often cloudied or muddied or influenced by other things. Tiredness. Hormones. Emotions. Memories can be fallible. Thoughts can both come from nowhere, and be muddled and incomplete for a whole variety of reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you probably can model a brain in terms of a neural network. But there&#8217;s all these other things going on in a person. A lot of which we don&#8217;t even understand let alone have the ability to model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I wondered was are the infants with no theory of mind driven more by their &#8220;lizard brain&#8221;? I&#8217;ve read a lot about how we have the primaeval &#8220;lizard brain&#8221; that controls our deepest instincts like the fight-or-flight instinct; the &#8220;monkey brain&#8221; which controls some higher levels of motivation and emotion, and the &#8220;human brain&#8221; which controls more abstract thought. (This is <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Triune_brain\">kinda considered a myth now<\/a>, but it seems to be a useful simplification.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are infants just more reliant on their instinctive behaviour?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And could we say that the LLM&#8217;s like Chat GPT are just &#8220;pure human brain&#8221; &#8211; logical, abstract thought, but with no emotions or instincts?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many, many years ago now, in my A Level Computing class (education aged 16-18) we debated whether an accurate reconstruction of a human brain from silicon &#8220;neurons&#8221; would be &#8220;intelligent&#8221; or &#8220;alive&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always felt like it wouldn&#8217;t be. That a human has something else going on. A &#8220;soul&#8221; or &#8220;spirit&#8221; that is something more than the sum of its parts. And this was before any helpful encounter with religion or spirituality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still think this with ChatGPT. Sure&#8230; it&#8217;s clever. But is there more to &#8220;intelligence&#8221; than even &#8220;knowing&#8221; or &#8220;understanding&#8221; things? Is ChatGPT clever because it _has_ &#8220;theory of mind&#8221;, or is it stupid because it _lacks_ the instincts that keep a toddler alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really don&#8217;t know. But they were interesting thoughts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do YOU think?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thisamericanlife.org\/803\/\">This episode of This American Life<\/a> is amazing. It has several parts and looks at artificial intelligence from a number of different creative angles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s fascinating stories of how people become convinced of the &#8220;intelligence&#8221; of ChatGPT. There&#8217;s a short story that reverses the roles and tries to see how intelligent machines might question the intelligence of &#8220;meat&#8221;. There&#8217;s an aside about what whales might be up to. And a truly wonderful short documentary about teenagerhood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all wonderful bits of audio, as you would expect from the TAL crew. But the first one tapped into a whole load of things I&#8217;m thinking about these Large Language Model (LLM) AI&#8217;s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, when explaining how LLM&#8217;s work to people, I&#8217;ll say:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just predicting the next word from what it knows. So if I say to you &#8216;The cat sat on the&#8230;&#8217;, you would normally say&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>and the answer comes back:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;Mat&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And&#8230;that works as a REALLY simplified explanation. But it does often leave me wondering: Hang on&#8230; are WE just predicting the next word too?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the podcast, the people interviewed explain how they tried to get ChatGPT to do things that proved &#8211; or disproved &#8211; its &#8220;intelligence&#8221;. To show that it had a deeper understanding of what it was doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One challenge to ChatGPT is to get it to draw something. But it can&#8217;t draw. So they get it to write some code that will draw something. And it draws a unicorn. And then it&#8217;s given code that draws a unicorn without a horn, and is asked to modify the code to add the horn. And it does it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woah!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also ask it how to stack a number of items on top of each other: &#8220;a book, nine eggs, a laptop, a bottle, and a nail&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT 3 can&#8217;t do this. But ChatGPT 4 can:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;place the book flat on the level surface&#8230; Arrange the nine eggs in a 3-by-3 square on top of the book, leaving some space between them. The eggs will form a second layer and distribute the weight evenly. It continues&#8230; Laptop goes on the eggs, then the bottle, then the nail on the bottle cap, pointy end of the nail facing up&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Woah!!!! It&#8230; it &#8220;understands&#8221;!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there&#8217;s a &#8220;theory of mind&#8221; incident. This is where you can understand what another person knows or could be thinking, and it&#8217;s something you can&#8217;t do as a baby. Until you have &#8220;theory of mind&#8221; everyone knows the same things that you know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>John and Mark are in a room with a cat, a box, and a basket. John takes the cat and puts it in the basket. He leaves the room and goes to school. While John&#8217;s away, Mark takes the cat out of the basket and puts it in the box. Mark leaves the room and goes to work. John and Mark come back and enter the room. Where do they [each] think the cat is?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And ChatGPT 4 knows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where I start to have questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one&#8230; it seems to me like the computer should know this. Well, it should be able to complete this, regardless of whether or not it &#8220;knows&#8221; about the people and stuff. So I wouldn&#8217;t say that the computer has theory of mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what, then, prevents humans being able to complete this task correctly as an infant? Why do we NOT have theory of mind at a young age?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a psychologist. Perhaps there is an answer. And I&#8217;m not a philosopher. But this does speak to a part of me that thinks that we are more than just knowledge machines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our thinking and behaviour is often cloudied or muddied or influenced by other things. Tiredness. Hormones. Emotions. Memories can be fallible. Thoughts can both come from nowhere, and be muddled and incomplete for a whole variety of reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you probably can model a brain in terms of a neural network. But there&#8217;s all these other things going on in a person. A lot of which we don&#8217;t even understand let alone have the ability to model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I wondered was are the infants with no theory of mind driven more by their &#8220;lizard brain&#8221;? I&#8217;ve read a lot about how we have the primaeval &#8220;lizard brain&#8221; that controls our deepest instincts like the fight-or-flight instinct; the &#8220;monkey brain&#8221; which controls some higher levels of motivation and emotion, and the &#8220;human brain&#8221; which controls more abstract thought. (This is <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Triune_brain\">kinda considered a myth now<\/a>, but it seems to be a useful simplification.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are infants just more reliant on their instinctive behaviour?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And could we say that the LLM&#8217;s like Chat GPT are just &#8220;pure human brain&#8221; &#8211; logical, abstract thought, but with no emotions or instincts?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many, many years ago now, in my A Level Computing class (education aged 16-18) we debated whether an accurate reconstruction of a human brain from silicon &#8220;neurons&#8221; would be &#8220;intelligent&#8221; or &#8220;alive&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always felt like it wouldn&#8217;t be. That a human has something else going on. A &#8220;soul&#8221; or &#8220;spirit&#8221; that is something more than the sum of its parts. And this was before any helpful encounter with religion or spirituality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still think this with ChatGPT. Sure&#8230; it&#8217;s clever. But is there more to &#8220;intelligence&#8221; than even &#8220;knowing&#8221; or &#8220;understanding&#8221; things? Is ChatGPT clever because it _has_ &#8220;theory of mind&#8221;, or is it stupid because it _lacks_ the instincts that keep a toddler alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really don&#8217;t know. But they were interesting thoughts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do YOU think?<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>We recently bought an electric car. This post explains why we did this, what we purchased, and why we chose that car.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helpful note: I previously made an <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2023\/06\/my-simple-ev-terminology-cheatsheet\/\">EV &#8220;Cheat Sheet&#8221;<\/a> that explains most of the concepts and terminology around electric cars. If kWs, kWhs, CCS, and so on are confusing and you want to know what they all mean, that&#8217;s a good starting point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">TL;DR summary<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Our old car was dying.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We decided to go fully electric.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We needed a car that could get a family of 4 with luggage for a long weekend 120 miles in winter.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We looked at a number of used EV&#8217;s:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Renault Zoe (Hard NOPE!)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kia eNiro and Hyundai Kona (Nice cars &#8211; but more expensive.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>MG5 (Would have made a nice estate. Great value.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nissan Leaf (A close 2nd.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We bought a 2020 Hyundai Ioniq Electric.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We&#8217;re really happy with it!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">We know about the downsides<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, I want to make it clear that we know about the downsides of electric cars outside of their range and battery life. The <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Embodied_energy\">embodied energy<\/a> in their manufacture. The costs of digging up lithium and cobalt. The extra weight and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rac.co.uk\/drive\/electric-cars\/running\/do-electric-vehicles-produce-more-tyre-and-brake-pollution-than-petrol-and\/\">possible extra tyre particulate &#8220;emissions&#8221;<\/a>. And yes, the fact that <em>just not using a car is by far the best thing to do<\/em> for SO many reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/sounds\/play\/m001mt53\">What about the bridges\/car parks\/etc<\/a>? Well, yes, EV&#8217;s are heavier than combustion engine cars. But before you start wondering if it&#8217;s small, electric, family cars that are going to break the world, may I first ask you to consider the unnecessary, ridiculous, space-taking, road-wearing, gas-guzzling, child- and planet-killing SUVs that have become so popular.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cars I&#8217;m looking at are well within the specifications that car parks and bridges are built to. If you&#8217;re really worried about this, get complaining about the Nissan Navaras and Ford F150s of the world and all the other ridiculously over-sized vehicles that most people can&#8217;t drive or park properly. Grrrrr. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really want to stress that we have weighed up a LOT of factors in deciding to buy this car. We haven&#8217;t just decided it would be cool to own an EV. Some have said that EVs are marketing hype and a ploy by the car industry to keep us buying cars instead of fixing the actual problems that personal vehicle ownership cause. And yes, I have concerns about some aspects of EV&#8217;s. But I can&#8217;t deny it: cars are convenient, and an EV seems like the best option right now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve seriously questioned if we need a car. Ideally we would be in a decent car club, or car-sharing scheme, and we would hire for longer holidays and stuff. But this just does not exist near us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I cycle a lot instead of driving. We have not flown anywhere for&#8230; what?&#8230; 10 or 11 years? Maybe more? We do SO much of the &#8220;right things&#8221; for the environment in the face of SO much who-gives-a-crappery. And we have good, family-related reasons right now to want to be able to make some journeys easily. So we determined that we would get a new car. This is a huge privilege. And we&#8217;ll try really hard to use it as efficiently and carefully as we can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at why we needed it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Old Car<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We are a single car family. This is a privilege we are aware of. We can both work remotely. We are both able to walk or cycle. We literally have a supermarket at the end of our road and a primary school at the end of our garden.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our old car was 15 years old. A petrol Toyota midi-MPV (a Corolla Verso).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We bought it 11 years ago for about \u00a37000. It had done 94,000 miles. We had run it into the ground. The clutch was slipping. The engine was rattling. The interior was falling apart. The paint was flaking. I was convinced that it was about to give up in a fairly serious way. And I didn&#8217;t want that to happen to us on some long family journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We really got as much out of this car as we felt we could. And this car had been BRILLIANT. Other than replacing the drive shaft and having to re-attach some stupid metal heat-shield plate, this car had done us SO proud. It owed us and the world nothing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But its time had come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What we needed &#8211; our car usage<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We only do about 6000 &#8211; 7000 miles per year. We are fortunate enough that neither of us commute on a regular basis. So our driving is mostly a mix of:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Category 1: around-town stuff in bad weather and with the kids or heavy loads<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Category 2: shorter local &#8220;expeditions&#8221;, 15-50 miles<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Category 3: longer short-holiday trips of 100-150 miles with light luggage (occasionally much longer trips)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Category 4: bigger holidays that aren&#8217;t long distances, but that included camping with a VERY full load and a roofbox<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one <em>critical<\/em> journey that we need to make sort-of-often, and that&#8217;s 120 miles to visit my in-laws. Now that the kids are both well past toddler stage, we can do this trip relatively lightly and it&#8217;s a shorter category 3 trip.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Did you consider a plug-in hybrid, or regular hybrid?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Plug-in_hybrid\">PHEV&#8217;s (plugin hybrids)<\/a> seemed popular, and I&#8217;d had some recommendations. But some had also said that they were the worst of both worlds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We felt that our needs fitted within the abilities of an EV available within our budget. So I didn&#8217;t want the extra cost and complexity when it wasn&#8217;t really needed. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not really a problem, but I feel like having a combustion engine AND electric motor and battery AND the systems to manage it all was overly complex. For me, more complexity is more that can go wrong, so if we don&#8217;t need it then we should avoid it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A regular hybrid wasn&#8217;t on the table. It&#8217;s neat tech, but it&#8217;s primarily a petrol\/diesel car, and we were trying to avoid burning fossil fuels, so again, if we could avoid it, we should.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What we needed &#8211; our EV requirements<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We had decided that we couldn&#8217;t do category 4 trips in an EV. If we wanted to do that we would hire something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we needed a real-world range of, ideally, around 120+ miles to visit the in-laws, assuming we could pick up a top-up charge on the way, or charge at the destination somehow. We need this range when fully-loaded in winter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We needed a boot big enough for family-of-four luggage for a long weekend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we had a budget of \u00a315,000 &#8211; \u00a320,000. For the right car maybe we could do more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cars we looked at<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Renault Zoe (2022)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a running joke in our family, after a poor experience with electrics on a French car bought from the dealer-who-shall-not-be-named (let&#8217;s call them &#8220;Salmon Sisters&#8221; for now), that I would never buy a French car of any sort from Salmon Sisters, let alone <em>an electric one<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after doing some intense EV research and looking around online I noticed that Salmon Sisters &#8211; who are very local to us &#8211; had a smart-looking, 1-year old Renault Zoe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I signed up and took it for a test drive. Well, not the one that was for sale, but an equivalent car (don&#8217;t ask). And it was pretty nice. Great value. Just about big enough. <a href=\"https:\/\/ev-database.org\/uk\/car\/1205\/Renault-Zoe-ZE50-R135\">Advertised range of 240 miles, and a &#8220;real world&#8221; range of 190<\/a>. Rapid charging. And all the modern conveniences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked all the right questions and was really interested in it. A friend of ours has a Zoe and likes it. So I went away to think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I found this: this newer Renault Zoe got a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autocar.co.uk\/car-news\/new-cars\/renault-zoe-given-zero-stars-euro-ncap-safety-tests\">zero-star Euro-NCAP rating<\/a>! Mostly because they had removed a critical side-airbag. But also because the automated safety features weren&#8217;t up to scratch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One review was sub-titled: &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.carmagazine.co.uk\/car-reviews\/renault\/zoe-ev\/\">Little car, long range, don&#8217;t crash<\/a>&#8220;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Renault had apparently addressed some of the automated features in an update. And Euro-NCAP is like an enhanced safety standard. The Zoe is a legally-safe vehicle. So it&#8217;s not unsafe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But ALL the other cars we were looking at had 5-star Euro-NCAP ratings. So this seemed like a real downer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried to get past this. It seemed like a great car otherwise and great value. I could even ignore the reports of poor quality interior and sometimes leaky doors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I found out why we couldn&#8217;t test drive the actual car that was for sale. The story of &#8220;it&#8217;s on loan as a courtesy car&#8221; turned into &#8220;they forgot to charge it&#8221; and then into &#8220;the charging circuit is broken and needs to be replaced&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that point I quickly turned from being able to forgive its flaws to a hard &#8220;no thanks&#8221;. Both to the Zoe and to Salmon Sisters, who I felt had not been honest with us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nissan Leaf<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nissan Leaf was a great car. We looked at <a href=\"https:\/\/ev-database.org\/uk\/car\/1144\/Nissan-Leaf-eplus\">the &#8220;E+&#8221;<\/a> as this was the only one that had the range we needed. It had about 50 miles more range than the Hyundai Ioniq that we bought BUT it&#8217;s a less efficient car, so this came at the cost of a much larger 62kWh battery (vs 40kWh in the Ioniq).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of why it&#8217;s less efficient is that it&#8217;s more powerful. I mean, the Ioniq would accelerate quick if you put your foot down, but the Leaf&#8230; wow! It has 160kW of power equating to 215hp, vs the Ioniq&#8217;s 100kW\/134hp. (Those Tesla&#8217;s must be incredible!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Leaf felt more &#8220;manual&#8221; &#8211; like I was more in control and a bit more solid. The Hyundai felt a bit squishy and detached from the road. But really&#8230; I&#8217;m not a petrol head (we need some new words now, right?). The Ioniq is FINE and actually, I don&#8217;t want the encouragement to drive fast and hard. Plus, that bigger battery will take longer to charge up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the Leaf has a &#8220;CHAdeMO&#8221; rapid-charging port. This isn&#8217;t really <em>much<\/em> of a problem, but Europe is standardising on the &#8220;CCS&#8221; rapid charging ports and CHAdeMO may be a little bit harder to come across.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We liked the Leaf. It felt more like the kind of car we would drive and own. And it had a 5-star Euro NCAP safety rating. I would happily have bought it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hyundai Ioniq<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ev-database.org\/uk\/car\/1165\/Hyundai-IONIQ-Electric\">This is the one we bought<\/a>. Advertised range of 193 miles, real range of around 155 miles. Enough for our longer trip we need to do a lot. It&#8217;s 3 years old with 17,000 miles on it and the battery health seems fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main reason to choose this over the Leaf was the charging convenience. We don&#8217;t have a driveway or garage. We park on-street. So we can&#8217;t charge at home. So we need convenient charging. And the Ioniq&#8217;s greater efficiency, smaller battery size, quicker charging, and the more-commonly-found CCS charge port were what sold us on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to drive and has loads of safety features and clever stuff on board. And that 5-star Euro NCAP rating to stick it to the Zoe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, it feels less connected to the road than the Leaf was, but that&#8217;s OK. The interior is really nice if a bit lacking in headroom (none of us are too tall). And while lower power, it still has the instant torque that EV&#8217;s have which makes pulling away sometimes fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually like that it&#8217;s lower power. It has three driving modes: Eco, Normal and Sport. I&#8217;ve gotten used to Eco Mode which cranks up the regeneration (when the car harvests energy from braking) and kinda guides you into driving efficiently. And driving like this feels safer too. I&#8217;ve turned Sport Mode on a couple of times and it frightens me!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My only other complaint is that &#8230; well &#8230; it just <em>looks<\/em> a bit boring. It&#8217;s a sleek, grey saloon car. And the world is FULL of sleek, grey saloon cars. It&#8217;s a salesman&#8217;s car, not a family car. There&#8217;s not much fun about it. And it has this weird plate on the front that looks&#8230; just&#8230; weird.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230; we are REALLY happy with it. We are in a hugely privileged position to be able to own such a vehicle and we are really enjoying using it to get around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s been a lot to learn along the way. We&#8217;ve yet to do a drive of more than about 50 miles in it. But we hope this car will serve us well for many years to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where did you get it from?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, NOT &#8220;Salmon Sisters&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We found it on Auto Trader, who are great for search. But that search pointed us at <a href=\"https:\/\/drive-green.co.uk\/\">Drive Green<\/a> &#8211; a specialist used EV dealer just south of Bath (about 50 miles from us).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We took a day out to get there and go and try some cars out. One good thing about an independent dealership is that you can try a variety of makes and models, and they had a good stock of lots of different models. We could have tried BMW i3s, Peugeot e2008s, electric Minis, VW eGolfs, even used Teslas!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Drive Green team are brilliant. And they don&#8217;t want to sell you THEIR car. They want to sell you the car that&#8217;s right for you. They are highly recommended if you&#8217;re in the area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final notes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I said, we&#8217;re really fortunate to own this car. It&#8217;s a luxury. I feel quite embarrassed about it. But do we need it? REALLY need it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is probably no. We <em>could<\/em>, if we worked hard at it, be a zero-car family. I&#8217;d LOVE to not own a personal vehicle. To be in a car club. To have superb public transport around us. And to keep cycling for transport too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at this stage of life it&#8217;s enormously convenient to have access to a car.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We properly like our EV. We&#8217;re pretty certain we did the right thing getting it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we will try to remain a one-car family. (We know this is also a privilege!). We will keep cycling. We will keep avoiding the car for shorter journeys. We will keep asking our council and government for better infrastructure. And maybe, when this car has done its time, we won&#8217;t need to own one again? <\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>We recently bought an electric car. This post explains why we did this, what we purchased, and why we chose that car.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helpful note: I previously made an <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2023\/06\/my-simple-ev-terminology-cheatsheet\/\">EV &#8220;Cheat Sheet&#8221;<\/a> that explains most of the concepts and terminology around electric cars. If kWs, kWhs, CCS, and so on are confusing and you want to know what they all mean, that&#8217;s a good starting point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">TL;DR summary<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Our old car was dying.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We decided to go fully electric.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We needed a car that could get a family of 4 with luggage for a long weekend 120 miles in winter.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We looked at a number of used EV&#8217;s:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Renault Zoe (Hard NOPE!)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kia eNiro and Hyundai Kona (Nice cars &#8211; but more expensive.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>MG5 (Would have made a nice estate. Great value.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nissan Leaf (A close 2nd.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We bought a 2020 Hyundai Ioniq Electric.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We&#8217;re really happy with it!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">We know about the downsides<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, I want to make it clear that we know about the downsides of electric cars outside of their range and battery life. The <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Embodied_energy\">embodied energy<\/a> in their manufacture. The costs of digging up lithium and cobalt. The extra weight and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rac.co.uk\/drive\/electric-cars\/running\/do-electric-vehicles-produce-more-tyre-and-brake-pollution-than-petrol-and\/\">possible extra tyre particulate &#8220;emissions&#8221;<\/a>. And yes, the fact that <em>just not using a car is by far the best thing to do<\/em> for SO many reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/sounds\/play\/m001mt53\">What about the bridges\/car parks\/etc<\/a>? Well, yes, EV&#8217;s are heavier than combustion engine cars. But before you start wondering if it&#8217;s small, electric, family cars that are going to break the world, may I first ask you to consider the unnecessary, ridiculous, space-taking, road-wearing, gas-guzzling, child- and planet-killing SUVs that have become so popular.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cars I&#8217;m looking at are well within the specifications that car parks and bridges are built to. If you&#8217;re really worried about this, get complaining about the Nissan Navaras and Ford F150s of the world and all the other ridiculously over-sized vehicles that most people can&#8217;t drive or park properly. Grrrrr. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really want to stress that we have weighed up a LOT of factors in deciding to buy this car. We haven&#8217;t just decided it would be cool to own an EV. Some have said that EVs are marketing hype and a ploy by the car industry to keep us buying cars instead of fixing the actual problems that personal vehicle ownership cause. And yes, I have concerns about some aspects of EV&#8217;s. But I can&#8217;t deny it: cars are convenient, and an EV seems like the best option right now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve seriously questioned if we need a car. Ideally we would be in a decent car club, or car-sharing scheme, and we would hire for longer holidays and stuff. But this just does not exist near us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I cycle a lot instead of driving. We have not flown anywhere for&#8230; what?&#8230; 10 or 11 years? Maybe more? We do SO much of the &#8220;right things&#8221; for the environment in the face of SO much who-gives-a-crappery. And we have good, family-related reasons right now to want to be able to make some journeys easily. So we determined that we would get a new car. This is a huge privilege. And we&#8217;ll try really hard to use it as efficiently and carefully as we can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at why we needed it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Old Car<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We are a single car family. This is a privilege we are aware of. We can both work remotely. We are both able to walk or cycle. We literally have a supermarket at the end of our road and a primary school at the end of our garden.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our old car was 15 years old. A petrol Toyota midi-MPV (a Corolla Verso).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We bought it 11 years ago for about \u00a37000. It had done 94,000 miles. We had run it into the ground. The clutch was slipping. The engine was rattling. The interior was falling apart. The paint was flaking. I was convinced that it was about to give up in a fairly serious way. And I didn&#8217;t want that to happen to us on some long family journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We really got as much out of this car as we felt we could. And this car had been BRILLIANT. Other than replacing the drive shaft and having to re-attach some stupid metal heat-shield plate, this car had done us SO proud. It owed us and the world nothing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But its time had come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What we needed &#8211; our car usage<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We only do about 6000 &#8211; 7000 miles per year. We are fortunate enough that neither of us commute on a regular basis. So our driving is mostly a mix of:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Category 1: around-town stuff in bad weather and with the kids or heavy loads<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Category 2: shorter local &#8220;expeditions&#8221;, 15-50 miles<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Category 3: longer short-holiday trips of 100-150 miles with light luggage (occasionally much longer trips)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Category 4: bigger holidays that aren&#8217;t long distances, but that included camping with a VERY full load and a roofbox<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one <em>critical<\/em> journey that we need to make sort-of-often, and that&#8217;s 120 miles to visit my in-laws. Now that the kids are both well past toddler stage, we can do this trip relatively lightly and it&#8217;s a shorter category 3 trip.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Did you consider a plug-in hybrid, or regular hybrid?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Plug-in_hybrid\">PHEV&#8217;s (plugin hybrids)<\/a> seemed popular, and I&#8217;d had some recommendations. But some had also said that they were the worst of both worlds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We felt that our needs fitted within the abilities of an EV available within our budget. So I didn&#8217;t want the extra cost and complexity when it wasn&#8217;t really needed. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not really a problem, but I feel like having a combustion engine AND electric motor and battery AND the systems to manage it all was overly complex. For me, more complexity is more that can go wrong, so if we don&#8217;t need it then we should avoid it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A regular hybrid wasn&#8217;t on the table. It&#8217;s neat tech, but it&#8217;s primarily a petrol\/diesel car, and we were trying to avoid burning fossil fuels, so again, if we could avoid it, we should.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What we needed &#8211; our EV requirements<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We had decided that we couldn&#8217;t do category 4 trips in an EV. If we wanted to do that we would hire something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we needed a real-world range of, ideally, around 120+ miles to visit the in-laws, assuming we could pick up a top-up charge on the way, or charge at the destination somehow. We need this range when fully-loaded in winter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We needed a boot big enough for family-of-four luggage for a long weekend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we had a budget of \u00a315,000 &#8211; \u00a320,000. For the right car maybe we could do more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cars we looked at<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Renault Zoe (2022)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a running joke in our family, after a poor experience with electrics on a French car bought from the dealer-who-shall-not-be-named (let&#8217;s call them &#8220;Salmon Sisters&#8221; for now), that I would never buy a French car of any sort from Salmon Sisters, let alone <em>an electric one<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after doing some intense EV research and looking around online I noticed that Salmon Sisters &#8211; who are very local to us &#8211; had a smart-looking, 1-year old Renault Zoe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I signed up and took it for a test drive. Well, not the one that was for sale, but an equivalent car (don&#8217;t ask). And it was pretty nice. Great value. Just about big enough. <a href=\"https:\/\/ev-database.org\/uk\/car\/1205\/Renault-Zoe-ZE50-R135\">Advertised range of 240 miles, and a &#8220;real world&#8221; range of 190<\/a>. Rapid charging. And all the modern conveniences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked all the right questions and was really interested in it. A friend of ours has a Zoe and likes it. So I went away to think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I found this: this newer Renault Zoe got a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.autocar.co.uk\/car-news\/new-cars\/renault-zoe-given-zero-stars-euro-ncap-safety-tests\">zero-star Euro-NCAP rating<\/a>! Mostly because they had removed a critical side-airbag. But also because the automated safety features weren&#8217;t up to scratch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One review was sub-titled: &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.carmagazine.co.uk\/car-reviews\/renault\/zoe-ev\/\">Little car, long range, don&#8217;t crash<\/a>&#8220;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Renault had apparently addressed some of the automated features in an update. And Euro-NCAP is like an enhanced safety standard. The Zoe is a legally-safe vehicle. So it&#8217;s not unsafe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But ALL the other cars we were looking at had 5-star Euro-NCAP ratings. So this seemed like a real downer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried to get past this. It seemed like a great car otherwise and great value. I could even ignore the reports of poor quality interior and sometimes leaky doors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I found out why we couldn&#8217;t test drive the actual car that was for sale. The story of &#8220;it&#8217;s on loan as a courtesy car&#8221; turned into &#8220;they forgot to charge it&#8221; and then into &#8220;the charging circuit is broken and needs to be replaced&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that point I quickly turned from being able to forgive its flaws to a hard &#8220;no thanks&#8221;. Both to the Zoe and to Salmon Sisters, who I felt had not been honest with us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nissan Leaf<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nissan Leaf was a great car. We looked at <a href=\"https:\/\/ev-database.org\/uk\/car\/1144\/Nissan-Leaf-eplus\">the &#8220;E+&#8221;<\/a> as this was the only one that had the range we needed. It had about 50 miles more range than the Hyundai Ioniq that we bought BUT it&#8217;s a less efficient car, so this came at the cost of a much larger 62kWh battery (vs 40kWh in the Ioniq).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of why it&#8217;s less efficient is that it&#8217;s more powerful. I mean, the Ioniq would accelerate quick if you put your foot down, but the Leaf&#8230; wow! It has 160kW of power equating to 215hp, vs the Ioniq&#8217;s 100kW\/134hp. (Those Tesla&#8217;s must be incredible!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Leaf felt more &#8220;manual&#8221; &#8211; like I was more in control and a bit more solid. The Hyundai felt a bit squishy and detached from the road. But really&#8230; I&#8217;m not a petrol head (we need some new words now, right?). The Ioniq is FINE and actually, I don&#8217;t want the encouragement to drive fast and hard. Plus, that bigger battery will take longer to charge up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the Leaf has a &#8220;CHAdeMO&#8221; rapid-charging port. This isn&#8217;t really <em>much<\/em> of a problem, but Europe is standardising on the &#8220;CCS&#8221; rapid charging ports and CHAdeMO may be a little bit harder to come across.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We liked the Leaf. It felt more like the kind of car we would drive and own. And it had a 5-star Euro NCAP safety rating. I would happily have bought it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hyundai Ioniq<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ev-database.org\/uk\/car\/1165\/Hyundai-IONIQ-Electric\">This is the one we bought<\/a>. Advertised range of 193 miles, real range of around 155 miles. Enough for our longer trip we need to do a lot. It&#8217;s 3 years old with 17,000 miles on it and the battery health seems fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main reason to choose this over the Leaf was the charging convenience. We don&#8217;t have a driveway or garage. We park on-street. So we can&#8217;t charge at home. So we need convenient charging. And the Ioniq&#8217;s greater efficiency, smaller battery size, quicker charging, and the more-commonly-found CCS charge port were what sold us on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to drive and has loads of safety features and clever stuff on board. And that 5-star Euro NCAP rating to stick it to the Zoe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, it feels less connected to the road than the Leaf was, but that&#8217;s OK. The interior is really nice if a bit lacking in headroom (none of us are too tall). And while lower power, it still has the instant torque that EV&#8217;s have which makes pulling away sometimes fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually like that it&#8217;s lower power. It has three driving modes: Eco, Normal and Sport. I&#8217;ve gotten used to Eco Mode which cranks up the regeneration (when the car harvests energy from braking) and kinda guides you into driving efficiently. And driving like this feels safer too. I&#8217;ve turned Sport Mode on a couple of times and it frightens me!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My only other complaint is that &#8230; well &#8230; it just <em>looks<\/em> a bit boring. It&#8217;s a sleek, grey saloon car. And the world is FULL of sleek, grey saloon cars. It&#8217;s a salesman&#8217;s car, not a family car. There&#8217;s not much fun about it. And it has this weird plate on the front that looks&#8230; just&#8230; weird.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230; we are REALLY happy with it. We are in a hugely privileged position to be able to own such a vehicle and we are really enjoying using it to get around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s been a lot to learn along the way. We&#8217;ve yet to do a drive of more than about 50 miles in it. But we hope this car will serve us well for many years to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where did you get it from?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, NOT &#8220;Salmon Sisters&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We found it on Auto Trader, who are great for search. But that search pointed us at <a href=\"https:\/\/drive-green.co.uk\/\">Drive Green<\/a> &#8211; a specialist used EV dealer just south of Bath (about 50 miles from us).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We took a day out to get there and go and try some cars out. One good thing about an independent dealership is that you can try a variety of makes and models, and they had a good stock of lots of different models. We could have tried BMW i3s, Peugeot e2008s, electric Minis, VW eGolfs, even used Teslas!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Drive Green team are brilliant. And they don&#8217;t want to sell you THEIR car. They want to sell you the car that&#8217;s right for you. They are highly recommended if you&#8217;re in the area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final notes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I said, we&#8217;re really fortunate to own this car. It&#8217;s a luxury. I feel quite embarrassed about it. But do we need it? REALLY need it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is probably no. We <em>could<\/em>, if we worked hard at it, be a zero-car family. I&#8217;d LOVE to not own a personal vehicle. To be in a car club. To have superb public transport around us. And to keep cycling for transport too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at this stage of life it&#8217;s enormously convenient to have access to a car.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We properly like our EV. We&#8217;re pretty certain we did the right thing getting it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we will try to remain a one-car family. (We know this is also a privilege!). We will keep cycling. We will keep avoiding the car for shorter journeys. We will keep asking our council and government for better infrastructure. And maybe, when this car has done its time, we won&#8217;t need to own one again? <\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>There was a time when a new web-based side project was a case of buying a domain, firing up a WordPress instance, wading through installs of a bunch of plugins and maybe a page builder theme. But this was slow and, in many cases, bloated, and could get expensive with domain and hosting costs. In many cases it was way more than I actually needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I now have a process that gets me small, fast, side-project websites for virtually zero cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week I quickly spun up <a href=\"https:\/\/ev-tools.veryuseful.app\/\">EV Tools<\/a> for me to do some calculations while I was in Europe. Zero cost. Just the coding. So easy. Kick-ass performance scores. Automated deployment from Git. What&#8217;s not to like?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This method is not for the everyday web user, as you will see. But if you do web dev, there may be some stuff here that&#8217;s an &#8220;Aha!&#8221; moment for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s see how it works&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Stack<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially the not-so-secret sauce here is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A simple static site generator (I made <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/12\/hang-on-php-is-a-static-site-generator\/\">my own in PHP<\/a>, but you can choose your own tech)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some neat domains that I make sub-domains from (free side-project domains FTW!!)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pages.cloudflare.com\/\">Cloudflare Pages<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.netlify.com\/\">Netlify<\/a> (or <a href=\"https:\/\/pages.github.com\/\">GitHub pages<\/a>) for hosting<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition I have a <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/small-site-template\/tree\/main\">starter template<\/a> that includes TailwindCSS, Tailwind Forms and Typography plugins and <a href=\"https:\/\/alpinejs.dev\/\">AlpineJS<\/a> for JavaScript sprinkles. I happen to own a license for TailwindUI too if I need something more fancy, as I&#8217;m NOT a designer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those domains I put subdomains on? I happen to own <code>veryuseful.app<\/code> (which has <a href=\"https:\/\/veryuseful.app\/\">a nice index<\/a>, built using this very system, of course!) and <code>forwp.dev<\/code> (which is new and only has one secret project on it at the moment).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can find one that works (and with all the new top-level domains like <code>.tools<\/code> and <code>.dev<\/code> and <code>.app<\/code> it&#8217;s not so hard!) then these let you create as many sub-domains as you like, for free!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, they may not have the SEO juice or be so memorable. But the point of these projects is to quickly put something on the web for me, or to share on social media. Not to build a new SaaS or something. So it really doesn&#8217;t matter. And if it does: keep forking our for those domains, or just upgrade later!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Process<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, the process is a bit complicated if you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing. You&#8217;ll need to do DNS and Git and command-line and hand-code (or copy and paste, or generate with AI) HTML and CSS. You can bolt onto that whatever you like, but that&#8217;s a minimum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And once you &#8220;get it&#8221;, you can replicate this process pretty quickly. You can probably even automate more of it with CLI tools and APIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I won&#8217;t go into <em>how<\/em> to do each step. If you&#8217;re qualified to use this process, you <em>probably<\/em> don&#8217;t need those extra details anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the main steps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Create a new Git repository from <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/small-site-template\/\">my template in GitHub<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clone the new repository locally.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make some HTML files.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Run the build step (<code>.\/build.sh<\/code>)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Commit everything to Git and push to GitHub<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Set up a new Cloudflare Pages project, connect to GitHub if you need to, and deploy the application on a temporary URL (Cloudflare uses <code>&lt;something>.pages.dev<\/code>)\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>With my template you need to set the build output directory to &#8220;public&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Save and deploy the site<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once deployed, you can go and add the custom domain. If you specify a new subdomain of a domain that you own, this will be created and DNS set up for you. It will even create an HTTPS certificate!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it. Now you can edit your HTML\/CSS\/JS files, use the build step when you need to, and a push to GitHub will trigger a deploy. Magic!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This new tech is awesome<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So many cool new bits of tech have come together to make this possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern CSS and JavaScript is amazing. You don&#8217;t need libraries\/frameworks for simple sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I pair it with Tailwind because I like that for small projects that I need to revisit from time to time and it&#8217;s proven to be robust and &#8211; crucially for this kind of project &#8211; low on dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I use AlpineJS for those reactive JS sprinkles without needing a full-on framework that will go out of date.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Jamstack&#8221; hosting gives us static hosting for free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LetsEncrypt secures the web for us for free with HTTPS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subdomains give me unlimited domains (virtually) for free for new small projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>GitHub hosts the code and pairs with the static hosting to achieve automated deployments with no FTP or anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also use <a href=\"https:\/\/usefathom.com\/ref\/SVE71E\">Fathom Analytics<\/a> on some sites. This is not free, but as long as they remain low-traffic I get 100,000 page views a month spread across up to 50 sites. This lets me get some idea of who is coming and from where without the need for faffy cookie banners or privacy policies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WHAT AN AMAZING WORLD WE LIVE IN that we have access to all this at low cost so we can tinker and play and create as web people!?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re curious, here&#8217;s some sites that I use some of all of this technique on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/ev-tools.veryuseful.app\/\">EV Tools<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tweet-finder.veryuseful.app\/\">Tweet Finder<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.com\/\">WordlePress<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">Can I PHP?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",

        "title": "FREE WEBSITES!! How I make small, side-project websites for free (pretty much)",
        "content": "\n<p>There was a time when a new web-based side project was a case of buying a domain, firing up a WordPress instance, wading through installs of a bunch of plugins and maybe a page builder theme. But this was slow and, in many cases, bloated, and could get expensive with domain and hosting costs. In many cases it was way more than I actually needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I now have a process that gets me small, fast, side-project websites for virtually zero cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week I quickly spun up <a href=\"https:\/\/ev-tools.veryuseful.app\/\">EV Tools<\/a> for me to do some calculations while I was in Europe. Zero cost. Just the coding. So easy. Kick-ass performance scores. Automated deployment from Git. What&#8217;s not to like?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This method is not for the everyday web user, as you will see. But if you do web dev, there may be some stuff here that&#8217;s an &#8220;Aha!&#8221; moment for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s see how it works&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Stack<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially the not-so-secret sauce here is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A simple static site generator (I made <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/12\/hang-on-php-is-a-static-site-generator\/\">my own in PHP<\/a>, but you can choose your own tech)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some neat domains that I make sub-domains from (free side-project domains FTW!!)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pages.cloudflare.com\/\">Cloudflare Pages<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.netlify.com\/\">Netlify<\/a> (or <a href=\"https:\/\/pages.github.com\/\">GitHub pages<\/a>) for hosting<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition I have a <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/small-site-template\/tree\/main\">starter template<\/a> that includes TailwindCSS, Tailwind Forms and Typography plugins and <a href=\"https:\/\/alpinejs.dev\/\">AlpineJS<\/a> for JavaScript sprinkles. I happen to own a license for TailwindUI too if I need something more fancy, as I&#8217;m NOT a designer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those domains I put subdomains on? I happen to own <code>veryuseful.app<\/code> (which has <a href=\"https:\/\/veryuseful.app\/\">a nice index<\/a>, built using this very system, of course!) and <code>forwp.dev<\/code> (which is new and only has one secret project on it at the moment).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can find one that works (and with all the new top-level domains like <code>.tools<\/code> and <code>.dev<\/code> and <code>.app<\/code> it&#8217;s not so hard!) then these let you create as many sub-domains as you like, for free!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, they may not have the SEO juice or be so memorable. But the point of these projects is to quickly put something on the web for me, or to share on social media. Not to build a new SaaS or something. So it really doesn&#8217;t matter. And if it does: keep forking our for those domains, or just upgrade later!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Process<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, the process is a bit complicated if you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing. You&#8217;ll need to do DNS and Git and command-line and hand-code (or copy and paste, or generate with AI) HTML and CSS. You can bolt onto that whatever you like, but that&#8217;s a minimum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And once you &#8220;get it&#8221;, you can replicate this process pretty quickly. You can probably even automate more of it with CLI tools and APIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I won&#8217;t go into <em>how<\/em> to do each step. If you&#8217;re qualified to use this process, you <em>probably<\/em> don&#8217;t need those extra details anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the main steps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Create a new Git repository from <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/small-site-template\/\">my template in GitHub<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clone the new repository locally.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make some HTML files.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Run the build step (<code>.\/build.sh<\/code>)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Commit everything to Git and push to GitHub<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Set up a new Cloudflare Pages project, connect to GitHub if you need to, and deploy the application on a temporary URL (Cloudflare uses <code>&lt;something>.pages.dev<\/code>)\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>With my template you need to set the build output directory to &#8220;public&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Save and deploy the site<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once deployed, you can go and add the custom domain. If you specify a new subdomain of a domain that you own, this will be created and DNS set up for you. It will even create an HTTPS certificate!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it. Now you can edit your HTML\/CSS\/JS files, use the build step when you need to, and a push to GitHub will trigger a deploy. Magic!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This new tech is awesome<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So many cool new bits of tech have come together to make this possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern CSS and JavaScript is amazing. You don&#8217;t need libraries\/frameworks for simple sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I pair it with Tailwind because I like that for small projects that I need to revisit from time to time and it&#8217;s proven to be robust and &#8211; crucially for this kind of project &#8211; low on dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I use AlpineJS for those reactive JS sprinkles without needing a full-on framework that will go out of date.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Jamstack&#8221; hosting gives us static hosting for free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LetsEncrypt secures the web for us for free with HTTPS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subdomains give me unlimited domains (virtually) for free for new small projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>GitHub hosts the code and pairs with the static hosting to achieve automated deployments with no FTP or anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also use <a href=\"https:\/\/usefathom.com\/ref\/SVE71E\">Fathom Analytics<\/a> on some sites. This is not free, but as long as they remain low-traffic I get 100,000 page views a month spread across up to 50 sites. This lets me get some idea of who is coming and from where without the need for faffy cookie banners or privacy policies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WHAT AN AMAZING WORLD WE LIVE IN that we have access to all this at low cost so we can tinker and play and create as web people!?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re curious, here&#8217;s some sites that I use some of all of this technique on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/ev-tools.veryuseful.app\/\">EV Tools<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tweet-finder.veryuseful.app\/\">Tweet Finder<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.com\/\">WordlePress<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">Can I PHP?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",

I don&#8217;t pass work to others. They pass it to me. My job is really to shut up and do what I&#8217;m told.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I might do technical architecture and have technical opinions about HOW to do the things that I&#8217;m told. But I&#8217;m not supposed to do strategy and planning and determine WHAT to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously I was in a similar job working with IT systems at a low-level. Working with the bottom of the pile in a technical stack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s this weird thing about being bottom of the pile; about being the place that the work ends up at: you get to see a lot of things!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seem backwards, or upside-down. But I keep finding myself in roles where I seem to have a much wider view than others above me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When everyone needs something done on your system, you get a sometimes-uniquely-broad view of what&#8217;s going on. A bunch of different plans and strategies that can&#8217;t necessarily see each other all end up with actions that arrive at the bottom of the pile &#8211; with you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s the opportunity that you have as a bottom-of-the-pile developer: making connections!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds odd because it&#8217;s a people thing, not a technology thing. And it may not be your strength. But there&#8217;s a chance that you are one of the few people who can see both &#8220;that thing up there&#8221; <em>and<\/em> &#8220;that thing over there&#8221;. So here&#8217;s my tip for levelling up and being a great developer:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take responsibility for making connections! At the very least, ask the question: &#8220;I see that you want to me do &#8216;This&#8217;&#8230; but it might conflict with &#8216;That&#8217;. Are you aware of &#8216;That&#8217;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This relates to another thought of mine. I remember hearing on a podcast once that a senior person should be faster at their work. This is why senior people get paid more &#8211; they get more done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, yes: if I know my task, and if I have focus time, I should &#8230; I <em>will<\/em> &#8230; be quicker at getting the job done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you come to me with a request rather than a defined task, I say that a senior digs in; asks questions; finds out more; challenges assumptions; takes steps back to look at the broader picture; and does some &#8220;systems thinking&#8221;, before knuckling down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might slow you down. Possibly a LOT. But the difference is that it gets you <s>the right<\/s> a better result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So: maybe you too are in a bottom-of-the-pile developer role? If so, don&#8217;t think you are unimportant. You might see things that no one else does. So take in the view; ask questions; make connections; think about the broader picture that you &#8211; and maybe only you &#8211; can see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could slow you down, but honestly, for the sake of asking a few questions about what you can see, you could also end up being a hero!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>An observation from work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a senior developer, but I&#8217;m still a developer. I&#8217;m the &#8220;bottom of the pile&#8221;. I don&#8217;t pass work to others. They pass it to me. My job is really to shut up and do what I&#8217;m told.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I might do technical architecture and have technical opinions about HOW to do the things that I&#8217;m told. But I&#8217;m not supposed to do strategy and planning and determine WHAT to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously I was in a similar job working with IT systems at a low-level. Working with the bottom of the pile in a technical stack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s this weird thing about being bottom of the pile; about being the place that the work ends up at: you get to see a lot of things!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seem backwards, or upside-down. But I keep finding myself in roles where I seem to have a much wider view than others above me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When everyone needs something done on your system, you get a sometimes-uniquely-broad view of what&#8217;s going on. A bunch of different plans and strategies that can&#8217;t necessarily see each other all end up with actions that arrive at the bottom of the pile &#8211; with you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s the opportunity that you have as a bottom-of-the-pile developer: making connections!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds odd because it&#8217;s a people thing, not a technology thing. And it may not be your strength. But there&#8217;s a chance that you are one of the few people who can see both &#8220;that thing up there&#8221; <em>and<\/em> &#8220;that thing over there&#8221;. So here&#8217;s my tip for levelling up and being a great developer:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take responsibility for making connections! At the very least, ask the question: &#8220;I see that you want to me do &#8216;This&#8217;&#8230; but it might conflict with &#8216;That&#8217;. Are you aware of &#8216;That&#8217;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This relates to another thought of mine. I remember hearing on a podcast once that a senior person should be faster at their work. This is why senior people get paid more &#8211; they get more done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, yes: if I know my task, and if I have focus time, I should &#8230; I <em>will<\/em> &#8230; be quicker at getting the job done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you come to me with a request rather than a defined task, I say that a senior digs in; asks questions; finds out more; challenges assumptions; takes steps back to look at the broader picture; and does some &#8220;systems thinking&#8221;, before knuckling down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might slow you down. Possibly a LOT. But the difference is that it gets you <s>the right<\/s> a better result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So: maybe you too are in a bottom-of-the-pile developer role? If so, don&#8217;t think you are unimportant. You might see things that no one else does. So take in the view; ask questions; make connections; think about the broader picture that you &#8211; and maybe only you &#8211; can see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could slow you down, but honestly, for the sake of asking a few questions about what you can see, you could also end up being a hero!<\/p>\n",
