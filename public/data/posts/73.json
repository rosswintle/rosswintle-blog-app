A good ride but my knees hurt a bit &#8211; probably beacause I&#8217;ve not been doing my stretches while I&#8217;ve not been cycling to work &#8211; must keep that up even when I&#8217;m not doing a daily ride.<\/p>\n<p>The stretches are mostly for my &#8220;Glutes&#8221; (mostly my gluteus medius) but also for a thing called the IT band (nothing to do with computers) that runs from the bum down the side of the leg.   Forgive my amateur physiology. The glutes pull the band to stop your legs collapsing underneath you.  If the glutes or the band are tight it seems to rub against the knee causing a dull pain.<\/p>\n<p>It also makes me flat footed (called over-pronation).  Just another of my ongoing health things that I keep at bay by doing certain things.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that there are all sorts of other mechanics going on, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the saddle high enough = are my legs bending too much?<\/li>\n<li>Have I got the right balance of cadence (rate of pedalling) and pressure?<\/li>\n<li>Are my feet in the right place on the pedals?  If the feet are twisted that can put additional strain on the knees.<\/li>\n<li>Am I pushing with the right part of the foot?  I think you need to try to spread load across the foot.  As I&#8217;m flat footed I tend to push with the ball of my foot so I need to make a conscious effort to put some pressure on the outside of my foot.  This also balances the quadriceps in the legs &#8211; you use the inner quads to push with the ball of your foot and the outer quads to push with the outside.<\/li>\n<li>Am I pushing with both legs?  The pain is usually in my right leg.  Of course, I&#8217;m right footed so I lead and do more pedalling with my right leg.  I need to balance that too.<\/li>\n<li>Are my knees in the right place? I&#8217;ve read that, ideally, the knee should sit directly above the foot and press straight downwards, rather than having your knees sticking out or squeezing in towards the bike.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As I say, all stuff I&#8217;ve read but it all makes sense and seems to work &#8211; if I do the stretches and try to balance everything and pedal right I can ride strong for ages.<\/p>\n<p>And you thought cycling was simple!?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Went out for a ride by myself this afternoon. Managed 21.24 miles in 1:24:31, averaging 15.0 mph overall.  A good ride but my knees hurt a bit &#8211; probably beacause I&#8217;ve not been doing my stretches while I&#8217;ve not been cycling to work &#8211; must keep that up even when I&#8217;m not doing a daily ride.<\/p>\n<p>The stretches are mostly for my &#8220;Glutes&#8221; (mostly my gluteus medius) but also for a thing called the IT band (nothing to do with computers) that runs from the bum down the side of the leg.   Forgive my amateur physiology. The glutes pull the band to stop your legs collapsing underneath you.  If the glutes or the band are tight it seems to rub against the knee causing a dull pain.<\/p>\n<p>It also makes me flat footed (called over-pronation).  Just another of my ongoing health things that I keep at bay by doing certain things.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that there are all sorts of other mechanics going on, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the saddle high enough = are my legs bending too much?<\/li>\n<li>Have I got the right balance of cadence (rate of pedalling) and pressure?<\/li>\n<li>Are my feet in the right place on the pedals?  If the feet are twisted that can put additional strain on the knees.<\/li>\n<li>Am I pushing with the right part of the foot?  I think you need to try to spread load across the foot.  As I&#8217;m flat footed I tend to push with the ball of my foot so I need to make a conscious effort to put some pressure on the outside of my foot.  This also balances the quadriceps in the legs &#8211; you use the inner quads to push with the ball of your foot and the outer quads to push with the outside.<\/li>\n<li>Am I pushing with both legs?  The pain is usually in my right leg.  Of course, I&#8217;m right footed so I lead and do more pedalling with my right leg.  I need to balance that too.<\/li>\n<li>Are my knees in the right place? I&#8217;ve read that, ideally, the knee should sit directly above the foot and press straight downwards, rather than having your knees sticking out or squeezing in towards the bike.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As I say, all stuff I&#8217;ve read but it all makes sense and seems to work &#8211; if I do the stretches and try to balance everything and pedal right I can ride strong for ages.<\/p>\n<p>And you thought cycling was simple!?<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m VERY grateful to my boss for the time off and the rest.  But I feel like a bit of a fraud now.  It was all very real on Saturday but now I wonder if there was some overreaction.

I guess we can only wait and see.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned some things in the meantime, which I&#8217;ll try to write up at some point but for now, I&#8217;m doing OK.<\/p>\n",

Decided not to go to stag day but then stressed a lot about whether Sally should go.  Eventually she decided she wouldn&#8217;t.  Went to BBQ in evening.  Very low all day, very tired, dazed and confused but no more crying.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Sunday 29th April<\/span> &#8211; slept well, fine again for most of the day, went for long bike ride and to church, ended the day feeling low and like crying again but didn&#8217;t.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Monday 30th April<\/span> &#8211; slept OK, felt VERY tired and pushed through it, started feeling better about 4pm and had a good, if tired, evening.

Felt good most of the day but boss replied and implored me to take time off.

We started out on Sustrans&#8217; National Cycle route 45, which is great BUT, in their wonderful efforts to get you off road as much as possible they don&#8217;t half put you on some narrow and gravelly tracks.  You can&#8217;t get much speed up at all on some of these.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; the NCN is a GREAT thing but sometimes you have to be a bit creative to get where you want in the way that you want.<\/p>\n<p>Good ride though!<\/p>\n",

We started out on Sustrans&#8217; National Cycle route 45, which is great BUT, in their wonderful efforts to get you off road as much as possible they don&#8217;t half put you on some narrow and gravelly tracks.  You can&#8217;t get much speed up at all on some of these.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; the NCN is a GREAT thing but sometimes you have to be a bit creative to get where you want in the way that you want.<\/p>\n<p>Good ride though!<\/p>\n",

This works well as it allows me to keep my favourites with Google and get to them from wherever I can login &#8211; I get the same favourites\/bookmarks on all the three computers I mainly use (work, home desktop and home laptop).<\/p>\n<p>In fact, I&#8217;m a bit of a Google addict &#8211; documents, bookmarks, mail, maps, notes, RSS feeds &#8211; they&#8217;re all on Google.  I&#8217;m sure this is a bad thing in the grand scheme of things &#8211; having all your eggs in one commercial basket, but their user interfaces are so simple and intuitive, their software is good and works well, it&#8217;s clean, quick and it all works like a dream.<\/p>\n<p>I should probably hate Google as much as I hate Microsoft but somehow I can&#8217;t bring myself to.
