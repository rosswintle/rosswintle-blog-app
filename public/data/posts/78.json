Campbell is very open about mental health and a supporter of mental health causes, so I bought the book with interest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re looking for a very open, frank, honest, and detailed biography\/memoir with lots of family history, and to gain an understanding of what suffering from depression is like then this is probably a good read.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, personally, found it rather self-indulgent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for science, or self-help then you probably want something else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just, not what I thought it would be.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;d heard a lot about Brandon Sanderson, and &#8211; as is my probably-not-very-ethical-really way &#8211; I saw The Book of Kings on offer on Kobo and bought it to see if I could get into it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And WHAT a book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, it&#8217;s epic. Literally. It&#8217;s huge. And I&#8217;m a slow reader. But I did make it through. And I was entranced by the world that had been created and the story that was set before me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I DID love it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were downsides though. Some of the descriptive parts &#8211; especially of battles &#8211; were just really very ridiculously long and drawn out. It was slow and hard-going at time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the ending was pretty disappointing too. I knew it was part one of at least five and maybe several more. But even with that knowledge the ending should have been a relief, but instead I felt the weight of the next tome already upon me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will have a break, but yes, book 2 is lined up ready to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brilliant.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of using RSS and I&#8217;ve loved the iOS and MacOs Reeder app for years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently a new version of <a href=\"https:\/\/reederapp.com\/\">Reeder<\/a> came out that&#8217;s in many ways different, but in many ways similar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It&#8217;s a subscription model to get all the features (but it&#8217;s VERY good value).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It doesn&#8217;t integrate with other services for it&#8217;s syncing. It&#8217;s just a feed reader and read-it-later app that syncs over iCloud.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It includes a video player and seems to also have a good podcast ability.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It emphasises a timeline sync feature.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I immediately tried it out as Reeder is so good and I use it a lot. I was keen to see what was new and different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, the free version only lets you add 10 feeds, and as such it doesn&#8217;t let you import. So if you&#8217;re an existing Reeder user, it&#8217;s not easy to migrate and try it out, which was a bit sad. I&#8217;m hoping the developer will realise that this could be better and maybe a one-time import should be allowed or a free trial or something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I haven&#8217;t paid anything for Reeder since a \u00a310 purchase of Reeder 5 for Mac in 2021, I was happy to pay \u00a31 to get a month&#8217;s upgrade and do an import and try it out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing I realised is that my existing Reeder app syncs with <a href=\"https:\/\/feedbin.com\/\">Feedbin<\/a> (which I also love &#8211; especially in the browser). And Feedbin has a bunch of other features that I use, like forwarding email newsletters, which I would miss in Reeder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I kind of immediately dropped it and unsubscribed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I kept opening it to check in. And what you have to get is that this timeline-sync thing is the main thing here. It&#8217;s trying to be a curated social news feed algorithm thing. You have to think of it like that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you do, and you combine that with the save-for-later feature, you can scroll through your main feed; swipe to read-later anything that&#8217;s of interest, then switch to the read-later feed to actually read things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s quite a nice workflow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ll keep trying it out this month, but I&#8217;ll also keep Feedbin because the email newsletters thing is such a cool feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feedbin can provide a combined feed of starred articles that I could subscribe to with Reeder, but that&#8217;s not really want I want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I might try out <a href=\"https:\/\/kill-the-newsletter.com\/\">kill-the-newsletter.com<\/a> as a way to get around this &#8211; send newsletters to this address, and subscribe to that feed in Reeder. That might work and may be worth a try. But I don&#8217;t know how reliable and sustainable Kill the Newsletter is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s a nice app. It&#8217;s great value. I&#8217;m going to keep trying it and see if I can figure out a way to use it for what I need. But in the meantime it&#8217;s Feedbin and &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/reederapp.com\/classic\/\">Reeder Classic<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of using RSS and I&#8217;ve loved the iOS and MacOs Reeder app for years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently a new version of <a href=\"https:\/\/reederapp.com\/\">Reeder<\/a> came out that&#8217;s in many ways different, but in many ways similar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It&#8217;s a subscription model to get all the features (but it&#8217;s VERY good value).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It doesn&#8217;t integrate with other services for it&#8217;s syncing. It&#8217;s just a feed reader and read-it-later app that syncs over iCloud.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It includes a video player and seems to also have a good podcast ability.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It emphasises a timeline sync feature.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I immediately tried it out as Reeder is so good and I use it a lot. I was keen to see what was new and different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, the free version only lets you add 10 feeds, and as such it doesn&#8217;t let you import. So if you&#8217;re an existing Reeder user, it&#8217;s not easy to migrate and try it out, which was a bit sad. I&#8217;m hoping the developer will realise that this could be better and maybe a one-time import should be allowed or a free trial or something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I haven&#8217;t paid anything for Reeder since a \u00a310 purchase of Reeder 5 for Mac in 2021, I was happy to pay \u00a31 to get a month&#8217;s upgrade and do an import and try it out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing I realised is that my existing Reeder app syncs with <a href=\"https:\/\/feedbin.com\/\">Feedbin<\/a> (which I also love &#8211; especially in the browser). And Feedbin has a bunch of other features that I use, like forwarding email newsletters, which I would miss in Reeder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I kind of immediately dropped it and unsubscribed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I kept opening it to check in. And what you have to get is that this timeline-sync thing is the main thing here. It&#8217;s trying to be a curated social news feed algorithm thing. You have to think of it like that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you do, and you combine that with the save-for-later feature, you can scroll through your main feed; swipe to read-later anything that&#8217;s of interest, then switch to the read-later feed to actually read things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s quite a nice workflow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ll keep trying it out this month, but I&#8217;ll also keep Feedbin because the email newsletters thing is such a cool feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feedbin can provide a combined feed of starred articles that I could subscribe to with Reeder, but that&#8217;s not really want I want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I might try out <a href=\"https:\/\/kill-the-newsletter.com\/\">kill-the-newsletter.com<\/a> as a way to get around this &#8211; send newsletters to this address, and subscribe to that feed in Reeder. That might work and may be worth a try. But I don&#8217;t know how reliable and sustainable Kill the Newsletter is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s a nice app. It&#8217;s great value. I&#8217;m going to keep trying it and see if I can figure out a way to use it for what I need. But in the meantime it&#8217;s Feedbin and &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/reederapp.com\/classic\/\">Reeder Classic<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s essentially a time travel story, but one which tries to escape all the &#8220;but what about&#8221;s of regular time travel in its execution. It held together well though, helped by not having to many main characters to keep track of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>About half way through I thought it had ended and was wondering what else would happen. It turns out the answer is: a whole load of weird and unnecessary traumatic and violent stuff!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was good. Good story. Well written. A fun romp. I enjoyed reading. But that second half could have been a lot shorter and I felt the ending was missing something. The characters put SO much effort into fixing what they had messed up and then, in the end, the solution &#8211; if that&#8217;s what it was &#8211; was pretty simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will read more from Crouch.

It&#8217;s essentially a time travel story, but one which tries to escape all the &#8220;but what about&#8221;s of regular time travel in its execution. It held together well though, helped by not having to many main characters to keep track of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>About half way through I thought it had ended and was wondering what else would happen. It turns out the answer is: a whole load of weird and unnecessary traumatic and violent stuff!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was good. Good story. Well written. A fun romp. I enjoyed reading. But that second half could have been a lot shorter and I felt the ending was missing something. The characters put SO much effort into fixing what they had messed up and then, in the end, the solution &#8211; if that&#8217;s what it was &#8211; was pretty simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will read more from Crouch. He&#8217;s a good storyteller!<\/p>\n",

If I am then I&#8217;m very high-functioning, with enough coping strategies that you probably wouldn&#8217;t notice. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I have a pile of books about topics like this ready to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/adhdjesse.com\/\">Jesse J Anderson<\/a> is what I would call an &#8220;ADHD influencer&#8221;. He&#8217;s big on social media, and ended up writing this short book, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extrafocusbook.com\/\">Extra Focus: The Quick Start Guide to Adult ADHD<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It covers both what ADHD is like, and it has a load of short practical strategies for coping with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a short, concise book, which is great for people who struggle to focus on long rambling stories. It is to-the-point and Iove it as a result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the kind of book that you will refer to over and over again to revisit the strategies as and when you need them. I almost wish I had a paper copy. I really recommend it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I read this book I felt myself thinking a lot: What, you mean, most people DON&#8217;T experience that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People don&#8217;t find All The New Things interesting and love to dive in deep to a random new field of study or creativity?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People don&#8217;t get focussed so deep on things that &#8220;you\u2019re afraid that if you try to redirect your focus anywhere else, you\u2019ll disrupt your momentum and never get it back&#8221;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People don&#8217;t find themselves wandering off on the more interesting tangential piece of work?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don&#8217;t &#8220;primarily find motivation through interest, novelty, challenge, and urgency&#8221;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don&#8217;t like to have a messy desk with work actually on it and a load of open tabs because &#8220;hoarding is actually a form of self-preservation. Why? Because we often forget things we can\u2019t see.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I left me feeling more and more certain of my own probable &#8220;neuro-spicyness&#8221;. But also gave me a pile of new coping strategies! Hooray!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The book also came with a bunch of introductory emails with extra information that was helpful. A really neat addition! Thanks, Jesse!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>So&#8230; I&#8217;m not diagnosed with any form of ADHD or ASD, but I do often feel like I&#8217;m not neurotypical. If I am then I&#8217;m very high-functioning, with enough coping strategies that you probably wouldn&#8217;t notice. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I have a pile of books about topics like this ready to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/adhdjesse.com\/\">Jesse J Anderson<\/a> is what I would call an &#8220;ADHD influencer&#8221;. He&#8217;s big on social media, and ended up writing this short book, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.extrafocusbook.com\/\">Extra Focus: The Quick Start Guide to Adult ADHD<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It covers both what ADHD is like, and it has a load of short practical strategies for coping with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a short, concise book, which is great for people who struggle to focus on long rambling stories. It is to-the-point and Iove it as a result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the kind of book that you will refer to over and over again to revisit the strategies as and when you need them. I almost wish I had a paper copy. I really recommend it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I read this book I felt myself thinking a lot: What, you mean, most people DON&#8217;T experience that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People don&#8217;t find All The New Things interesting and love to dive in deep to a random new field of study or creativity?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People don&#8217;t get focussed so deep on things that &#8220;you\u2019re afraid that if you try to redirect your focus anywhere else, you\u2019ll disrupt your momentum and never get it back&#8221;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People don&#8217;t find themselves wandering off on the more interesting tangential piece of work?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don&#8217;t &#8220;primarily find motivation through interest, novelty, challenge, and urgency&#8221;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don&#8217;t like to have a messy desk with work actually on it and a load of open tabs because &#8220;hoarding is actually a form of self-preservation. Why? Because we often forget things we can\u2019t see.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I left me feeling more and more certain of my own probable &#8220;neuro-spicyness&#8221;. But also gave me a pile of new coping strategies! Hooray!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The book also came with a bunch of introductory emails with extra information that was helpful. A really neat addition! Thanks, Jesse!<\/p>\n",
