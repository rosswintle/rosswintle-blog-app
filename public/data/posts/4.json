A real sense of two becoming one and a change of status in their relationship.<\/p>\n<p>It was interesting going to a Christian wedding with a mixed bunch of people (some who would prefess a faith in Jesus and others who wouldn&#8217;t).  It made me wonder what other people make of Christian weddings.<\/p>\n<p>I always find Christian weddings special.  It&#8217;s not just a spoken commitment with a bit of ritual wrapped around it.  The parts of the typical English wedding ceremony are all very meaningful to Christians; from the opening words of the vicar, the songs, the ceremony itself, the prayers, through to the final blessing at the end.<\/p>\n<p>The marriage is centered on the vows and the commitments made in them, and it usually marks a very deep change in the couple&#8217;s status.  Often they have abstained from sex before marriage, and probably haven&#8217;t lived together.  And, of course, there is the real sense of celebration of the bride and groom as individuals, and as a newly formed couple.<\/p>\n<p>Whereas, admittedly not all of them, but most church weddings of non-Christian people, I find a bit false.  It&#8217;s odd to hear people speaking and singing things that they don&#8217;t necessarily believe, and  I find it odd when the party afterwards is made more important than the marriage itself.   This is not a sensation that has been exclusive to my Christian life.  I went to a church wedding of some friends even before I started finding out about God and it just felt awkward.<\/p>\n<p>Yet I find myself wondering what other people make of it all.  Do people who don&#8217;t follow the Christian faith find Weddings of believers different to weddings of non-believers?  Does it seem &#8220;special&#8221; to them?  Does it seem more meaningful?  I wonder what our worship looks like from the outside?<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I don&#8217;t wish to devalue the marriage of people who don&#8217;t follow Christ.  The commitment of marriage is incredibly special and I support it, uphold it, and respect it however it is done.  I would much rather people get married, if it&#8217;s the right thing for them to do, than not get married!<\/p>\n<p>But as a little windows into the lives and rituals of believers, I wonder how these ceremonies look and feel to others, what effect it has on them, and what we might be able to learn from their experiences.<\/div>\n",

A real sense of two becoming one and a change of status in their relationship.<\/p>\n<p>It was interesting going to a Christian wedding with a mixed bunch of people (some who would prefess a faith in Jesus and others who wouldn&#8217;t).  It made me wonder what other people make of Christian weddings.<\/p>\n<p>I always find Christian weddings special.  It&#8217;s not just a spoken commitment with a bit of ritual wrapped around it.  The parts of the typical English wedding ceremony are all very meaningful to Christians; from the opening words of the vicar, the songs, the ceremony itself, the prayers, through to the final blessing at the end.<\/p>\n<p>The marriage is centered on the vows and the commitments made in them, and it usually marks a very deep change in the couple&#8217;s status.  Often they have abstained from sex before marriage, and probably haven&#8217;t lived together.  And, of course, there is the real sense of celebration of the bride and groom as individuals, and as a newly formed couple.<\/p>\n<p>Whereas, admittedly not all of them, but most church weddings of non-Christian people, I find a bit false.  It&#8217;s odd to hear people speaking and singing things that they don&#8217;t necessarily believe, and  I find it odd when the party afterwards is made more important than the marriage itself.   This is not a sensation that has been exclusive to my Christian life.  I went to a church wedding of some friends even before I started finding out about God and it just felt awkward.<\/p>\n<p>Yet I find myself wondering what other people make of it all.  Do people who don&#8217;t follow the Christian faith find Weddings of believers different to weddings of non-believers?  Does it seem &#8220;special&#8221; to them?  Does it seem more meaningful?  I wonder what our worship looks like from the outside?<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I don&#8217;t wish to devalue the marriage of people who don&#8217;t follow Christ.  The commitment of marriage is incredibly special and I support it, uphold it, and respect it however it is done.  I would much rather people get married, if it&#8217;s the right thing for them to do, than not get married!<\/p>\n<p>But as a little windows into the lives and rituals of believers, I wonder how these ceremonies look and feel to others, what effect it has on them, and what we might be able to learn from their experiences.<\/div>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>A friend has given me a very interesting little book to read to read called &#8220;Accompanying young people on their spiritual quest&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a cracking book and very well written (that&#8217;s very high praise from me!) and, oddly, my first interesting thought about it is not about the book&#8217;s key subject.<\/p>\n<p>While discussing how the church perceives young people it introduces the topic of Movements and Organisation.<\/p>\n<p>In this case the &#8220;movement&#8221; is the Christian religion. The notion being that the &#8220;church&#8221; (by which I mean the global body of people who profess faith in Jesus Christ) is not static. To quote the book &#8220;its thinking and practices remain open to question and open to change&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Yet any large &#8220;movement&#8221; requires some form of &#8220;organization&#8221;. Which poses a problem, because organizations have boundaries and procedures which limit movement.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a continual challenge, I find, at work, in my local church, in my friendships and relationships, even at home, to be disciplined and organised, and yet, remain open to change.  On the one hand I&#8217;m a very organised individual who likes order and structure and gets annoyed when things are out of place.  On the other hand, I retain the right to change my views, move on, do things differently.  There is a creative part of me that likes to operate outside of formal structures.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important not to become legalistic about anything, especially in the Christian faith where the central concept is love: a thing that has no real boundary or definition and which, practically, can be expressed in many, many ways.  AND it is a thing which means different things to different people.  It can&#8217;t be given an organisation because it&#8217;s too woolly to pin down to a process.<\/p>\n<p>Organising can be difficult for the similar reasons.  What organisation works for one person may not work for another.  Some churches have very set forms, called liturgy.  Written out words that are spoken or sung during a service.  Some church services are entirely based around such liturgies.  Others have no written form whatsoever.  Who&#8217;s to say what&#8217;s right.  Horses for courses isn&#8217;t it?<\/p>\n<p>Which all leads to much confusion.  How do we love?  How do we organise?  How do we not become legalistic?<\/p>\n<p>We see in the bible how Jesus, our role model for all that we do, interacts with children.  &#8220;Become like them&#8221; he says, as he gives the legalistic priests a good telling off about their stubborn ways.  Yet when faced with a large group with some work to do Jesus organises them, splits them up, gives them instructions, and sends them out.<\/p>\n<p>One of the &#8220;Accompanying&#8221; book&#8217;s ideas is that children represent the movement side of church, wanting to grow, but not necessarily according to the rules of the church organisation.   I wonder what we can learn from them about moving on, and about growing in our faith and in who we are as people.  I wonder if we need to rebel occasionally against strict organisation.  I wonder if we need more chaos in our lives or the other way around?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve love to draw a conclusion, state something profound that I&#8217;ve learned from thinking about this and say what I&#8217;m going to do about it, but I think this is probably a journey.  One of those things that we&#8217;ll never get right, and a balance that we&#8217;ll always be tweaking with.<\/p>\n<p>One thing I&#8217;ve learned since becoming a Christian is that answers aren&#8217;t always necessary.  Sometimes it&#8217;s just as important to just ask the questions.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>A friend has given me a very interesting little book to read to read called &#8220;Accompanying young people on their spiritual quest&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a cracking book and very well written (that&#8217;s very high praise from me!) and, oddly, my first interesting thought about it is not about the book&#8217;s key subject.<\/p>\n<p>While discussing how the church perceives young people it introduces the topic of Movements and Organisation.<\/p>\n<p>In this case the &#8220;movement&#8221; is the Christian religion. The notion being that the &#8220;church&#8221; (by which I mean the global body of people who profess faith in Jesus Christ) is not static. To quote the book &#8220;its thinking and practices remain open to question and open to change&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Yet any large &#8220;movement&#8221; requires some form of &#8220;organization&#8221;. Which poses a problem, because organizations have boundaries and procedures which limit movement.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a continual challenge, I find, at work, in my local church, in my friendships and relationships, even at home, to be disciplined and organised, and yet, remain open to change.  On the one hand I&#8217;m a very organised individual who likes order and structure and gets annoyed when things are out of place.  On the other hand, I retain the right to change my views, move on, do things differently.  There is a creative part of me that likes to operate outside of formal structures.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important not to become legalistic about anything, especially in the Christian faith where the central concept is love: a thing that has no real boundary or definition and which, practically, can be expressed in many, many ways.  AND it is a thing which means different things to different people.  It can&#8217;t be given an organisation because it&#8217;s too woolly to pin down to a process.<\/p>\n<p>Organising can be difficult for the similar reasons.  What organisation works for one person may not work for another.  Some churches have very set forms, called liturgy.  Written out words that are spoken or sung during a service.  Some church services are entirely based around such liturgies.  Others have no written form whatsoever.  Who&#8217;s to say what&#8217;s right.  Horses for courses isn&#8217;t it?<\/p>\n<p>Which all leads to much confusion.  How do we love?  How do we organise?  How do we not become legalistic?<\/p>\n<p>We see in the bible how Jesus, our role model for all that we do, interacts with children.  &#8220;Become like them&#8221; he says, as he gives the legalistic priests a good telling off about their stubborn ways.  Yet when faced with a large group with some work to do Jesus organises them, splits them up, gives them instructions, and sends them out.<\/p>\n<p>One of the &#8220;Accompanying&#8221; book&#8217;s ideas is that children represent the movement side of church, wanting to grow, but not necessarily according to the rules of the church organisation.   I wonder what we can learn from them about moving on, and about growing in our faith and in who we are as people.  I wonder if we need to rebel occasionally against strict organisation.  I wonder if we need more chaos in our lives or the other way around?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve love to draw a conclusion, state something profound that I&#8217;ve learned from thinking about this and say what I&#8217;m going to do about it, but I think this is probably a journey.  One of those things that we&#8217;ll never get right, and a balance that we&#8217;ll always be tweaking with.<\/p>\n<p>One thing I&#8217;ve learned since becoming a Christian is that answers aren&#8217;t always necessary.  Sometimes it&#8217;s just as important to just ask the questions.<\/p>\n",

SHAPE is an acronym, standing for &#8220;Spritual Gifts, Heart, Abilities, Personality, Experiences&#8221;.  It&#8217;s intended to help you look at those five things, think a bit about what things you have that fit into those categories, and work out what things you might be able to do well in serving God.<\/p>\n<p>The Spiritual Gifts bit was first and, as you might expect, raised the most questions.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s clear from the Bible, more so in the New Testament, but also in the Old, that God gives particular &#8220;gifts&#8221; or abilities to people and he does this &#8220;by his spirit&#8221;&#8230;that is, those abilities are specifically given by God in a &#8220;supernatural&#8221; kind of way.<\/p>\n<p>From my point of view, gifts of the spirit fall into two categories:<\/p>\n<p>1) things that are always obviously of God when they happen, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>healing<\/li>\n<li>prophecy (speaking God&#8217;s thoughts to groups of people)<\/li>\n<li>words of knowledge (when God tells you something &#8211; like prophecy but different)<\/li>\n<li>miracles<\/li>\n<li>tongues\/languages and interpretation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I will call these the &#8220;difficult gifts&#8221; &#8211; because it&#8217;s more difficult to believe that we have them, and requires more faith to use them&#8230;I think.<\/p>\n<p>2) things that might be of God but you can never be sure, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>music<\/li>\n<li>administration<\/li>\n<li>hospitality<\/li>\n<li>wisdom<\/li>\n<li>teaching<\/li>\n<li>leadership<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I specifically draw a line here between the &#8220;difficult&#8221; gifts and the &#8220;non-difficult&#8221; gifts because this is the main thing I want to speak about.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div> <\/div>\n<p>In my experience the &#8220;difficult&#8221; spiritual gifts are less commonly found. I know lots of people who seem to be blessed by God with real ability in music, hospitality, and teaching. I know few prophets, healers and miracle workers.<\/p>\n<p>Yet it doesn&#8217;t make sense to me that God would distribute the gifts unevenly.  In fact, because he&#8217;s such an awesome God who should choose to reveal himself and his thoughts to his people, I would expect to see MORE healers and prophets than the easier things.<\/p>\n<div> <\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div>Which makes me wonder if maybe there are lots of people that are healers, prophets, miracle workers, etc that don&#8217;t know if they have those gifts?  And if this is the case, how do we nurture these gifts in people?  How should the church encourage people to &#8220;seek the greater gifts&#8221; as the bible says?  How do we know if we have the difficult gifts if we don&#8217;t have opportunities to try and use them?  How shall we go about discovering who our prophets and healers are?<\/p>\n<p>This is really the main thing I&#8217;ve learned from the SHAPE course.  That we should be praying and asking God for the difficult gifts &#8211; he tells us to do this.  But how practically should we be trying out these things if we think that God has given them to us?<\/div>\n",

        "content": "<div>We&#8217;ve been doing a thing at our church called a SHAPE course.  SHAPE is an acronym, standing for &#8220;Spritual Gifts, Heart, Abilities, Personality, Experiences&#8221;.  It&#8217;s intended to help you look at those five things, think a bit about what things you have that fit into those categories, and work out what things you might be able to do well in serving God.<\/p>\n<p>The Spiritual Gifts bit was first and, as you might expect, raised the most questions.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s clear from the Bible, more so in the New Testament, but also in the Old, that God gives particular &#8220;gifts&#8221; or abilities to people and he does this &#8220;by his spirit&#8221;&#8230;that is, those abilities are specifically given by God in a &#8220;supernatural&#8221; kind of way.<\/p>\n<p>From my point of view, gifts of the spirit fall into two categories:<\/p>\n<p>1) things that are always obviously of God when they happen, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>healing<\/li>\n<li>prophecy (speaking God&#8217;s thoughts to groups of people)<\/li>\n<li>words of knowledge (when God tells you something &#8211; like prophecy but different)<\/li>\n<li>miracles<\/li>\n<li>tongues\/languages and interpretation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I will call these the &#8220;difficult gifts&#8221; &#8211; because it&#8217;s more difficult to believe that we have them, and requires more faith to use them&#8230;I think.<\/p>\n<p>2) things that might be of God but you can never be sure, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>music<\/li>\n<li>administration<\/li>\n<li>hospitality<\/li>\n<li>wisdom<\/li>\n<li>teaching<\/li>\n<li>leadership<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I specifically draw a line here between the &#8220;difficult&#8221; gifts and the &#8220;non-difficult&#8221; gifts because this is the main thing I want to speak about.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div> <\/div>\n<p>In my experience the &#8220;difficult&#8221; spiritual gifts are less commonly found. I know lots of people who seem to be blessed by God with real ability in music, hospitality, and teaching. I know few prophets, healers and miracle workers.<\/p>\n<p>Yet it doesn&#8217;t make sense to me that God would distribute the gifts unevenly.  In fact, because he&#8217;s such an awesome God who should choose to reveal himself and his thoughts to his people, I would expect to see MORE healers and prophets than the easier things.<\/p>\n<div> <\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div>Which makes me wonder if maybe there are lots of people that are healers, prophets, miracle workers, etc that don&#8217;t know if they have those gifts?  And if this is the case, how do we nurture these gifts in people?  How should the church encourage people to &#8220;seek the greater gifts&#8221; as the bible says?  How do we know if we have the difficult gifts if we don&#8217;t have opportunities to try and use them?  How shall we go about discovering who our prophets and healers are?<\/p>\n<p>This is really the main thing I&#8217;ve learned from the SHAPE course.  That we should be praying and asking God for the difficult gifts &#8211; he tells us to do this.  But how practically should we be trying out these things if we think that God has given them to us?<\/div>\n",

It makes you think of big, stuffy old mansion houses and random bits of old castle.  But having been to a few places you start to realise how good the work that they do is, AND, having a link with them, you start to notice how much they look after.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s where we&#8217;ve been in a few months that&#8217;s owned by the National Trust:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lacock <\/li>\n<li>Buscot Castle Drogo<\/li>\n<li>Lizard Coast<\/li>\n<li> Lizard Point<\/li>\n<li> Kynance Cove<\/li>\n<li>Glendurgan Gardens<\/li>\n<li>and we&#8217;ll be going to St Michael&#8217;s Mount later in the week<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>   Here are some things that have impressed me about the National Trust:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">They own LOADS of stuff<\/span>: much of the Lizard&#8217;s coastline, many small coves and sites of beauty or scientific interest, lots of interesting buildings and gardens.  Some of it is well known and listed in their handbook, but lots of it is just land that they care for and preserve that&#8217;s not listed anywhere and is open to anyone for free!<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Their facilities are always really good<\/span>: clean toilets, good information, friendly staff, well organised, well sign posted, lots of free leaflets, good food in their cafe&#8217;s.  The quality of what they do is always excellent.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">They care for people<\/span>: related to good facilities, but also in Sally&#8217;s working for them, you can see that people are important to them and their quality and integrity stems from that.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">They care for the environment:<\/span> they take the view that there&#8217;s no point preserving all this stuff if the world&#8217;s being messed up around it.  To that end they put their money where their mouth is and invest in things like solar panels, using their own resources, using renewable energy and materials, recycling, fair trade and so on.  They&#8217;re also keen on promoting environmental issues to their members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m really very impressed, to the extent that I&#8217;d pay for membership now- not just to get free entry to all their properties, but to support the good work that they do.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know much about the National Trust, look them up, find out what they do, look out for their land and properties and I hope you&#8217;ll agree that they do a great job and are worth supporting.<\/div>\n",

It makes you think of big, stuffy old mansion houses and random bits of old castle.  But having been to a few places you start to realise how good the work that they do is, AND, having a link with them, you start to notice how much they look after.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s where we&#8217;ve been in a few months that&#8217;s owned by the National Trust:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lacock <\/li>\n<li>Buscot Castle Drogo<\/li>\n<li>Lizard Coast<\/li>\n<li> Lizard Point<\/li>\n<li> Kynance Cove<\/li>\n<li>Glendurgan Gardens<\/li>\n<li>and we&#8217;ll be going to St Michael&#8217;s Mount later in the week<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>   Here are some things that have impressed me about the National Trust:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">They own LOADS of stuff<\/span>: much of the Lizard&#8217;s coastline, many small coves and sites of beauty or scientific interest, lots of interesting buildings and gardens.  Some of it is well known and listed in their handbook, but lots of it is just land that they care for and preserve that&#8217;s not listed anywhere and is open to anyone for free!<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Their facilities are always really good<\/span>: clean toilets, good information, friendly staff, well organised, well sign posted, lots of free leaflets, good food in their cafe&#8217;s.  The quality of what they do is always excellent.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">They care for people<\/span>: related to good facilities, but also in Sally&#8217;s working for them, you can see that people are important to them and their quality and integrity stems from that.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">They care for the environment:<\/span> they take the view that there&#8217;s no point preserving all this stuff if the world&#8217;s being messed up around it.  To that end they put their money where their mouth is and invest in things like solar panels, using their own resources, using renewable energy and materials, recycling, fair trade and so on.  They&#8217;re also keen on promoting environmental issues to their members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m really very impressed, to the extent that I&#8217;d pay for membership now- not just to get free entry to all their properties, but to support the good work that they do.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know much about the National Trust, look them up, find out what they do, look out for their land and properties and I hope you&#8217;ll agree that they do a great job and are worth supporting.<\/div>\n",

You mostly hear good things about it but occasionally you meet someone that thought it was rubbish.  I can see why people might not like it but I thought it was fascinating, beautiful, educational and inspiring.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div>A visit to the Eden Project raises lots of questions about our planet.  I&#8217;d probably fall into the category of very-nearly-green-hippy.  Partly driven by my faith &#8211; my belief in a creator and in our duty to look after His creation &#8211; and partly driven by science and common sense, I believe we should reduce, recycle and reuse as much as possible.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been having a lot of conversations at work about being green.  Mostly with people who slightly mock the concept of being overtly, or overly, environmentally friendly.  Mostly with people who think I&#8217;m silly for cycling in the rain (but that&#8217;s another issue altogether).  I feel in a minority there.<\/p>\n<p>But most of the discussions aren&#8217;t actually about the concepts of waste, wastefulness, packaging, reuse of materials and consumerism.  Most of the discussions are about &#8220;Carbon Footprints&#8221;, which I don&#8217;t really understand myself and which, to me, seem to be just marketing to make us feel good about buying a product or service.  But I don&#8217;t actually get what it means to put a tonne of carbon dioxide into the air!  In contrast, I DO get what it means to put a plastic bag in a landfill.  It means that I&#8217;ve wasted some oil &#8211; a precious natural resource that will, one day pretty soon now, run out &#8211; in order to produce something that I&#8217;ve then discarded on a big heap and which will sit there being a plastic bag in the way, for a VERY long time.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div>I&#8217;m all for being carbon neutral.  But I&#8217;m more for thinking about how much stuff we use and throw away.  And by &#8220;use&#8221; I include &#8220;burn to make energy&#8221;, which means that my concept of &#8220;reducing&#8221; includes lowering emissions, but, so I think, seems to be a more holistic approach.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div>What&#8217;s this got to do with my holiday and the Eden Project?<\/p>\n<p>Well, there aren&#8217;t many things that I don&#8217;t like about the lovely cottage that we&#8217;re staying in, but one thing that bugs me is that we can&#8217;t recycle.  Everything is thrown in the bin (well, we&#8217;re going to take some stuff home with us too).  This means that in 5 days we&#8217;ve produced about 2 times as much waste as we&#8217;d normally produce at home.  It&#8217;s shocking how, without compost and recycling, it mounts up so quickly.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div>In contrast, the Eden Project was keen to talk about how it was trying to be &#8220;waste neutral&#8221;.  Reducing the amount of waste that they produce, reusing items where it is possible, recycling what&#8217;s left, and buying recycled goods (and thus creating demand for recycled products).<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s expensive, and it sounds like hard work and lots of thinking.  They declare it to be &#8220;a philosophy for life&#8221;.  It&#8217;s a challenge to all of us.  It&#8217;s a challenge to me!  How much do I think about the waste that will be produced by an item that I buy?  How often do I get lazy and throw something away because to take it home and recycle it would be too much hard work?  Am I willing to pay a bit extra for something that&#8217;s locally sourced, recycled, or in &#8220;green&#8221; packaging?<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>One other thing that I wondered was, are we doing enough?  That is are we DOING enough?<\/p>\n<p>The Eden Project sells lots of books.  Mostly books about being green and ethical.  It&#8217;s good to read (or write!) an article or book about this kind of thing.  It&#8217;s good to be inspired by the wonders of nature on display at the Eden Project and feel protective of our amazing planet.  It&#8217;s good to read about how others are adopting this philosophy for life.  It&#8217;s good to think and ask the questions.<\/p>\n<p>But when we get to the supermarket, or need to travel somewhere nearby, or book a holiday, or are throwing something in the bin&#8230;when we have a choice to make a difference&#8230;what are we actually going to choose to do?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<div>Wednesday of our holiday in Cornwall, and a visit to the Eden Project!  You mostly hear good things about it but occasionally you meet someone that thought it was rubbish.  I can see why people might not like it but I thought it was fascinating, beautiful, educational and inspiring.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div>A visit to the Eden Project raises lots of questions about our planet.  I&#8217;d probably fall into the category of very-nearly-green-hippy.  Partly driven by my faith &#8211; my belief in a creator and in our duty to look after His creation &#8211; and partly driven by science and common sense, I believe we should reduce, recycle and reuse as much as possible.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been having a lot of conversations at work about being green.  Mostly with people who slightly mock the concept of being overtly, or overly, environmentally friendly.  Mostly with people who think I&#8217;m silly for cycling in the rain (but that&#8217;s another issue altogether).  I feel in a minority there.<\/p>\n<p>But most of the discussions aren&#8217;t actually about the concepts of waste, wastefulness, packaging, reuse of materials and consumerism.  Most of the discussions are about &#8220;Carbon Footprints&#8221;, which I don&#8217;t really understand myself and which, to me, seem to be just marketing to make us feel good about buying a product or service.  But I don&#8217;t actually get what it means to put a tonne of carbon dioxide into the air!  In contrast, I DO get what it means to put a plastic bag in a landfill.  It means that I&#8217;ve wasted some oil &#8211; a precious natural resource that will, one day pretty soon now, run out &#8211; in order to produce something that I&#8217;ve then discarded on a big heap and which will sit there being a plastic bag in the way, for a VERY long time.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div>I&#8217;m all for being carbon neutral.  But I&#8217;m more for thinking about how much stuff we use and throw away.  And by &#8220;use&#8221; I include &#8220;burn to make energy&#8221;, which means that my concept of &#8220;reducing&#8221; includes lowering emissions, but, so I think, seems to be a more holistic approach.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div>What&#8217;s this got to do with my holiday and the Eden Project?<\/p>\n<p>Well, there aren&#8217;t many things that I don&#8217;t like about the lovely cottage that we&#8217;re staying in, but one thing that bugs me is that we can&#8217;t recycle.  Everything is thrown in the bin (well, we&#8217;re going to take some stuff home with us too).  This means that in 5 days we&#8217;ve produced about 2 times as much waste as we&#8217;d normally produce at home.  It&#8217;s shocking how, without compost and recycling, it mounts up so quickly.<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div>In contrast, the Eden Project was keen to talk about how it was trying to be &#8220;waste neutral&#8221;.  Reducing the amount of waste that they produce, reusing items where it is possible, recycling what&#8217;s left, and buying recycled goods (and thus creating demand for recycled products).<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s expensive, and it sounds like hard work and lots of thinking.  They declare it to be &#8220;a philosophy for life&#8221;.  It&#8217;s a challenge to all of us.  It&#8217;s a challenge to me!  How much do I think about the waste that will be produced by an item that I buy?  How often do I get lazy and throw something away because to take it home and recycle it would be too much hard work?  Am I willing to pay a bit extra for something that&#8217;s locally sourced, recycled, or in &#8220;green&#8221; packaging?<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>One other thing that I wondered was, are we doing enough?  That is are we DOING enough?<\/p>\n<p>The Eden Project sells lots of books.  Mostly books about being green and ethical.  It&#8217;s good to read (or write!) an article or book about this kind of thing.  It&#8217;s good to be inspired by the wonders of nature on display at the Eden Project and feel protective of our amazing planet.  It&#8217;s good to read about how others are adopting this philosophy for life.  It&#8217;s good to think and ask the questions.<\/p>\n<p>But when we get to the supermarket, or need to travel somewhere nearby, or book a holiday, or are throwing something in the bin&#8230;when we have a choice to make a difference&#8230;what are we actually going to choose to do?<\/p>\n",

It was a bit nerve racking at first but it&#8217;s very secure!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been such a busy holiday that we only actually did 2 rides.  On Tuesday to Helford (see the post from that day and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikely.com\/maps\/bike-path\/Ruan-Minor-Cadgwith-to-Helford-Passenger-Ferry\">route on Bikely<\/a>), and today, in the afternoon, I did a faster ride by myself on the same route we did to Helford, but only as far as Newtown.<\/p>\n<p>These have been good rides.  Slightly hilly but quiet roads.  A bit disappointing that some roads were very narrow so you didn&#8217;t want to get too much speed up in case anything came the other way.<\/div>\n<div> <\/div>\n<p>Fitness-wise, I&#8217;ve got a new strain in the form of an aching wrist, but I had this on the way to Cornwall in the car and so it&#8217;s probably related to driving!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d definitely take the bikes away on holiday again!<\/p>\n",

It was a bit nerve racking at first but it&#8217;s very secure!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been such a busy holiday that we only actually did 2 rides.  On Tuesday to Helford (see the post from that day and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikely.com\/maps\/bike-path\/Ruan-Minor-Cadgwith-to-Helford-Passenger-Ferry\">route on Bikely<\/a>), and today, in the afternoon, I did a faster ride by myself on the same route we did to Helford, but only as far as Newtown.<\/p>\n<p>These have been good rides.  Slightly hilly but quiet roads.  A bit disappointing that some roads were very narrow so you didn&#8217;t want to get too much speed up in case anything came the other way.<\/div>\n<div> <\/div>\n<p>Fitness-wise, I&#8217;ve got a new strain in the form of an aching wrist, but I had this on the way to Cornwall in the car and so it&#8217;s probably related to driving!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d definitely take the bikes away on holiday again!<\/p>\n",
