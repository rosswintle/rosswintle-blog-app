                "rendered": "\n<p>Today I&#8217;m tidying up an old draft post on the topic of minimalism for posting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t really think of myself as minimalist. I&#8217;m not a clean desk person. Our home is big on &#8220;floordrobes&#8221;. We are slightly-chaotic, creative, mad-professor types. (Well, I should only speak for myself but&#8230;)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet I have a feeling if I embraced it, minimalism would really be my thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I loved <a href=\"https:\/\/thingsworthlearning.show\/episodes\/minimalism-with-diana-scharf\">this Podcast<\/a> from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stauffermatt\">Matt Stauffer<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DianaWebdev\">Diana Scharf<\/a>, it really piqued my interest and got me wondering what more I can do to embrace minimalism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m particularly challeneged by the idea that everything you own has an ongoing cost: looking after it; having a space for it; fixing it if it breaks; finding it if its lost; moving it if you move home. Posessions have a small ongoing cognitive load.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my first thoughts was about books. I don&#8217;t really need books. I have an eReader now and much as I dislike not actually OWNING my books, it saves on all the space and is SO much easier to travel with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m really keen to start ditching physical books!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I had other thoughts about focus and distraction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My Phone&#8217;s Homescreen<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I&#8217;ve really noticed is how distracting my phone is. So in an attempt to clean this up I wondered if I could somehow just delete all my app icons (or put them in the hidden away app library thing) and use Siri or Spotlight (search) to go straight to the thing I want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t ready to completely embrace this, and wanted a back-out plan &#8211; I&#8217;m not ready to delete my crafted layouts and groups of apps that are in muscle memory. So I thought I&#8217;d keep my app screens for now, and just add one as the &#8220;home&#8221; screen with no apps on. I added a couple of nice widgets, but the vast majority of the apps are gone.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-473x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11345\" width=\"305\" height=\"660\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-473x1024.jpg 473w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-139x300.jpg 139w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-768x1663.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-709x1536.jpg 709w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-946x2048.jpg 946w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324.jpg 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>When I&#8217;m disciplined about sticking to this one screen it&#8217;s AWESOME. I should probably delete all my app pages and just do this all the time. But I can&#8217;t bring myself to do it yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a really neat trick though. Swipe down, search for what you want. Go straight there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So much better than scrolling and getting distracted before I&#8217;ve even started the task I set out to achieve!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recommended.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sticking with keys &#8211; a journey<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve long been working on the same idea for my (MacBook) laptop. I switch apps a LOT. I don&#8217;t want to use the dock. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/apple.stackexchange.com\/questions\/59556\/is-there-a-way-to-completely-disable-dock\">the dock can just disappear entirely<\/a> for all I care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alt-Tab-ing my way through apps is a simple way to stay on the keyboard for switching apps. And pairing that with using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alfredapp.com\/\">Alfred<\/a> (or Apple&#8217;s Spotlight) is great. But I&#8217;ve often wondered if I could do better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hyper Keys<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I&#8217;d heard about &#8211; mostly from <a href=\"https:\/\/syntax.fm\/show\/315\/hasty-treat-hyper-productivity-with-keyboard-shortcuts-window-management\">the Syntax.fm podcast<\/a> &#8211; is making your caps-lock key a hyper key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I was sceptical about re-mapping my caps-lock key for another purpose. But I really don&#8217;t miss it one bit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is a &#8220;hyper key&#8221;? Well the idea is that you map caps-lock to ALL the other meta-keys being pressed at once. On a Mac this is Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Option. You need special tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/karabiner-elements.pqrs.org\/\">Karabiner Elements<\/a> to do this, but once you have you can then use another tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/folivora.ai\/\">Better Touch Tool<\/a> to map Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Option-&lt;some-key> to do things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly have a whole keyboard of new shortcuts open up to you with Hyper-Something!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I set about mapping Hyper-&lt;key> to applications so that I could go straight to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hyper-F opens Firefox<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hyper-P opens PHPStorm<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hyper-W opens Wavebox<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hyper-I opens iTerm<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>and so on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Direct access to apps. Sweet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I loved this approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even Hyper Keys are a bit limited. I know I&#8217;ll sound selfish, but I wanted MORE!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stream Deck<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So I tried out Elgato&#8217;s Stream Deck.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First as an app on my phone. This has a small subscription cost, but is a good way to try out the principle of a custom keypad without investing in the reasonably expensive hardware.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It worked REALLY nicely. So, as a treat to myself when I got my new job last year, I bought a proper Stream Deak (the 15-key version) in a sale. And it works really great. Go straight to any app without typing, remembering keyboard shortcuts, or multiple alt-tabs. It keeps me focussed on what I want to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a certain amount of remembering to use the Stream Deck at first. Alt-tab is STRONG in my muscle-memory! But it&#8217;s physical presence actually helps, drawing me back to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with different pages of buttons I have a setup for when I&#8217;m on a call, for when I&#8217;m in my code editor, and shortcuts for opening websites and GitHub repos. It&#8217;s a great tool. Elgato&#8217;s software is pretty terrible (come on folks, do better!!), but this is also a recommended for going straight to apps without passing Go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with Stream Deck is&#8230; you need your Stream Deck. I don&#8217;t have it when I&#8217;m not in my office. And I&#8217;m not paying for the app if I also have the hardware. Annoying!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I still like the Hyper-Key approach too. Even though it is a bit clumsy to set up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">R-Cmd<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To finish off this journey then, one day I saw <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/rcmd-app-switcher\/id1596283165?mt=12\">R-Cmd<\/a>&#8230; a really simple MacApp that says &#8220;Hey, stuff caps-lock, it&#8217;s the Right-Cmd key that you don&#8217;t need&#8221; (really, you don&#8217;t) &#8220;so here&#8217;s a really simple app that lets you set Right-Cmd-&lt;key> as a key to open an app.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my Hyper-key setup, but SO much easier and with one app controlling it. Sure, it&#8217;s not as configurable, but I LOVE this way of doing things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Am I completely, over-the-top obsessed with avoiding my mouse and pressing too many keys? YES! Unashamedly. For something I literally do hundreds of times a day, the ergonomics and minimalism in this are great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, finally, finally&#8230; if you want to take this to the next level then you need to read &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/tighten.com\/blog\/how-to-train-your-keyboard\/\">How to Train Your Keyboard<\/a>&#8221; (which also has <a href=\"https:\/\/twentypercent.fm\/episodes\/andrew-morgan-train-your-keyboard\">an accompanying podcast episode<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now go, be productive and ditch YOUR mouse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Today I&#8217;m tidying up an old draft post on the topic of minimalism for posting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t really think of myself as minimalist. I&#8217;m not a clean desk person. Our home is big on &#8220;floordrobes&#8221;. We are slightly-chaotic, creative, mad-professor types. (Well, I should only speak for myself but&#8230;)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet I have a feeling if I embraced it, minimalism would really be my thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I loved <a href=\"https:\/\/thingsworthlearning.show\/episodes\/minimalism-with-diana-scharf\">this Podcast<\/a> from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stauffermatt\">Matt Stauffer<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DianaWebdev\">Diana Scharf<\/a>, it really piqued my interest and got me wondering what more I can do to embrace minimalism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m particularly challeneged by the idea that everything you own has an ongoing cost: looking after it; having a space for it; fixing it if it breaks; finding it if its lost; moving it if you move home. Posessions have a small ongoing cognitive load.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my first thoughts was about books. I don&#8217;t really need books. I have an eReader now and much as I dislike not actually OWNING my books, it saves on all the space and is SO much easier to travel with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m really keen to start ditching physical books!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I had other thoughts about focus and distraction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My Phone&#8217;s Homescreen<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I&#8217;ve really noticed is how distracting my phone is. So in an attempt to clean this up I wondered if I could somehow just delete all my app icons (or put them in the hidden away app library thing) and use Siri or Spotlight (search) to go straight to the thing I want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t ready to completely embrace this, and wanted a back-out plan &#8211; I&#8217;m not ready to delete my crafted layouts and groups of apps that are in muscle memory. So I thought I&#8217;d keep my app screens for now, and just add one as the &#8220;home&#8221; screen with no apps on. I added a couple of nice widgets, but the vast majority of the apps are gone.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-473x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11345\" width=\"305\" height=\"660\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-473x1024.jpg 473w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-139x300.jpg 139w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-768x1663.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-709x1536.jpg 709w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-946x2048.jpg 946w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324.jpg 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>When I&#8217;m disciplined about sticking to this one screen it&#8217;s AWESOME. I should probably delete all my app pages and just do this all the time. But I can&#8217;t bring myself to do it yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a really neat trick though. Swipe down, search for what you want. Go straight there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So much better than scrolling and getting distracted before I&#8217;ve even started the task I set out to achieve!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recommended.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sticking with keys &#8211; a journey<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve long been working on the same idea for my (MacBook) laptop. I switch apps a LOT. I don&#8217;t want to use the dock. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/apple.stackexchange.com\/questions\/59556\/is-there-a-way-to-completely-disable-dock\">the dock can just disappear entirely<\/a> for all I care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alt-Tab-ing my way through apps is a simple way to stay on the keyboard for switching apps. And pairing that with using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alfredapp.com\/\">Alfred<\/a> (or Apple&#8217;s Spotlight) is great. But I&#8217;ve often wondered if I could do better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hyper Keys<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I&#8217;d heard about &#8211; mostly from <a href=\"https:\/\/syntax.fm\/show\/315\/hasty-treat-hyper-productivity-with-keyboard-shortcuts-window-management\">the Syntax.fm podcast<\/a> &#8211; is making your caps-lock key a hyper key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I was sceptical about re-mapping my caps-lock key for another purpose. But I really don&#8217;t miss it one bit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is a &#8220;hyper key&#8221;? Well the idea is that you map caps-lock to ALL the other meta-keys being pressed at once. On a Mac this is Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Option. You need special tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/karabiner-elements.pqrs.org\/\">Karabiner Elements<\/a> to do this, but once you have you can then use another tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/folivora.ai\/\">Better Touch Tool<\/a> to map Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Option-&lt;some-key> to do things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly have a whole keyboard of new shortcuts open up to you with Hyper-Something!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I set about mapping Hyper-&lt;key> to applications so that I could go straight to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hyper-F opens Firefox<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hyper-P opens PHPStorm<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hyper-W opens Wavebox<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hyper-I opens iTerm<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>and so on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Direct access to apps. Sweet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I loved this approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even Hyper Keys are a bit limited. I know I&#8217;ll sound selfish, but I wanted MORE!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stream Deck<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So I tried out Elgato&#8217;s Stream Deck.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First as an app on my phone. This has a small subscription cost, but is a good way to try out the principle of a custom keypad without investing in the reasonably expensive hardware.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It worked REALLY nicely. So, as a treat to myself when I got my new job last year, I bought a proper Stream Deak (the 15-key version) in a sale. And it works really great. Go straight to any app without typing, remembering keyboard shortcuts, or multiple alt-tabs. It keeps me focussed on what I want to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a certain amount of remembering to use the Stream Deck at first. Alt-tab is STRONG in my muscle-memory! But it&#8217;s physical presence actually helps, drawing me back to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with different pages of buttons I have a setup for when I&#8217;m on a call, for when I&#8217;m in my code editor, and shortcuts for opening websites and GitHub repos. It&#8217;s a great tool. Elgato&#8217;s software is pretty terrible (come on folks, do better!!), but this is also a recommended for going straight to apps without passing Go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with Stream Deck is&#8230; you need your Stream Deck. I don&#8217;t have it when I&#8217;m not in my office. And I&#8217;m not paying for the app if I also have the hardware. Annoying!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I still like the Hyper-Key approach too. Even though it is a bit clumsy to set up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">R-Cmd<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To finish off this journey then, one day I saw <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/rcmd-app-switcher\/id1596283165?mt=12\">R-Cmd<\/a>&#8230; a really simple MacApp that says &#8220;Hey, stuff caps-lock, it&#8217;s the Right-Cmd key that you don&#8217;t need&#8221; (really, you don&#8217;t) &#8220;so here&#8217;s a really simple app that lets you set Right-Cmd-&lt;key> as a key to open an app.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my Hyper-key setup, but SO much easier and with one app controlling it. Sure, it&#8217;s not as configurable, but I LOVE this way of doing things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Am I completely, over-the-top obsessed with avoiding my mouse and pressing too many keys? YES! Unashamedly. For something I literally do hundreds of times a day, the ergonomics and minimalism in this are great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, finally, finally&#8230; if you want to take this to the next level then you need to read &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/tighten.com\/blog\/how-to-train-your-keyboard\/\">How to Train Your Keyboard<\/a>&#8221; (which also has <a href=\"https:\/\/twentypercent.fm\/episodes\/andrew-morgan-train-your-keyboard\">an accompanying podcast episode<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now go, be productive and ditch YOUR mouse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",
        "excerpt": "<p>Today I&#8217;m tidying up an old draft post on the topic of minimalism for posting. I don&#8217;t really think of myself as minimalist. I&#8217;m not a clean desk person.

Having decided to put off manifest v3 support (a browser extension thing that I will need to do at some point) I\u2019m focussing on making the tool more \u201cframeworky\u201d and building an internal plugin\/addon API.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This won&#8217;t be something that the public can build for. At least, not initially. But it will allow me to apply a standard structure to many of the various &#8220;features&#8221; of Turbo Admin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the existing features are currently in separate JS files\/classes. But they are &#8220;pulled in&#8221; to the appropriate bits of palette code in an ad-hoc way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the new code structure, they will register themselves and offer up features to the palette system, and they will (mostly) use a standard API to interact with the command palette. For example, they will be able to add items, save the palette state and clear it, and provide keyword-based &#8220;search modes&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These search modes are where most of the future power will lie. Typing &#8220;posts&#8221; will search posts using the REST API. Typing &#8220;plugin&#8221; could search your plugins. Typing &#8220;user&#8221; could initiate a user search. Or (and this is HUGE for me &#8211; and maybe for you!) typing &#8220;order&#8221; or &#8220;customer&#8221; could search WooCommerce!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of these features are prototyped and living in branches in Git. Adding this core API is what will free me up to pull them all together into the product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230; how do you do this in JavaScript?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frameworky JavaScript<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a PHP coder. So my natural instinct was to do something object-oriented. JavaScript is sort-of object oriented too. So I was hoping this would work. But it&#8217;s been a strange journey. How do I take my knowledge of how to structure large PHP apps, and turn it into JS architecture?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One issue here is that very few tutorials seem to guide you through architecting with a given language. They show you the principles, but rarely build anything substantial where you get to see the principles applied at scale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m figuring this out from scratch. And yes, I made mistakes along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve ended up with an abstract class approach where each &#8220;plugin&#8221; inherits and extends the functionality of a base, abstract &#8220;plugin&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems that getting the level of abstraction right when you&#8217;re architecting something like this is REALLY difficult. And I&#8217;ve swung both ways. Sometimes with lots of duplicate\/boilerplate code. And sometimes with lots of classes and objects flying around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels important to get it right, so that I don&#8217;t have to re-work all my plugins later. So the pressure is on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to show you REAMS of code, but here&#8217;s an example of the kind of place I&#8217;m at:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"859\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-1024x859.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11341\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-1024x859.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-300x252.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-768x644.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-1536x1288.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x.png 1894w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing this sort of OO in JS feels very weird. I&#8217;m not quite sure it&#8217;s the right approach, and I&#8217;ve heard people frowning on JS classes (is that just a React thing?). But it works a treat, and I&#8217;m pretty sure this will soon allow me to start &#8220;merging in&#8221; all the various prototype code that I have lying around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, evening by evening, little by little, it will start coming together, and the full power of command-pallette-driven WordPress and WooCommerce will reveal itself!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, if you like this sound of all this, please <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/try.html\">give it a try (for free!)<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/turbo-admin\/#reviews\">review it<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/turbo-admin\/hfafpihfemmbjhppilebphmcpepglkfp?hl=en-GB\">rate it<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">go and buy a license<\/a>, or share it with a friend or colleague, or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/turboadmn\">Tweet me<\/a> something nice. This is a labour of love, and every ker-ching of a sale is an encouragement that I&#8217;m doing something useful. All these features will be in a free update in the future, so buy now to get locked in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for following along and for all your support.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I\u2019m FINALLY getting around to chipping away at <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a>&#8216;s next steps. Having decided to put off manifest v3 support (a browser extension thing that I will need to do at some point) I\u2019m focussing on making the tool more \u201cframeworky\u201d and building an internal plugin\/addon API.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This won&#8217;t be something that the public can build for. At least, not initially. But it will allow me to apply a standard structure to many of the various &#8220;features&#8221; of Turbo Admin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the existing features are currently in separate JS files\/classes. But they are &#8220;pulled in&#8221; to the appropriate bits of palette code in an ad-hoc way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the new code structure, they will register themselves and offer up features to the palette system, and they will (mostly) use a standard API to interact with the command palette. For example, they will be able to add items, save the palette state and clear it, and provide keyword-based &#8220;search modes&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These search modes are where most of the future power will lie. Typing &#8220;posts&#8221; will search posts using the REST API. Typing &#8220;plugin&#8221; could search your plugins. Typing &#8220;user&#8221; could initiate a user search. Or (and this is HUGE for me &#8211; and maybe for you!) typing &#8220;order&#8221; or &#8220;customer&#8221; could search WooCommerce!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of these features are prototyped and living in branches in Git. Adding this core API is what will free me up to pull them all together into the product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230; how do you do this in JavaScript?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frameworky JavaScript<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a PHP coder. So my natural instinct was to do something object-oriented. JavaScript is sort-of object oriented too. So I was hoping this would work. But it&#8217;s been a strange journey. How do I take my knowledge of how to structure large PHP apps, and turn it into JS architecture?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One issue here is that very few tutorials seem to guide you through architecting with a given language. They show you the principles, but rarely build anything substantial where you get to see the principles applied at scale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m figuring this out from scratch. And yes, I made mistakes along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve ended up with an abstract class approach where each &#8220;plugin&#8221; inherits and extends the functionality of a base, abstract &#8220;plugin&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems that getting the level of abstraction right when you&#8217;re architecting something like this is REALLY difficult. And I&#8217;ve swung both ways. Sometimes with lots of duplicate\/boilerplate code. And sometimes with lots of classes and objects flying around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels important to get it right, so that I don&#8217;t have to re-work all my plugins later. So the pressure is on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to show you REAMS of code, but here&#8217;s an example of the kind of place I&#8217;m at:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"859\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-1024x859.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11341\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-1024x859.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-300x252.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-768x644.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x-1536x1288.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/CleanShot-2022-09-22-at-21.04.52@2x.png 1894w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing this sort of OO in JS feels very weird. I&#8217;m not quite sure it&#8217;s the right approach, and I&#8217;ve heard people frowning on JS classes (is that just a React thing?). But it works a treat, and I&#8217;m pretty sure this will soon allow me to start &#8220;merging in&#8221; all the various prototype code that I have lying around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, evening by evening, little by little, it will start coming together, and the full power of command-pallette-driven WordPress and WooCommerce will reveal itself!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, if you like this sound of all this, please <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/try.html\">give it a try (for free!)<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/turbo-admin\/#reviews\">review it<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/turbo-admin\/hfafpihfemmbjhppilebphmcpepglkfp?hl=en-GB\">rate it<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">go and buy a license<\/a>, or share it with a friend or colleague, or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/turboadmn\">Tweet me<\/a> something nice. This is a labour of love, and every ker-ching of a sale is an encouragement that I&#8217;m doing something useful. All these features will be in a free update in the future, so buy now to get locked in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for following along and for all your support.<\/p>\n",

We had a great time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that, as I relax and unwind, and the adrenaline that&#8217;s been keeping everything at bay dissipates, and the major life stuff is put aside, things come crashing down and the minor annoyances of life are suddenly much more noticable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And other than appliances and customer service, the other thing that really bugged me while on holiday was that you need a flippin&#8217; app or website registration for SO many things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Get a voucher for a meal at a restaurant: Download an app and register.<\/li><li>Check which beaches are safe to swim at: Probably on a website, but the encouragement was to download the app.<\/li><li>Get a map for the forest park: OK, this didn&#8217;t NEED an app, but, again, it was encouraged and signposted when paper maps were not.<\/li><li>Hire a scooter: Download app and register.<\/li><li>Scan a non-standard QR code on a box of cereal. I didn&#8217;t have to do this, but I was curious. Apparently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.packaginginsights.com\/news\/kelloggs-smartphone-detectable-cereal-boxes-championed-as-game-changer-for-blind-consumer-inclusivity.html\">it&#8217;s great for accessibility<\/a>, and could be some wonderful tech, but it&#8217;s proprietary tech that&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/edent\/status\/1411732397314486278\">not without issues<\/a> and, really, an app to read a colorful QR code?<\/li><li>Trying to find out when the next bus is: the app was optional, but again, encouraged. And it had neat real-time bus-tracking features too.<\/li><li>Buying tickets for the aquarium: this probably legitimately needed registration, but was still ANOTHER account I had to create while mobile.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And don&#8217;t get me started on parking. I now have JustPark, RingGo, PhoneAndPay, PayByPhone, and Apcoa Connect and they all forget who I am and fail in every possible way when ALL I WANT TO DO IS PAY \u00a33 TO PARK MY CAR!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The friction that tech has brought to all of these things seems to be huge. Downloading apps on mobile data isn&#8217;t nice. Registering for anything that requires a password isn&#8217;t nice (yes I use a password manager, and no it&#8217;s not very helpful in these scenarios). Confirming identity by email is a mess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can we make this better?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Use lightweight, progressive web apps, that I can open in a regular browser, without an app download.<\/li><li>Allow some way to do the thing without creating an account, or allowing me to create an account later. Surely someone has fixed the spam and fraud issues by now?<\/li><li>Find some better way than passwords for login. Login with Apple\/Google seems to help here, but isn&#8217;t always implemented and I&#8217;m not entirely sure if I like its magic.<\/li><li>Go and actually user test your applications and websites in real life scenarios &#8211; like, I want to book a ticket to the aquarium from the beach. Or I want to frickin pay \u00a33 to park my frickin&#8217; car in a frickin&#8217; car park and we can land a car-sized rover on Mars using a rocket-powered hovering crane so why can&#8217;t I reset my password right now. I feel like so many of these apps are tested in offices and never actually taken into the real world and used in a real-world scenario.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I dunno. There are some hard problems here. But there are some awesome opportunities to use tech to make things easier and better for people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we MUST reduce the friction of trying to do these things to grasp those opportunites and not just frustrate people who are trying to enjoy their holiday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&lt;\/rant><\/p>\n",

We had a great time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that, as I relax and unwind, and the adrenaline that&#8217;s been keeping everything at bay dissipates, and the major life stuff is put aside, things come crashing down and the minor annoyances of life are suddenly much more noticable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And other than appliances and customer service, the other thing that really bugged me while on holiday was that you need a flippin&#8217; app or website registration for SO many things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Get a voucher for a meal at a restaurant: Download an app and register.<\/li><li>Check which beaches are safe to swim at: Probably on a website, but the encouragement was to download the app.<\/li><li>Get a map for the forest park: OK, this didn&#8217;t NEED an app, but, again, it was encouraged and signposted when paper maps were not.<\/li><li>Hire a scooter: Download app and register.<\/li><li>Scan a non-standard QR code on a box of cereal. I didn&#8217;t have to do this, but I was curious. Apparently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.packaginginsights.com\/news\/kelloggs-smartphone-detectable-cereal-boxes-championed-as-game-changer-for-blind-consumer-inclusivity.html\">it&#8217;s great for accessibility<\/a>, and could be some wonderful tech, but it&#8217;s proprietary tech that&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/edent\/status\/1411732397314486278\">not without issues<\/a> and, really, an app to read a colorful QR code?<\/li><li>Trying to find out when the next bus is: the app was optional, but again, encouraged. And it had neat real-time bus-tracking features too.<\/li><li>Buying tickets for the aquarium: this probably legitimately needed registration, but was still ANOTHER account I had to create while mobile.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And don&#8217;t get me started on parking. I now have JustPark, RingGo, PhoneAndPay, PayByPhone, and Apcoa Connect and they all forget who I am and fail in every possible way when ALL I WANT TO DO IS PAY \u00a33 TO PARK MY CAR!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The friction that tech has brought to all of these things seems to be huge. Downloading apps on mobile data isn&#8217;t nice. Registering for anything that requires a password isn&#8217;t nice (yes I use a password manager, and no it&#8217;s not very helpful in these scenarios). Confirming identity by email is a mess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can we make this better?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Use lightweight, progressive web apps, that I can open in a regular browser, without an app download.<\/li><li>Allow some way to do the thing without creating an account, or allowing me to create an account later. Surely someone has fixed the spam and fraud issues by now?<\/li><li>Find some better way than passwords for login. Login with Apple\/Google seems to help here, but isn&#8217;t always implemented and I&#8217;m not entirely sure if I like its magic.<\/li><li>Go and actually user test your applications and websites in real life scenarios &#8211; like, I want to book a ticket to the aquarium from the beach. Or I want to frickin pay \u00a33 to park my frickin&#8217; car in a frickin&#8217; car park and we can land a car-sized rover on Mars using a rocket-powered hovering crane so why can&#8217;t I reset my password right now. I feel like so many of these apps are tested in offices and never actually taken into the real world and used in a real-world scenario.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I dunno. There are some hard problems here. But there are some awesome opportunities to use tech to make things easier and better for people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we MUST reduce the friction of trying to do these things to grasp those opportunites and not just frustrate people who are trying to enjoy their holiday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&lt;\/rant><\/p>\n",

HTML lacked some advanced things like date\/time inputs, and media elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CSS was lacking in simple things like animated transitions, flexbox, grid, image\/object fit\/cover, custom properties, and calc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might need PNG icon sprite sheets. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>JavaScript was so clunky you kinda had to have jQuery to make it usable. There was no good way to make it modular (other than conflicting standards jostling to be The True Way). And anything more than the simplest code quickly became a spaghetti of functions and nested callbacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So much stuff required importing libraries of code to achieve what is now basic and built-in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hosting was on shared servers with SFTP and SSH if you were lucky. CDN&#8217;s were for advanced projects. HTTPS certificates cost money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LOOK AT US NOW!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HTML5 semantic markup; programmable video and audio elements; date\/time inputs; built-in input validation and errors; CSS transitions and animations; flexbox, grid, calc, fancy units; CSS custom properties; background-size and object-fit options; ES6+ JavaScript with all sorts of niceties that make coding in vanilla JS so much easier; the fetch API; promises and async\/await; simple reactive JS libraries like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alpinejs.dev\/\">Alpine<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/vuejs\/petite-vue\">Petite Vue<\/a>; a multitude of browser APIs for things like geolocation, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, cameras, video, orientation, bluetooth and stuff; <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/JavaScript\/Guide\/Modules\">native ES modules<\/a>; fast and simple JavaScript tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/esbuild.github.io\/\">ESBuild<\/a>; SVG&#8217;s; and super-easy deployment of static pages to free or super-cheap, serverless hosts like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.netlify.com\/\">Netlify<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/pages.github.com\/\">GitHub Pages<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/pages.cloudflare.com\/\">Cloudflare pages<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phew! I can barely handle the power. And there IS power here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How I&#8217;d build and host a single page website now<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With all this power, let&#8217;s explore what a difference this has made. First off &#8211; how would I build and deploy a single page site?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the caveat that I&#8217;m not a designer, so I very much stand on the shoulders of giants when it comes to design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days that&#8217;s usually <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\/\">TailwindUI<\/a>, or something I can throw together in <a href=\"https:\/\/shuffle.dev\/\">Shuffle<\/a> (probably using TailwindCSS as well). Though there are some <a href=\"https:\/\/tailblocks.cc\/\">free<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hyperui.dev\/\">alternatives<\/a> as well for this kind of thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pick some components, chuck them together, tweak them as necessary (which I find much easier to do in this kind of small site with TailwindCSS than in regular CSS) and away you go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I need some simple JavaScript-driven interactivity I&#8217;ll add <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alpinejs.dev\/\">AlpineJS<\/a> (a small, reactive JS library) alongside vanilla JavaScript if needed. This needs no build process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;d put the whole thing in GitHub and deploy it to a static hosting service like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.netlify.com\/\">Netlify<\/a> (which has a generous free tier) or <a href=\"https:\/\/pages.cloudflare.com\/\">Cloudflare Pages<\/a> (which is 100% free). No FTP; a quick push to Git and you&#8217;re done! This is the modern way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Wait? What? Tailwind?!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But wait&#8230;&#8221;, I hear you say, &#8220;aren&#8217;t we aiming for minimal tech here? A no-build-process type thing?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, there are some exceptions. And let me justify Tailwind as a build tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have NEVER had a big problem with Tailwind&#8217;s CLI tool. It&#8217;s well maintained by some very smart people who have a decent business model. I just don&#8217;t get the kind of npm-error-vomit from Tailwind that I have got from other build tools. It&#8217;s stable, robust, well-documented, and the nature of what it does means that backwards-compatibility rarely seems to break.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I <em>enjoy<\/em> using Tailwind as a build tool and so I&#8217;m happy to have it in my simple toolchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PLUS, for me, one of the big benefits of Tailwind is it&#8217;s easy to come back to a project to tweak its styling. These projects are often build-deploy-and-forget-for-ages type things. So simple re-visiting of them is really helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s one more thing to mention about about Tailwind: to get the best from it you really need to have HTML components, possibly with parameters. And this might also need a build tool such as a static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is starting to sound complicated. But wait!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How I&#8217;d build and host a multi-page website<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the site has multiple pages, then to get the benefit of push-to-deploy to a static file host but also using some kind of templating, we&#8217;re going to need a static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I went surveying the environment for this, everything was just WAY too complicated. Sure, <a href=\"https:\/\/jigsaw.tighten.co\/\">Jigsaw<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.11ty.dev\/\">Eleventy<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/mozilla.github.io\/nunjucks\/\">Nunjucks<\/a> and the many others are useful. But I didn&#8217;t want this big a dependency for these small sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I realised that the popular back-end PHP language <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/12\/hang-on-php-is-a-static-site-generator\/\">does this job already<\/a>. It&#8217;s original purpose was as a templating language. So why don&#8217;t I just use that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I wrote <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d\">a super-simple static site generator in about 160 lines of PHP<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This not only lets me use templating, but also lets me have partials\/components with parameters. Perfect for Tailwind!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pulling it all together<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have all the building blocks:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript<\/li><li>TailwindCSS &#8211; my only real dependency<\/li><li>AlpineJS &#8211; which is a dependency if you want it, but it just gets included from a CDN so there&#8217;s no build process<\/li><li>My simple PHP static site generator &#8211; which isn&#8217;t a dependency as such, but does have a build step<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To pull this all together I just use a couple of bash scripts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>build.sh<\/code> does a development build<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>prod.sh<\/code> does a production build (if this needs to be different)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t quite a perfect process. It needs a little more refinement. But I wanted to share it with you. I have kinda hastily thrown together a Git repository with all this ready to go:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/small-site-template\">https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/small-site-template<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick <code>npm install<\/code> on a fork or clone of the repo, followed by a <code>.\/build.sh<\/code> should deliver you a working site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim is NOT that you include this as a dependency of your project. But you fork it and make it your own. This is a template for you to take off in whatever direction you choose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Examples<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to see this in action? Sure thing. Here&#8217;s some examples of where I&#8217;ve used some or all of this tech stack to make real things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">caniphp.com<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/can-i-php\">GitHub<\/a>)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">turbo-admin.com<\/a> (this is a private repo &#8211; sorry)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/wp-composer-generator.veryuseful.app\/\">wp-composer-generator.veryuseful.app<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/wp-composer-generator\/\">GitHub<\/a>)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/bingo.doingitforthekids.net\/\">bingo.doingitforthekids.net<\/a> (Not in GitHub)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/\">wordlepress.netlify.app<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/wordlepress\">GitHub<\/a>)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/tweet-finder.veryuseful.app\/\">tweet-finder.veryuseful.app<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/tweet-finder\">GitHub<\/a>)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Go forth, and build uncomplicated websites<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The web doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated. My process here is, if anything, still over-complicated. But I&#8217;ve stripped down the tech to the minimum that I need to be productive building small sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t use WordPress unless I need to. I don&#8217;t need databases and logins and servers to host on. And I&#8217;m free to build and experiment quickly with these tools, which generate sites which will last and where I hope the tooling is sustainable and the projects easy to return to at a later date if I need to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was inspired to finally finish and publish this post by various sentiments I&#8217;ve seen on Twitter in the last week or so. At one end are people saying &#8220;web dev is never finished because it&#8217;s constantly evolving&#8221;. And at the other end are people saying it&#8217;s taboo that &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/traversymedia\/status\/1554443140479782914\">you don&#8217;t need a frameworks<\/a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jon_bossenger\/status\/1555119369646219265\">this is how we USED to build the web<\/a>&#8221; (emphasis mine).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But HTML, CSS and JS are stable technologies. They are evolving, but they will always have great backwards compatibility. These things won&#8217;t break!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we don&#8217;t need to be ashamed of this approach &#8211; you should develop simple sites with pride! &#8211; and it can be how we build the web now!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go and do so. And let me know how you get on.<\/p>\n",

And partly there have been some technology shifts that have enabled different ways of achieveing the &#8220;simple landing page&#8221; goal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But lets dig in to what&#8217;s changed, and what I would do now instead of using WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s changed?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you rewind even a relatively small number of years, building a simple several-page website with some interactivity was painful. HTML lacked some advanced things like date\/time inputs, and media elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CSS was lacking in simple things like animated transitions, flexbox, grid, image\/object fit\/cover, custom properties, and calc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might need PNG icon sprite sheets. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>JavaScript was so clunky you kinda had to have jQuery to make it usable. There was no good way to make it modular (other than conflicting standards jostling to be The True Way). And anything more than the simplest code quickly became a spaghetti of functions and nested callbacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So much stuff required importing libraries of code to achieve what is now basic and built-in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hosting was on shared servers with SFTP and SSH if you were lucky. CDN&#8217;s were for advanced projects. HTTPS certificates cost money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LOOK AT US NOW!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HTML5 semantic markup; programmable video and audio elements; date\/time inputs; built-in input validation and errors; CSS transitions and animations; flexbox, grid, calc, fancy units; CSS custom properties; background-size and object-fit options; ES6+ JavaScript with all sorts of niceties that make coding in vanilla JS so much easier; the fetch API; promises and async\/await; simple reactive JS libraries like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alpinejs.dev\/\">Alpine<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/vuejs\/petite-vue\">Petite Vue<\/a>; a multitude of browser APIs for things like geolocation, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, cameras, video, orientation, bluetooth and stuff; <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/JavaScript\/Guide\/Modules\">native ES modules<\/a>; fast and simple JavaScript tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/esbuild.github.io\/\">ESBuild<\/a>; SVG&#8217;s; and super-easy deployment of static pages to free or super-cheap, serverless hosts like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.netlify.com\/\">Netlify<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/pages.github.com\/\">GitHub Pages<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/pages.cloudflare.com\/\">Cloudflare pages<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phew! I can barely handle the power. And there IS power here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How I&#8217;d build and host a single page website now<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With all this power, let&#8217;s explore what a difference this has made. First off &#8211; how would I build and deploy a single page site?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the caveat that I&#8217;m not a designer, so I very much stand on the shoulders of giants when it comes to design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days that&#8217;s usually <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\/\">TailwindUI<\/a>, or something I can throw together in <a href=\"https:\/\/shuffle.dev\/\">Shuffle<\/a> (probably using TailwindCSS as well). Though there are some <a href=\"https:\/\/tailblocks.cc\/\">free<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hyperui.dev\/\">alternatives<\/a> as well for this kind of thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pick some components, chuck them together, tweak them as necessary (which I find much easier to do in this kind of small site with TailwindCSS than in regular CSS) and away you go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I need some simple JavaScript-driven interactivity I&#8217;ll add <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alpinejs.dev\/\">AlpineJS<\/a> (a small, reactive JS library) alongside vanilla JavaScript if needed. This needs no build process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;d put the whole thing in GitHub and deploy it to a static hosting service like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.netlify.com\/\">Netlify<\/a> (which has a generous free tier) or <a href=\"https:\/\/pages.cloudflare.com\/\">Cloudflare Pages<\/a> (which is 100% free). No FTP; a quick push to Git and you&#8217;re done! This is the modern way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Wait? What? Tailwind?!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But wait&#8230;&#8221;, I hear you say, &#8220;aren&#8217;t we aiming for minimal tech here? A no-build-process type thing?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, there are some exceptions. And let me justify Tailwind as a build tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have NEVER had a big problem with Tailwind&#8217;s CLI tool. It&#8217;s well maintained by some very smart people who have a decent business model. I just don&#8217;t get the kind of npm-error-vomit from Tailwind that I have got from other build tools. It&#8217;s stable, robust, well-documented, and the nature of what it does means that backwards-compatibility rarely seems to break.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I <em>enjoy<\/em> using Tailwind as a build tool and so I&#8217;m happy to have it in my simple toolchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PLUS, for me, one of the big benefits of Tailwind is it&#8217;s easy to come back to a project to tweak its styling. These projects are often build-deploy-and-forget-for-ages type things. So simple re-visiting of them is really helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s one more thing to mention about about Tailwind: to get the best from it you really need to have HTML components, possibly with parameters. And this might also need a build tool such as a static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is starting to sound complicated. But wait!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How I&#8217;d build and host a multi-page website<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the site has multiple pages, then to get the benefit of push-to-deploy to a static file host but also using some kind of templating, we&#8217;re going to need a static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I went surveying the environment for this, everything was just WAY too complicated. Sure, <a href=\"https:\/\/jigsaw.tighten.co\/\">Jigsaw<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.11ty.dev\/\">Eleventy<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/mozilla.github.io\/nunjucks\/\">Nunjucks<\/a> and the many others are useful. But I didn&#8217;t want this big a dependency for these small sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I realised that the popular back-end PHP language <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/12\/hang-on-php-is-a-static-site-generator\/\">does this job already<\/a>. It&#8217;s original purpose was as a templating language. So why don&#8217;t I just use that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I wrote <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d\">a super-simple static site generator in about 160 lines of PHP<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This not only lets me use templating, but also lets me have partials\/components with parameters. Perfect for Tailwind!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pulling it all together<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have all the building blocks:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript<\/li><li>TailwindCSS &#8211; my only real dependency<\/li><li>AlpineJS &#8211; which is a dependency if you want it, but it just gets included from a CDN so there&#8217;s no build process<\/li><li>My simple PHP static site generator &#8211; which isn&#8217;t a dependency as such, but does have a build step<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To pull this all together I just use a couple of bash scripts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>build.sh<\/code> does a development build<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>prod.sh<\/code> does a production build (if this needs to be different)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t quite a perfect process. It needs a little more refinement. But I wanted to share it with you. I have kinda hastily thrown together a Git repository with all this ready to go:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/small-site-template\">https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/small-site-template<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick <code>npm install<\/code> on a fork or clone of the repo, followed by a <code>.\/build.sh<\/code> should deliver you a working site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim is NOT that you include this as a dependency of your project. But you fork it and make it your own. This is a template for you to take off in whatever direction you choose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Examples<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to see this in action? Sure thing. Here&#8217;s some examples of where I&#8217;ve used some or all of this tech stack to make real things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/caniphp.com\/\">caniphp.com<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/can-i-php\">GitHub<\/a>)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">turbo-admin.com<\/a> (this is a private repo &#8211; sorry)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/wp-composer-generator.veryuseful.app\/\">wp-composer-generator.veryuseful.app<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/wp-composer-generator\/\">GitHub<\/a>)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/bingo.doingitforthekids.net\/\">bingo.doingitforthekids.net<\/a> (Not in GitHub)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/\">wordlepress.netlify.app<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/wordlepress\">GitHub<\/a>)<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/tweet-finder.veryuseful.app\/\">tweet-finder.veryuseful.app<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/tweet-finder\">GitHub<\/a>)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Go forth, and build uncomplicated websites<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The web doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated. My process here is, if anything, still over-complicated. But I&#8217;ve stripped down the tech to the minimum that I need to be productive building small sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t use WordPress unless I need to. I don&#8217;t need databases and logins and servers to host on. And I&#8217;m free to build and experiment quickly with these tools, which generate sites which will last and where I hope the tooling is sustainable and the projects easy to return to at a later date if I need to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was inspired to finally finish and publish this post by various sentiments I&#8217;ve seen on Twitter in the last week or so. At one end are people saying &#8220;web dev is never finished because it&#8217;s constantly evolving&#8221;. And at the other end are people saying it&#8217;s taboo that &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/traversymedia\/status\/1554443140479782914\">you don&#8217;t need a frameworks<\/a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jon_bossenger\/status\/1555119369646219265\">this is how we USED to build the web<\/a>&#8221; (emphasis mine).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But HTML, CSS and JS are stable technologies. They are evolving, but they will always have great backwards compatibility. These things won&#8217;t break!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we don&#8217;t need to be ashamed of this approach &#8211; you should develop simple sites with pride! &#8211; and it can be how we build the web now!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go and do so. And let me know how you get on.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ve always resisted on the basis that the world really doesn&#8217;t need another white tech dude mouth-blogging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve often wondered what would it look like for me to have a podcast or be on a podcast on a regular basis. And recently I&#8217;ve had reason to think about this properly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s my thoughts:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It would be short, with a hard-limit of 20 minutes, a goal of 15 minutes, and a stretch-goal of 10.<\/li><li>It would be at least weekly (to keep cadence) but with bonus episodes as and when I have stuff to talk about.<\/li><li>It would not just be me and it would ideally feature another person that is not a white man. And I would love to use it to promote the work of others who fly under the radar.<\/li><li>It would not be sponsored. It would be for the joy of sharing what I know and what I do with others.<\/li><li>It would be primarily, not only about tech. My world is richer than that and I love learning about all sorts of things.<\/li><li>Related to 5, it would be carefully named so as to not limit the topic or audience. And who cares about the SEO anyway?!<\/li><li>I would be allowed to be critical, but it would never be personal. HOWEVER any critique would always be balanced with positivity. I would expect any co-host and the audience to hold me to this.<\/li><li>It would be fun and have energy. Perhaps modelled on the XKCD concept of &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/xkcd.com\/1053\/\">you&#8217;re one of todays lucky 10,000<\/a>&#8220;.<\/li><li>I would love the format to be different or original in some way, to inject some kind of creativity into people&#8217;s feeds. There would have to be something about it that is unlike all the other podcasts I listen to.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>What would your imaginary podcast look like?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I&#8217;ve often felt the peer pressure of the podcasting bandwagon. I&#8217;ve always resisted on the basis that the world really doesn&#8217;t need another white tech dude mouth-blogging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve often wondered what would it look like for me to have a podcast or be on a podcast on a regular basis. And recently I&#8217;ve had reason to think about this properly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s my thoughts:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It would be short, with a hard-limit of 20 minutes, a goal of 15 minutes, and a stretch-goal of 10.<\/li><li>It would be at least weekly (to keep cadence) but with bonus episodes as and when I have stuff to talk about.<\/li><li>It would not just be me and it would ideally feature another person that is not a white man. And I would love to use it to promote the work of others who fly under the radar.<\/li><li>It would not be sponsored. It would be for the joy of sharing what I know and what I do with others.<\/li><li>It would be primarily, not only about tech. My world is richer than that and I love learning about all sorts of things.<\/li><li>Related to 5, it would be carefully named so as to not limit the topic or audience. And who cares about the SEO anyway?!<\/li><li>I would be allowed to be critical, but it would never be personal. HOWEVER any critique would always be balanced with positivity. I would expect any co-host and the audience to hold me to this.<\/li><li>It would be fun and have energy. Perhaps modelled on the XKCD concept of &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/xkcd.com\/1053\/\">you&#8217;re one of todays lucky 10,000<\/a>&#8220;.<\/li><li>I would love the format to be different or original in some way, to inject some kind of creativity into people&#8217;s feeds. There would have to be something about it that is unlike all the other podcasts I listen to.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>What would your imaginary podcast look like?<\/p>\n",

But it wasn&#8217;t really. It was a comment on how hard freelancing can be (for some types of work) hard to get closed down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I strived for a while to get my business into a place where I could more easily wind it down if I got a job (which I now have). But the nature of my work is that I often helped small organisations work with technology that they really didn&#8217;t understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of that technology is now changing (I&#8217;m looking at you Google Workspace!) and I find myself feeling heavily obliged to helping people through the transition. I was the one who set them up and I&#8217;m really the only admin left on most of the accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, some freelancers can just complete a job and wrap it all up and be done. But I seem to have dug myself a bit of a hole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I was starting again, I wouldn&#8217;t offer hosting, and any ongoing services that my clients depend upon would be well and truly owned by them so that they could more easily be handed over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lo, another of my values starting with the letter &#8216;C&#8217; is evident (they all start with &#8216;C&#8217;!): Conscientious!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-1\/\">10 things I learned about freelancing in ten years (with ten days to go) \u2013 Part 1<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-2\/\">10 things I learned about freelancing in ten years (with ten days to go) \u2013 Part 2<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/10\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-part-3\/\">10 things I learned about freelancing in ten years \u2013 Part 3<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n",

But it wasn&#8217;t really. It was a comment on how hard freelancing can be (for some types of work) hard to get closed down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I strived for a while to get my business into a place where I could more easily wind it down if I got a job (which I now have). But the nature of my work is that I often helped small organisations work with technology that they really didn&#8217;t understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of that technology is now changing (I&#8217;m looking at you Google Workspace!) and I find myself feeling heavily obliged to helping people through the transition. I was the one who set them up and I&#8217;m really the only admin left on most of the accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, some freelancers can just complete a job and wrap it all up and be done. But I seem to have dug myself a bit of a hole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I was starting again, I wouldn&#8217;t offer hosting, and any ongoing services that my clients depend upon would be well and truly owned by them so that they could more easily be handed over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lo, another of my values starting with the letter &#8216;C&#8217; is evident (they all start with &#8216;C&#8217;!): Conscientious!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-1\/\">10 things I learned about freelancing in ten years (with ten days to go) \u2013 Part 1<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-2\/\">10 things I learned about freelancing in ten years (with ten days to go) \u2013 Part 2<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/10\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-part-3\/\">10 things I learned about freelancing in ten years \u2013 Part 3<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n",

I made a lot of &#8220;YAGNI&#8221; (You Ain&#8217;t Gonna Need It) calls, for example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here&#8217;s the kicker: it&#8217;s recursive!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function verses( $start, $end ) {\n    if ($start === $end) {\n        return $this-&gt;verse($start);\n    }\n\n    return $this-&gt;verse($start) . &quot;\\n&quot; . $this-&gt;verses($start - 1, $end);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that this is not optimal in many ways. But the fact that, while working in a hurry, this solution came to mind tells you something about how I was taught computing. I&#8217;m very curious about where this book goes and what I learn from it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on we go&#8230;with an open mind!<\/p>\n",

I made a lot of &#8220;YAGNI&#8221; (You Ain&#8217;t Gonna Need It) calls, for example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here&#8217;s the kicker: it&#8217;s recursive!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\npublic function verses( $start, $end ) {\n    if ($start === $end) {\n        return $this-&gt;verse($start);\n    }\n\n    return $this-&gt;verse($start) . &quot;\\n&quot; . $this-&gt;verses($start - 1, $end);\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that this is not optimal in many ways. But the fact that, while working in a hurry, this solution came to mind tells you something about how I was taught computing. I&#8217;m very curious about where this book goes and what I learn from it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on we go&#8230;with an open mind!<\/p>\n",

I loved this article and though the examples in it were more visually playful than technologically playful (and yes, HTML and CSS are technological &#8211; I just couldn&#8217;t find a better way to distinguish between the two things so, you know what I mean!) I still related to it strongly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the main point of the article is, in my opinion, both important and true:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Being playful with your code and what might seem like \u201clateral\u201d learning can be a huge driving factor in evolving your skills. It might not be noticeable at once, but every time you make some new whimsical thing, you\u2019re leveling up!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why I take stupid ideas for things like &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/\">WordlePress<\/a>&#8220;, <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/swindon-quiz\/\">The Swindon Quiz<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/peekobot.github.io\/peekobot\/\">Peekobot<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hey_schoolbot\">SchoolBot<\/a>, and bring them to reality. There&#8217;s even a fake command line interface on <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/\">the homepage of this site<\/a> written in vanilla JavaScript!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\">Turbo Admin<\/a> was also in this category of &#8220;fun things I&#8217;m going to make just because I can&#8221; (some of its story is <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/03\/turbo-admin-the-story-of-a-first-software-product\/\">here<\/a>), it just happened to be so useful that I thought others might pay for it (and, to my surprise and with my thankfullness, many of you did!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Turbo Admin is a base from which I can try all sorts of other things. I have experimental branches in Git for <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1522249456091119623\">pretty admin URLs<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1496485286636920836\">pulling your favourite plugins into a dashboard widget<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1496246301113135106\">hiding dashboard widgets<\/a> (remember this is a browser extension, so these settings would be saved across all sites).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve put <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1465411502723248131\">easter eggs<\/a> on the marketing site. I&#8217;ve built my own licensing server (that I&#8217;m not using, but it&#8217;s there if I need it). And the other day I figured out that I could let people try it out using a bookmarklet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, last night, I found a way to add <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/05\/raise-your-hands-its-voice-controlled-wordpress\/\">voice recognition<\/a> to it to make WordPress voice-controlled. Watch the first video and you&#8217;ll see how much fun this was and how exciting it was to get it working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And through all these things I&#8217;ve learned a TON, and I&#8217;ve had fun while doing it, and even made a bit of money too &#8211; let alone the reputation-building and networking I&#8217;ve done as a result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s true, we need other hobbies. We need to get away from screens and apps. We need to move our bodies, and exercise our minds in other ways. We should not be defined by our coding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And NOT having silly side projects or being &#8211; the term I&#8217;ve come to love &#8211; a &#8220;recreational coder&#8221; is fine too. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily make you a worse software developer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are benefits to tinkering in SOME of your spare time. And if you&#8217;re having fun as well, as I clearly am, then go for it!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Back at the end of 2020, Jhey Tompkins wrote an excellent article titled &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2020\/11\/playfulness-code-supercharge-fun-learning\/\">Playfulness In Code: Supercharge Your Learning By Having Fun<\/a>&#8220;. I loved this article and though the examples in it were more visually playful than technologically playful (and yes, HTML and CSS are technological &#8211; I just couldn&#8217;t find a better way to distinguish between the two things so, you know what I mean!) I still related to it strongly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the main point of the article is, in my opinion, both important and true:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Being playful with your code and what might seem like \u201clateral\u201d learning can be a huge driving factor in evolving your skills. It might not be noticeable at once, but every time you make some new whimsical thing, you\u2019re leveling up!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why I take stupid ideas for things like &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/wordlepress.netlify.app\/\">WordlePress<\/a>&#8220;, <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/swindon-quiz\/\">The Swindon Quiz<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/peekobot.github.io\/peekobot\/\">Peekobot<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hey_schoolbot\">SchoolBot<\/a>, and bring them to reality. There&#8217;s even a fake command line interface on <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/\">the homepage of this site<\/a> written in vanilla JavaScript!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\">Turbo Admin<\/a> was also in this category of &#8220;fun things I&#8217;m going to make just because I can&#8221; (some of its story is <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/03\/turbo-admin-the-story-of-a-first-software-product\/\">here<\/a>), it just happened to be so useful that I thought others might pay for it (and, to my surprise and with my thankfullness, many of you did!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Turbo Admin is a base from which I can try all sorts of other things. I have experimental branches in Git for <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1522249456091119623\">pretty admin URLs<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1496485286636920836\">pulling your favourite plugins into a dashboard widget<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1496246301113135106\">hiding dashboard widgets<\/a> (remember this is a browser extension, so these settings would be saved across all sites).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve put <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/1465411502723248131\">easter eggs<\/a> on the marketing site. I&#8217;ve built my own licensing server (that I&#8217;m not using, but it&#8217;s there if I need it). And the other day I figured out that I could let people try it out using a bookmarklet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, last night, I found a way to add <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2022\/05\/raise-your-hands-its-voice-controlled-wordpress\/\">voice recognition<\/a> to it to make WordPress voice-controlled. Watch the first video and you&#8217;ll see how much fun this was and how exciting it was to get it working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And through all these things I&#8217;ve learned a TON, and I&#8217;ve had fun while doing it, and even made a bit of money too &#8211; let alone the reputation-building and networking I&#8217;ve done as a result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s true, we need other hobbies. We need to get away from screens and apps. We need to move our bodies, and exercise our minds in other ways. We should not be defined by our coding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And NOT having silly side projects or being &#8211; the term I&#8217;ve come to love &#8211; a &#8220;recreational coder&#8221; is fine too. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily make you a worse software developer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are benefits to tinkering in SOME of your spare time. And if you&#8217;re having fun as well, as I clearly am, then go for it!<\/p>\n",
