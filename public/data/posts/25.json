                "rendered": "<p>Well, if I didn&#8217;t offend any of my cycling\/Twitter buddies with my last post, then maybe this one will do it!<\/p>\n<p>Kidding&#8230;well, possibly. \u00a0I don&#8217;t like being controvertial but there&#8217;s a balance that I want to address. \u00a0My aim is simply to put forward a different &#8211; not better, or worse, just different &#8211; point of view and, I hope, to try to get some of us cyclists united, despite our differences.<\/p>\n<p>You see most of the cyclists I seem to have come across online seem to be of the slow, chic, stylish cycling persuasion. \u00a0They promote cycling as a means of getting from A-to-B and they want to help you do it with the minimum of fuss&#8230;and definitely with the minimum of lycra!<\/p>\n<p>And this is a goal which I fully support. \u00a0People should be able to see cycling as a valid means of transport, and if my own cycle campaigning attempts (when they get underway) \u00a0are ever to be effective, I&#8217;ll need to be seen as someone who can hop on a bike at a moment&#8217;s notice and go somewhere, without any fuss.<\/p>\n<p>I DO cycle in my jeans and jumper (note: I probably don&#8217;t look cool but that&#8217;s more to do with my general lack of dress sense). \u00a0I do have a heavy, upright, hybrid bike with paniers that I can use as a workhorse for transport.<\/p>\n<p>But, I&#8217;m a sports cyclist too. I like to cycle fast. \u00a0I also have a light, sprightly bike with drop bars and low rolling resistance so that I can be efficient. \u00a0I like to get my heart pounding as I pull myself up a steep hill. \u00a0I track my rides, set goals, and go out riding purely for the hell of it.<\/p>\n<p>Darn it, I&#8217;m a lycra lout!<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t see being a sports cyclist and an &#8220;a-to-b&#8221; cyclist as being conflicting or contradictory. \u00a0I think they complement each other well. \u00a0The fitness I gain from being sporty makes getting from a-to-b easier!<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve read some stuff lately that&#8217;s made me feel like I&#8217;m inferior for being a sports cyclist. \u00a0Some of the cycle-chic crowd seem to frown upon light bikes with many gears, but when I got my road bike the acceleration and responsiveness were two of the things I quickly grew to love.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also concerned about the bike fashions being promoted. \u00a0Riding around in your everyday garb is fine&#8230;until it gets dark&#8230;or foggy&#8230;or it rains.<\/p>\n<p>A few years back, I nearly crashed my car into a cyclist, side on, who was traversing a roundabout at night, with no lights, wearing dark clothes. \u00a0Ever since, my primary goal when dressing for cycling isn&#8217;t to look cool, but it&#8217;s to be seen! \u00a0And my secondary goal is to be comfortable.<\/p>\n<p>This is possibly less of a problem on the continent. They don&#8217;t have the English weather to contend with, and their better cycling infrastructure makes it much safer to ride at night.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, I love all the Copenhagen and Amsterdam stuff. \u00a0It&#8217;s brilliant, and it&#8217;s great for showing people what everyday cycling could be like. \u00a0I love that cycling can actually have universal appeal. \u00a0And I will use the valuable resources that are onlinefor showcasing cycling chic because they are incredibly cool.<\/p>\n<p>And I also confess that there are probably road cyclists out there who turn thir noses up at people with big, heavy, practical, cool-looking bikes &#8211; I hope you won&#8217;t count me among them.<\/p>\n<p>But for the sake of appearing united as cyclists, I&#8217;d like to see a little more respect for those of us that like to get a bit of speed and sweat on. \u00a0Sometimes we&#8217;re just trying to get from A-to-B too!<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, even, the roadies and the cycle-chic crowd could get together and gang up on the really silly cyclists&#8230;the mountain bikers!!! \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Well, if I didn&#8217;t offend any of my cycling\/Twitter buddies with my last post, then maybe this one will do it!<\/p>\n<p>Kidding&#8230;well, possibly. \u00a0I don&#8217;t like being controvertial but there&#8217;s a balance that I want to address. \u00a0My aim is simply to put forward a different &#8211; not better, or worse, just different &#8211; point of view and, I hope, to try to get some of us cyclists united, despite our differences.<\/p>\n<p>You see most of the cyclists I seem to have come across online seem to be of the slow, chic, stylish cycling persuasion. \u00a0They promote cycling as a means of getting from A-to-B and they want to help you do it with the minimum of fuss&#8230;and definitely with the minimum of lycra!<\/p>\n<p>And this is a goal which I fully support. \u00a0People should be able to see cycling as a valid means of transport, and if my own cycle campaigning attempts (when they get underway) \u00a0are ever to be effective, I&#8217;ll need to be seen as someone who can hop on a bike at a moment&#8217;s notice and go somewhere, without any fuss.<\/p>\n<p>I DO cycle in my jeans and jumper (note: I probably don&#8217;t look cool but that&#8217;s more to do with my general lack of dress sense). \u00a0I do have a heavy, upright, hybrid bike with paniers that I can use as a workhorse for transport.<\/p>\n<p>But, I&#8217;m a sports cyclist too. I like to cycle fast. \u00a0I also have a light, sprightly bike with drop bars and low rolling resistance so that I can be efficient. \u00a0I like to get my heart pounding as I pull myself up a steep hill. \u00a0I track my rides, set goals, and go out riding purely for the hell of it.<\/p>\n<p>Darn it, I&#8217;m a lycra lout!<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t see being a sports cyclist and an &#8220;a-to-b&#8221; cyclist as being conflicting or contradictory. \u00a0I think they complement each other well. \u00a0The fitness I gain from being sporty makes getting from a-to-b easier!<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve read some stuff lately that&#8217;s made me feel like I&#8217;m inferior for being a sports cyclist. \u00a0Some of the cycle-chic crowd seem to frown upon light bikes with many gears, but when I got my road bike the acceleration and responsiveness were two of the things I quickly grew to love.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also concerned about the bike fashions being promoted. \u00a0Riding around in your everyday garb is fine&#8230;until it gets dark&#8230;or foggy&#8230;or it rains.<\/p>\n<p>A few years back, I nearly crashed my car into a cyclist, side on, who was traversing a roundabout at night, with no lights, wearing dark clothes. \u00a0Ever since, my primary goal when dressing for cycling isn&#8217;t to look cool, but it&#8217;s to be seen! \u00a0And my secondary goal is to be comfortable.<\/p>\n<p>This is possibly less of a problem on the continent. They don&#8217;t have the English weather to contend with, and their better cycling infrastructure makes it much safer to ride at night.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, I love all the Copenhagen and Amsterdam stuff. \u00a0It&#8217;s brilliant, and it&#8217;s great for showing people what everyday cycling could be like. \u00a0I love that cycling can actually have universal appeal. \u00a0And I will use the valuable resources that are onlinefor showcasing cycling chic because they are incredibly cool.<\/p>\n<p>And I also confess that there are probably road cyclists out there who turn thir noses up at people with big, heavy, practical, cool-looking bikes &#8211; I hope you won&#8217;t count me among them.<\/p>\n<p>But for the sake of appearing united as cyclists, I&#8217;d like to see a little more respect for those of us that like to get a bit of speed and sweat on. \u00a0Sometimes we&#8217;re just trying to get from A-to-B too!<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, even, the roadies and the cycle-chic crowd could get together and gang up on the really silly cyclists&#8230;the mountain bikers!!! \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n",

I have drunk the Copenhagen Kool-aid, for sure.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s definitely a sense of wanting to change the status quo, though; we have car dominance overall in the UK, but within cycling the emphasis in most bike marketing is on MTBs, lycra, lots and lots of *kit*.<\/p>\n<p>I, like quite a few others, would love to see more cycling-as-transportation, for health and traffic congestion reasons. It\u2019s the lack of mainstream emphasis on this that causes us to shout loud, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Keep on cycling, in whatever form <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http:\/\/s.wordpress.com\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnyone who rides a bike is a friend of mine\u201d \u2014 Gary Fisher<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I like what Tim said and I agree wholeheartedly, but it triggered some more thoughts in my brain.<\/p>\n<p>Now, occasionally I like to play devil&#8217;s advocate somewhat.\u00a0 These aren&#8217;t ideas that are fully thought through, or even that I agree with, they are questions to stimulate further discussion.<\/p>\n<p>We live in an age where pretty much everything&#8217;s commercialised; where, rightly or wrongly, &#8220;lots of *kit*&#8221; is the norm.\u00a0 Here&#8217;s some thoughts then:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Isn&#8217;t it <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">good<\/span> that we have lots of cycling kit so that people who are gadget-lovers can get a hook into cycling?\u00a0 Perhaps this is one of the reasons for the boom in mountain biking&#8230;it&#8217;s a chance to acquire more &#8220;cool stuff&#8221;?\u00a0 A mountain bike appears to be a much greater status symbol than a road bike, a commuter, or a tourer, even though it may be less suited to everyday use.\u00a0 Why is that?\u00a0 Because it has more of a gadget factor?<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t we also want identity through our stuff?\u00a0 As I think Karl&#8217;s post pointed out the other day, we tend to see differences rather than similarities.\u00a0 But I also think we strive to be different &#8211; to fit in with a particular class or group.\u00a0 Isn&#8217;t &#8220;a-to-b&#8221; cyclist, or &#8220;chic&#8221; cyclist just another form of cyclist with an associated set of behaviours and paraphernalia? And isn&#8217;t it, again, rightly or wrongly, a group that people are trying to fit themselves into to differentiate themselves from other types of cyclist?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Given that the above might be true, what things would you design\/invent to encourage more use of the bike as a means of transport.\u00a0 What marketing might we do to elevate the status of the everyday city\/commuter bike?\u00a0 How do we get to a state where owning something like a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pashley.co.uk\/\">Pashley<\/a> or, for that matter, any sort of bike with panniers and mudguards, is &#8220;mainstream&#8221; and &#8220;cool&#8221;? (I know we think it is, but do others?)<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the aim is to get people cycling whatever their bike is like and whatever they might have in their wardrobe, but I can&#8217;t help thinking that fashion&#8230;&#8221;kit&#8221;&#8230;&#8221;stuff&#8221; helps us get there.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine a Nike Bike.\u00a0 Or an Apple iBike.\u00a0 Or celebrity-endorsed cycles?\u00a0 Hey, I&#8217;m not a marketer&#8230;you&#8217;re ideas are almost certainly better then mine.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, in short, the bike needs rebranding?<\/p>\n",

I have drunk the Copenhagen Kool-aid, for sure.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s definitely a sense of wanting to change the status quo, though; we have car dominance overall in the UK, but within cycling the emphasis in most bike marketing is on MTBs, lycra, lots and lots of *kit*.<\/p>\n<p>I, like quite a few others, would love to see more cycling-as-transportation, for health and traffic congestion reasons. It\u2019s the lack of mainstream emphasis on this that causes us to shout loud, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Keep on cycling, in whatever form <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http:\/\/s.wordpress.com\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnyone who rides a bike is a friend of mine\u201d \u2014 Gary Fisher<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I like what Tim said and I agree wholeheartedly, but it triggered some more thoughts in my brain.<\/p>\n<p>Now, occasionally I like to play devil&#8217;s advocate somewhat.\u00a0 These aren&#8217;t ideas that are fully thought through, or even that I agree with, they are questions to stimulate further discussion.<\/p>\n<p>We live in an age where pretty much everything&#8217;s commercialised; where, rightly or wrongly, &#8220;lots of *kit*&#8221; is the norm.\u00a0 Here&#8217;s some thoughts then:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Isn&#8217;t it <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">good<\/span> that we have lots of cycling kit so that people who are gadget-lovers can get a hook into cycling?\u00a0 Perhaps this is one of the reasons for the boom in mountain biking&#8230;it&#8217;s a chance to acquire more &#8220;cool stuff&#8221;?\u00a0 A mountain bike appears to be a much greater status symbol than a road bike, a commuter, or a tourer, even though it may be less suited to everyday use.\u00a0 Why is that?\u00a0 Because it has more of a gadget factor?<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t we also want identity through our stuff?\u00a0 As I think Karl&#8217;s post pointed out the other day, we tend to see differences rather than similarities.\u00a0 But I also think we strive to be different &#8211; to fit in with a particular class or group.\u00a0 Isn&#8217;t &#8220;a-to-b&#8221; cyclist, or &#8220;chic&#8221; cyclist just another form of cyclist with an associated set of behaviours and paraphernalia? And isn&#8217;t it, again, rightly or wrongly, a group that people are trying to fit themselves into to differentiate themselves from other types of cyclist?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Given that the above might be true, what things would you design\/invent to encourage more use of the bike as a means of transport.\u00a0 What marketing might we do to elevate the status of the everyday city\/commuter bike?\u00a0 How do we get to a state where owning something like a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pashley.co.uk\/\">Pashley<\/a> or, for that matter, any sort of bike with panniers and mudguards, is &#8220;mainstream&#8221; and &#8220;cool&#8221;? (I know we think it is, but do others?)<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the aim is to get people cycling whatever their bike is like and whatever they might have in their wardrobe, but I can&#8217;t help thinking that fashion&#8230;&#8221;kit&#8221;&#8230;&#8221;stuff&#8221; helps us get there.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine a Nike Bike.\u00a0 Or an Apple iBike.\u00a0 Or celebrity-endorsed cycles?\u00a0 Hey, I&#8217;m not a marketer&#8230;you&#8217;re ideas are almost certainly better then mine.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, in short, the bike needs rebranding?<\/p>\n",

A line where my cycle commute is so ingrained that it feels more natural than driving to and from work.\u00a0 Being in a traffic jam feels truly alien, incrediby frustrating and just generally horrid.<\/p>\n<p>The difference is subtle.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve always known in my head that cycling is better, but today there was something more emotional and heartfelt, something more emotional about driving.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s taken a surprisingly long time to achieve this &#8211; probably mostly because I&#8217;ve avoided rush hour on most occasions I&#8217;ve commuted by car.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I felt liberated from the car.<\/p>\n<p>Now, how to convince others to join me?<\/p>\n",

Here&#8217;s some thoughts I jotted down shortly after the Martyn Joseph and Stewart Henderson gig on March 27th]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had a busy weekend.  A gig on Friday night, up early on Saturday to travel to Aberystwyth for a meeting, an overnight stay in a B&amp;B in the Brecon Beacons, and home in time to lead music at Church on Sunday night.  Not much of a restful weekend.<\/p>\n<p>This post is about the first of those things though: Friday night&#8217;s gig.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been booked in to see Martyn Joseph and Stewart Henderson for months and, as always with a gig, we were excited and expectant as the evening approached.  But what, actually, to expect from a gig that&#8217;s half folk rock music and half poetry?<\/p>\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, Martyn Joseph is a really good folk rock guitarist\/singer\/songwriter.  His shows are always packed with passion and emotion, MJ means what he sings, his fiery spirit punches through in every song and you leave stirred, moved and excited.<\/p>\n<p>But behind a lot of his songs sits the quiet, wise, humble Henderson, who writes some of he lyrics that MJ puts music to.  It&#8217;s a long established partnership that spans decades.  But Henderson is a poet; a man of words and not music or song.<\/p>\n<p>We arrived to a stage with two microphones set up.  Introductions were done by the comp\u00e8re and as the looming Joseph in crisp white t-shirt and jeans leapt up on stage followed by the small, slight, bespectacled Henderson in proper trousers and a neat suit jacket, I don&#8217;t think anyone was quite sure what was about to happen.<\/p>\n<p>But, if I remember rightly, MJ launched into a passionate rendition of \u201cWeight of the World\u201d, but dropping his sung vocals at times for Henderson to read \u2013 intelligently and entertainingly \u2013 the lyrics, in his soft Liverpudlian, while occasionally dancing around the stage in&#8230;delight?&#8230;err&#8230;well I&#8217;m not sure why, but it made us laugh.<\/p>\n<p>What followed was a fascinating evening of poems set to music, prose read with charm and wit, music wrapped around poetry, songs rendered with power and feeling, and entertainment from two inspiring and engaging men, with great sensitivity and wisdom.<\/p>\n<p>At times, I wasn&#8217;t sure what to make of it.  Knowing a lot of the tunes and words, I can barely hold back from song, so having the verses read as prose created a tension for me and I think, overall, I prefer Joseph on his own.<\/p>\n<p>But this is important stuff right?  Henderson is so often the unrecognised talent in the team.  How incredibly right that MJ puts his own rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll talent aside, steps back from the mic, and suppresses his desire to launch into song, in order to give voice to the spirit of his words.<\/p>\n<p>And Henderson is hugely entertaining in his own right. A master of words with a huge vocabulary and gift for crafting them into evocative verse.  He has a talent for public speaking too and when the floor was opened for questions, Henderson did most of the answering (though that my be because more of the questions were directed at him) bring his replies to life with fun anecdotes and dry, spontaneous, northern wit&#8230;even, occasionally, making his stage partner screw his face up in laughter.<\/p>\n<p>I, personally, was reminded of the power of poetry.  I wonder if we can use the spoken word more in our communication, and for me this may be especially relevant in leading people in worship at church.  I also used to write prose myself&#8230;perhaps this is something I should try again.<\/p>\n<p>Folk music is often so much more than the sum of its valuable parts.  This evening demonstrated that.  Poetry and music together partners that have been clearly demonstrated to complement each other so well.<\/p>\n<p>Now where&#8217;s my guitar?  Or, possibly, when my quill and ink?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><em>[Oh, look &#8211; a pre-written blog post.  Here&#8217;s some thoughts I jotted down shortly after the Martyn Joseph and Stewart Henderson gig on March 27th]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had a busy weekend.  A gig on Friday night, up early on Saturday to travel to Aberystwyth for a meeting, an overnight stay in a B&amp;B in the Brecon Beacons, and home in time to lead music at Church on Sunday night.  Not much of a restful weekend.<\/p>\n<p>This post is about the first of those things though: Friday night&#8217;s gig.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been booked in to see Martyn Joseph and Stewart Henderson for months and, as always with a gig, we were excited and expectant as the evening approached.  But what, actually, to expect from a gig that&#8217;s half folk rock music and half poetry?<\/p>\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, Martyn Joseph is a really good folk rock guitarist\/singer\/songwriter.  His shows are always packed with passion and emotion, MJ means what he sings, his fiery spirit punches through in every song and you leave stirred, moved and excited.<\/p>\n<p>But behind a lot of his songs sits the quiet, wise, humble Henderson, who writes some of he lyrics that MJ puts music to.  It&#8217;s a long established partnership that spans decades.  But Henderson is a poet; a man of words and not music or song.<\/p>\n<p>We arrived to a stage with two microphones set up.  Introductions were done by the comp\u00e8re and as the looming Joseph in crisp white t-shirt and jeans leapt up on stage followed by the small, slight, bespectacled Henderson in proper trousers and a neat suit jacket, I don&#8217;t think anyone was quite sure what was about to happen.<\/p>\n<p>But, if I remember rightly, MJ launched into a passionate rendition of \u201cWeight of the World\u201d, but dropping his sung vocals at times for Henderson to read \u2013 intelligently and entertainingly \u2013 the lyrics, in his soft Liverpudlian, while occasionally dancing around the stage in&#8230;delight?&#8230;err&#8230;well I&#8217;m not sure why, but it made us laugh.<\/p>\n<p>What followed was a fascinating evening of poems set to music, prose read with charm and wit, music wrapped around poetry, songs rendered with power and feeling, and entertainment from two inspiring and engaging men, with great sensitivity and wisdom.<\/p>\n<p>At times, I wasn&#8217;t sure what to make of it.  Knowing a lot of the tunes and words, I can barely hold back from song, so having the verses read as prose created a tension for me and I think, overall, I prefer Joseph on his own.<\/p>\n<p>But this is important stuff right?  Henderson is so often the unrecognised talent in the team.  How incredibly right that MJ puts his own rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll talent aside, steps back from the mic, and suppresses his desire to launch into song, in order to give voice to the spirit of his words.<\/p>\n<p>And Henderson is hugely entertaining in his own right. A master of words with a huge vocabulary and gift for crafting them into evocative verse.  He has a talent for public speaking too and when the floor was opened for questions, Henderson did most of the answering (though that my be because more of the questions were directed at him) bring his replies to life with fun anecdotes and dry, spontaneous, northern wit&#8230;even, occasionally, making his stage partner screw his face up in laughter.<\/p>\n<p>I, personally, was reminded of the power of poetry.  I wonder if we can use the spoken word more in our communication, and for me this may be especially relevant in leading people in worship at church.  I also used to write prose myself&#8230;perhaps this is something I should try again.<\/p>\n<p>Folk music is often so much more than the sum of its valuable parts.  This evening demonstrated that.  Poetry and music together partners that have been clearly demonstrated to complement each other so well.<\/p>\n<p>Now where&#8217;s my guitar?  Or, possibly, when my quill and ink?<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>It wasn&#8217;t long since I was <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/03\/11\/contemplating-my-existence\/\">wondering whether or not to stick around on Twitter<\/a>.  I&#8217;m still mulling over the purposes, uses, and usefulness of Twitter, the instant short-messaging system that is capturing more and more of the media&#8217;s attention and is growing rapidly.<\/p>\n<p>So, if my last post might have put people off, this one, and the next few, are intended to encourage people who&#8217;ve joined Twitter, or are thinking of joining, and who are wondering what it&#8217;s all about.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t be the first to post tips on how to use Twitter, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.pbworks.com\/\">Twitter Fan Wiki<\/a> is a much better resource than I&#8217;ll ever be able to produce.<\/p>\n<p>But my aim is to have some bite-size posts here that I can refer people to when they say &#8220;what&#8217;s this all about then&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So, Twitter.  Instant short messaging? Micro blogging?  Search engine?  Cultural phenomenon?  Waste of time?  What is it?<\/p>\n<p>I imagine many more of you use Facebook and you&#8217;re probably aware of the concept of status updates.  Short notes that describe what you&#8217;re doing, thinking or feeling.<\/p>\n<p>For me, status updates (and photos) are the two most useful parts of Facebook.  They are simple hooks into what people are up to that enable a conversation to start.  I&#8217;m more in touch with what my friends are doing now because of such things.<\/p>\n<p>And there is an element of art in status updates too.  There is a skill in crafting short, clever, interesting messages.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter is, in effect, the status updates from Facebook, with everything else stripped out.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s a key difference: Twitter is (mostly) public. Anyone can see your updates. With Facebook only your friends can see your updates.<\/p>\n<p>There is a concept of &#8220;Following&#8221;. Updates from people who you follow appear in your &#8220;Timeline&#8221; (on your homepage).\u00a0 Equally, you can be followed and your updates will appear or be sent to your followers. However, unlike Facebook, you can follow anyone and anyone can follow you.\u00a0 You don&#8217;t need to be mutual friends.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter does allow you to lock down so that your updates are protected, but you miss out on a lot by doing this.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;open&#8221; nature means that people can come and scour the messages flying around and process them in useful and interesting ways.\u00a0 I&#8217;ll deal with some of these in a future post, but as a pretty example, take a look at <a title=\"Twistori\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twistori.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twistori<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It is this ability to process the messages that gives Twitter its power.\u00a0 And its this power that I&#8217;ll be exploring in subsequent posts.<\/p>\n<p>However, in my opinion, Twitter&#8217;s extensions have taken over slightly and people use it for more than just status updates and this has made it more impersonal and less valuable to me as a person.<\/p>\n<p>The other problem with the cultural phenomenon of Twitter is that it&#8217;s turned into a words and numbers game.\u00a0 Can I get hundreds of followers? Can I get my chosen topic mentioned to much that it&#8217;s classified as a trend.<\/p>\n<p>Such things have diluted the useful posts with many meaningless ones.<\/p>\n<p>I think Twitter IS still a useful tool, if you don&#8217;t get caught up in the numbers game, keep your followings managable, and mostly follow real people that share interests with you.\u00a0 That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m still there!<\/p>\n<p>Stick with me for a few days and hopefully you&#8217;ll see why.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>It wasn&#8217;t long since I was <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/03\/11\/contemplating-my-existence\/\">wondering whether or not to stick around on Twitter<\/a>.  I&#8217;m still mulling over the purposes, uses, and usefulness of Twitter, the instant short-messaging system that is capturing more and more of the media&#8217;s attention and is growing rapidly.<\/p>\n<p>So, if my last post might have put people off, this one, and the next few, are intended to encourage people who&#8217;ve joined Twitter, or are thinking of joining, and who are wondering what it&#8217;s all about.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t be the first to post tips on how to use Twitter, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.pbworks.com\/\">Twitter Fan Wiki<\/a> is a much better resource than I&#8217;ll ever be able to produce.<\/p>\n<p>But my aim is to have some bite-size posts here that I can refer people to when they say &#8220;what&#8217;s this all about then&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So, Twitter.  Instant short messaging? Micro blogging?  Search engine?  Cultural phenomenon?  Waste of time?  What is it?<\/p>\n<p>I imagine many more of you use Facebook and you&#8217;re probably aware of the concept of status updates.  Short notes that describe what you&#8217;re doing, thinking or feeling.<\/p>\n<p>For me, status updates (and photos) are the two most useful parts of Facebook.  They are simple hooks into what people are up to that enable a conversation to start.  I&#8217;m more in touch with what my friends are doing now because of such things.<\/p>\n<p>And there is an element of art in status updates too.  There is a skill in crafting short, clever, interesting messages.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter is, in effect, the status updates from Facebook, with everything else stripped out.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s a key difference: Twitter is (mostly) public. Anyone can see your updates. With Facebook only your friends can see your updates.<\/p>\n<p>There is a concept of &#8220;Following&#8221;. Updates from people who you follow appear in your &#8220;Timeline&#8221; (on your homepage).\u00a0 Equally, you can be followed and your updates will appear or be sent to your followers. However, unlike Facebook, you can follow anyone and anyone can follow you.\u00a0 You don&#8217;t need to be mutual friends.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter does allow you to lock down so that your updates are protected, but you miss out on a lot by doing this.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;open&#8221; nature means that people can come and scour the messages flying around and process them in useful and interesting ways.\u00a0 I&#8217;ll deal with some of these in a future post, but as a pretty example, take a look at <a title=\"Twistori\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twistori.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twistori<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It is this ability to process the messages that gives Twitter its power.\u00a0 And its this power that I&#8217;ll be exploring in subsequent posts.<\/p>\n<p>However, in my opinion, Twitter&#8217;s extensions have taken over slightly and people use it for more than just status updates and this has made it more impersonal and less valuable to me as a person.<\/p>\n<p>The other problem with the cultural phenomenon of Twitter is that it&#8217;s turned into a words and numbers game.\u00a0 Can I get hundreds of followers? Can I get my chosen topic mentioned to much that it&#8217;s classified as a trend.<\/p>\n<p>Such things have diluted the useful posts with many meaningless ones.<\/p>\n<p>I think Twitter IS still a useful tool, if you don&#8217;t get caught up in the numbers game, keep your followings managable, and mostly follow real people that share interests with you.\u00a0 That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m still there!<\/p>\n<p>Stick with me for a few days and hopefully you&#8217;ll see why.<\/p>\n",

Part 2 of my Twitter introduction\/reference.\u00a0 Hey, this is as much for my benefit as yours!<\/p>\n<p>Today, different types of message.<\/p>\n<p>Status updates are all well and good, but sometimes you want to reply to something someone said, or pass it on to others.\u00a0 There are conventions that allow you to do this.\u00a0 Some result in special processing of your message by Twitter&#8217;s servers, others are just style or accepted convention.<\/p>\n<h3>@ Replies<\/h3>\n<p>Pronounced &#8220;at replies&#8221;, these allow you to send replies to a message posted by another user.\u00a0 The format of an @ reply is:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@username Message<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@magicroundabout Hey, thanks for the tips!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>These are specially processed by Twitter and you can see which &#8220;Tweet&#8221; (message) the reply was sent in reply to.\u00a0 Plus, if someone you&#8217;re not following @ replies you, you will see the message in your timeline &#8211; on your homepage.\u00a0 There is also a special section on the Twitter homepage that allows you to see all replies directed at you.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, Twitter started processing messages as @ replies even if the @username wasn&#8217;t at the start of the message.<\/p>\n<h3>Direct messaging<\/h3>\n<p>@ replies are, in essence, public. There are rules (that I won&#8217;t go into here) about who&#8217;s @replies you see in your timeline.\u00a0 But if someone else looks at your profile, they will see the @replies that you have posted.<\/p>\n<p>Direct messaging allows you send a message to someone privately and is done by writing a message in the format:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>d username Message<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>d magicroundabout Ah, so no one else can see this eh?!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Direct messages are filtered into a separate &#8220;Direct Messages&#8221; inbox on the Twitter homepage, and there&#8217;s a neat little screen for sending &#8220;directs&#8221; to others on the Twitter site too.<\/p>\n<h3>Re-tweeting<\/h3>\n<p>Re-tweeting is a convention used when someone has said something that you want to repeat, with credit to the original sender.\u00a0 A re-tweet is denoted by the letters RT and the username of the originator.\u00a0 A typical message would be:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>RT @myfriend Hey, send everyone this cool link: http:\/\/url.com\/<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Re-tweets are not, to my knowledge, processed any differently to normal messages &#8211; other than the fact that they are also an @reply to the originator.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, re-tweeting, in general, annoys me.\u00a0 If I want to hear what @yourfriend has to say, then I&#8217;m probably following them.\u00a0 Plus, if I am already following them and you RT them, then I get the same message twice.<\/p>\n<p>Occasional re-tweeting is OK, but it&#8217;s got a bit out of hand.<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>Twitter has now rolled out an official Re-tweet feature.\u00a0 This seems to have reduced some of the noise by doing retweets more intelligently.\u00a0 The details of how this works are over on the <a title=\"Twitter Blog: Project Retweet\" href=\"http:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2009\/08\/project-retweet-phase-one.html\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Hashtags<\/h3>\n<p>Hashtags are a convention that&#8217;s not processed by Twitter, but IS processed by a separate website at http:\/\/hashtags.org\/.<\/p>\n<p>Hashtags allow you to include your messages along with other messages about a similar topic.\u00a0 A hashtag basically says &#8220;This message is about&#8230;.&lt;topic&gt;&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>A hashtag is a word, with no spaces, preceeded by a hash (#) character, and can appear anywhere in your message.<\/p>\n<p>A good example of this was in February when we had lots of snow in the UK and it caused lots of disruption.\u00a0 People used &#8220;#uksnow&#8221;\u00a0 to state that their message was about the UK snow. e.g.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Snow&#8217;s about 8 inches deep here in Swindon #uksnow<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>or<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Got stuck in the #uksnow this morning.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Why would you want to do this?\u00a0 Well, the hashtags website mentioned above tracks hashtags and shows lists of messages that contain a particular tag, &#8220;trends&#8221; (what people are talking about a lot right now) and statistics about tags.<\/p>\n<p>The <a title=\"Twitter search\" href=\"http:\/\/search.twitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter search<\/a> function (which I&#8217;ll cover another time) also does trending and allows you to seach for messages with a particular tag?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Where to tags come from?&#8221;, I hear you ask.\u00a0 Well, anyone! Just make one up, start using it, or pick up an existing one and use that.<\/p>\n<p>Note that, apart from direct messages, you can combine as many of these things as you like.\u00a0 You could, for example, write:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>RT @yourfriend Hey, pass this on #coolretweets<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>How any old user is supposed to work out these things I&#8217;m not sure.\u00a0 Probably people say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@magicroundabout What&#8217;s all these # things flying around?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>and I reply<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@friend Ah, that&#8217;ll be #hashtags then: http:\/\/hashtags.org\/<\/p><\/blockquote>\n",

        "content": "<p>Welcome back. Part 2 of my Twitter introduction\/reference.\u00a0 Hey, this is as much for my benefit as yours!<\/p>\n<p>Today, different types of message.<\/p>\n<p>Status updates are all well and good, but sometimes you want to reply to something someone said, or pass it on to others.\u00a0 There are conventions that allow you to do this.\u00a0 Some result in special processing of your message by Twitter&#8217;s servers, others are just style or accepted convention.<\/p>\n<h3>@ Replies<\/h3>\n<p>Pronounced &#8220;at replies&#8221;, these allow you to send replies to a message posted by another user.\u00a0 The format of an @ reply is:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@username Message<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@magicroundabout Hey, thanks for the tips!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>These are specially processed by Twitter and you can see which &#8220;Tweet&#8221; (message) the reply was sent in reply to.\u00a0 Plus, if someone you&#8217;re not following @ replies you, you will see the message in your timeline &#8211; on your homepage.\u00a0 There is also a special section on the Twitter homepage that allows you to see all replies directed at you.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, Twitter started processing messages as @ replies even if the @username wasn&#8217;t at the start of the message.<\/p>\n<h3>Direct messaging<\/h3>\n<p>@ replies are, in essence, public. There are rules (that I won&#8217;t go into here) about who&#8217;s @replies you see in your timeline.\u00a0 But if someone else looks at your profile, they will see the @replies that you have posted.<\/p>\n<p>Direct messaging allows you send a message to someone privately and is done by writing a message in the format:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>d username Message<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>d magicroundabout Ah, so no one else can see this eh?!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Direct messages are filtered into a separate &#8220;Direct Messages&#8221; inbox on the Twitter homepage, and there&#8217;s a neat little screen for sending &#8220;directs&#8221; to others on the Twitter site too.<\/p>\n<h3>Re-tweeting<\/h3>\n<p>Re-tweeting is a convention used when someone has said something that you want to repeat, with credit to the original sender.\u00a0 A re-tweet is denoted by the letters RT and the username of the originator.\u00a0 A typical message would be:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>RT @myfriend Hey, send everyone this cool link: http:\/\/url.com\/<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Re-tweets are not, to my knowledge, processed any differently to normal messages &#8211; other than the fact that they are also an @reply to the originator.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, re-tweeting, in general, annoys me.\u00a0 If I want to hear what @yourfriend has to say, then I&#8217;m probably following them.\u00a0 Plus, if I am already following them and you RT them, then I get the same message twice.<\/p>\n<p>Occasional re-tweeting is OK, but it&#8217;s got a bit out of hand.<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>Twitter has now rolled out an official Re-tweet feature.\u00a0 This seems to have reduced some of the noise by doing retweets more intelligently.\u00a0 The details of how this works are over on the <a title=\"Twitter Blog: Project Retweet\" href=\"http:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2009\/08\/project-retweet-phase-one.html\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Hashtags<\/h3>\n<p>Hashtags are a convention that&#8217;s not processed by Twitter, but IS processed by a separate website at http:\/\/hashtags.org\/.<\/p>\n<p>Hashtags allow you to include your messages along with other messages about a similar topic.\u00a0 A hashtag basically says &#8220;This message is about&#8230;.&lt;topic&gt;&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>A hashtag is a word, with no spaces, preceeded by a hash (#) character, and can appear anywhere in your message.<\/p>\n<p>A good example of this was in February when we had lots of snow in the UK and it caused lots of disruption.\u00a0 People used &#8220;#uksnow&#8221;\u00a0 to state that their message was about the UK snow. e.g.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Snow&#8217;s about 8 inches deep here in Swindon #uksnow<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>or<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Got stuck in the #uksnow this morning.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Why would you want to do this?\u00a0 Well, the hashtags website mentioned above tracks hashtags and shows lists of messages that contain a particular tag, &#8220;trends&#8221; (what people are talking about a lot right now) and statistics about tags.<\/p>\n<p>The <a title=\"Twitter search\" href=\"http:\/\/search.twitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter search<\/a> function (which I&#8217;ll cover another time) also does trending and allows you to seach for messages with a particular tag?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Where to tags come from?&#8221;, I hear you ask.\u00a0 Well, anyone! Just make one up, start using it, or pick up an existing one and use that.<\/p>\n<p>Note that, apart from direct messages, you can combine as many of these things as you like.\u00a0 You could, for example, write:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>RT @yourfriend Hey, pass this on #coolretweets<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>How any old user is supposed to work out these things I&#8217;m not sure.\u00a0 Probably people say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@magicroundabout What&#8217;s all these # things flying around?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>and I reply<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@friend Ah, that&#8217;ll be #hashtags then: http:\/\/hashtags.org\/<\/p><\/blockquote>\n",

Definitely buses.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway.<\/p>\n<p>Follow my revelation about rush hour last week, I decided that this week, when carrying my precious laptop between work and home, I would do something I&#8217;ve been meaning to for ages and get the bus.<\/p>\n<p>Buses, to me, seem to be one of those thing that have an inner circle.\u00a0 They&#8217;re like a cult.\u00a0 If you don&#8217;t understand them then you feel left out and like you&#8217;ll never be a part.\u00a0 (Probably a lot like cycling, and church!) And it took me some amount of overcoming my fears to find myself at a bus stop, awaiting the number 8, 54 or 55.<\/p>\n<p>You have to know the routes, and the fares.\u00a0 You have to have the right change.\u00a0 And, most importantly, you have to know when to get off.<\/p>\n<p>But, actually, it wasn&#8217;t all that bad at all.\u00a0 It helped that the drivers were much more helpful than in London (I should point out that I LIKE the bus system in London!!), happily advising on which fare to buy.\u00a0 And it helped that I&#8217;ve come to know West Swindon quite well &#8211; though why the buses take such a circuitous route I&#8217;ll never know.<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t get stuck in traffic, I got to sit and read a book and chill out for 20 mins.\u00a0 It was probably a bit slower than cycling and driving, and there&#8217;s the unknown wait time to be included, but I enjoyed that.\u00a0 I abanodoned myself to the fact that I was at the mercy of the system and actually had a good time.<\/p>\n<p>And, you know what, I&#8217;ll do it again!\u00a0 I have joined the cult of bus!<\/p>\n<p>P.S. I&#8217;m almost a bus spotter in Swindon.\u00a0 I think it&#8217;s quite cute that Thamesdown Transport name all their buses things like &#8220;Sultan&#8221;, &#8220;Lightning&#8221;, &#8220;St Agatha&#8221;, and Hercules (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thamesdown-transport.co.uk\/latest\/scripts\/fleet_pub.asp\">list here<\/a>, if you&#8217;re really interested), and I should probably be keeping a list of those that I have seen&#8230;BUT, I should point out, I most definitely am not!<\/p>\n",

Definitely buses.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway.<\/p>\n<p>Follow my revelation about rush hour last week, I decided that this week, when carrying my precious laptop between work and home, I would do something I&#8217;ve been meaning to for ages and get the bus.<\/p>\n<p>Buses, to me, seem to be one of those thing that have an inner circle.\u00a0 They&#8217;re like a cult.\u00a0 If you don&#8217;t understand them then you feel left out and like you&#8217;ll never be a part.\u00a0 (Probably a lot like cycling, and church!) And it took me some amount of overcoming my fears to find myself at a bus stop, awaiting the number 8, 54 or 55.<\/p>\n<p>You have to know the routes, and the fares.\u00a0 You have to have the right change.\u00a0 And, most importantly, you have to know when to get off.<\/p>\n<p>But, actually, it wasn&#8217;t all that bad at all.\u00a0 It helped that the drivers were much more helpful than in London (I should point out that I LIKE the bus system in London!!), happily advising on which fare to buy.\u00a0 And it helped that I&#8217;ve come to know West Swindon quite well &#8211; though why the buses take such a circuitous route I&#8217;ll never know.<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t get stuck in traffic, I got to sit and read a book and chill out for 20 mins.\u00a0 It was probably a bit slower than cycling and driving, and there&#8217;s the unknown wait time to be included, but I enjoyed that.\u00a0 I abanodoned myself to the fact that I was at the mercy of the system and actually had a good time.<\/p>\n<p>And, you know what, I&#8217;ll do it again!\u00a0 I have joined the cult of bus!<\/p>\n<p>P.S. I&#8217;m almost a bus spotter in Swindon.\u00a0 I think it&#8217;s quite cute that Thamesdown Transport name all their buses things like &#8220;Sultan&#8221;, &#8220;Lightning&#8221;, &#8220;St Agatha&#8221;, and Hercules (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thamesdown-transport.co.uk\/latest\/scripts\/fleet_pub.asp\">list here<\/a>, if you&#8217;re really interested), and I should probably be keeping a list of those that I have seen&#8230;BUT, I should point out, I most definitely am not!<\/p>\n",
