                "rendered": "<p>OK, so I should make it clear at this point that, in my head at least, if not on paper, &#8220;52 songs&#8221; is a concept, not a target.  I never thought I&#8217;d learn 52 songs this year, but the idea was to learn SOME pop songs this year, the 52 Songs concept was to give me some discipline to do it, and that&#8217;s what I will continue to do!<\/p>\n<p>So, I considered choosing another song to learn but with the bad and busy week I&#8217;ve had I decided to drop it and learn the last two verses of &#8220;Nothing Ever Happens&#8221;.  I now know all the words and just need to learn the musical bridge before verse 4.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a cool song.  I don&#8217;t know for sure, but I guess it&#8217;s about how we all go about doing our business and work and shopping and stuff, we all have our routines.  But nothing really ever happens, and &#8220;we&#8217;ll all be lonely tonight, and lonely tomorrow.  We don&#8217;t achieve anything by just plodding through a working, consumerist, selfish life.<\/p>\n<p>It reminds me of a book in the Bible called &#8220;Ecclesiastes&#8221;, which starts off:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cUtterly meaningless!  <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Everything is meaningless.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>What does man gain from all his labour  <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>at which he toils under the sun?\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The point of life is not just to wake up and follow the same old routine every day.  That&#8217;s not life.  That&#8217;s missing the point!<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s something else I read about life recently.  This is Tom Wright, the Bishop of Durham, writing about the time when Jesus tells us to love our enemies, and gives examples of how to do this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Think of the best thing you can do for the worst person, and go ahead and do it.  Think of what you&#8217;d really like someone to do for you, and do it for them.  Think of the people to whom you are tempted to be nasty, and lavish generosity on them instead.  These instructions have a fresh, springlike quality.  They are all about new life bursting out energetically, like flowers growing through concrete and startling everyone with their colour and vigour&#8230;Imagine if even a few people around you took Jesus seriously and lived like that.  Life would be exuberant, different, astonishing.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Doesn&#8217;t that sound exciting?!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, this is a huge challenge for us, especially in our me-first culture.  It&#8217;s a huge challenge for me personally &#8211; it sounds massively exciting living that way, but I find it incredibly hard too.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fortunate to have some incredibly loving and generous people around me in the shape of my close friends and family.  They are all different and astonishing in the ways that they love others and live life to the full, and  I&#8217;m hugely thankful for them.<\/p>\n<p>In other places, I don&#8217;t see much of this kind of life at all.  I hardly know my neighbours for example.  I hope that as the weather improves and we start chatting over the fences and in the street, we will get to know them and have opportunities to be generous towards them.<\/p>\n<p>Del Amitri don&#8217;t give suggestions as to how to get out, meet people and find an exuberant life (I like the word exuberant &#8211; I must use it more!).  But they make us think &#8211; what are we doing here?  How can we make life worth living?<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n<p>P.S. I got a little carried away there &#8211; I suspect next week&#8217;s song won&#8217;t be anywhere near as interesting!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>OK, so I should make it clear at this point that, in my head at least, if not on paper, &#8220;52 songs&#8221; is a concept, not a target.  I never thought I&#8217;d learn 52 songs this year, but the idea was to learn SOME pop songs this year, the 52 Songs concept was to give me some discipline to do it, and that&#8217;s what I will continue to do!<\/p>\n<p>So, I considered choosing another song to learn but with the bad and busy week I&#8217;ve had I decided to drop it and learn the last two verses of &#8220;Nothing Ever Happens&#8221;.  I now know all the words and just need to learn the musical bridge before verse 4.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a cool song.  I don&#8217;t know for sure, but I guess it&#8217;s about how we all go about doing our business and work and shopping and stuff, we all have our routines.  But nothing really ever happens, and &#8220;we&#8217;ll all be lonely tonight, and lonely tomorrow.  We don&#8217;t achieve anything by just plodding through a working, consumerist, selfish life.<\/p>\n<p>It reminds me of a book in the Bible called &#8220;Ecclesiastes&#8221;, which starts off:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cUtterly meaningless!  <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Everything is meaningless.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>What does man gain from all his labour  <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>at which he toils under the sun?\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The point of life is not just to wake up and follow the same old routine every day.  That&#8217;s not life.  That&#8217;s missing the point!<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s something else I read about life recently.  This is Tom Wright, the Bishop of Durham, writing about the time when Jesus tells us to love our enemies, and gives examples of how to do this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Think of the best thing you can do for the worst person, and go ahead and do it.  Think of what you&#8217;d really like someone to do for you, and do it for them.  Think of the people to whom you are tempted to be nasty, and lavish generosity on them instead.  These instructions have a fresh, springlike quality.  They are all about new life bursting out energetically, like flowers growing through concrete and startling everyone with their colour and vigour&#8230;Imagine if even a few people around you took Jesus seriously and lived like that.  Life would be exuberant, different, astonishing.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Doesn&#8217;t that sound exciting?!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, this is a huge challenge for us, especially in our me-first culture.  It&#8217;s a huge challenge for me personally &#8211; it sounds massively exciting living that way, but I find it incredibly hard too.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fortunate to have some incredibly loving and generous people around me in the shape of my close friends and family.  They are all different and astonishing in the ways that they love others and live life to the full, and  I&#8217;m hugely thankful for them.<\/p>\n<p>In other places, I don&#8217;t see much of this kind of life at all.  I hardly know my neighbours for example.  I hope that as the weather improves and we start chatting over the fences and in the street, we will get to know them and have opportunities to be generous towards them.<\/p>\n<p>Del Amitri don&#8217;t give suggestions as to how to get out, meet people and find an exuberant life (I like the word exuberant &#8211; I must use it more!).  But they make us think &#8211; what are we doing here?  How can we make life worth living?<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n<p>P.S. I got a little carried away there &#8211; I suspect next week&#8217;s song won&#8217;t be anywhere near as interesting!<\/p>\n",

I need to get all the right things to the right places. This means I:<\/p>\n<p>1) Wake up<br \/>2) Have breakfast and stuff and put cycling gear on.<br \/>3) Pack clean clothes (underwear and shirt) &#8211; my jumper and jeans\/trousers having previously been taken there and stored in a locker.<br \/>4) Remember to pack gadgets (phones, organiser, etc) in bag.<br \/>5) Remember to pack security pass in bag.<br \/>6) Remember to take keys.<br \/>7) Pack lunch\/snacks in bag.<br \/>8) Get keys, wallet and change from my &#8220;home&#8221; jeans.<br \/>9) Get bike from shed.<br \/>10) Put helmet, gloves, shoes, jacket, etc on.<br \/>11) Go to work.<\/p>\n<p>Then&#8230;at work:<br \/>1) Lock bike<br \/>2) Put lights in bag<br \/>3) Put computer in bag<br \/>4) Put saddle pack in bag<br \/>5) Take helmet and gloves off<br \/>6) Enter office.<br \/>7) Shower and change, taking trousers and jumper out of the locker and replacing them with bike stuff.<br \/>8) Remembering to take keys and computer into the office.<\/p>\n<p>And then reverse the whole process when I get home.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not simple and, inevitably, goes wrong occasionally.  Usually something simple like leaving my keys in my jeans or putting my lights in the wrong place when I get to the office.  It&#8217;s such a complicated routine that the slightest little thing throws me and risks the whole thing imploding a mess of clothing, gadgets and bike stuff.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I made a slightly more embarassing boo boo, which I blame fairly an squarely on not having done the routine for a week&#8230;I forgot to pack a shirt!!!  Which left me with the tricky dilemma of choosing between wearing a jumper with no shirt underneath &#8211; and hoping nobody notices.  Or wearing a long-sleeved, and not particularly attractive-looking, orange and black cycle jersey all day under the jumper &#8211; and hoping nobody notices.<\/p>\n<p>What would YOU do?<\/p>\n",

Which left me with the tricky dilemma of choosing between wearing a jumper with no shirt underneath &#8211; and hoping nobody notices.

They do this a couple of times a year and the idea is that we believe God wishes, in some cases, to heal us, and, in all cases, to bring us wholeness.<\/p>\n<p>And so I had Sally and one of the Elders pray for me in person.<\/p>\n<p>Talking about being prayed for is weird, mostly because spiritual things aren&#8217;t easy to describe in words.  In some cases you don&#8217;t feel anything when you&#8217;re being prayed for.  In other cases you will get a sense of peace, or happiness.  Sometimes there is a physical sensation of some sort.  And at other times more unusual things happen &#8211; for example, I&#8217;ve seen people fall over, semi-conscious, kinda like shutting down physically so that God can work on the spiritual stuff &#8211; forced meditation I guess!<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, in this case not much seemed to happen.  Does that mean that nothing has actually happened?  No! Not really.  I believe that whenever we speak to God something happens &#8211; he hears us, understands us, and though we may not see, hear, or feel the effects, we have made a request and had it heard.  A bit like sending a letter to Santa &#8211; nothing happens when you send the letter, but you will (eventually, if you&#8217;re a good boy\/girl) get some kind of response!<\/p>\n<p>And on that Sunday certain things started moving.  Later, at home, I prayed and had my own little conversation with God.  Again, it&#8217;s hard to explain how but I felt that God &#8220;spoke&#8221; to me &#8211; not in words as such, but a message arrived in my mind or my spirit or something &#8211; and he said that I could &#8220;start thinking again&#8221;.  Certain things, in my head, have kinda been on hold while all this illness and injury has been ongoing.  God was telling me that I could take those things off hold.<\/p>\n<p>That was a bit odd as I didn&#8217;t feel any dramatic improvement at that point.<\/p>\n<p>However &#8211; in the morning, on Monday, I felt like a different person!  Really, overnight the pain had gone from being a painful, broken, sort of pain, to being a tired, weary, will-be-better-soon sort of pain.  Psychologically I felt MUCH stronger too.  It really was a remarkable change &#8211; I suddenly felt like me again.  Oh, and I was really hungry!!  My appetite increased substantially!<\/p>\n<p>Following that I&#8217;ve had a steady week &#8211; the pain has come and gone a bit, but it&#8217;s not felt harsh and difficult, it&#8217;s continued to feel like recovery rather than injury.  I&#8217;ve been laughing, smiling, joking, and enjoying myself.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not about to enter into a discourse on the nature of prayer and answers to prayer here &#8211; maybe another time &#8211; I just want to record my experience and give thanks for it.  I&#8217;m happy for people to dismiss this as coincidence, or psychology, or a perfectly normal physical recovery.  But I know that something slightly more than that has happened.  As William Temple once said: &#8220;When I pray, coincidences happen, and when I don&#8217;t, they don&#8217;t.&#8221;<\/p>\n",

They do this a couple of times a year and the idea is that we believe God wishes, in some cases, to heal us, and, in all cases, to bring us wholeness.<\/p>\n<p>And so I had Sally and one of the Elders pray for me in person.<\/p>\n<p>Talking about being prayed for is weird, mostly because spiritual things aren&#8217;t easy to describe in words.  In some cases you don&#8217;t feel anything when you&#8217;re being prayed for.  In other cases you will get a sense of peace, or happiness.  Sometimes there is a physical sensation of some sort.  And at other times more unusual things happen &#8211; for example, I&#8217;ve seen people fall over, semi-conscious, kinda like shutting down physically so that God can work on the spiritual stuff &#8211; forced meditation I guess!<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, in this case not much seemed to happen.  Does that mean that nothing has actually happened?  No! Not really.  I believe that whenever we speak to God something happens &#8211; he hears us, understands us, and though we may not see, hear, or feel the effects, we have made a request and had it heard.  A bit like sending a letter to Santa &#8211; nothing happens when you send the letter, but you will (eventually, if you&#8217;re a good boy\/girl) get some kind of response!<\/p>\n<p>And on that Sunday certain things started moving.  Later, at home, I prayed and had my own little conversation with God.  Again, it&#8217;s hard to explain how but I felt that God &#8220;spoke&#8221; to me &#8211; not in words as such, but a message arrived in my mind or my spirit or something &#8211; and he said that I could &#8220;start thinking again&#8221;.  Certain things, in my head, have kinda been on hold while all this illness and injury has been ongoing.  God was telling me that I could take those things off hold.<\/p>\n<p>That was a bit odd as I didn&#8217;t feel any dramatic improvement at that point.<\/p>\n<p>However &#8211; in the morning, on Monday, I felt like a different person!  Really, overnight the pain had gone from being a painful, broken, sort of pain, to being a tired, weary, will-be-better-soon sort of pain.  Psychologically I felt MUCH stronger too.  It really was a remarkable change &#8211; I suddenly felt like me again.  Oh, and I was really hungry!!  My appetite increased substantially!<\/p>\n<p>Following that I&#8217;ve had a steady week &#8211; the pain has come and gone a bit, but it&#8217;s not felt harsh and difficult, it&#8217;s continued to feel like recovery rather than injury.  I&#8217;ve been laughing, smiling, joking, and enjoying myself.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not about to enter into a discourse on the nature of prayer and answers to prayer here &#8211; maybe another time &#8211; I just want to record my experience and give thanks for it.  I&#8217;m happy for people to dismiss this as coincidence, or psychology, or a perfectly normal physical recovery.  But I know that something slightly more than that has happened.  As William Temple once said: &#8220;When I pray, coincidences happen, and when I don&#8217;t, they don&#8217;t.&#8221;<\/p>\n",

Did my little run to Cricklade and back in under an hour, which is OK.  It was one of those annoying days where the wind seemed to come from all directions.  I did an out-and-back ride, which should mean I only feel a headwind half the time, but I felt it for the WHOLE ride.  How does that happen?<\/p>\n<p>Last time I did this little jaunt I did my back in, so it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how I feel tomorrow.  Lots of stretching before bed tonight.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Few Nice Things<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m noticing lots of cool things about my bike!  They didn&#8217;t give me a manual you know.  They seem to assume that if you&#8217;re buying a proper road bike then you must know what you&#8217;re doing.  But dual-pivot caliper brakes, Sora gear shifters, and Tiagra rear mechs (d\u00e9railleurs to the rest of us), are, though mostly familiar, a little bit alien in some respects.<\/p>\n<p>One of the nice things about Fuzzy is that he&#8217;s got lots of neat little design features that cheaper bikes don&#8217;t have.  Things that make sense to have.   Here&#8217;s a few:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quick releases.  I know these are standard but I&#8217;m still made happy by the fact that I can whip a wheel off in seconds with no tools.  Genius!<\/li>\n<li>Hex-key bolts&#8230;everywhere.  My sister got me a multi-tool for my birthday last year, but it was pretty useless on the Raleigh as everything was screws and bolts.  But pretty much everything on Fuzzy is held tight by bolts that I can loosen and tighten with hex keys.  Suddenly my multi-tool is all I need!<\/li>\n<li>Gear adjustments on the down tube.  I wanted to adjust my front d\u00e9railleur today and couldn&#8217;t find the screw thing to do it with.  Turns out it&#8217;s on the down tube.  Not REALLY sure why but you can certainly make the adjustment while you&#8217;re riding, which is pretty cool.<\/li>\n<li>Dual-pivot brakes.  Not sure why these are so good, but they&#8217;re pretty solid and seem to give even braking on both sides no matter what you do to them.<\/li>\n<li>Strength.  All the components are tough.  I know this &#8216;cos I fell of and damaged more of me than of the bike!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find plenty more as time goes on.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Photo<\/span><\/p>\n<p>By the way, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve posted it here yet, so here&#8217;s a photo of Fuzzy the Felt &#8211; just to prove that I DO own a nice road bike now:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh4.google.com\/ross.wintle\/R79WS011XfI\/AAAAAAAAB0s\/uATCuL3_jCY\/s800\/IMG_0300.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.google.com\/ross.wintle\/R79WS011XfI\/AAAAAAAAB0s\/uATCuL3_jCY\/s800\/IMG_0300.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>I&#8217;m not so sure about the MTB-style mudguards.  But, annoyingly, there&#8217;s no fixings for proper mudguards on the bike.  I may try out race blades one day.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A-nnoying<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In other bike news, I got a bit fed up with my local bike shop today.  I took the bike in yesterday for its six-week\/hundred mile free service and it came back with the transmission (chain and gears) crunching and grinding.  The brakes have been tightened and they&#8217;ve true&#8217;d up the rear wheel, which was nice of them.  But they&#8217;ve messed up derailleur settings before.  Grrrr.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Rant<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Why?  Why why?  WHY?  Why do people who make roads put 3-foot-wide drain covers about three feet from the edge of the road?  This is exactly the point at which a cyclist riding in &#8220;primary position&#8221; will need to cycle over it.  I&#8217;ve passed many of these today.  Options for a cyclist approaching one are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dive in towards the kerb &#8211; more difficult but safer if you can do it<\/li>\n<li>Dive OUT towards the middle of the road &#8211; easier but more liable to upset motorists and\/or get you knocked off the road entirely<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There must be a better way!<\/p>\n<p>And finally I&#8217;d like to end on&#8230;<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A High Note<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/><\/span><\/span><\/span>I&#8217;m really enjoying cycling again. After a long spell of illness and injury I feel like I&#8217;m back and it&#8217;s great to be in the saddle with the countryside rushing by, wind in my face, heart racing, watching the miles tick by.  I love it.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Ride<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Out on the bike today for a proper (i.e. non-commute) ride.  Did my little run to Cricklade and back in under an hour, which is OK.  It was one of those annoying days where the wind seemed to come from all directions.  I did an out-and-back ride, which should mean I only feel a headwind half the time, but I felt it for the WHOLE ride.  How does that happen?<\/p>\n<p>Last time I did this little jaunt I did my back in, so it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how I feel tomorrow.  Lots of stretching before bed tonight.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Few Nice Things<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m noticing lots of cool things about my bike!  They didn&#8217;t give me a manual you know.  They seem to assume that if you&#8217;re buying a proper road bike then you must know what you&#8217;re doing.  But dual-pivot caliper brakes, Sora gear shifters, and Tiagra rear mechs (d\u00e9railleurs to the rest of us), are, though mostly familiar, a little bit alien in some respects.<\/p>\n<p>One of the nice things about Fuzzy is that he&#8217;s got lots of neat little design features that cheaper bikes don&#8217;t have.  Things that make sense to have.   Here&#8217;s a few:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quick releases.  I know these are standard but I&#8217;m still made happy by the fact that I can whip a wheel off in seconds with no tools.  Genius!<\/li>\n<li>Hex-key bolts&#8230;everywhere.  My sister got me a multi-tool for my birthday last year, but it was pretty useless on the Raleigh as everything was screws and bolts.  But pretty much everything on Fuzzy is held tight by bolts that I can loosen and tighten with hex keys.  Suddenly my multi-tool is all I need!<\/li>\n<li>Gear adjustments on the down tube.  I wanted to adjust my front d\u00e9railleur today and couldn&#8217;t find the screw thing to do it with.  Turns out it&#8217;s on the down tube.  Not REALLY sure why but you can certainly make the adjustment while you&#8217;re riding, which is pretty cool.<\/li>\n<li>Dual-pivot brakes.  Not sure why these are so good, but they&#8217;re pretty solid and seem to give even braking on both sides no matter what you do to them.<\/li>\n<li>Strength.  All the components are tough.  I know this &#8216;cos I fell of and damaged more of me than of the bike!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find plenty more as time goes on.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Photo<\/span><\/p>\n<p>By the way, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve posted it here yet, so here&#8217;s a photo of Fuzzy the Felt &#8211; just to prove that I DO own a nice road bike now:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh4.google.com\/ross.wintle\/R79WS011XfI\/AAAAAAAAB0s\/uATCuL3_jCY\/s800\/IMG_0300.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.google.com\/ross.wintle\/R79WS011XfI\/AAAAAAAAB0s\/uATCuL3_jCY\/s800\/IMG_0300.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>I&#8217;m not so sure about the MTB-style mudguards.  But, annoyingly, there&#8217;s no fixings for proper mudguards on the bike.  I may try out race blades one day.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A-nnoying<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In other bike news, I got a bit fed up with my local bike shop today.  I took the bike in yesterday for its six-week\/hundred mile free service and it came back with the transmission (chain and gears) crunching and grinding.  The brakes have been tightened and they&#8217;ve true&#8217;d up the rear wheel, which was nice of them.  But they&#8217;ve messed up derailleur settings before.  Grrrr.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Rant<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Why?  Why why?  WHY?  Why do people who make roads put 3-foot-wide drain covers about three feet from the edge of the road?  This is exactly the point at which a cyclist riding in &#8220;primary position&#8221; will need to cycle over it.  I&#8217;ve passed many of these today.  Options for a cyclist approaching one are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dive in towards the kerb &#8211; more difficult but safer if you can do it<\/li>\n<li>Dive OUT towards the middle of the road &#8211; easier but more liable to upset motorists and\/or get you knocked off the road entirely<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There must be a better way!<\/p>\n<p>And finally I&#8217;d like to end on&#8230;<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A High Note<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/><\/span><\/span><\/span>I&#8217;m really enjoying cycling again. After a long spell of illness and injury I feel like I&#8217;m back and it&#8217;s great to be in the saddle with the countryside rushing by, wind in my face, heart racing, watching the miles tick by.  I love it.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n",

I think they even sold kitchen sinks!<\/p>\n<p>And yet, despite the millions of items on show, there was very little I wanted.  I mean &#8211; there was actually stuff I needed there but most of it just not quite right, slightly too low quality, too cheap and tacky, or&#8230;something.<\/p>\n<p>Sally and I have occasionally popped to Trago&#8217;s (which is like the range but about 8 times bigger&#8230;I exaggerate not!) when down in Devon and experienced the same thing.  We usually go with a long list of things, and very rarely bring back even half of them.  It just seems like a better idea to buy it somewhere else.<\/p>\n<p>I bought a few things in The Range.  I will probably go back, but more for the wonder and awe of seeing such a vast range of products under one roof, than to actually buy anything of any real value.<\/p>\n",

I saw paintings, frames, mirrors, DIY goods, car maintenance kit, bike gear, craft supplies, office stationary, food, lighting, furniture, gardening items, fabric and sewing stuff, outdoor and camping equipment, leisure and sports things.  I think they even sold kitchen sinks!<\/p>\n<p>And yet, despite the millions of items on show, there was very little I wanted.  I mean &#8211; there was actually stuff I needed there but most of it just not quite right, slightly too low quality, too cheap and tacky, or&#8230;something.<\/p>\n<p>Sally and I have occasionally popped to Trago&#8217;s (which is like the range but about 8 times bigger&#8230;I exaggerate not!) when down in Devon and experienced the same thing.  We usually go with a long list of things, and very rarely bring back even half of them.  It just seems like a better idea to buy it somewhere else.<\/p>\n<p>I bought a few things in The Range.  I will probably go back, but more for the wonder and awe of seeing such a vast range of products under one roof, than to actually buy anything of any real value.<\/p>\n",
