I&#8217;ve been chatting with other speakers in the Speaker&#8217;s Slack Channel and I popped in and asked for tips:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Who has super speaker tips? Assume nothing. I want all the basics.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I gave a couple of my own for starters:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Quit All Your Apps when presenting (other than your presenting app)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Mute all notifications! Mac users can enable Do Not Disturb mode if you click the notification centre &#8211; top right &#8211; and scroll up to the toggle, or just Alt-Click the notification centre icon in the menu bar. There&#8217;s probably a Windows equivalent.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a tip that is WordCamp London venue-specific:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Also, if you&#8217;re speaking in track A, the Great Hall, it sounds stupid but there&#8217;s a HUGE clock on the back wall and one year it was about 4 minutes slow. Take note of if this clock is accurate cos you don&#8217;t want to look at it and think you&#8217;ve got lots of time that you haven&#8217;t!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>But this probably translates into more of a general &#8220;Check out your environment beforehand. Stand on the stage. Find out what you will be looking at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/danmaby\">Dan Maby<\/a> had a few useful nuggets:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I use Owly to keep my mac awake too https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/owly-prevent-display-sleep\/id882812218?mt=12<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Drink water<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>(which I followed with &#8220;but not too much water!&#8221;)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Breath<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Pause, giving yourself a second to catch up with yourself is good for everyone<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Pause Dropbox\/Google Drive\/One Drive etc.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Make sure your Google Slides are available off-line<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tnash\">Tim Nash<\/a> is super-experienced. And his experience suggests that the following are good ideas:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Don&#8217;t fall of the stage<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Don&#8217;t panic, if words are coming out of your mouth its probably ok<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Don&#8217;t open the file called passwords.txt<\/p><p><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Clean and hide your desktop if you like to use that space as a general place to dump files. Inevitably you will minimise your presentation and you never know what files are there.<\/p><p><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I followed up with my own tip: Even if it means shoving everything into a &#8220;Things that were on my desktop&#8221; folder temporarily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When you&#8217;re on stage, if you can, get away from the lectern, it both obscures you but also will make you hunch which will make it harder to project. It sometimes feels safe behind there but it really is worth trying to avoid that space entirely<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/karmatosed\">Tammie Lister<\/a>, who is also a very experienced speaker, countered this and made her own wise suggestions too:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Standing by lectern is OK. For those of us that need notes and have poor eyesight or reading hurdles it&#8217;s OK. Just be comfortable.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Turn off your wifi, seriously stop doing live demos &#8211; if wifi is off you can&#8217;t get notifications<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Don&#8217;t focus on one person, move your eyes over everyone.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Which prompted a related, WordPress-specific tech tip from me:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>If you&#8217;re demoing WordPress locally, you can use this to speed it up and stop network stuff happening too: https:\/\/github.com\/norcross\/airplane-mode<br><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/swissspidy\">Pascal Birchler<\/a> suggests you:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Arrive on time for your talk <\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Which got some follow ups:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Early even!<br><\/p><p>And sit in the audience if you can for a talk in your track, if you not been in the room before. It will give you a rough idea of what they the audience can see\/hear.<\/p><cite>Tim Nash<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Yes. Definitely scout the room. Have a chat with the AV\/sound people in a break before your talk if you can. They&#8217;re super helpful.<\/p><cite>Ross Wintle<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There were some lightning-talk specific tips and tips on Q&amp;A&#8217;s afterwards too:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Perhaps a bit late and very much my take, but front load your talk, you have a very short amount of time, so don&#8217;t spend to long talking about yourself, or your background, so if you have slides like about you put them at the end, so you can say I was &lt;whoever you are> come find me afterwards. Similarly keep resources to the end, as otherwise folks will start trying to find links to sites etc, while your talking and miss like half the talk<br><\/p><p>I think more so for a lightning talk its all about giving folks things to go away and think and research. It&#8217;s also one of the few times, where its OK to be a little fast paced just don&#8217;t trip over yourself.<\/p><p>Also don&#8217;t be afraid to say, I will take questions at the end<\/p><cite>Tim Nash<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>For lightning talks, leverage the Happiness Bar (the &#8220;tech support zone&#8221;  of a WordCamp) heavily. Only talk about the important things, and at the end of your talk say &#8220;I&#8217;m going to the Happiness Bar right now to answer any more questions&#8221;<\/p><cite>Topher DeRosia<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;, is the most powerful answer to a question ever, don&#8217;t be afraid to say it, no one will think less of you. If anything the opposite, I am much more likely to respect a speaker, who when asked a question they don&#8217;t know the answer to says I don&#8217;t know, but if you remind me later I might be able to find out.<\/p><cite>Tim Nash<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, as Tim Nash says<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Have fun!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I&#8217;m speaking at <a href=\"https:\/\/2019.london.wordcamp.org\/\">WordCamp London<\/a> on Sunday. And I ALWAYS learn something new when public speaking. I&#8217;ve been chatting with other speakers in the Speaker&#8217;s Slack Channel and I popped in and asked for tips:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Who has super speaker tips? Assume nothing. I want all the basics.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I gave a couple of my own for starters:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Quit All Your Apps when presenting (other than your presenting app)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Mute all notifications! Mac users can enable Do Not Disturb mode if you click the notification centre &#8211; top right &#8211; and scroll up to the toggle, or just Alt-Click the notification centre icon in the menu bar. There&#8217;s probably a Windows equivalent.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a tip that is WordCamp London venue-specific:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Also, if you&#8217;re speaking in track A, the Great Hall, it sounds stupid but there&#8217;s a HUGE clock on the back wall and one year it was about 4 minutes slow. Take note of if this clock is accurate cos you don&#8217;t want to look at it and think you&#8217;ve got lots of time that you haven&#8217;t!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>But this probably translates into more of a general &#8220;Check out your environment beforehand. Stand on the stage. Find out what you will be looking at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/danmaby\">Dan Maby<\/a> had a few useful nuggets:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I use Owly to keep my mac awake too https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/owly-prevent-display-sleep\/id882812218?mt=12<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Drink water<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>(which I followed with &#8220;but not too much water!&#8221;)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Breath<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Pause, giving yourself a second to catch up with yourself is good for everyone<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Pause Dropbox\/Google Drive\/One Drive etc.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Make sure your Google Slides are available off-line<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tnash\">Tim Nash<\/a> is super-experienced. And his experience suggests that the following are good ideas:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Don&#8217;t fall of the stage<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Don&#8217;t panic, if words are coming out of your mouth its probably ok<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Don&#8217;t open the file called passwords.txt<\/p><p><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Clean and hide your desktop if you like to use that space as a general place to dump files. Inevitably you will minimise your presentation and you never know what files are there.<\/p><p><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I followed up with my own tip: Even if it means shoving everything into a &#8220;Things that were on my desktop&#8221; folder temporarily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When you&#8217;re on stage, if you can, get away from the lectern, it both obscures you but also will make you hunch which will make it harder to project. It sometimes feels safe behind there but it really is worth trying to avoid that space entirely<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/karmatosed\">Tammie Lister<\/a>, who is also a very experienced speaker, countered this and made her own wise suggestions too:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Standing by lectern is OK. For those of us that need notes and have poor eyesight or reading hurdles it&#8217;s OK. Just be comfortable.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Turn off your wifi, seriously stop doing live demos &#8211; if wifi is off you can&#8217;t get notifications<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Don&#8217;t focus on one person, move your eyes over everyone.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Which prompted a related, WordPress-specific tech tip from me:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>If you&#8217;re demoing WordPress locally, you can use this to speed it up and stop network stuff happening too: https:\/\/github.com\/norcross\/airplane-mode<br><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/swissspidy\">Pascal Birchler<\/a> suggests you:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Arrive on time for your talk <\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Which got some follow ups:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Early even!<br><\/p><p>And sit in the audience if you can for a talk in your track, if you not been in the room before. It will give you a rough idea of what they the audience can see\/hear.<\/p><cite>Tim Nash<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Yes. Definitely scout the room. Have a chat with the AV\/sound people in a break before your talk if you can. They&#8217;re super helpful.<\/p><cite>Ross Wintle<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There were some lightning-talk specific tips and tips on Q&amp;A&#8217;s afterwards too:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Perhaps a bit late and very much my take, but front load your talk, you have a very short amount of time, so don&#8217;t spend to long talking about yourself, or your background, so if you have slides like about you put them at the end, so you can say I was &lt;whoever you are> come find me afterwards. Similarly keep resources to the end, as otherwise folks will start trying to find links to sites etc, while your talking and miss like half the talk<br><\/p><p>I think more so for a lightning talk its all about giving folks things to go away and think and research. It&#8217;s also one of the few times, where its OK to be a little fast paced just don&#8217;t trip over yourself.<\/p><p>Also don&#8217;t be afraid to say, I will take questions at the end<\/p><cite>Tim Nash<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>For lightning talks, leverage the Happiness Bar (the &#8220;tech support zone&#8221;  of a WordCamp) heavily. Only talk about the important things, and at the end of your talk say &#8220;I&#8217;m going to the Happiness Bar right now to answer any more questions&#8221;<\/p><cite>Topher DeRosia<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;, is the most powerful answer to a question ever, don&#8217;t be afraid to say it, no one will think less of you. If anything the opposite, I am much more likely to respect a speaker, who when asked a question they don&#8217;t know the answer to says I don&#8217;t know, but if you remind me later I might be able to find out.<\/p><cite>Tim Nash<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, as Tim Nash says<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Have fun!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n",

You have to tell it to collect data for a specific petition. It does not collect data for all petitions.<\/li><li>For each petition, the system collects the count data every 5 minutes (if it can! the goverenment&#8217;s system has been struggling this week)<\/li><li>I only store the global count and a &#8220;delta&#8221; &#8211; the different between the current point and the precious point, to get an idea of growth rate<\/li><li>The delta&#8217;s are a bit rubbish. I should average them out over the time since the last count was collected.

        "content": "\n<p>So my government petition tracker has been pretty heavily used in the last couple of days. I thought it was worth putting together a little article on how it works and how it&#8217;s handling being (a little bit) busy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How it&#8217;s made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The tool is built with Laravel on PHP and MySQL<\/li><li>It has no login or back-end as such<\/li><li>It uses the government petition site&#8217;s JSON API: you can stick &#8216;.json&#8217; on the end of a URL and get a snapshot of the current count and the current counts by geographic region<\/li><li>The system only collects data for petitions it knows about. You have to tell it to collect data for a specific petition. It does not collect data for all petitions.<\/li><li>For each petition, the system collects the count data every 5 minutes (if it can! the goverenment&#8217;s system has been struggling this week)<\/li><li>I only store the global count and a &#8220;delta&#8221; &#8211; the different between the current point and the precious point, to get an idea of growth rate<\/li><li>The delta&#8217;s are a bit rubbish. I should average them out over the time since the last count was collected. It&#8217;s on my list!<\/li><li>It runs on a $10 Digital Ocean droplet\/VPS alongside a few other side projects of mine.<\/li><li>I deploy using Git and <a href=\"https:\/\/forge.laravel.com\/\">Laravel Forge<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How&#8217;s it doing?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, unlike the government site, it has stayed up! And it&#8217;s been performing fine. It&#8217;s not had HUGE traffic, but&#8230;well&#8230;here&#8217;s some stats. Bear in mind that I use <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/\">my own very simple privacy-aware analytics<\/a>, so numbers are helpful but won&#8217;t be the kind of super-accurate stuff you get from more sophisticated analytics tools:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The petition tracker has had 22,500 page views in the last 24 hours (to 09:45 on Friday 22nd)<\/li><li>It&#8217;s only had 30,100 page views in the last year, so 75% of the year&#8217;s traffic has been in the last 24 hours.<\/li><li>The server peaked at 36.14% CPU and has averaged about 15% throughout the day<\/li><li>Memory usage is pretty flat<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"677\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-09.50.50-1024x677.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4706\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-09.50.50-1024x677.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-09.50.50-300x198.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-09.50.50-768x507.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Screenshot-2019-03-22-at-09.50.50.png 1704w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Charts of server utilisation over last 24 hours<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And this despite me not really having any caching in place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, so I&#8217;m getting 1,000&#8217;s views per day rather than per minute, but I&#8217;m pretty happy with this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though I am a bit scared that a retweet from the <del>wrong<\/del>right person could take the thing down!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s see how today goes!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p><strong>Update August 2019<\/strong>: Another <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/petitions\/269157\">petition about proroguing\/suspending parliament<\/a> has been taking off and got 1,000,000 signatures in a day! So I&#8217;ve updated this list with some resources related to that as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that many of the tools listed here have a 6-digit petition ID in the URL, so if you change that from 241584 to 269157 you&#8217;ll get the equivalent analysis\/data for the proroguing petition. Happy petitioning!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of years back I was intrigued by the seemingly-very-uniform growth of <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/archived\/petitions\/131215\">a large and fast-growing government petition<\/a>. The government&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/\">petitions site<\/a> gives you <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/archived\/petitions\/131215.json\">the data<\/a> in a quite usable form (called JSON) but it&#8217;s only an instantaneous snapshot of values. It doesn&#8217;t record the history of the petition&#8217;s growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I built <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/\">a little tool<\/a> to collect the number of signatures every 5 minutes and store it so I could <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/131215\">plot charts of growth<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now&#8230;you may have noticed that <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/petitions\/241584\">a little petition<\/a> has gone a bit &#8220;viral&#8221; in the last couple of days! So I kinda turn, temporarily, into petition data geek.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not just me that is <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/241584\">tracking it<\/a>. Various other people are doing interesting things with the data. So here&#8217;s a little list of Revoke Article 50 petition resources.

        "content": "\n<p><strong>Update August 2019<\/strong>: Another <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/petitions\/269157\">petition about proroguing\/suspending parliament<\/a> has been taking off and got 1,000,000 signatures in a day! So I&#8217;ve updated this list with some resources related to that as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that many of the tools listed here have a 6-digit petition ID in the URL, so if you change that from 241584 to 269157 you&#8217;ll get the equivalent analysis\/data for the proroguing petition. Happy petitioning!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of years back I was intrigued by the seemingly-very-uniform growth of <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/archived\/petitions\/131215\">a large and fast-growing government petition<\/a>. The government&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/\">petitions site<\/a> gives you <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/archived\/petitions\/131215.json\">the data<\/a> in a quite usable form (called JSON) but it&#8217;s only an instantaneous snapshot of values. It doesn&#8217;t record the history of the petition&#8217;s growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I built <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/\">a little tool<\/a> to collect the number of signatures every 5 minutes and store it so I could <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/131215\">plot charts of growth<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now&#8230;you may have noticed that <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/petitions\/241584\">a little petition<\/a> has gone a bit &#8220;viral&#8221; in the last couple of days! So I kinda turn, temporarily, into petition data geek.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not just me that is <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/241584\">tracking it<\/a>. Various other people are doing interesting things with the data. So here&#8217;s a little list of Revoke Article 50 petition resources. If you want to add yours then <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\">drop me a line<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tracking over time<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>My petition tracker (will track any petition you tell it to): <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/241584\">https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/241584<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/odileeds\">ODI Leeds<\/a> Tracker (seems to be a one-off for this petition): <a href=\"https:\/\/odileeds.org\/projects\/petitions\/241584\">https:\/\/odileeds.org\/projects\/petitions\/241584<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/livefrombrexit\"><\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/theosanderson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">Theo Sanderson<\/a> has made a simple tracker with a real-time counter too: <a href=\"https:\/\/splasho.com\/petitions\/index.php?petition=241584\">https:\/\/splasho.com\/petitions\/index.php?petition=241584<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/milliams\">Matt Williams<\/a>  has taken my data and made much better rate-of-change  (signatures-per-minute) charts from it and added some simple growth  predictions: <a href=\"http:\/\/petitionstats.eu\/\">http:\/\/petitionstats.eu\/<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jonty\/\">Jonty Wareing<\/a> has made a simple predictor of when the next million will be hit: <a href=\"https:\/\/predictition.jonty.now.sh\/\">https:\/\/predictition.jonty.now.sh\/<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/codekipple\">Carl Hughes<\/a> has made a Twitter bot that tweets out the number of signatures every 15 mins or so: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/revoke50bot\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/revoke50bot<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/milliams\"><\/a> (there are several of these now!)<\/li><li>&#8220;Ben&#8221; has <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRS-5ggYBN3OP47_vExFwhe4ALl2DdtpksIQgy-h7NxoVLyr3BP8jGWZg3JYKLai2Ma18cLDazujybj\/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true\">a tracking spreadsheet<\/a> he&#8217;s updating manually every now and then.

WHAT IS THIS?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been working on a little re-brand of my personal blog site. Here&#8217;s the low down on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What have you done?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, quite. I actually have no idea if this is a great idea or a terrible one. But I&#8217;ve removed the long-standing &#8220;Which Way Now&#8221; branding and made the whole thing much more &#8220;me&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve implemented a new theme that I&#8217;ve created from scratch. I&#8217;ve 100% embraced the fact that I&#8217;m not a designer and removed pretty much all the images (apart from those in posts) and added a geeky, mono-spaced font look that&#8217;s hopefully appealing to my core audience. And the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/\">homepage<\/a> has a fun section for those-who-know to try out with plenty of Easter eggs to find<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also tried to embrace modern web technologies &#8211; more about this in the &#8220;How?&#8221; section, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still need to re-work a lot of out of date pages and do a bit more work on presenting content and adding what I want in the navigation\/sidebar. The structure is\/will be somewhat inspired by <a href=\"http:\/\/jvns.ca\/blog\/2019\/02\/17\/organizing-this-blog-into-categories\/\">Julia Evans&#8217;s ideas<\/a> about categorising her blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other inspiration is from:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/changelog.com\/\">Changelog.com<\/a><\/li><li>My friend <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/keiron\">@keiron&#8217;s<\/a> &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.geekeryasaservice.co.uk\/\">Geekery as a Service<\/a>&#8220;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why have you done this?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I think my audience has changed &#8211; it&#8217;s more technical people now and less general folk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the things I write and the reasons I write have changed &#8211; it&#8217;s less of a life journal and more of a set of technical articles and stuff about technology and work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will sounds horribly vain, I know &#8211; when I started working freelance I set up <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/\">Oikos<\/a> as my business, but I was never sure if it would be more important to promote the business or to promote myself. Over the last few years it&#8217;s become evident that my personal &#8220;brand&#8221; is more important to my work, so I&#8217;m really focussing in on that with this change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to show that I could build my own theme for my own site, gain greater control over the structure of it, learn some new things, try some new things, and tinker with technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, I&#8217;m not a designer and I always had a sense that my personal site didn&#8217;t need to be image-heavy; why load a bunch of impersonal stock images or off-the-shelf icons that actually say nothing about me? So I&#8217;ve gone all in on the geeky coding theme and it&#8217;s super fast and light-weight as a result, with fun things for my core audience to play with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How did you make it?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s built with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>WordPress<\/li><li>Plain CSS (including flexbox)<\/li><li>A little plain vanilla, framework-free JavaScript (ES6 to be precise, might struggle on IE11)<\/li><li>My <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/oiko_s\/tree\/SUCSS\">own super-simple starter theme<\/a> based on <a href=\"http:\/\/underscores.me\/\">_s<\/a> (&#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/underscores.me\/\">underscores<\/a>&#8220;) &#8211; I&#8217;m working on a branch that removes the SASS and Webkit build process<\/li><li>ZERO build process<\/li><li>ZERO cookie-based analytics or social media tracking codes &#8211; I use my own <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/\">Kownter<\/a> (still early work in progress) for anonymised, private analytics<\/li><li>100% system font stacks &#8211; I ship you NO font files. I&#8217;m actually not entirely happy with the system mono-spaced fonts, I wanted something more Courier&#8217;y really<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been years in the thinking, but not actually that long in the making. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed doing it and I&#8217;m pleased with the result&#8230;I think?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s still not quite finished, and I&#8217;m totally up for feedback. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s easy enough to read, so if you think the idea of the design is terrible then do tell me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, all good websites have a quote from my friend <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/smp303\">Simon Pollard<\/a>, so here&#8217;s the obligatory hat tip to him:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It is missing a quote from me &#8211; all good sites have a quote from me<\/p><cite>Simon Pollard<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>If you&#8217;re a regular visitor you&#8217;ll notice things look VERY different around here today. If you&#8217;re not then you&#8217;re probably thinking WOAH!?!?! WHAT IS THIS?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been working on a little re-brand of my personal blog site. Here&#8217;s the low down on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What have you done?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, quite. I actually have no idea if this is a great idea or a terrible one. But I&#8217;ve removed the long-standing &#8220;Which Way Now&#8221; branding and made the whole thing much more &#8220;me&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve implemented a new theme that I&#8217;ve created from scratch. I&#8217;ve 100% embraced the fact that I&#8217;m not a designer and removed pretty much all the images (apart from those in posts) and added a geeky, mono-spaced font look that&#8217;s hopefully appealing to my core audience. And the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/\">homepage<\/a> has a fun section for those-who-know to try out with plenty of Easter eggs to find<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also tried to embrace modern web technologies &#8211; more about this in the &#8220;How?&#8221; section, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still need to re-work a lot of out of date pages and do a bit more work on presenting content and adding what I want in the navigation\/sidebar. The structure is\/will be somewhat inspired by <a href=\"http:\/\/jvns.ca\/blog\/2019\/02\/17\/organizing-this-blog-into-categories\/\">Julia Evans&#8217;s ideas<\/a> about categorising her blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other inspiration is from:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/changelog.com\/\">Changelog.com<\/a><\/li><li>My friend <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/keiron\">@keiron&#8217;s<\/a> &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.geekeryasaservice.co.uk\/\">Geekery as a Service<\/a>&#8220;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why have you done this?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I think my audience has changed &#8211; it&#8217;s more technical people now and less general folk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the things I write and the reasons I write have changed &#8211; it&#8217;s less of a life journal and more of a set of technical articles and stuff about technology and work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will sounds horribly vain, I know &#8211; when I started working freelance I set up <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/\">Oikos<\/a> as my business, but I was never sure if it would be more important to promote the business or to promote myself. Over the last few years it&#8217;s become evident that my personal &#8220;brand&#8221; is more important to my work, so I&#8217;m really focussing in on that with this change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to show that I could build my own theme for my own site, gain greater control over the structure of it, learn some new things, try some new things, and tinker with technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, I&#8217;m not a designer and I always had a sense that my personal site didn&#8217;t need to be image-heavy; why load a bunch of impersonal stock images or off-the-shelf icons that actually say nothing about me? So I&#8217;ve gone all in on the geeky coding theme and it&#8217;s super fast and light-weight as a result, with fun things for my core audience to play with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How did you make it?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s built with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>WordPress<\/li><li>Plain CSS (including flexbox)<\/li><li>A little plain vanilla, framework-free JavaScript (ES6 to be precise, might struggle on IE11)<\/li><li>My <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/oiko_s\/tree\/SUCSS\">own super-simple starter theme<\/a> based on <a href=\"http:\/\/underscores.me\/\">_s<\/a> (&#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/underscores.me\/\">underscores<\/a>&#8220;) &#8211; I&#8217;m working on a branch that removes the SASS and Webkit build process<\/li><li>ZERO build process<\/li><li>ZERO cookie-based analytics or social media tracking codes &#8211; I use my own <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/\">Kownter<\/a> (still early work in progress) for anonymised, private analytics<\/li><li>100% system font stacks &#8211; I ship you NO font files. I&#8217;m actually not entirely happy with the system mono-spaced fonts, I wanted something more Courier&#8217;y really<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been years in the thinking, but not actually that long in the making. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed doing it and I&#8217;m pleased with the result&#8230;I think?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s still not quite finished, and I&#8217;m totally up for feedback. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s easy enough to read, so if you think the idea of the design is terrible then do tell me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, all good websites have a quote from my friend <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/smp303\">Simon Pollard<\/a>, so here&#8217;s the obligatory hat tip to him:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It is missing a quote from me &#8211; all good sites have a quote from me<\/p><cite>Simon Pollard<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n",

So here I am catching up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started, finished and nudged along a bunch of small thing this week, and progressed the early stages of some larger things that are coming up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Wednesday I tried out the new co-working space in Swindon called &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theworkshed.co.uk\/\">The Workshed<\/a>&#8221; &#8211; they&#8217;re doing a great three-months-for-the-price-of-one offer that I may take them up on to try it out. Though I found the environment quite visually noisy and distracting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Friday was an ACE day where I actually feel I totally nailed my productivity. Hoping for more of this in the coming weeks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>My new Laravel project is signed off and I&#8217;ll commence work on that next week (w\/c 18th) and really get stuck in in March.<\/li><li>I started and finished a small WordPress plugin development job that involved postcode lookups. Postcodes &#8211; like dates &#8211; are trickier than they seem!<\/li><li>I nudged along a site migration to new hosting that should be simple but involves 6 parties (old IT company, new IT company, new hosting company, ultimate client, intermediary consultant and me!). Migrations &#8211; like dates &#8211; are trickier than they seem!I had a REALLY interesting call about a REALLY interesting future project that may or may not happen.<\/li><li>Started work on an interesting piece of WordPress work that will involve a small amount of front-end work, a hefty amount of back-end work, and some data-import work. The data here is pretty simple &#8211; it&#8217;s two custom post types and a theoretical &#8220;pivot&#8221; table. But I&#8217;m going to have to find the best way to get it into WordPress:<ul><li>ACF meta using repeater fields? (With the issue that repeater fields put numbers in the <code>meta_key<\/code>s which defeats the indexing if I do a wild-carded search and makes queried inefficient)<\/li><li>Standard meta but building my own UI (Thinking about it, this won&#8217;t actually work because there&#8217;s TWO bits of data for each entry&#8230;hmm)<\/li><li>A custom pivot table &#8211; which I hate doing in WordPress. Custom tables are painful and feel out of place. You have to build your own abstractions for them or use packages that are probably overkill for this kind of application.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>I think I&#8217;m going with the custom table option. But this actually-very-simple case highlights where WordPress can quite quickly get stuck with even simple tasks beyond simple publishing.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/02\/going-vanilla-initial-thoughts-on-building-a-theme-with-no-build-tools\/\">Going Vanilla &#8211; initial thoughts on building a theme with no build tools<\/a>: I&#8217;m having a go at building my own theme for my personal blog here.

So here I am catching up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started, finished and nudged along a bunch of small thing this week, and progressed the early stages of some larger things that are coming up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Wednesday I tried out the new co-working space in Swindon called &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theworkshed.co.uk\/\">The Workshed<\/a>&#8221; &#8211; they&#8217;re doing a great three-months-for-the-price-of-one offer that I may take them up on to try it out. Though I found the environment quite visually noisy and distracting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Friday was an ACE day where I actually feel I totally nailed my productivity. Hoping for more of this in the coming weeks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>My new Laravel project is signed off and I&#8217;ll commence work on that next week (w\/c 18th) and really get stuck in in March.<\/li><li>I started and finished a small WordPress plugin development job that involved postcode lookups. Postcodes &#8211; like dates &#8211; are trickier than they seem!<\/li><li>I nudged along a site migration to new hosting that should be simple but involves 6 parties (old IT company, new IT company, new hosting company, ultimate client, intermediary consultant and me!). Migrations &#8211; like dates &#8211; are trickier than they seem!I had a REALLY interesting call about a REALLY interesting future project that may or may not happen.<\/li><li>Started work on an interesting piece of WordPress work that will involve a small amount of front-end work, a hefty amount of back-end work, and some data-import work. The data here is pretty simple &#8211; it&#8217;s two custom post types and a theoretical &#8220;pivot&#8221; table. But I&#8217;m going to have to find the best way to get it into WordPress:<ul><li>ACF meta using repeater fields? (With the issue that repeater fields put numbers in the <code>meta_key<\/code>s which defeats the indexing if I do a wild-carded search and makes queried inefficient)<\/li><li>Standard meta but building my own UI (Thinking about it, this won&#8217;t actually work because there&#8217;s TWO bits of data for each entry&#8230;hmm)<\/li><li>A custom pivot table &#8211; which I hate doing in WordPress. Custom tables are painful and feel out of place. You have to build your own abstractions for them or use packages that are probably overkill for this kind of application.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>I think I&#8217;m going with the custom table option. But this actually-very-simple case highlights where WordPress can quite quickly get stuck with even simple tasks beyond simple publishing.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/02\/going-vanilla-initial-thoughts-on-building-a-theme-with-no-build-tools\/\">Going Vanilla &#8211; initial thoughts on building a theme with no build tools<\/a>: I&#8217;m having a go at building my own theme for my personal blog here.

There are two projects on the go which are squeezing databases of stuff into WordPress.

This site was built by a big design agency using <a href=\"https:\/\/roots.io\/bedrock\/\">Bedrock<\/a> (or some kind of fork of it), which is total overkill for something this size. Bedrock is a composer-based WordPress environment where updates are all manual so someone needs to update it. But the agency then seems to have uploaded this site to a server and left it to get old. Extracting this site from Bedrock to make it easier to manage has been a challenge and this week I learned that WordPress prevents auto-updates if there is a <code>.git<\/code> folder\/directory that makes it look like WordPress is version controlled.

Though it turns out there is no such thing as a &#8220;normal&#8221; week in our family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Work-wise some small projects have been nudged along and I&#8217;ve had interesting conversations about some new ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Specs for the new Laravel project progressed and draft proposal was made. I need to work up the final proposal still but then we should get going quickly, I hope.<\/li><li>There were quite a lot of calls about new things, large and small! There are two projects on the go which are squeezing databases of stuff into WordPress. I had a play with <a href=\"https:\/\/airtable.com\/\">AirTable<\/a> to see if that would fit well but their API &#8211; though clever &#8211; is quite limited.<\/li><li>I spent more time on complicated slug\/URL\/redirect issues &#8211; this was really tricky, but I think we&#8217;ve nailed it now.<\/li><li>I did some work on a small charity&#8217;s site, making some changes for them and trying to work out why WordPress wouldn&#8217;t do automatic security updates. This site was built by a big design agency using <a href=\"https:\/\/roots.io\/bedrock\/\">Bedrock<\/a> (or some kind of fork of it), which is total overkill for something this size. Bedrock is a composer-based WordPress environment where updates are all manual so someone needs to update it. But the agency then seems to have uploaded this site to a server and left it to get old. Extracting this site from Bedrock to make it easier to manage has been a challenge and this week I learned that WordPress prevents auto-updates if there is a <code>.git<\/code> folder\/directory that makes it look like WordPress is version controlled. ARGH!<\/li><li>I had a REALLY interesting call about a REALLY interesting future project that may or may not happen.<\/li><li>I had a stupid idea and this lead me to start some initial work on a new theme for my personal website.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Nothing posted last week.

                "rendered": "\n<p>I&#8217;ve become pretty fed up with using build tools for small web projects. So I&#8217;m attempting to build a WordPress theme with no build tool using only &#8220;vanilla&#8221; CSS and JS. Here&#8217;s some initial thoughts I&#8217;ve had after getting started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are you doing and why?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m attempting to build a new custom theme for my own blog (yes, this one you are reading), and I&#8217;m doing it with no npm, grunt, gulp, parcel.js, or anything. It&#8217;s zero config because there&#8217;s nothing to configure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m starting with the <a href=\"http:\/\/underscores.me\/\">_s<\/a> (&#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/underscores.me\/\">Underscores<\/a>&#8220;) starter theme, just to get me off the starting blocks with something, but with the &#8220;SASSify&#8221; option turned off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m actually basing it on my own fork of Underscores that I&#8217;ve called oiko_s &#8211; this previously had a simple webpack setup added with SASS, Babel transpilation, LiveReload and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But actually, as I mention in <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/my-new-css-framework-sucss\/\">my post about my silly SUCSS idea<\/a>, I&#8217;m wondering if modern CSS and JS that now has good browser support (CSS variables, HTTP2, ES6, etc) allows us to write good, clean front-end code for small projects with no build process at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What have you found so far?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I&#8217;m PROBABLY figuring out why people build frameworks. A few things have come up, even in the very early days of working like this, that make me think it won&#8217;t work. But I also have some optimism that I can make this work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A large, single CSS file is hard to work with<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I should really have seen this coming, but Underscores without SASS has one big CSS file and this is hard to work with.  It has sections and a table of contents, but it feels like it needs to be properly broken down OR that some conventions or editor\/IDE tool is needed to help efficiently navigate it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also considered that HTTP2 (you&#8217;re all using HTTPS and HTTP2, right?) is much more efficient at downloading lots of small files, so maybe I can just break it up into lots of smaller files and use a loop in my PHP to inject them into the HTML? I could even defer loading of non-critical CSS more easily this way. Hmm&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Live-reloaders are nice<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m missing this. I think I can do it using BrowserSync proxying or something that I can run from npm globally, rather than having it local. There will be a way. But I&#8217;m without it for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Internet Explorer<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I would really like to support IE11 if I can. There are polyfills of sorts for some things I will probably use, but without them the site will NOT look right. CSS variables in particular are an issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I find myself wondering if I should but a notice up saying &#8220;You&#8217;re not getting the best experience in IE&#8221; or something. Don&#8217;t people rally against this? Or is this an acceptable kind of notice to display these days, especially if you&#8217;re working WITH modern web standards, not against them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Forging ahead<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I&#8217;ve made a start, and I&#8217;m happy with how it is. There are issues to sort out and things need to be done to improve the workflow. But I&#8217;m happy with the direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch this space for more!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I&#8217;ve become pretty fed up with using build tools for small web projects. So I&#8217;m attempting to build a WordPress theme with no build tool using only &#8220;vanilla&#8221; CSS and JS. Here&#8217;s some initial thoughts I&#8217;ve had after getting started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are you doing and why?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m attempting to build a new custom theme for my own blog (yes, this one you are reading), and I&#8217;m doing it with no npm, grunt, gulp, parcel.js, or anything. It&#8217;s zero config because there&#8217;s nothing to configure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m starting with the <a href=\"http:\/\/underscores.me\/\">_s<\/a> (&#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/underscores.me\/\">Underscores<\/a>&#8220;) starter theme, just to get me off the starting blocks with something, but with the &#8220;SASSify&#8221; option turned off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m actually basing it on my own fork of Underscores that I&#8217;ve called oiko_s &#8211; this previously had a simple webpack setup added with SASS, Babel transpilation, LiveReload and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But actually, as I mention in <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/my-new-css-framework-sucss\/\">my post about my silly SUCSS idea<\/a>, I&#8217;m wondering if modern CSS and JS that now has good browser support (CSS variables, HTTP2, ES6, etc) allows us to write good, clean front-end code for small projects with no build process at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What have you found so far?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I&#8217;m PROBABLY figuring out why people build frameworks. A few things have come up, even in the very early days of working like this, that make me think it won&#8217;t work. But I also have some optimism that I can make this work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A large, single CSS file is hard to work with<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I should really have seen this coming, but Underscores without SASS has one big CSS file and this is hard to work with.  It has sections and a table of contents, but it feels like it needs to be properly broken down OR that some conventions or editor\/IDE tool is needed to help efficiently navigate it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also considered that HTTP2 (you&#8217;re all using HTTPS and HTTP2, right?) is much more efficient at downloading lots of small files, so maybe I can just break it up into lots of smaller files and use a loop in my PHP to inject them into the HTML? I could even defer loading of non-critical CSS more easily this way. Hmm&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Live-reloaders are nice<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m missing this. I think I can do it using BrowserSync proxying or something that I can run from npm globally, rather than having it local. There will be a way. But I&#8217;m without it for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Internet Explorer<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I would really like to support IE11 if I can. There are polyfills of sorts for some things I will probably use, but without them the site will NOT look right. CSS variables in particular are an issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I find myself wondering if I should but a notice up saying &#8220;You&#8217;re not getting the best experience in IE&#8221; or something. Don&#8217;t people rally against this? Or is this an acceptable kind of notice to display these days, especially if you&#8217;re working WITH modern web standards, not against them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Forging ahead<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I&#8217;ve made a start, and I&#8217;m happy with how it is. There are issues to sort out and things need to be done to improve the workflow. But I&#8217;m happy with the direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch this space for more!<\/p>\n",

We&#8217;re about to start a whole new routine with my youngest starting pre-school and doing more hours there than she was in nursery, my wife taking on an extra half day and me&#8230;am I working more or just moving hours around? I can&#8217;t tell. Anyway, it&#8217;s crazy, and it starts today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week&#8217;s snow messed things up a little with a school closure on Friday too. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Still reviewing spec&#8217;s and working up a proposal for a new Laravel project. Keen to get going on this one if I can.<\/li><li>Finally got a long-outstanding, but really small project for a friend-of-a-friend live. It&#8217;s a couple of pages in a WordPress page-builder but has just been hanging around for so long. Smaller projects with no deadline often get put back and back. I&#8217;m going to try and stop taking them on.<\/li><li>More helping my friends at <a href=\"https:\/\/handsup.co.uk\">Hands Up<\/a> with last minute project snags on a custom WordPress build. There&#8217;s been some tricky issues with redirects that have been pretty hard to debug.<\/li><li>Another small, slow-burning project has had some good progress and I met the client this week to talk them through. They&#8217;re really happy with things and we have just a few final tasks to get through before we may be able to &#8220;go live&#8221;!

        "content": "\n<p>Blimey, what a week! We&#8217;re about to start a whole new routine with my youngest starting pre-school and doing more hours there than she was in nursery, my wife taking on an extra half day and me&#8230;am I working more or just moving hours around? I can&#8217;t tell. Anyway, it&#8217;s crazy, and it starts today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week&#8217;s snow messed things up a little with a school closure on Friday too. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Still reviewing spec&#8217;s and working up a proposal for a new Laravel project. Keen to get going on this one if I can.<\/li><li>Finally got a long-outstanding, but really small project for a friend-of-a-friend live. It&#8217;s a couple of pages in a WordPress page-builder but has just been hanging around for so long. Smaller projects with no deadline often get put back and back. I&#8217;m going to try and stop taking them on.<\/li><li>More helping my friends at <a href=\"https:\/\/handsup.co.uk\">Hands Up<\/a> with last minute project snags on a custom WordPress build. There&#8217;s been some tricky issues with redirects that have been pretty hard to debug.<\/li><li>Another small, slow-burning project has had some good progress and I met the client this week to talk them through. They&#8217;re really happy with things and we have just a few final tasks to get through before we may be able to &#8220;go live&#8221;! It was wonderful seeing them use what I made and enjoying the benefits the re-work of their old website has brought.<\/li><li>Helping a client fix some SPF records to fix outgoing mail. SPF comes up SO often. I&#8217;m sure many have documented it, but I need to write my own guide.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/improving-internal-communications-its-a-people-problem\/\">Improving internal communications \u2013 it\u2019s a people problem\u2026<\/a>: This was a comment in a Facebook group that was blog-post worthy once tidied up a bit.

            "content": {
                "rendered": "\n<p>I heard a thing today which made me realise something about what has happened with WordPress&#8217;s new &#8220;Gutenberg&#8221; editor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been really frustrated that people like me that build websites for others seemed to be a bit left out with both WHAT Gutenberg is and HOW is was delivered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve always known that the new block editor in WordPress is designed to help WordPress compete with website builders like Wix and SquareSpace and Weebly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I had ignored or forgotten was that website builders like those are intended to help people build websites on their own, without small agency owners like me being involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so WordPress, in moving to this model, is actually moving to a space where people like me aren&#8217;t needed. Or at least, to a space where IT APPEARS that people like me aren&#8217;t needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, take the fact that Gutenberg allows someone writing a post or page to change the font size or text colour. People like me are cross about this because we spend time designing sites, and paying attention to details like font sizes and colours that should be consistent across the site. So we&#8217;re frustrated that people will now be able to come along and use text sizes and colours inconsistently and mess up our nice designs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But regular people who want to build a website are probably thinking: &#8220;Woo hoo! I can edit text colour and size, and even change the background colour of a block. I don&#8217;t need to ask my web developer person to do this any more, I can build the site myself!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m not complaining that Gutenberg is taking my work away. That&#8217;s not the point I want to make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also not complaining that Gutenberg is bad. At least, not the IDEA of Gutenberg. I think the idea of a block editor is exactly the right thing. I just think Gutenberg is the WRONG block editor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point I want to make is that making a <em><strong>good<\/strong><\/em> website requires skill, knowledge and experience. The Wix&#8217;s and Weebly&#8217;s give the impression that someone with very little knowledge can, for a few dollars a month, have a beautiful, functional website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to some extent that&#8217;s true. But then I look at the stuff that people make with these tools and it&#8217;s often very poor. And I look at the code that the builder creates, and the speed of the site, and other &#8220;under the bonnet&#8221; technical things, and it turns out that these platforms are really bad at the technology stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg is intended to give this same veneer: you don&#8217;t need someone to help you; you can make a website yourself!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may enable WordPress to compete better with the site builders. To maintain and grow it&#8217;s already-enormous market share. But at what cost?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the cost of annoying many people like me who previously recommended WordPress to people but who are now seriously considering alternatives, or have already jumped ship?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the cost of tricking people into thinking they can build a site by themselves when actually what they need is some help to do it properly?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the cost of raising the bar of what\u2019s needed to develop for WordPress by including React and lots of complicated build processes?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has the project lost its way chasing user numbers rather than focusing on its mission?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A different Gutenberg might have said &#8220;OK, let&#8217;s let Wix and Weebly do their thing, and we&#8217;ll do our thing. They might take some people away from WordPress at first because those tools appear easier. But WE will guide people along a better path.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these thoughts lead me to having a better understanding of why the WordPress governance project has sprung up (best explained here on the <a href=\"https:\/\/wptavern.com\/wpweekly-episode-344-introduction-to-the-wordpress-governance-project\">recent WordPress Weekly podcast<\/a>). Who was making the decisions to chase after these things? Where are the bigger decisions about the direction of the project not documented? Why are some of these processes so opaque?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just opinion, of course. But I do think it was an important realisation to have: WordPress isn\u2019t focussed on agencies and developers right now &#8211; it wants users who can fend for themselves.<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Opinion: WordPress Gutenberg and the responsibility of owning a website",
        "content": "\n<p>I heard a thing today which made me realise something about what has happened with WordPress&#8217;s new &#8220;Gutenberg&#8221; editor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been really frustrated that people like me that build websites for others seemed to be a bit left out with both WHAT Gutenberg is and HOW is was delivered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve always known that the new block editor in WordPress is designed to help WordPress compete with website builders like Wix and SquareSpace and Weebly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I had ignored or forgotten was that website builders like those are intended to help people build websites on their own, without small agency owners like me being involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so WordPress, in moving to this model, is actually moving to a space where people like me aren&#8217;t needed. Or at least, to a space where IT APPEARS that people like me aren&#8217;t needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, take the fact that Gutenberg allows someone writing a post or page to change the font size or text colour. People like me are cross about this because we spend time designing sites, and paying attention to details like font sizes and colours that should be consistent across the site. So we&#8217;re frustrated that people will now be able to come along and use text sizes and colours inconsistently and mess up our nice designs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But regular people who want to build a website are probably thinking: &#8220;Woo hoo! I can edit text colour and size, and even change the background colour of a block. I don&#8217;t need to ask my web developer person to do this any more, I can build the site myself!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m not complaining that Gutenberg is taking my work away. That&#8217;s not the point I want to make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also not complaining that Gutenberg is bad. At least, not the IDEA of Gutenberg. I think the idea of a block editor is exactly the right thing. I just think Gutenberg is the WRONG block editor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point I want to make is that making a <em><strong>good<\/strong><\/em> website requires skill, knowledge and experience. The Wix&#8217;s and Weebly&#8217;s give the impression that someone with very little knowledge can, for a few dollars a month, have a beautiful, functional website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to some extent that&#8217;s true. But then I look at the stuff that people make with these tools and it&#8217;s often very poor. And I look at the code that the builder creates, and the speed of the site, and other &#8220;under the bonnet&#8221; technical things, and it turns out that these platforms are really bad at the technology stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg is intended to give this same veneer: you don&#8217;t need someone to help you; you can make a website yourself!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may enable WordPress to compete better with the site builders. To maintain and grow it&#8217;s already-enormous market share. But at what cost?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the cost of annoying many people like me who previously recommended WordPress to people but who are now seriously considering alternatives, or have already jumped ship?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the cost of tricking people into thinking they can build a site by themselves when actually what they need is some help to do it properly?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the cost of raising the bar of what\u2019s needed to develop for WordPress by including React and lots of complicated build processes?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has the project lost its way chasing user numbers rather than focusing on its mission?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A different Gutenberg might have said &#8220;OK, let&#8217;s let Wix and Weebly do their thing, and we&#8217;ll do our thing. They might take some people away from WordPress at first because those tools appear easier. But WE will guide people along a better path.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these thoughts lead me to having a better understanding of why the WordPress governance project has sprung up (best explained here on the <a href=\"https:\/\/wptavern.com\/wpweekly-episode-344-introduction-to-the-wordpress-governance-project\">recent WordPress Weekly podcast<\/a>). Who was making the decisions to chase after these things? Where are the bigger decisions about the direction of the project not documented? Why are some of these processes so opaque?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just opinion, of course. But I do think it was an important realisation to have: WordPress isn\u2019t focussed on agencies and developers right now &#8211; it wants users who can fend for themselves.<\/p>\n",
