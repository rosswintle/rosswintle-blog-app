So we had another slow start and a nice bacon-and-eggs breakfast\/elevenses.  Yummy!  There wasn&#8217;t much in the plan, and the weather was possibly unpredictable weather, but expected to clear, so we again went for something with an indoor element &#8211; at least to start with.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Sally had been wanting to check out some Irish crafts, so we headed off to Avoca&#8217;s Handweaving centre, which we&#8217;d passed earlier in the week.  Our (by now indispensible) Ordnance Survey of Ireland, 1:50,000 scale, &#8220;Explorer&#8221; maps allowed us to take some fun, minor roads, and Sally was getting pretty good at navigating!  Who needs signs?!<\/p>\n<p>Once there, surprisingly, you can just walk right in to the small weaving factory and walk around.  There are a few boards explaining what&#8217;s going on, but it was weird just being able to wander about while people sat preparing and operating both manual and powered looms, weaving fine cloth.  Bizarre, but quite interesting.<\/p>\n<p>It was a much quicker trip then we thought it would be, even with a trip around the almost-as-expensive-as-Powerscourt shop.  So we quickly committed to doing a few more Geocaches as we headed towards Brittas Bay.<\/p>\n<h3>Three Bickerson&#8217;s and a Beach<\/h3>\n<p>Learning from yesterday, we&#8217;d logged on and checked the cache logs before leaving, and found nothiing to put us off.  We easily picked up Barron in the Sky, Ballymoyle Hill and End of our Drive &#8211; with much thanks to &#8220;The Bickersons&#8221; for placing easy-to-find caches in some great locations with some great views across the eastern coast that we wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have seen.  Our aim was to do Brittas Bay, near the South Car Park too, but the 4 Euro for the car park seemed a bit much for a short visit.<\/p>\n<p>A bit further up the road, the North Car Park had the barrier up, so we parked up and had a highly enjoyable half hour or so on the beach.  I did all the stupid, manly, show-off things that one does: skimming and throwing stones; dragging the lovely wife into the sea (paddling only); hand stands; and generally larking around, while she enjoyed my silliness and captured the scene on&#8230;err&#8230;what now passes for film.  On reflection, 4 Euro would be good value if you wanted to spend half a day, or a few hours, on a beautiful, clean, sandy beach, manned by lifeguards, which is virtually deserted on a sunny day in mid-June.<\/p>\n<p>An early finish meant home for tea and toast, leftover curry for dinner, and a chilled out evening.  I could quite get used to this holiday lark.<\/p>\n<h3>The Ups and Downs of Geocaching<\/h3>\n<p>Reflections on today: Geocaching has been sometimes frustrating and sometimes fun, but we are still learning, and it&#8217;s enabled us to get out to some places that we wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have been, and seen some good bits of history and some beautiful places.  It&#8217;s a good way to tap into locals&#8217; knowledge of where you can see interesting stuff!<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Green&#8221; side of us finds that it does involve a lot of driving though.  We&#8217;ve tried to pick caches near to places that we&#8217;re going anyway, but it&#8217;s often involved going out of our way to find places.  We&#8217;ve tried to walk as much as possible (one other good thing about Geocaching is that it gets you out walking) but perhaps cycle-caching would be better and worth promoting!<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re actually wondering what we&#8217;d have done this holiday without Geocaching.  I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;d have found places to see and things to do, but it&#8217;s certainly prevented us stitting around in the cottage and doing nothing.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h3>Who Needs Signs?<\/h3>\n<p>Lots of rain overnight meant that we weren&#8217;t keen to rise early&#8230;again!  So we had another slow start and a nice bacon-and-eggs breakfast\/elevenses.  Yummy!  There wasn&#8217;t much in the plan, and the weather was possibly unpredictable weather, but expected to clear, so we again went for something with an indoor element &#8211; at least to start with.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Sally had been wanting to check out some Irish crafts, so we headed off to Avoca&#8217;s Handweaving centre, which we&#8217;d passed earlier in the week.  Our (by now indispensible) Ordnance Survey of Ireland, 1:50,000 scale, &#8220;Explorer&#8221; maps allowed us to take some fun, minor roads, and Sally was getting pretty good at navigating!  Who needs signs?!<\/p>\n<p>Once there, surprisingly, you can just walk right in to the small weaving factory and walk around.  There are a few boards explaining what&#8217;s going on, but it was weird just being able to wander about while people sat preparing and operating both manual and powered looms, weaving fine cloth.  Bizarre, but quite interesting.<\/p>\n<p>It was a much quicker trip then we thought it would be, even with a trip around the almost-as-expensive-as-Powerscourt shop.  So we quickly committed to doing a few more Geocaches as we headed towards Brittas Bay.<\/p>\n<h3>Three Bickerson&#8217;s and a Beach<\/h3>\n<p>Learning from yesterday, we&#8217;d logged on and checked the cache logs before leaving, and found nothiing to put us off.  We easily picked up Barron in the Sky, Ballymoyle Hill and End of our Drive &#8211; with much thanks to &#8220;The Bickersons&#8221; for placing easy-to-find caches in some great locations with some great views across the eastern coast that we wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have seen.  Our aim was to do Brittas Bay, near the South Car Park too, but the 4 Euro for the car park seemed a bit much for a short visit.<\/p>\n<p>A bit further up the road, the North Car Park had the barrier up, so we parked up and had a highly enjoyable half hour or so on the beach.  I did all the stupid, manly, show-off things that one does: skimming and throwing stones; dragging the lovely wife into the sea (paddling only); hand stands; and generally larking around, while she enjoyed my silliness and captured the scene on&#8230;err&#8230;what now passes for film.  On reflection, 4 Euro would be good value if you wanted to spend half a day, or a few hours, on a beautiful, clean, sandy beach, manned by lifeguards, which is virtually deserted on a sunny day in mid-June.<\/p>\n<p>An early finish meant home for tea and toast, leftover curry for dinner, and a chilled out evening.  I could quite get used to this holiday lark.<\/p>\n<h3>The Ups and Downs of Geocaching<\/h3>\n<p>Reflections on today: Geocaching has been sometimes frustrating and sometimes fun, but we are still learning, and it&#8217;s enabled us to get out to some places that we wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have been, and seen some good bits of history and some beautiful places.  It&#8217;s a good way to tap into locals&#8217; knowledge of where you can see interesting stuff!<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Green&#8221; side of us finds that it does involve a lot of driving though.  We&#8217;ve tried to pick caches near to places that we&#8217;re going anyway, but it&#8217;s often involved going out of our way to find places.  We&#8217;ve tried to walk as much as possible (one other good thing about Geocaching is that it gets you out walking) but perhaps cycle-caching would be better and worth promoting!<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re actually wondering what we&#8217;d have done this holiday without Geocaching.  I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;d have found places to see and things to do, but it&#8217;s certainly prevented us stitting around in the cottage and doing nothing.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<h3>Radio, Weather and Late Rising<\/h3>\n<p>Two quick observations.<\/p>\n<p>Radio: Radio here is really good.  Both East Coast FM and RTE 2 have a really good mix of music.  Though, oddly, its all English music.<\/p>\n<p>Weather forecasts: We&#8217;ve got Freesat here, but it&#8217;s been really hard getting a decent forecast for the Republic of Ireland.  There don&#8217;t seem to be any Irish channels on Freesat, so we&#8217;re resorting to interpreting the BBC&#8217;s big charts (with the presenter usually stood right in front of the bit of map we&#8217;re interested in) and short snippets on the aforementioned radio.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well.  It&#8217;s mostly sunny with showers, and I guess that will continue.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Our rising time is getting later and later.  With the long days there&#8217;s not really much requirement to get up and out of the house early, so we&#8217;re taking our mornings pretty easy.<\/p>\n<h3>Powerscourt<\/h3>\n<p>Today&#8217;s forecast was sunshine and showers (who&#8217;d have guessed?!), so we decided to do something with an option of being indoors, so it was off a bit North to Powerscourt House and Gardens.  It&#8217;s recommended as a good place to see, and we had a voucher for 2 euro discount on tickets to the garden.<\/p>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t have any Geocaches for that area, so we looked up a few on my phone.  Mobile internet is fine here, though I&#8217;m not looking forward to my next bill and finding out how much it costs.<\/p>\n<p>Armed with the information we needed, we set out.  The drive was pretty easy and took us through some beautiful land.  The only problem being the random\/sporadic signposting again.  But we found Powerscourt and turned into the long drive &#8211; an avenue of huge beech trees.  Once into the car park, sporadic signposting took over again and we wandered into a small garden centre.  Eventually we decided that this wasn&#8217;t on the way to the gardens, so we headed out and back towards the drive.  There we did find the entrance to the house.<\/p>\n<p>Bizarrely, most of the parts of the building that are open to the public have been converted to shops.  It felt like a small, posh, boutiquey shopping mall.  The food court of this mall being the one of the most expensive cafe&#8217;s I&#8217;ve ever been in!  We sat and ate and extortionately expensive sandwich, and drank liquid gold&#8230;err, I mean, a cup of coffee before heading to the gardens.<\/p>\n<h3>Tidy = Dull<\/h3>\n<p>On the way out of the mall, there were a few interpretive boards, but I generally felt that information on the house and gardens was lacking.  We were given a small map with a few prescribed walks around the gardens to follow.  The gardens are nice enough, but not my cup of tea.  If you like pristine, neat, formal gardens, then you&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s amazing, but I prefer something a bit more on the wild side.<\/p>\n<p>I enjoyed the walk through the woodland with its spectacular, huge firs; the Japanese Gardens were nicely done, and I poked around at some of the smaller wildlife in the dolphin pond, but generally was underwhelmed.  The vista from the house of the surrounding hills and Sugar Loaf Mountain was spectacular too, but I was left wanting to get away from the house and up the mountain, rather than hanging around.<\/p>\n<h3>Learning about Logs<\/h3>\n<p>We grabbed our daily ice-cream fix and headed off to do some Geocaching.  First stop, the little town of Enniskerry for &#8220;Knocksink River Bend&#8221;.  The car park to Knocksink Forest Park was closed, and we couldn&#8217;t park outside, so we parked up back in Enniskerry and walked the short distance to the park.  Initially we were on the wrong side of the river and couldn&#8217;t see how to get across, but, after logging on on my mobile and checking the logs, we found that there was a bridge across, and after some meandering, we found the cache.<\/p>\n<p>We then walked back and further up the road to find &#8220;Fox Hall&#8221;, a 2-part multicache, a bit like a treasure hunt.  The first part needed good observation to spot a clue, and once found we used the cache notes to calculate the coordinates of the second cache.  Sadly, it seemed to be in a place where a BMX bike track has neatly been constructed and, with several young muggles around on their bikes, we decided not to disturb them.  Again checking the cache logs shows that we&#8217;re not the first to have this problem.<\/p>\n<p>We learned today that checking the logs, though it can reveal &#8220;spoilers&#8221;, can also be very helpful and worthwhile.<\/p>\n<h3>Tumbling Torrents, Tesco and Telly<\/h3>\n<p>Caching over, we headed back south to check out Powerscourt Waterfall.  This is a spectacular place and a huge, elegant waterfall.  I think we paid 5 euro each to get in, which seems expensive for a short, 1-hour visit.  I&#8217;d recommend taking a picnic or barbecue here and spending a long lunch in this fantastic setting, rather than paying it a flying visit.<\/p>\n<p>Home via the recognisable comforts of Tesco to pick up some dinner supplies and a lazy evening in front of the telly finished our day &#8211; just what we needed.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h3>Radio, Weather and Late Rising<\/h3>\n<p>Two quick observations.<\/p>\n<p>Radio: Radio here is really good.  Both East Coast FM and RTE 2 have a really good mix of music.  Though, oddly, its all English music.<\/p>\n<p>Weather forecasts: We&#8217;ve got Freesat here, but it&#8217;s been really hard getting a decent forecast for the Republic of Ireland.  There don&#8217;t seem to be any Irish channels on Freesat, so we&#8217;re resorting to interpreting the BBC&#8217;s big charts (with the presenter usually stood right in front of the bit of map we&#8217;re interested in) and short snippets on the aforementioned radio.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well.  It&#8217;s mostly sunny with showers, and I guess that will continue.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Our rising time is getting later and later.  With the long days there&#8217;s not really much requirement to get up and out of the house early, so we&#8217;re taking our mornings pretty easy.<\/p>\n<h3>Powerscourt<\/h3>\n<p>Today&#8217;s forecast was sunshine and showers (who&#8217;d have guessed?!), so we decided to do something with an option of being indoors, so it was off a bit North to Powerscourt House and Gardens.  It&#8217;s recommended as a good place to see, and we had a voucher for 2 euro discount on tickets to the garden.<\/p>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t have any Geocaches for that area, so we looked up a few on my phone.  Mobile internet is fine here, though I&#8217;m not looking forward to my next bill and finding out how much it costs.<\/p>\n<p>Armed with the information we needed, we set out.  The drive was pretty easy and took us through some beautiful land.  The only problem being the random\/sporadic signposting again.  But we found Powerscourt and turned into the long drive &#8211; an avenue of huge beech trees.  Once into the car park, sporadic signposting took over again and we wandered into a small garden centre.  Eventually we decided that this wasn&#8217;t on the way to the gardens, so we headed out and back towards the drive.  There we did find the entrance to the house.<\/p>\n<p>Bizarrely, most of the parts of the building that are open to the public have been converted to shops.  It felt like a small, posh, boutiquey shopping mall.  The food court of this mall being the one of the most expensive cafe&#8217;s I&#8217;ve ever been in!  We sat and ate and extortionately expensive sandwich, and drank liquid gold&#8230;err, I mean, a cup of coffee before heading to the gardens.<\/p>\n<h3>Tidy = Dull<\/h3>\n<p>On the way out of the mall, there were a few interpretive boards, but I generally felt that information on the house and gardens was lacking.  We were given a small map with a few prescribed walks around the gardens to follow.  The gardens are nice enough, but not my cup of tea.  If you like pristine, neat, formal gardens, then you&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s amazing, but I prefer something a bit more on the wild side.<\/p>\n<p>I enjoyed the walk through the woodland with its spectacular, huge firs; the Japanese Gardens were nicely done, and I poked around at some of the smaller wildlife in the dolphin pond, but generally was underwhelmed.  The vista from the house of the surrounding hills and Sugar Loaf Mountain was spectacular too, but I was left wanting to get away from the house and up the mountain, rather than hanging around.<\/p>\n<h3>Learning about Logs<\/h3>\n<p>We grabbed our daily ice-cream fix and headed off to do some Geocaching.  First stop, the little town of Enniskerry for &#8220;Knocksink River Bend&#8221;.  The car park to Knocksink Forest Park was closed, and we couldn&#8217;t park outside, so we parked up back in Enniskerry and walked the short distance to the park.  Initially we were on the wrong side of the river and couldn&#8217;t see how to get across, but, after logging on on my mobile and checking the logs, we found that there was a bridge across, and after some meandering, we found the cache.<\/p>\n<p>We then walked back and further up the road to find &#8220;Fox Hall&#8221;, a 2-part multicache, a bit like a treasure hunt.  The first part needed good observation to spot a clue, and once found we used the cache notes to calculate the coordinates of the second cache.  Sadly, it seemed to be in a place where a BMX bike track has neatly been constructed and, with several young muggles around on their bikes, we decided not to disturb them.  Again checking the cache logs shows that we&#8217;re not the first to have this problem.<\/p>\n<p>We learned today that checking the logs, though it can reveal &#8220;spoilers&#8221;, can also be very helpful and worthwhile.<\/p>\n<h3>Tumbling Torrents, Tesco and Telly<\/h3>\n<p>Caching over, we headed back south to check out Powerscourt Waterfall.  This is a spectacular place and a huge, elegant waterfall.  I think we paid 5 euro each to get in, which seems expensive for a short, 1-hour visit.  I&#8217;d recommend taking a picnic or barbecue here and spending a long lunch in this fantastic setting, rather than paying it a flying visit.<\/p>\n<p>Home via the recognisable comforts of Tesco to pick up some dinner supplies and a lazy evening in front of the telly finished our day &#8211; just what we needed.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<h3>It&#8217;s a Sign!!<\/h3>\n<p>First a note on Irish signs.  These aren&#8217;t lacking, but they are, we find, generally pretty rubbish.  They are badly placed, usually too small, occasionally not actually related to the place\/junction at which they&#8217;re located, and completely sporadic and unpredictable.  One minute a main road is signed, the next, you&#8217;re at a junction with no idea which way to turn.  This is not confined to the countryside: on our trip to Dublin last year we couldn&#8217;t find any signs for the main M1 motorway north to Belfast and spent 40 minutes driving through the suburbs.<\/p>\n<p>Someone should really have a word.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Boots or Shoes?<\/h3>\n<p>Anyway, we were feeling good today.  The forecast was for patchy rain and our target was Glendalough &#8211; &#8220;The valley of two lakes&#8221; &#8211; for some walking and Geocaching.  Morning discussion was of what sort of shoes to wear and what to take.  I suggested that we pack for a proper hike and see what happens.  Lovely wife seemed a bit more sceptical about my potential-hiking ambitions.<\/p>\n<p>We started with a quick trip to pick some information up from Wicklow&#8217;s information office and then headed straight from there to the mostly well-signposted Glendalough.<\/p>\n<h3>Glendalough and St Kevin<\/h3>\n<p>There was a bit of rain to start with but it soon cleared and we had a beautiful day of walking ahead.   Lovely wife wasn&#8217;t so keen to start with, but I encouraged her to take walking boots and a full rucksack.  I think she appreciated this in the end.<\/p>\n<p>Glendalough has a visitor centre, which is OK, but the interpretive bit wasn&#8217;t open and there wasn&#8217;t much in terms of information there, so we grabbed a walking routes map and a leaflet about the historic relics.  Total cost, 1 Euro!<\/p>\n<p>We took a quick trip round the ruins &#8211; these were impressive and old and mostly relating to St Kevin the information leaflet was, true to its name, informative, telling us some of the history and legends surrounding the site and St Kevin himself.  The gravestones were also fascinating, a huge variety of styles from across the years.  The location, in the heart of the glen, was very atmospheric, but the place was bustling with tourists.<\/p>\n<h3>Walking Glendalough<\/h3>\n<p>After a short time we set of on one of the walking routes.  These all seemed to be mostly well-paved and well sign-posted.  Previously in Ireland this has bothered me, but here it seemed fitting.  There&#8217;s a long board walk (a walk along raised wooden boards), which exists to protect the land from erosion&#8230;excellent stuff!  Walking on the marshland would not have been nice.  Sign posts and interpretative boards are there, but not over-done, making it feel slightly more wild.  The altitude and remoteness that you achieve also means that you feel like you&#8217;re doing some proper outdoorsy stuff.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than pick a single main route we made up our own route out of bits of the others &#8211; mostly in order to take in as much scenery and geocaching as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Once we&#8217;d left the busy shorter routes a lot of the people melted away and we were left pretty much to ourselves.  We climbed up a waterfall, walked through a forest, and up and over a hill onto the boardwalk.  This took us along a cliff edge with views that made the climb well worthwhile.<\/p>\n<h3>Spink and Kevin&#8217;s Dental Work<\/h3>\n<p>The first geocache, &#8220;Spink&#8221;, was a short walk uphill from the boardwalk.  It felt wrong walking over the peat and marshland when a clear trail had been provided to protect the land, but that&#8217;s what we did.  Our geocaching disappointment continued as this cache, which had been listed as &#8220;needing maintenance&#8221;, was not in its place at all.  Our lunch had been carried up in a biscuit tin and this was now empty, so we left that in the cache&#8217;s place, with a short note scribbled on a bit of paper.  At least there&#8217;s something there now!<\/p>\n<p>Back down to the boardwalk and along to the western extent of the path.  The second cache was here: a big army tin full of stuff, hiding&#8230;we won&#8217;t say where.  Finally&#8230;success!  We logged our visit and took a &#8220;travel bug&#8221; that was in there too, before trying to hide the cache again without other people in this busy spot seeing what we were doing.  We continued back down the path to the walk&#8217;s end and treated ourselves to an ice-cream.<\/p>\n<h3>Laragh and Home<\/h3>\n<p>Glendalough is sublime, by far the most expansive glen we&#8217;ve visited.  The terrain is varied, but never too challenging, and the occasional relic of times gone by gives you something to learn about too.<\/p>\n<p>We headed home via St Kevin&#8217;s Church, Laragh where another successful (and neatly-hidden) geocache &#8211; Kevin and the Blackbird &#8211; awaited us.  When it works it&#8217;s exciting and good fun!<\/p>\n<p>Back home for dinner, games, and relaxing.  A splendid day!  Very green, very beautiful, better than Northern Ireland, but still not as rugged and charming as the west.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h3>It&#8217;s a Sign!!<\/h3>\n<p>First a note on Irish signs.  These aren&#8217;t lacking, but they are, we find, generally pretty rubbish.  They are badly placed, usually too small, occasionally not actually related to the place\/junction at which they&#8217;re located, and completely sporadic and unpredictable.  One minute a main road is signed, the next, you&#8217;re at a junction with no idea which way to turn.  This is not confined to the countryside: on our trip to Dublin last year we couldn&#8217;t find any signs for the main M1 motorway north to Belfast and spent 40 minutes driving through the suburbs.<\/p>\n<p>Someone should really have a word.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Boots or Shoes?<\/h3>\n<p>Anyway, we were feeling good today.  The forecast was for patchy rain and our target was Glendalough &#8211; &#8220;The valley of two lakes&#8221; &#8211; for some walking and Geocaching.  Morning discussion was of what sort of shoes to wear and what to take.  I suggested that we pack for a proper hike and see what happens.  Lovely wife seemed a bit more sceptical about my potential-hiking ambitions.<\/p>\n<p>We started with a quick trip to pick some information up from Wicklow&#8217;s information office and then headed straight from there to the mostly well-signposted Glendalough.<\/p>\n<h3>Glendalough and St Kevin<\/h3>\n<p>There was a bit of rain to start with but it soon cleared and we had a beautiful day of walking ahead.   Lovely wife wasn&#8217;t so keen to start with, but I encouraged her to take walking boots and a full rucksack.  I think she appreciated this in the end.<\/p>\n<p>Glendalough has a visitor centre, which is OK, but the interpretive bit wasn&#8217;t open and there wasn&#8217;t much in terms of information there, so we grabbed a walking routes map and a leaflet about the historic relics.  Total cost, 1 Euro!<\/p>\n<p>We took a quick trip round the ruins &#8211; these were impressive and old and mostly relating to St Kevin the information leaflet was, true to its name, informative, telling us some of the history and legends surrounding the site and St Kevin himself.  The gravestones were also fascinating, a huge variety of styles from across the years.  The location, in the heart of the glen, was very atmospheric, but the place was bustling with tourists.<\/p>\n<h3>Walking Glendalough<\/h3>\n<p>After a short time we set of on one of the walking routes.  These all seemed to be mostly well-paved and well sign-posted.  Previously in Ireland this has bothered me, but here it seemed fitting.  There&#8217;s a long board walk (a walk along raised wooden boards), which exists to protect the land from erosion&#8230;excellent stuff!  Walking on the marshland would not have been nice.  Sign posts and interpretative boards are there, but not over-done, making it feel slightly more wild.  The altitude and remoteness that you achieve also means that you feel like you&#8217;re doing some proper outdoorsy stuff.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than pick a single main route we made up our own route out of bits of the others &#8211; mostly in order to take in as much scenery and geocaching as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Once we&#8217;d left the busy shorter routes a lot of the people melted away and we were left pretty much to ourselves.  We climbed up a waterfall, walked through a forest, and up and over a hill onto the boardwalk.  This took us along a cliff edge with views that made the climb well worthwhile.<\/p>\n<h3>Spink and Kevin&#8217;s Dental Work<\/h3>\n<p>The first geocache, &#8220;Spink&#8221;, was a short walk uphill from the boardwalk.  It felt wrong walking over the peat and marshland when a clear trail had been provided to protect the land, but that&#8217;s what we did.  Our geocaching disappointment continued as this cache, which had been listed as &#8220;needing maintenance&#8221;, was not in its place at all.  Our lunch had been carried up in a biscuit tin and this was now empty, so we left that in the cache&#8217;s place, with a short note scribbled on a bit of paper.  At least there&#8217;s something there now!<\/p>\n<p>Back down to the boardwalk and along to the western extent of the path.  The second cache was here: a big army tin full of stuff, hiding&#8230;we won&#8217;t say where.  Finally&#8230;success!  We logged our visit and took a &#8220;travel bug&#8221; that was in there too, before trying to hide the cache again without other people in this busy spot seeing what we were doing.  We continued back down the path to the walk&#8217;s end and treated ourselves to an ice-cream.<\/p>\n<h3>Laragh and Home<\/h3>\n<p>Glendalough is sublime, by far the most expansive glen we&#8217;ve visited.  The terrain is varied, but never too challenging, and the occasional relic of times gone by gives you something to learn about too.<\/p>\n<p>We headed home via St Kevin&#8217;s Church, Laragh where another successful (and neatly-hidden) geocache &#8211; Kevin and the Blackbird &#8211; awaited us.  When it works it&#8217;s exciting and good fun!<\/p>\n<p>Back home for dinner, games, and relaxing.  A splendid day!  Very green, very beautiful, better than Northern Ireland, but still not as rugged and charming as the west.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<h3>The way of things to come<\/h3>\n<p>We had a very nice long sleep &#8211; a feature that would be present in most of our days in Ireland.  We had spotted in our room an electronic pest control device and had heard some odd noises from above &#8211; we wondered if there may be rats, but these failed to materialise in any tangible way during the course of the week&#8230;phew.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>On waking, I had a really intense stomach pain for a few hours.  To the extent that we nearly headed to hospital.  After a while it started to go though, and I took my mind off it by programming some Geocaches into GPS.  We were learning as we went along with this &#8211; both about Geocaching and how to use the GPS, so it was a slow process.  One key thing we discovered was that we could input the co-ordinates for the caches in longitude and latitude (as given on geocaching.com) and then get the GPS receiver to translate these into nice Irish Grid references for us on the map.  This COULD be done by hand, but was much more accurate with the technology, and the Irish Grid references would prove invaluable in our hunting.<\/p>\n<p>We then headed off to Wicklow Town.  The Information Centre (and most things) were shut on Sunday.  But we found a pharmacy and another Super Valu (with another Tesco nearby), that was open, which was what we needed.<\/p>\n<p>As we came out of Super Valu the Irish rain came down, but &#8211; as expected, it had all but stopped by the time we got back to the car.  It was on and off all day&#8230;all week!  Light and heavy, wet and then dry again, blazing sunshine evaporating the surface water of recent showers in a shimmering cloud of steam.<\/p>\n<h3>How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?<\/h3>\n<p>We took the back roads from Wicklow to Rathdrum for our first bit of solo Geocaching: the Maria&#8217;s Drum multi-cache (spoliers lie ahead if you&#8217;re a Geocacher who may one day go to Ireland).<\/p>\n<p>Multi-caches have several parts and are usually treasure-hunt-like affairs, with places to explore and clues o solve to find the co-ordinates of the cache.  The first two steps were easy and took in the local high street and a memorial park.  We solved the clues and calculated the co-ordinates, but the third and final part was an unexpectedly long walk away.<\/p>\n<p>We finally arrived at a small roadside shrine to the blessed virgin (I think).  We followed the GPS, which, in the tree cover, wasn&#8217;t being particularly accurate.  We followed the decoded clue.  We rummaged in the trees, we searched the stone walls for little holes, and we hunted high and low, but to no avail.<\/p>\n<p>We eventually gave up and headed back up to the town, disappointed; Geocaching isn&#8217;t supposed to be like this, it&#8217;s fun, and exciting, the trail, the search, the find!!!  But no, we failed at the first attempt.  Did we not look hard enough?  Or was it not there?  We&#8217;ve logged our &#8220;Not Found&#8221; and are waiting to see.<\/p>\n<p>We did head back for another go on our way back out of Rathdrum in the car, but still couldn&#8217;t find it.  We&#8217;re convinced the cache has been removed.  I, personally, didn&#8217;t like rummaging around in a shrine to Mary &#8211; I&#8217;m a Christian, but I&#8217;m not into the reverance for Mary that catholics have, but I also appreciate that some people will have regarded that as a sacred site.  Perhaps that&#8217;s why the cache was removed?<\/p>\n<h3>The Beach<\/h3>\n<p>We grabbed an ice cream&#8230;this would become another habit of our holiday&#8230;and then headed back to the cottage.<\/p>\n<p>Dinner was followed by an attempted walk to the nearest beach.  Our first attempt was via a farm and track but, despite the existence of a track on the map, we weren&#8217;t sure if we had a right of way across the field.  So we abandoned the route.<\/p>\n<p>The second attempt was via the road through the nearby &#8220;Missionary Sisters'&#8221; place, however, this was clearly signposted as private ground.<\/p>\n<p>So we headed back down past the farm that we first tried, for a longer, on-road route.  But we went too far along the road &#8211; which had confused me, because the map clearly showed a turning on the right towards the beach.  It turned out that the path to the beach marked on the map as &#8220;other road&#8221;, was actually a gated, narrow, pedestrian path!  Grrr.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually we found the path, and got to the beach.  It was nice and secluded &#8211; out own private bay for 20 minutes &#8211; but there was lots of litter.  As we left, some bikers arrived at the end of the path.  I suspect there&#8217;s a lot of fires and parties that go on on that little patch of sand, and we were probably fortunate to have a secluded stroll.<\/p>\n<h3>Finding our way<\/h3>\n<p>Ireland is &#8220;just over there&#8221;, and most people speak English, but Ireland can be quite different.<\/p>\n<p>Wicklow is very scenic but feels tamed.  We have OS maps but paths are not easily findable and some paths and even roads, seem to be private.  It makes you realise how open and accessible the UK is and how good it is for countryside rambling.<\/p>\n<p>We were still finding our way on the first day of our holiday.<\/p>\n",

We had spotted in our room an electronic pest control device and had heard some odd noises from above &#8211; we wondered if there may be rats, but these failed to materialise in any tangible way during the course of the week&#8230;phew.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>On waking, I had a really intense stomach pain for a few hours.  To the extent that we nearly headed to hospital.  After a while it started to go though, and I took my mind off it by programming some Geocaches into GPS.  We were learning as we went along with this &#8211; both about Geocaching and how to use the GPS, so it was a slow process.  One key thing we discovered was that we could input the co-ordinates for the caches in longitude and latitude (as given on geocaching.com) and then get the GPS receiver to translate these into nice Irish Grid references for us on the map.  This COULD be done by hand, but was much more accurate with the technology, and the Irish Grid references would prove invaluable in our hunting.<\/p>\n<p>We then headed off to Wicklow Town.  The Information Centre (and most things) were shut on Sunday.  But we found a pharmacy and another Super Valu (with another Tesco nearby), that was open, which was what we needed.<\/p>\n<p>As we came out of Super Valu the Irish rain came down, but &#8211; as expected, it had all but stopped by the time we got back to the car.  It was on and off all day&#8230;all week!  Light and heavy, wet and then dry again, blazing sunshine evaporating the surface water of recent showers in a shimmering cloud of steam.<\/p>\n<h3>How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?<\/h3>\n<p>We took the back roads from Wicklow to Rathdrum for our first bit of solo Geocaching: the Maria&#8217;s Drum multi-cache (spoliers lie ahead if you&#8217;re a Geocacher who may one day go to Ireland).<\/p>\n<p>Multi-caches have several parts and are usually treasure-hunt-like affairs, with places to explore and clues o solve to find the co-ordinates of the cache.  The first two steps were easy and took in the local high street and a memorial park.  We solved the clues and calculated the co-ordinates, but the third and final part was an unexpectedly long walk away.<\/p>\n<p>We finally arrived at a small roadside shrine to the blessed virgin (I think).  We followed the GPS, which, in the tree cover, wasn&#8217;t being particularly accurate.  We followed the decoded clue.  We rummaged in the trees, we searched the stone walls for little holes, and we hunted high and low, but to no avail.<\/p>\n<p>We eventually gave up and headed back up to the town, disappointed; Geocaching isn&#8217;t supposed to be like this, it&#8217;s fun, and exciting, the trail, the search, the find!!!  But no, we failed at the first attempt.  Did we not look hard enough?  Or was it not there?  We&#8217;ve logged our &#8220;Not Found&#8221; and are waiting to see.<\/p>\n<p>We did head back for another go on our way back out of Rathdrum in the car, but still couldn&#8217;t find it.  We&#8217;re convinced the cache has been removed.  I, personally, didn&#8217;t like rummaging around in a shrine to Mary &#8211; I&#8217;m a Christian, but I&#8217;m not into the reverance for Mary that catholics have, but I also appreciate that some people will have regarded that as a sacred site.  Perhaps that&#8217;s why the cache was removed?<\/p>\n<h3>The Beach<\/h3>\n<p>We grabbed an ice cream&#8230;this would become another habit of our holiday&#8230;and then headed back to the cottage.<\/p>\n<p>Dinner was followed by an attempted walk to the nearest beach.  Our first attempt was via a farm and track but, despite the existence of a track on the map, we weren&#8217;t sure if we had a right of way across the field.  So we abandoned the route.<\/p>\n<p>The second attempt was via the road through the nearby &#8220;Missionary Sisters'&#8221; place, however, this was clearly signposted as private ground.<\/p>\n<p>So we headed back down past the farm that we first tried, for a longer, on-road route.  But we went too far along the road &#8211; which had confused me, because the map clearly showed a turning on the right towards the beach.  It turned out that the path to the beach marked on the map as &#8220;other road&#8221;, was actually a gated, narrow, pedestrian path!  Grrr.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually we found the path, and got to the beach.  It was nice and secluded &#8211; out own private bay for 20 minutes &#8211; but there was lots of litter.  As we left, some bikers arrived at the end of the path.  I suspect there&#8217;s a lot of fires and parties that go on on that little patch of sand, and we were probably fortunate to have a secluded stroll.<\/p>\n<h3>Finding our way<\/h3>\n<p>Ireland is &#8220;just over there&#8221;, and most people speak English, but Ireland can be quite different.<\/p>\n<p>Wicklow is very scenic but feels tamed.  We have OS maps but paths are not easily findable and some paths and even roads, seem to be private.  It makes you realise how open and accessible the UK is and how good it is for countryside rambling.<\/p>\n<p>We were still finding our way on the first day of our holiday.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<h3>An Early Start<\/h3>\n<p>It was an early start on the first Saturday.  Holidays shouldn&#8217;t start so early, but as my sister said, it meant that we didn&#8217;t just spend the whole day travelling, and we got there with some hours to relax and find our way around before bedtime.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>We were crossing from Fishguard to Rosslare on the Ferry with our little car.  We toyed with doing Rail-Sail, which worked out pretty cheap, but by the time you&#8217;ve taken into account hiring a car at the other end and the inflexibility of having to carry all your luggage, the ferry wasn&#8217;t too bad in terms of value.<\/p>\n<h3>On and on<\/h3>\n<p>The M4 goes on much longer than I thought.  And Wales goes on much further than that!  I know that this is a generalisation, but people drive crazy in Wales &#8211; they go much faster than mandatory speed limits, even where these are explicitly for safety reasons.<\/p>\n<p>Traffic was very quiet so early in the morning and we arrived nice and early.  Ports aren&#8217;t great places to have to spend a couple of hours, but we waited around at Fishguard, enjoying a cuppa and a pastry, and passing the time with a game of cribbage (which we&#8217;ve recently discovered).<\/p>\n<h3>Food for thought<\/h3>\n<p>Eventually we got going.  The crossing &#8211; on the &#8220;express&#8221; ferry &#8211; was good (actually, in hindsight and with the experience of the crossing back, it wasn&#8217;t THAT good) but we both felt sea sick &#8211; which has never happened to me before.  At first we wondered if we were hungry, so we ordered some nice-looking pies, but nether of us could face eating more than half of it.  We resorted to standing on deck, and wishing it would be over quickly.<\/p>\n<p>We were on time into Rosslare.  We disembarked and had a quick and easy, journey to Blackditch &#8211; our home for the week &#8211; via the surprisingly-large town of Arklow.  The good old Irish supermarket &#8220;Supa Value&#8221; is still here but, further down the road was evidence that Tesco is taking over this country too.  Food is EXPENSIVE here &#8211; the weak pound contributes, but even so, the number of Euros we were paying was high!!!<\/p>\n<h3>Cottages and Games<\/h3>\n<p>Blackditch turned out to be less of a village and more an un-signed collection of houses.  We drove passed at first but eventually worked out where we needed to be and we were welcomed by our landlord for the week.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shamrockcottages.co.uk\/properties\/wicklow\/wicklow-1\/\">The cottage<\/a> we stayed in was lovely and the pictures on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shamrockcottages.co.uk\/\">Shamrock Cottages<\/a> website didn&#8217;t do it justice.  We were expecting much smaller bedrooms, but the whole place was much bigger than we expected.<\/p>\n<p>The weather was fine and we sat outside and had a restful afternoon.  The evening was spent playing my new, birthday-present card game, Munchkin: A possibly slightly over-complicated parody of fantasy role-playing games, which is fun but, we thing, more fun with 3 or more players.<\/p>\n<p>After an early morning we had an early night and were looking forward to exploring County Wicklow in the days to come.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h3>An Early Start<\/h3>\n<p>It was an early start on the first Saturday.  Holidays shouldn&#8217;t start so early, but as my sister said, it meant that we didn&#8217;t just spend the whole day travelling, and we got there with some hours to relax and find our way around before bedtime.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>We were crossing from Fishguard to Rosslare on the Ferry with our little car.  We toyed with doing Rail-Sail, which worked out pretty cheap, but by the time you&#8217;ve taken into account hiring a car at the other end and the inflexibility of having to carry all your luggage, the ferry wasn&#8217;t too bad in terms of value.<\/p>\n<h3>On and on<\/h3>\n<p>The M4 goes on much longer than I thought.  And Wales goes on much further than that!  I know that this is a generalisation, but people drive crazy in Wales &#8211; they go much faster than mandatory speed limits, even where these are explicitly for safety reasons.<\/p>\n<p>Traffic was very quiet so early in the morning and we arrived nice and early.  Ports aren&#8217;t great places to have to spend a couple of hours, but we waited around at Fishguard, enjoying a cuppa and a pastry, and passing the time with a game of cribbage (which we&#8217;ve recently discovered).<\/p>\n<h3>Food for thought<\/h3>\n<p>Eventually we got going.  The crossing &#8211; on the &#8220;express&#8221; ferry &#8211; was good (actually, in hindsight and with the experience of the crossing back, it wasn&#8217;t THAT good) but we both felt sea sick &#8211; which has never happened to me before.  At first we wondered if we were hungry, so we ordered some nice-looking pies, but nether of us could face eating more than half of it.  We resorted to standing on deck, and wishing it would be over quickly.<\/p>\n<p>We were on time into Rosslare.  We disembarked and had a quick and easy, journey to Blackditch &#8211; our home for the week &#8211; via the surprisingly-large town of Arklow.  The good old Irish supermarket &#8220;Supa Value&#8221; is still here but, further down the road was evidence that Tesco is taking over this country too.  Food is EXPENSIVE here &#8211; the weak pound contributes, but even so, the number of Euros we were paying was high!!!<\/p>\n<h3>Cottages and Games<\/h3>\n<p>Blackditch turned out to be less of a village and more an un-signed collection of houses.  We drove passed at first but eventually worked out where we needed to be and we were welcomed by our landlord for the week.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shamrockcottages.co.uk\/properties\/wicklow\/wicklow-1\/\">The cottage<\/a> we stayed in was lovely and the pictures on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shamrockcottages.co.uk\/\">Shamrock Cottages<\/a> website didn&#8217;t do it justice.  We were expecting much smaller bedrooms, but the whole place was much bigger than we expected.<\/p>\n<p>The weather was fine and we sat outside and had a restful afternoon.  The evening was spent playing my new, birthday-present card game, Munchkin: A possibly slightly over-complicated parody of fantasy role-playing games, which is fun but, we thing, more fun with 3 or more players.<\/p>\n<p>After an early morning we had an early night and were looking forward to exploring County Wicklow in the days to come.<\/p>\n",

Partly because I want to remember what&#8217;s happened, so that I can refer back when I need to.  And partly for the benefit of others.  When people want to know what our holiday in such-and-such a place was like, where we stayed and ate, and what we enjoyed and learned, I can just refer them here.<\/p>\n<p>So comes my write up of a week in Wicklow, on the East Coast of Ireland.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Introduction: Cottages and Caches<\/h3>\n<p>We love Ireland.  I&#8217;ve visited the Dingle Peninsula in the south-west twice now, once with lovely wife and once, many years ago, with others.  We&#8217;ve done Northern Ireland, and so, this year, we thought we&#8217;d try the east coast.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d heard good things about Wicklow and there&#8217;s a national park with some mountains in, so we booked some time off, a small cottage, and a ferry, and planned our trip away.<\/p>\n<p>Finding a cottage for two is hard.  Most are much bigger, or really pokey and small, so we booked into a 4-bed cottage, accepting the extra cost as the price for some extra space.<\/p>\n<p>We got online and bought some Ordnance Survey of Ireland, 1:50,000, &#8220;Explorer&#8221; maps, and a Harvey map of the Wicklow Mountains.  We ordered a book of mountain walks too, but it didn&#8217;t arrive in time.  Our experience of walking in Ireland is that it&#8217;s not as easy as the UK &#8211; land is less accessible, paths are not as clear, and maps are not as easy to get hold of, so we wanted as much information as we could get up front.<\/p>\n<p>We also managed to get hold of a GPS receiver.  After our long weekend in the Lakes with some friends who introduced us to the &#8220;sport&#8221; of Geocaching, we&#8217;ve been wanting to incorporate some geocaching of our own into a holiday.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, our birthdays are both in early June and some very kind people clubbed together to get us a Garmin eTrex Legend H: slightly above the basic model with mapping capability and some geocaching features.<\/p>\n<p>We printed out details of a pile of caches before we went, as access to the Internet and a printer was not expected to be easy to find.<\/p>\n<p>So, booked, packed, equipped, and informed, we expectantly headed to bed early on Friday night.<\/p>\n",

Partly because I want to remember what&#8217;s happened, so that I can refer back when I need to.  And partly for the benefit of others.  When people want to know what our holiday in such-and-such a place was like, where we stayed and ate, and what we enjoyed and learned, I can just refer them here.<\/p>\n<p>So comes my write up of a week in Wicklow, on the East Coast of Ireland.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Introduction: Cottages and Caches<\/h3>\n<p>We love Ireland.  I&#8217;ve visited the Dingle Peninsula in the south-west twice now, once with lovely wife and once, many years ago, with others.  We&#8217;ve done Northern Ireland, and so, this year, we thought we&#8217;d try the east coast.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d heard good things about Wicklow and there&#8217;s a national park with some mountains in, so we booked some time off, a small cottage, and a ferry, and planned our trip away.<\/p>\n<p>Finding a cottage for two is hard.  Most are much bigger, or really pokey and small, so we booked into a 4-bed cottage, accepting the extra cost as the price for some extra space.<\/p>\n<p>We got online and bought some Ordnance Survey of Ireland, 1:50,000, &#8220;Explorer&#8221; maps, and a Harvey map of the Wicklow Mountains.  We ordered a book of mountain walks too, but it didn&#8217;t arrive in time.  Our experience of walking in Ireland is that it&#8217;s not as easy as the UK &#8211; land is less accessible, paths are not as clear, and maps are not as easy to get hold of, so we wanted as much information as we could get up front.<\/p>\n<p>We also managed to get hold of a GPS receiver.  After our long weekend in the Lakes with some friends who introduced us to the &#8220;sport&#8221; of Geocaching, we&#8217;ve been wanting to incorporate some geocaching of our own into a holiday.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, our birthdays are both in early June and some very kind people clubbed together to get us a Garmin eTrex Legend H: slightly above the basic model with mapping capability and some geocaching features.<\/p>\n<p>We printed out details of a pile of caches before we went, as access to the Internet and a printer was not expected to be easy to find.<\/p>\n<p>So, booked, packed, equipped, and informed, we expectantly headed to bed early on Friday night.<\/p>\n",

Does he want a high-five?\u00a0 What should I do?<\/p>\n<p>No time to change my mind now&#8230;I&#8217;m going.\u00a0 I&#8217;ll give a cheery &#8220;Thanks mate&#8221; as I go past.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Thanks mate!!!!!!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Hang on.\u00a0 What WAS he doing?\u00a0 I know I&#8217;ll look back.<\/p>\n<p>CRIKEY!!! He&#8217;s just completed a right turn into that field.\u00a0 I could have been run down!!!<\/p>\n<p>Oo-err.<\/p>\n<p>In hindsight, the poor tractor driver did exactly the right thing and gave the clearest possible signal that he could.\u00a0 I simply didn&#8217;t get it.\u00a0 I&#8217;m not used to seeing hand signals from vehicles, and I&#8217;m not used to seeing vehicles turn right where there&#8217;s nowhere to turn into.<\/p>\n<p>Still, I&#8217;m safe, and I&#8217;ve learned something.<\/p>\n<p>Stupid cyclists!!!<\/p>\n",

Despite being a leftie, if given the choice I think I&#8217;d vote Cameron!<\/p>\n<h3>So who to vote for<\/h3>\n<p>But, no&#8230;I can&#8217;t bring myself to vote Tory.\u00a0 The expenses stuff has just reinforced that they&#8217;re mostly rich people who don&#8217;t have a clue about the real world.<\/p>\n<p>I probably should vote Labour, but I think the party is in disarray and I can&#8217;t bring myself to do that either.<\/p>\n<p>BNP and UKIP are definite no-go areas.\u00a0 So of the well-known parties I&#8217;m left with Lib Dems and Greens.<\/p>\n<p>Both of which are quite appealing!<\/p>\n<h3>So&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>Of course, I&#8217;m not saying what I decided.\u00a0 I DID vote though, I think it&#8217;s hugely important to be a part of the political process.\u00a0 I shall be making sure my elected representatives do represent me too by writing and expressing my views.<\/p>\n<p>And I shall be praying.\u00a0 Our leaders need any help they can get right now!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>The infrequency with which I write about politics does not to justice to how important I think it is.\u00a0 The last few weeks have been fairly tumuluous politically and today I got to vote in the European elections so maybe it&#8217;s time to reflect a little on things.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Where I stand<\/h3>\n<p>Before you get carried away &#8211; I&#8217;m NOT standing in the European elections.\u00a0 Phew!<\/p>\n<p>But I did a little political orientation test night and came out as slightly &#8220;left&#8221; and slightly &#8220;libertarian&#8221;, somewhere near Ghandi I think.<\/p>\n<p>I place a large amount of value in honesty and trustworhtiness, and I dislike party politics and the bickering we so often see that, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, wastes time and money and gets in the way of government of our country.<\/p>\n<p>I like my leaders to be good at making decisions about things and sticking to those decisions once made, but I also believe that it&#8217;s OK to get things wrong and that humility, apologies and a desire to learn from mistakes and put things right counts for much too.<\/p>\n<h3>Expenses<\/h3>\n<p>So from that you can probably guess that I&#8217;m not hugely impressed with the expenses scandal.\u00a0 On two fronts:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The system is bloody awful.\u00a0 Any commercial organisation would have a strict policy on what is and isn&#8217;t allowed, expenses-wise, backed up by a bunch of people who check expenses about that policy.\u00a0 Repeated breach of policy results in disciplinary action&#8230;and so on.\u00a0 What&#8217;s so hard?\u00a0 Why is our government not run like a business?\u00a0 We can&#8217;t see money leaking away like this!<\/li>\n<li>The MPs, at least those who&#8217;ve been caught being naughty, are dishonest and untrustworthy.\u00a0 They&#8217;ve manipulated the system for personal gain.\u00a0 If I did this with my expenses I&#8217;d be fired!\u00a0 But more than that, I wouldn&#8217;t do that with my expenses because it&#8217;s WRONG!\u00a0 But worse than that, it shows how out of touch politicians are.\u00a0 There are people that can&#8217;t afford their rent or mortgage, yet alone for gardeners, cleaners, or huge amounts of expensive food.\u00a0 It is, frankly, unjust.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve worked on customer site for months at a time.\u00a0 It&#8217;s tough leading a double life in two different places and having somewhere nice to live makes it much nicer.\u00a0 But there are limits.<\/p>\n<h3>Our PM<\/h3>\n<p>As I write, James Purnell has just resigned from government and called for Gordon Brown to step down, and I&#8217;ve no doubt that our Prime Minister will not last the weekend in his post.<\/p>\n<p>I actually like Gordon Brown, I think he has potential to be a good PM.\u00a0 But I find that he&#8217;s useless at making decisions.\u00a0 He seems to sway between opinions and not make his mind up, or make his mind up too late.\u00a0 In contrast, David Cameron is quick, sharp, decisive.\u00a0 I&#8217;m not sure either has enough well-defined policies for me to want to vote for them. Despite being a leftie, if given the choice I think I&#8217;d vote Cameron!<\/p>\n<h3>So who to vote for<\/h3>\n<p>But, no&#8230;I can&#8217;t bring myself to vote Tory.\u00a0 The expenses stuff has just reinforced that they&#8217;re mostly rich people who don&#8217;t have a clue about the real world.<\/p>\n<p>I probably should vote Labour, but I think the party is in disarray and I can&#8217;t bring myself to do that either.<\/p>\n<p>BNP and UKIP are definite no-go areas.\u00a0 So of the well-known parties I&#8217;m left with Lib Dems and Greens.<\/p>\n<p>Both of which are quite appealing!<\/p>\n<h3>So&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>Of course, I&#8217;m not saying what I decided.\u00a0 I DID vote though, I think it&#8217;s hugely important to be a part of the political process.\u00a0 I shall be making sure my elected representatives do represent me too by writing and expressing my views.<\/p>\n<p>And I shall be praying.\u00a0 Our leaders need any help they can get right now!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>It&#8217;s with some trepidation that I approach writing an article about my church mens&#8217; walking weekend.\u00a0 There are so many traps to fall into.\u00a0 Worn out cliches about men in caves and male bonding.\u00a0 Stereotypes of football-loving and beer-swigging blokes.\u00a0 And the risk of appearing sexist as I try to explain my way around the differences between men and women.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve decided to avoid trying to answer the question I&#8217;ve been asked so many times&#8230;&#8221;Why is it men only?&#8221;\u00a0 Let&#8217;s just start with the fact that, once a year, the men, and only the men, of our church are invited to head off together for a weekend of walking, eating and socialising.<\/p>\n<p>And, despite loving the outdoors, I&#8217;ve managed to miss this event for as long as I&#8217;ve been at the church.\u00a0 So, as soon as I learned the date of this years weekend I was booked on, and nothing was going to stop me.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Day 1<\/h3>\n<p>The early start came at the end of a long week but I was up and out of the door and looking forward to arriving in Devon for our first trek.<\/p>\n<p>We convened at the services on the way for a much needed coffee and some introductions before proceeding to Shipley Bridge for a days walking on Dartmoor.\u00a0 The walk started with a picturesque rise up a pretty valley with a sparkling, bubbling stream and we quickly lost the two budding photographers in the group.<\/p>\n<p>They soon caught us up again but their hobby was just one example of what was great about the weekend; though us men do have a lot in common, there was great diversity in the group.\u00a0 I spoke to chemists, martial arts instructors, magistrates, accountants, and several ordained ministers (all, bizarrely called David) and what a wealth of interests, wit and wisdom.\u00a0 It was great to get introduced to some friends of friends who had come along and to get to know better some people from USBC.\u00a0 There was rarely a dull moment.<\/p>\n<p>The highlight of the day was surely Tim&#8217;s lunchtime &#8220;dive&#8221; to retrieve a camera lens filter from the bottom of the river.\u00a0 Quite how it got there and why someone with a longer arm didn&#8217;t help out I don&#8217;t recall.<\/p>\n<p>After about 8 miles or so we were back at the cars and a short drive took us to the beautiful town of Salcombe.\u00a0 The Youth Hostel we were staying in was up a windy road in a building shared with a National Trust property.\u00a0 It was a great location with excellent views and I promptly chose a bed with a sea view.<\/p>\n<p>Now you might think that this sounds like an out-of-the-way, remote, beautiful location and that with all the peace and quiet, sea air, and a hard day&#8217;s walking behind us, we&#8217;d have a great night&#8217;s sleep.\u00a0 But noooooo.\u00a0 It soon became apparent that some of the party were in training for the 2012 Olympic snoring team.\u00a0 Rumour has it that I even took my duvet and de-camped to a sofa in the hostel&#8217;s lounge &#8211; much to the surprise of some children who wanted to watch the TV early the next morning.<\/p>\n<h3>Day 2<\/h3>\n<p>We awoke to glorious sunshine over the south Devon coast.\u00a0 The YHA put on a plentiful breakfast and did a good trade in ear plugs.\u00a0 We congregated with our rucksacks and began day 2.<\/p>\n<p>The walk was west along the south-west coast path to Hope (this is the name of the town, in case you were wondering) and then back, inland through Malborough, to Salcombe.<\/p>\n<p>I confess that I don&#8217;t remember much of the walk.\u00a0 The weather was glorious, the scenery spectacular, the conversation interesting, and racing the youngest of the group uphill extremely exhausting.\u00a0 Mental note: don&#8217;t try that again.\u00a0 Another mental note &#8211; don&#8217;t ever enter a competition with Steve&#8230;he&#8217;s a blatant cheat!<\/p>\n<p>We stopped for lunch in Hope Bay, a few popped to the pub briefly, and some others got lost and needed rounding up.<\/p>\n<p>The walk back wasn&#8217;t quite so interesting, though we saw lots of sheep and I got to hear what an abomination bungalows are.\u00a0 We were all quite glad to get back to the hostel for a cup of coffee.<\/p>\n<p>It was at around this point that someone started talking about 4-dimensional objects and I got dragged into giving a science lesson convering some of the trickier aspects of physics.\u00a0 An experience that has stuck with me.\u00a0 (Note to men: You all know about the theory of relativity now, so I&#8217;ll be preparing next years lesson on quantum physics!)<\/p>\n<p>Dinner was reasonable.\u00a0 After Buttermere YHA, my hopes for the hostel were a little high and probably not quite met.\u00a0 The evening ended with quizes, and games and I learned to play &#8220;Bucket King&#8221;&#8230;ask Tim if you REALLY want to know.<\/p>\n<p>The second night&#8217;s sleep was much better &#8211; I reckon most didn&#8217;t have the energy for snoring!<\/p>\n<h3>Day 3<\/h3>\n<p>Mixing it up a little, Sunday&#8217;s trip was across Salcome Estuary on a small ferry.\u00a0 The walking was slightly less energetic, and we explored the sandy beach and watched small dinghy&#8217;s racing.<\/p>\n<p>We gathered on a small grassy mound and were led in some devotions, songs, prayers and a simple service of communion.\u00a0 I confess that I was slightly self-concious, but it was good to be praising God in the open air on such a glorious day.<\/p>\n<p>We walked, east this time, round the coastal path and had lunch on a beautiful bay where some even unexpectedly indulged in a little swim.\u00a0 I&#8217;m hoping that someone brings a bigger towel next year, for the sake of anyone who was looking on!<\/p>\n<p>I was sad to leave that cove and start the final part of our expedition, but the weekened was drawing to a close.<\/p>\n<p>The walk back seemed long and slow, but we eventually arrived back at the cars.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d had a thoroughly enjoyable weekend with some great people, making new friends, and exploring the beautiful south coast of England.\u00a0 I was tired but refreshed.\u00a0 And already looking forward to next year&#8217;s trip!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>It&#8217;s with some trepidation that I approach writing an article about my church mens&#8217; walking weekend.\u00a0 There are so many traps to fall into.\u00a0 Worn out cliches about men in caves and male bonding.\u00a0 Stereotypes of football-loving and beer-swigging blokes.\u00a0 And the risk of appearing sexist as I try to explain my way around the differences between men and women.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve decided to avoid trying to answer the question I&#8217;ve been asked so many times&#8230;&#8221;Why is it men only?&#8221;\u00a0 Let&#8217;s just start with the fact that, once a year, the men, and only the men, of our church are invited to head off together for a weekend of walking, eating and socialising.<\/p>\n<p>And, despite loving the outdoors, I&#8217;ve managed to miss this event for as long as I&#8217;ve been at the church.\u00a0 So, as soon as I learned the date of this years weekend I was booked on, and nothing was going to stop me.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Day 1<\/h3>\n<p>The early start came at the end of a long week but I was up and out of the door and looking forward to arriving in Devon for our first trek.<\/p>\n<p>We convened at the services on the way for a much needed coffee and some introductions before proceeding to Shipley Bridge for a days walking on Dartmoor.\u00a0 The walk started with a picturesque rise up a pretty valley with a sparkling, bubbling stream and we quickly lost the two budding photographers in the group.<\/p>\n<p>They soon caught us up again but their hobby was just one example of what was great about the weekend; though us men do have a lot in common, there was great diversity in the group.\u00a0 I spoke to chemists, martial arts instructors, magistrates, accountants, and several ordained ministers (all, bizarrely called David) and what a wealth of interests, wit and wisdom.\u00a0 It was great to get introduced to some friends of friends who had come along and to get to know better some people from USBC.\u00a0 There was rarely a dull moment.<\/p>\n<p>The highlight of the day was surely Tim&#8217;s lunchtime &#8220;dive&#8221; to retrieve a camera lens filter from the bottom of the river.\u00a0 Quite how it got there and why someone with a longer arm didn&#8217;t help out I don&#8217;t recall.<\/p>\n<p>After about 8 miles or so we were back at the cars and a short drive took us to the beautiful town of Salcombe.\u00a0 The Youth Hostel we were staying in was up a windy road in a building shared with a National Trust property.\u00a0 It was a great location with excellent views and I promptly chose a bed with a sea view.<\/p>\n<p>Now you might think that this sounds like an out-of-the-way, remote, beautiful location and that with all the peace and quiet, sea air, and a hard day&#8217;s walking behind us, we&#8217;d have a great night&#8217;s sleep.\u00a0 But noooooo.\u00a0 It soon became apparent that some of the party were in training for the 2012 Olympic snoring team.\u00a0 Rumour has it that I even took my duvet and de-camped to a sofa in the hostel&#8217;s lounge &#8211; much to the surprise of some children who wanted to watch the TV early the next morning.<\/p>\n<h3>Day 2<\/h3>\n<p>We awoke to glorious sunshine over the south Devon coast.\u00a0 The YHA put on a plentiful breakfast and did a good trade in ear plugs.\u00a0 We congregated with our rucksacks and began day 2.<\/p>\n<p>The walk was west along the south-west coast path to Hope (this is the name of the town, in case you were wondering) and then back, inland through Malborough, to Salcombe.<\/p>\n<p>I confess that I don&#8217;t remember much of the walk.\u00a0 The weather was glorious, the scenery spectacular, the conversation interesting, and racing the youngest of the group uphill extremely exhausting.\u00a0 Mental note: don&#8217;t try that again.\u00a0 Another mental note &#8211; don&#8217;t ever enter a competition with Steve&#8230;he&#8217;s a blatant cheat!<\/p>\n<p>We stopped for lunch in Hope Bay, a few popped to the pub briefly, and some others got lost and needed rounding up.<\/p>\n<p>The walk back wasn&#8217;t quite so interesting, though we saw lots of sheep and I got to hear what an abomination bungalows are.\u00a0 We were all quite glad to get back to the hostel for a cup of coffee.<\/p>\n<p>It was at around this point that someone started talking about 4-dimensional objects and I got dragged into giving a science lesson convering some of the trickier aspects of physics.\u00a0 An experience that has stuck with me.\u00a0 (Note to men: You all know about the theory of relativity now, so I&#8217;ll be preparing next years lesson on quantum physics!)<\/p>\n<p>Dinner was reasonable.\u00a0 After Buttermere YHA, my hopes for the hostel were a little high and probably not quite met.\u00a0 The evening ended with quizes, and games and I learned to play &#8220;Bucket King&#8221;&#8230;ask Tim if you REALLY want to know.<\/p>\n<p>The second night&#8217;s sleep was much better &#8211; I reckon most didn&#8217;t have the energy for snoring!<\/p>\n<h3>Day 3<\/h3>\n<p>Mixing it up a little, Sunday&#8217;s trip was across Salcome Estuary on a small ferry.\u00a0 The walking was slightly less energetic, and we explored the sandy beach and watched small dinghy&#8217;s racing.<\/p>\n<p>We gathered on a small grassy mound and were led in some devotions, songs, prayers and a simple service of communion.\u00a0 I confess that I was slightly self-concious, but it was good to be praising God in the open air on such a glorious day.<\/p>\n<p>We walked, east this time, round the coastal path and had lunch on a beautiful bay where some even unexpectedly indulged in a little swim.\u00a0 I&#8217;m hoping that someone brings a bigger towel next year, for the sake of anyone who was looking on!<\/p>\n<p>I was sad to leave that cove and start the final part of our expedition, but the weekened was drawing to a close.<\/p>\n<p>The walk back seemed long and slow, but we eventually arrived back at the cars.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d had a thoroughly enjoyable weekend with some great people, making new friends, and exploring the beautiful south coast of England.\u00a0 I was tired but refreshed.\u00a0 And already looking forward to next year&#8217;s trip!<\/p>\n",
