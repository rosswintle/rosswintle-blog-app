Our aim has been to be outdoors as much as we can, and do some hill walking if possible.  While we&#8217;ve certainly been to mountain height, we&#8217;ve still not really &#8220;climbed a mountain&#8221;, and so last night we planned a hike up Tonelagee (817m).<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But when we awoke we decided that the forecast, was, and always had been, better for Friday than for Thursday, so we put off the big walk until tomorrow.  So today was the backup plan&#8230;a trip up the military road, through Sally Gap, stopping off to do some shorter walks to pick up our last Geocaches.<\/p>\n<h3>Trooping and Paddock Hill<\/h3>\n<p>First stop, &#8220;Trooping&#8221; at the foot of Trooperstown Hill.  Not much of a climb from the Trooperstown car park to get to this, but we did have to carefully pick our way through lots of spiky gorse and muddy, marshy ground.  It was well worth it though, as we were treated to more great scenery, hidden away by a remote bit of river.<\/p>\n<p>Then, back to the car and up to &#8220;Paddock Hill&#8221;.  The recommended route is not from the south, as we did it, but there was a route on the map and we gave it a go.  It was mostly easy, but we lost the path at one point and ended up in what&#8217;s best described as a graveyard for old fir trees.  The cache was easily found on the summit to glorious views of the surrounding peaks (Scarr, Brockagh, Tonelagee) and some fierce, blustery winds.<\/p>\n<h3>Blown Away<\/h3>\n<p>Having bagged a minor peak (Paddock Hill is 357m and, I think, technically a mountain), we headed back to the car to find another place to park up and find some more.  We headed up to the Wicklow Gap, which is quite a climb up to 476m in the car.  We parked up and got out the car only to be nearly blown away.  We toyed with picking up Turlough Hill, a walk up to the reservoir at 692m, but the path was on the exposed side of the hill and we decided that it would either be to cold or to dangerous to head up in such a strong wind.<\/p>\n<p>So we opted to head down hill, and down wind, to &#8220;Wicklow Gold&#8221;.  This was along St Kevin&#8217;s Way, which, apparently, was once paved, but is now mostly boggy marsh.  This was another quick and easy one, though the walk back to the car &#8211; uphill and into the wind, while losing the path in some more boggy marshland &#8211; was not so pleasant.<\/p>\n<h3>Through the Gap<\/h3>\n<p>Weather was still not good so we decided to skip &#8220;Turlough Hill&#8221; and hit the military road.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, I hadn&#8217;t paid much attention to the detail of the map for this drive.  In my head it was a fairly main road and pretty straight.  But the military had other ideas when building it &#8211; mostly their idea was to build a road through the mountains, following the contours, peaking at 524m and crossing a barren and spectacular landscape.  The drive started well, and after a steady climb we got to take in Glenmacnass waterfall and to see Tonelagee a bit closer up.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after Glenmacnass though, the road got increasingly narrow, twisty and remote.  We drove for quite some time across a flatish moorland, surrounded by some high peaks.  It felt incredibly wild and it was exhilarating just being there.  The light played off the cliffs and hillsides, shadows of the clouds brought a moody, atmospheric feel to the place, and there was no one &#8211; no one! &#8211; for miles.  We were even treated to what felt like our own, personal rainbow.<\/p>\n<p>If you come to Wicklow, take time out to head up the military road through the Sally Gap.  I promise, it&#8217;s spectacular!<\/p>\n<p>We headed back from Enniskerry on the N11, wilderness behind us, and a fun evening of learning old card games, and remembering some old ones &#8211; shed, slam, nines and so on.<\/p>\n<p>One more full day to go &#8211; the forecast is still good for tomorrow, though I&#8217;m worried it will still be windy.  We will pack, rise early, and head to Tonelagee for a short hike.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h3>To Walk or not to Walk, that is the question<\/h3>\n<p>Despite it being predictably unpredictable, We&#8217;ve been trying our best to closely watch the weather this week.  Our aim has been to be outdoors as much as we can, and do some hill walking if possible.  While we&#8217;ve certainly been to mountain height, we&#8217;ve still not really &#8220;climbed a mountain&#8221;, and so last night we planned a hike up Tonelagee (817m).<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But when we awoke we decided that the forecast, was, and always had been, better for Friday than for Thursday, so we put off the big walk until tomorrow.  So today was the backup plan&#8230;a trip up the military road, through Sally Gap, stopping off to do some shorter walks to pick up our last Geocaches.<\/p>\n<h3>Trooping and Paddock Hill<\/h3>\n<p>First stop, &#8220;Trooping&#8221; at the foot of Trooperstown Hill.  Not much of a climb from the Trooperstown car park to get to this, but we did have to carefully pick our way through lots of spiky gorse and muddy, marshy ground.  It was well worth it though, as we were treated to more great scenery, hidden away by a remote bit of river.<\/p>\n<p>Then, back to the car and up to &#8220;Paddock Hill&#8221;.  The recommended route is not from the south, as we did it, but there was a route on the map and we gave it a go.  It was mostly easy, but we lost the path at one point and ended up in what&#8217;s best described as a graveyard for old fir trees.  The cache was easily found on the summit to glorious views of the surrounding peaks (Scarr, Brockagh, Tonelagee) and some fierce, blustery winds.<\/p>\n<h3>Blown Away<\/h3>\n<p>Having bagged a minor peak (Paddock Hill is 357m and, I think, technically a mountain), we headed back to the car to find another place to park up and find some more.  We headed up to the Wicklow Gap, which is quite a climb up to 476m in the car.  We parked up and got out the car only to be nearly blown away.  We toyed with picking up Turlough Hill, a walk up to the reservoir at 692m, but the path was on the exposed side of the hill and we decided that it would either be to cold or to dangerous to head up in such a strong wind.<\/p>\n<p>So we opted to head down hill, and down wind, to &#8220;Wicklow Gold&#8221;.  This was along St Kevin&#8217;s Way, which, apparently, was once paved, but is now mostly boggy marsh.  This was another quick and easy one, though the walk back to the car &#8211; uphill and into the wind, while losing the path in some more boggy marshland &#8211; was not so pleasant.<\/p>\n<h3>Through the Gap<\/h3>\n<p>Weather was still not good so we decided to skip &#8220;Turlough Hill&#8221; and hit the military road.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, I hadn&#8217;t paid much attention to the detail of the map for this drive.  In my head it was a fairly main road and pretty straight.  But the military had other ideas when building it &#8211; mostly their idea was to build a road through the mountains, following the contours, peaking at 524m and crossing a barren and spectacular landscape.  The drive started well, and after a steady climb we got to take in Glenmacnass waterfall and to see Tonelagee a bit closer up.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after Glenmacnass though, the road got increasingly narrow, twisty and remote.  We drove for quite some time across a flatish moorland, surrounded by some high peaks.  It felt incredibly wild and it was exhilarating just being there.  The light played off the cliffs and hillsides, shadows of the clouds brought a moody, atmospheric feel to the place, and there was no one &#8211; no one! &#8211; for miles.  We were even treated to what felt like our own, personal rainbow.<\/p>\n<p>If you come to Wicklow, take time out to head up the military road through the Sally Gap.  I promise, it&#8217;s spectacular!<\/p>\n<p>We headed back from Enniskerry on the N11, wilderness behind us, and a fun evening of learning old card games, and remembering some old ones &#8211; shed, slam, nines and so on.<\/p>\n<p>One more full day to go &#8211; the forecast is still good for tomorrow, though I&#8217;m worried it will still be windy.  We will pack, rise early, and head to Tonelagee for a short hike.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ve left out much detail but if you think any of what I&#8217;ve said is inappropriate then let me know and I&#8217;ll remove it.]<\/p>\n<h3>It&#8217;s Been on My Mind<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to write about cycle helmets for ages but recent events have brought to the fore my want to share what I think.<\/p>\n<p>A friend of mine was knocked off his bike and landed on his head, crushing a vertebrae.\u00a0 His helmet was severely damaged &#8211; his skull was intact.<\/p>\n<p>This has obviously made me think hard about cycling and helmet-wearing and I&#8217;ve been trying to crystallise my thoughts.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Background<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m obviously a keen cyclist, and I read lots on the internet, Twitter, and other people&#8217;s blogs, about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>pros and cons of wearing a helmet;<\/li>\n<li>pros and cons of helmet legislation;<\/li>\n<li>anecdotes about helmet wearing\/not-wearing;<\/li>\n<li>pros and cons of websites\/blogs\/people that talk about the pros and cons of wearing a helmet;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You get the idea.<\/p>\n<p>For those who don&#8217;t move in cycling circles, the safety benefits of cycle helmets are far from proven and they may even make injuries from an accident WORSE!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all explained, far better than I could ever explain it, on the <a title=\"CycleHelmets.org\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclehelmets.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Cycle Helmets Site<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Lidlessness<\/h3>\n<p>Anyway, other people seem to get very passionate about helmet wearing. \u00a0Most people, and cycling organisations, I&#8217;ve come across are &#8220;pro-helmet-choice&#8221;, or &#8220;anti-helmet-legislation&#8221;. \u00a0They are keen to educate people about the myth that a helmet makes you safer.<\/p>\n<p>What strikes me is that the balance seems to be a bit out.\u00a0 People who are pro-helmet-choice come across as being anti-helmet, even though some of them wear helmets.\u00a0 Some of what I read also paints those who don&#8217;t know about the inconclusive bike helmet science as being a bit daft.<\/p>\n<p>This annoys me somewhat as I used to be someone who thought that a helmet was obviously going to help protect you in a fall and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s stupid to think that way.<\/p>\n<h3>Out with it!<\/h3>\n<p>So, where am I at with the whole cycle helmet thing?\u00a0 Well:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I instinctively feel that I SHOULD wear one.\u00a0 The thought of my head hitting tarmac at speed doesn&#8217;t fill me with joyous expectation.\u00a0 I&#8217;d like my head to be protected.<\/li>\n<li>I read the current science and research as being inconclusive.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve not read it all in depth, but it seems to say that if I fall one way a helmet will protect me, and if I fall another way, a helmet will make my injuries worse.\u00a0 There appears to be no right or wrong.<\/li>\n<li>So&#8230;I wear a helmet for all my cycling.<\/li>\n<li>I am &#8220;pro-helmet-choice&#8221; &#8211; I am against making cycle helmet wearing compulsory as I believe that this would put people off cycling (this seems to be fairly well proven by statistics).<\/li>\n<li>I am very much pro-cycling.\u00a0 The benefits of cycling far outweigh the risks, and the risks clearly decrease as more people cycle.\u00a0 (See <a title=\"CTC's Safety in Numbers Campaign\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ctc.org.uk\/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=5225\" target=\"_blank\">CTC&#8217;s Safety in Numbers report<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m also pro- other cycle safety measures: training people to ride on the road; better cycle infrastructure; use of lights, colours and reflectives to make sure you&#8217;re seen; and riding confidently and learning to anticipate driver movements.\u00a0 How&#8217;s about we reduce the risk of falling or being hit in the first place?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>There are other aspects of this discussion, that I actually don&#8217;t feel I can answer, or even that they&#8217;re particularly important, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do I ride more dangerously, and take more risks because I&#8217;m wearing a helmet?<\/li>\n<li>Do vehicle drivers give me less room because I wear a helmet&#8230;and lycra&#8230;and reflectives!?!<\/li>\n<li>Are there better solutions to protecting your head whilst on a bike?\u00a0 Is there a different helmet design that could be used?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Recent Events<\/h3>\n<p>What happened to my friend has really brought home the whole cycling safety and helmets issue.\u00a0 I no longer have just statistics, studies and reports, I have a real person, that I know, who has had a week in hospital, is wearing a brace, and who will have 6 to 8 weeks of not being able to do much at all, and probably a lengthly period of recouperation after that.<\/p>\n<p>The studies say that wearing a helmet may increase the damage done in a nasty accident.\u00a0 But it may also save your life.<\/p>\n<p>My common sense says that in a minor accident my head will probably be better off with a helmet.<\/p>\n<p>And my personal experience is of a person who seems to have been spared injury because of a helmet.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that people have information and make a choice about helmet wearing.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that we offer people training on cycling on the road, build decent cycle lanes and infrastructure, and encourage more people onto bikes.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that we all, when driving vehicles, give room to cyclists and take extra care to look out for them. And DON&#8217;T pass them at any sort of junction&#8230;especially a roundabout!<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, I pray for my friend and his family, and I continue to wear my polystyrene &#8220;lid&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think?\u00a0 Would the inconclusive facts change your mind about helmets? Would the experience of my friend change your opinion?\u00a0 Or would it reinforce your existing opinion?<\/p>\n",

his skull was intact.<\/p>\n<p>This has obviously made me think hard about cycling and helmet-wearing and I&#8217;ve been trying to crystallise my thoughts.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Background<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m obviously a keen cyclist, and I read lots on the internet, Twitter, and other people&#8217;s blogs, about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>pros and cons of wearing a helmet;<\/li>\n<li>pros and cons of helmet legislation;<\/li>\n<li>anecdotes about helmet wearing\/not-wearing;<\/li>\n<li>pros and cons of websites\/blogs\/people that talk about the pros and cons of wearing a helmet;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You get the idea.<\/p>\n<p>For those who don&#8217;t move in cycling circles, the safety benefits of cycle helmets are far from proven and they may even make injuries from an accident WORSE!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all explained, far better than I could ever explain it, on the <a title=\"CycleHelmets.org\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclehelmets.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Cycle Helmets Site<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Lidlessness<\/h3>\n<p>Anyway, other people seem to get very passionate about helmet wearing. \u00a0Most people, and cycling organisations, I&#8217;ve come across are &#8220;pro-helmet-choice&#8221;, or &#8220;anti-helmet-legislation&#8221;. \u00a0They are keen to educate people about the myth that a helmet makes you safer.<\/p>\n<p>What strikes me is that the balance seems to be a bit out.\u00a0 People who are pro-helmet-choice come across as being anti-helmet, even though some of them wear helmets.\u00a0 Some of what I read also paints those who don&#8217;t know about the inconclusive bike helmet science as being a bit daft.<\/p>\n<p>This annoys me somewhat as I used to be someone who thought that a helmet was obviously going to help protect you in a fall and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s stupid to think that way.<\/p>\n<h3>Out with it!<\/h3>\n<p>So, where am I at with the whole cycle helmet thing?\u00a0 Well:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I instinctively feel that I SHOULD wear one.\u00a0 The thought of my head hitting tarmac at speed doesn&#8217;t fill me with joyous expectation.\u00a0 I&#8217;d like my head to be protected.<\/li>\n<li>I read the current science and research as being inconclusive.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve not read it all in depth, but it seems to say that if I fall one way a helmet will protect me, and if I fall another way, a helmet will make my injuries worse.\u00a0 There appears to be no right or wrong.<\/li>\n<li>So&#8230;I wear a helmet for all my cycling.<\/li>\n<li>I am &#8220;pro-helmet-choice&#8221; &#8211; I am against making cycle helmet wearing compulsory as I believe that this would put people off cycling (this seems to be fairly well proven by statistics).<\/li>\n<li>I am very much pro-cycling.\u00a0 The benefits of cycling far outweigh the risks, and the risks clearly decrease as more people cycle.\u00a0 (See <a title=\"CTC's Safety in Numbers Campaign\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ctc.org.uk\/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=5225\" target=\"_blank\">CTC&#8217;s Safety in Numbers report<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m also pro- other cycle safety measures: training people to ride on the road; better cycle infrastructure; use of lights, colours and reflectives to make sure you&#8217;re seen; and riding confidently and learning to anticipate driver movements.\u00a0 How&#8217;s about we reduce the risk of falling or being hit in the first place?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>There are other aspects of this discussion, that I actually don&#8217;t feel I can answer, or even that they&#8217;re particularly important, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do I ride more dangerously, and take more risks because I&#8217;m wearing a helmet?<\/li>\n<li>Do vehicle drivers give me less room because I wear a helmet&#8230;and lycra&#8230;and reflectives!?!<\/li>\n<li>Are there better solutions to protecting your head whilst on a bike?\u00a0 Is there a different helmet design that could be used?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Recent Events<\/h3>\n<p>What happened to my friend has really brought home the whole cycling safety and helmets issue.\u00a0 I no longer have just statistics, studies and reports, I have a real person, that I know, who has had a week in hospital, is wearing a brace, and who will have 6 to 8 weeks of not being able to do much at all, and probably a lengthly period of recouperation after that.<\/p>\n<p>The studies say that wearing a helmet may increase the damage done in a nasty accident.\u00a0 But it may also save your life.<\/p>\n<p>My common sense says that in a minor accident my head will probably be better off with a helmet.<\/p>\n<p>And my personal experience is of a person who seems to have been spared injury because of a helmet.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that people have information and make a choice about helmet wearing.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that we offer people training on cycling on the road, build decent cycle lanes and infrastructure, and encourage more people onto bikes.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that we all, when driving vehicles, give room to cyclists and take extra care to look out for them. And DON&#8217;T pass them at any sort of junction&#8230;especially a roundabout!<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, I pray for my friend and his family, and I continue to wear my polystyrene &#8220;lid&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think?\u00a0 Would the inconclusive facts change your mind about helmets? Would the experience of my friend change your opinion?\u00a0 Or would it reinforce your existing opinion?<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<h3>Who Needs Signs?<\/h3>\n<p>Lots of rain overnight meant that we weren&#8217;t keen to rise early&#8230;again!  So we had another slow start and a nice bacon-and-eggs breakfast\/elevenses.  Yummy!  There wasn&#8217;t much in the plan, and the weather was possibly unpredictable weather, but expected to clear, so we again went for something with an indoor element &#8211; at least to start with.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Sally had been wanting to check out some Irish crafts, so we headed off to Avoca&#8217;s Handweaving centre, which we&#8217;d passed earlier in the week.  Our (by now indispensible) Ordnance Survey of Ireland, 1:50,000 scale, &#8220;Explorer&#8221; maps allowed us to take some fun, minor roads, and Sally was getting pretty good at navigating!  Who needs signs?!<\/p>\n<p>Once there, surprisingly, you can just walk right in to the small weaving factory and walk around.  There are a few boards explaining what&#8217;s going on, but it was weird just being able to wander about while people sat preparing and operating both manual and powered looms, weaving fine cloth.  Bizarre, but quite interesting.<\/p>\n<p>It was a much quicker trip then we thought it would be, even with a trip around the almost-as-expensive-as-Powerscourt shop.  So we quickly committed to doing a few more Geocaches as we headed towards Brittas Bay.<\/p>\n<h3>Three Bickerson&#8217;s and a Beach<\/h3>\n<p>Learning from yesterday, we&#8217;d logged on and checked the cache logs before leaving, and found nothiing to put us off.  We easily picked up Barron in the Sky, Ballymoyle Hill and End of our Drive &#8211; with much thanks to &#8220;The Bickersons&#8221; for placing easy-to-find caches in some great locations with some great views across the eastern coast that we wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have seen.  Our aim was to do Brittas Bay, near the South Car Park too, but the 4 Euro for the car park seemed a bit much for a short visit.<\/p>\n<p>A bit further up the road, the North Car Park had the barrier up, so we parked up and had a highly enjoyable half hour or so on the beach.  I did all the stupid, manly, show-off things that one does: skimming and throwing stones; dragging the lovely wife into the sea (paddling only); hand stands; and generally larking around, while she enjoyed my silliness and captured the scene on&#8230;err&#8230;what now passes for film.  On reflection, 4 Euro would be good value if you wanted to spend half a day, or a few hours, on a beautiful, clean, sandy beach, manned by lifeguards, which is virtually deserted on a sunny day in mid-June.<\/p>\n<p>An early finish meant home for tea and toast, leftover curry for dinner, and a chilled out evening.  I could quite get used to this holiday lark.<\/p>\n<h3>The Ups and Downs of Geocaching<\/h3>\n<p>Reflections on today: Geocaching has been sometimes frustrating and sometimes fun, but we are still learning, and it&#8217;s enabled us to get out to some places that we wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have been, and seen some good bits of history and some beautiful places.  It&#8217;s a good way to tap into locals&#8217; knowledge of where you can see interesting stuff!<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Green&#8221; side of us finds that it does involve a lot of driving though.  We&#8217;ve tried to pick caches near to places that we&#8217;re going anyway, but it&#8217;s often involved going out of our way to find places.  We&#8217;ve tried to walk as much as possible (one other good thing about Geocaching is that it gets you out walking) but perhaps cycle-caching would be better and worth promoting!<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re actually wondering what we&#8217;d have done this holiday without Geocaching.  I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;d have found places to see and things to do, but it&#8217;s certainly prevented us stitting around in the cottage and doing nothing.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h3>Who Needs Signs?<\/h3>\n<p>Lots of rain overnight meant that we weren&#8217;t keen to rise early&#8230;again!  So we had another slow start and a nice bacon-and-eggs breakfast\/elevenses.  Yummy!  There wasn&#8217;t much in the plan, and the weather was possibly unpredictable weather, but expected to clear, so we again went for something with an indoor element &#8211; at least to start with.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Sally had been wanting to check out some Irish crafts, so we headed off to Avoca&#8217;s Handweaving centre, which we&#8217;d passed earlier in the week.  Our (by now indispensible) Ordnance Survey of Ireland, 1:50,000 scale, &#8220;Explorer&#8221; maps allowed us to take some fun, minor roads, and Sally was getting pretty good at navigating!  Who needs signs?!<\/p>\n<p>Once there, surprisingly, you can just walk right in to the small weaving factory and walk around.  There are a few boards explaining what&#8217;s going on, but it was weird just being able to wander about while people sat preparing and operating both manual and powered looms, weaving fine cloth.  Bizarre, but quite interesting.<\/p>\n<p>It was a much quicker trip then we thought it would be, even with a trip around the almost-as-expensive-as-Powerscourt shop.  So we quickly committed to doing a few more Geocaches as we headed towards Brittas Bay.<\/p>\n<h3>Three Bickerson&#8217;s and a Beach<\/h3>\n<p>Learning from yesterday, we&#8217;d logged on and checked the cache logs before leaving, and found nothiing to put us off.  We easily picked up Barron in the Sky, Ballymoyle Hill and End of our Drive &#8211; with much thanks to &#8220;The Bickersons&#8221; for placing easy-to-find caches in some great locations with some great views across the eastern coast that we wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have seen.  Our aim was to do Brittas Bay, near the South Car Park too, but the 4 Euro for the car park seemed a bit much for a short visit.<\/p>\n<p>A bit further up the road, the North Car Park had the barrier up, so we parked up and had a highly enjoyable half hour or so on the beach.  I did all the stupid, manly, show-off things that one does: skimming and throwing stones; dragging the lovely wife into the sea (paddling only); hand stands; and generally larking around, while she enjoyed my silliness and captured the scene on&#8230;err&#8230;what now passes for film.  On reflection, 4 Euro would be good value if you wanted to spend half a day, or a few hours, on a beautiful, clean, sandy beach, manned by lifeguards, which is virtually deserted on a sunny day in mid-June.<\/p>\n<p>An early finish meant home for tea and toast, leftover curry for dinner, and a chilled out evening.  I could quite get used to this holiday lark.<\/p>\n<h3>The Ups and Downs of Geocaching<\/h3>\n<p>Reflections on today: Geocaching has been sometimes frustrating and sometimes fun, but we are still learning, and it&#8217;s enabled us to get out to some places that we wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have been, and seen some good bits of history and some beautiful places.  It&#8217;s a good way to tap into locals&#8217; knowledge of where you can see interesting stuff!<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Green&#8221; side of us finds that it does involve a lot of driving though.  We&#8217;ve tried to pick caches near to places that we&#8217;re going anyway, but it&#8217;s often involved going out of our way to find places.  We&#8217;ve tried to walk as much as possible (one other good thing about Geocaching is that it gets you out walking) but perhaps cycle-caching would be better and worth promoting!<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re actually wondering what we&#8217;d have done this holiday without Geocaching.  I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;d have found places to see and things to do, but it&#8217;s certainly prevented us stitting around in the cottage and doing nothing.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<h3>Radio, Weather and Late Rising<\/h3>\n<p>Two quick observations.<\/p>\n<p>Radio: Radio here is really good.  Both East Coast FM and RTE 2 have a really good mix of music.  Though, oddly, its all English music.<\/p>\n<p>Weather forecasts: We&#8217;ve got Freesat here, but it&#8217;s been really hard getting a decent forecast for the Republic of Ireland.  There don&#8217;t seem to be any Irish channels on Freesat, so we&#8217;re resorting to interpreting the BBC&#8217;s big charts (with the presenter usually stood right in front of the bit of map we&#8217;re interested in) and short snippets on the aforementioned radio.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well.  It&#8217;s mostly sunny with showers, and I guess that will continue.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Our rising time is getting later and later.  With the long days there&#8217;s not really much requirement to get up and out of the house early, so we&#8217;re taking our mornings pretty easy.<\/p>\n<h3>Powerscourt<\/h3>\n<p>Today&#8217;s forecast was sunshine and showers (who&#8217;d have guessed?!), so we decided to do something with an option of being indoors, so it was off a bit North to Powerscourt House and Gardens.  It&#8217;s recommended as a good place to see, and we had a voucher for 2 euro discount on tickets to the garden.<\/p>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t have any Geocaches for that area, so we looked up a few on my phone.  Mobile internet is fine here, though I&#8217;m not looking forward to my next bill and finding out how much it costs.<\/p>\n<p>Armed with the information we needed, we set out.  The drive was pretty easy and took us through some beautiful land.  The only problem being the random\/sporadic signposting again.  But we found Powerscourt and turned into the long drive &#8211; an avenue of huge beech trees.  Once into the car park, sporadic signposting took over again and we wandered into a small garden centre.  Eventually we decided that this wasn&#8217;t on the way to the gardens, so we headed out and back towards the drive.  There we did find the entrance to the house.<\/p>\n<p>Bizarrely, most of the parts of the building that are open to the public have been converted to shops.  It felt like a small, posh, boutiquey shopping mall.  The food court of this mall being the one of the most expensive cafe&#8217;s I&#8217;ve ever been in!  We sat and ate and extortionately expensive sandwich, and drank liquid gold&#8230;err, I mean, a cup of coffee before heading to the gardens.<\/p>\n<h3>Tidy = Dull<\/h3>\n<p>On the way out of the mall, there were a few interpretive boards, but I generally felt that information on the house and gardens was lacking.  We were given a small map with a few prescribed walks around the gardens to follow.  The gardens are nice enough, but not my cup of tea.  If you like pristine, neat, formal gardens, then you&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s amazing, but I prefer something a bit more on the wild side.<\/p>\n<p>I enjoyed the walk through the woodland with its spectacular, huge firs; the Japanese Gardens were nicely done, and I poked around at some of the smaller wildlife in the dolphin pond, but generally was underwhelmed.  The vista from the house of the surrounding hills and Sugar Loaf Mountain was spectacular too, but I was left wanting to get away from the house and up the mountain, rather than hanging around.<\/p>\n<h3>Learning about Logs<\/h3>\n<p>We grabbed our daily ice-cream fix and headed off to do some Geocaching.  First stop, the little town of Enniskerry for &#8220;Knocksink River Bend&#8221;.  The car park to Knocksink Forest Park was closed, and we couldn&#8217;t park outside, so we parked up back in Enniskerry and walked the short distance to the park.  Initially we were on the wrong side of the river and couldn&#8217;t see how to get across, but, after logging on on my mobile and checking the logs, we found that there was a bridge across, and after some meandering, we found the cache.<\/p>\n<p>We then walked back and further up the road to find &#8220;Fox Hall&#8221;, a 2-part multicache, a bit like a treasure hunt.  The first part needed good observation to spot a clue, and once found we used the cache notes to calculate the coordinates of the second cache.  Sadly, it seemed to be in a place where a BMX bike track has neatly been constructed and, with several young muggles around on their bikes, we decided not to disturb them.  Again checking the cache logs shows that we&#8217;re not the first to have this problem.<\/p>\n<p>We learned today that checking the logs, though it can reveal &#8220;spoilers&#8221;, can also be very helpful and worthwhile.<\/p>\n<h3>Tumbling Torrents, Tesco and Telly<\/h3>\n<p>Caching over, we headed back south to check out Powerscourt Waterfall.  This is a spectacular place and a huge, elegant waterfall.  I think we paid 5 euro each to get in, which seems expensive for a short, 1-hour visit.  I&#8217;d recommend taking a picnic or barbecue here and spending a long lunch in this fantastic setting, rather than paying it a flying visit.<\/p>\n<p>Home via the recognisable comforts of Tesco to pick up some dinner supplies and a lazy evening in front of the telly finished our day &#8211; just what we needed.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h3>Radio, Weather and Late Rising<\/h3>\n<p>Two quick observations.<\/p>\n<p>Radio: Radio here is really good.  Both East Coast FM and RTE 2 have a really good mix of music.  Though, oddly, its all English music.<\/p>\n<p>Weather forecasts: We&#8217;ve got Freesat here, but it&#8217;s been really hard getting a decent forecast for the Republic of Ireland.  There don&#8217;t seem to be any Irish channels on Freesat, so we&#8217;re resorting to interpreting the BBC&#8217;s big charts (with the presenter usually stood right in front of the bit of map we&#8217;re interested in) and short snippets on the aforementioned radio.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well.  It&#8217;s mostly sunny with showers, and I guess that will continue.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Our rising time is getting later and later.  With the long days there&#8217;s not really much requirement to get up and out of the house early, so we&#8217;re taking our mornings pretty easy.<\/p>\n<h3>Powerscourt<\/h3>\n<p>Today&#8217;s forecast was sunshine and showers (who&#8217;d have guessed?!), so we decided to do something with an option of being indoors, so it was off a bit North to Powerscourt House and Gardens.  It&#8217;s recommended as a good place to see, and we had a voucher for 2 euro discount on tickets to the garden.<\/p>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t have any Geocaches for that area, so we looked up a few on my phone.  Mobile internet is fine here, though I&#8217;m not looking forward to my next bill and finding out how much it costs.<\/p>\n<p>Armed with the information we needed, we set out.  The drive was pretty easy and took us through some beautiful land.  The only problem being the random\/sporadic signposting again.  But we found Powerscourt and turned into the long drive &#8211; an avenue of huge beech trees.  Once into the car park, sporadic signposting took over again and we wandered into a small garden centre.  Eventually we decided that this wasn&#8217;t on the way to the gardens, so we headed out and back towards the drive.  There we did find the entrance to the house.<\/p>\n<p>Bizarrely, most of the parts of the building that are open to the public have been converted to shops.  It felt like a small, posh, boutiquey shopping mall.  The food court of this mall being the one of the most expensive cafe&#8217;s I&#8217;ve ever been in!  We sat and ate and extortionately expensive sandwich, and drank liquid gold&#8230;err, I mean, a cup of coffee before heading to the gardens.<\/p>\n<h3>Tidy = Dull<\/h3>\n<p>On the way out of the mall, there were a few interpretive boards, but I generally felt that information on the house and gardens was lacking.  We were given a small map with a few prescribed walks around the gardens to follow.  The gardens are nice enough, but not my cup of tea.  If you like pristine, neat, formal gardens, then you&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s amazing, but I prefer something a bit more on the wild side.<\/p>\n<p>I enjoyed the walk through the woodland with its spectacular, huge firs; the Japanese Gardens were nicely done, and I poked around at some of the smaller wildlife in the dolphin pond, but generally was underwhelmed.  The vista from the house of the surrounding hills and Sugar Loaf Mountain was spectacular too, but I was left wanting to get away from the house and up the mountain, rather than hanging around.<\/p>\n<h3>Learning about Logs<\/h3>\n<p>We grabbed our daily ice-cream fix and headed off to do some Geocaching.  First stop, the little town of Enniskerry for &#8220;Knocksink River Bend&#8221;.  The car park to Knocksink Forest Park was closed, and we couldn&#8217;t park outside, so we parked up back in Enniskerry and walked the short distance to the park.  Initially we were on the wrong side of the river and couldn&#8217;t see how to get across, but, after logging on on my mobile and checking the logs, we found that there was a bridge across, and after some meandering, we found the cache.<\/p>\n<p>We then walked back and further up the road to find &#8220;Fox Hall&#8221;, a 2-part multicache, a bit like a treasure hunt.  The first part needed good observation to spot a clue, and once found we used the cache notes to calculate the coordinates of the second cache.  Sadly, it seemed to be in a place where a BMX bike track has neatly been constructed and, with several young muggles around on their bikes, we decided not to disturb them.  Again checking the cache logs shows that we&#8217;re not the first to have this problem.<\/p>\n<p>We learned today that checking the logs, though it can reveal &#8220;spoilers&#8221;, can also be very helpful and worthwhile.<\/p>\n<h3>Tumbling Torrents, Tesco and Telly<\/h3>\n<p>Caching over, we headed back south to check out Powerscourt Waterfall.  This is a spectacular place and a huge, elegant waterfall.  I think we paid 5 euro each to get in, which seems expensive for a short, 1-hour visit.  I&#8217;d recommend taking a picnic or barbecue here and spending a long lunch in this fantastic setting, rather than paying it a flying visit.<\/p>\n<p>Home via the recognisable comforts of Tesco to pick up some dinner supplies and a lazy evening in front of the telly finished our day &#8211; just what we needed.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<h3>It&#8217;s a Sign!!<\/h3>\n<p>First a note on Irish signs.  These aren&#8217;t lacking, but they are, we find, generally pretty rubbish.  They are badly placed, usually too small, occasionally not actually related to the place\/junction at which they&#8217;re located, and completely sporadic and unpredictable.  One minute a main road is signed, the next, you&#8217;re at a junction with no idea which way to turn.  This is not confined to the countryside: on our trip to Dublin last year we couldn&#8217;t find any signs for the main M1 motorway north to Belfast and spent 40 minutes driving through the suburbs.<\/p>\n<p>Someone should really have a word.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Boots or Shoes?<\/h3>\n<p>Anyway, we were feeling good today.  The forecast was for patchy rain and our target was Glendalough &#8211; &#8220;The valley of two lakes&#8221; &#8211; for some walking and Geocaching.  Morning discussion was of what sort of shoes to wear and what to take.  I suggested that we pack for a proper hike and see what happens.  Lovely wife seemed a bit more sceptical about my potential-hiking ambitions.<\/p>\n<p>We started with a quick trip to pick some information up from Wicklow&#8217;s information office and then headed straight from there to the mostly well-signposted Glendalough.<\/p>\n<h3>Glendalough and St Kevin<\/h3>\n<p>There was a bit of rain to start with but it soon cleared and we had a beautiful day of walking ahead.   Lovely wife wasn&#8217;t so keen to start with, but I encouraged her to take walking boots and a full rucksack.  I think she appreciated this in the end.<\/p>\n<p>Glendalough has a visitor centre, which is OK, but the interpretive bit wasn&#8217;t open and there wasn&#8217;t much in terms of information there, so we grabbed a walking routes map and a leaflet about the historic relics.  Total cost, 1 Euro!<\/p>\n<p>We took a quick trip round the ruins &#8211; these were impressive and old and mostly relating to St Kevin the information leaflet was, true to its name, informative, telling us some of the history and legends surrounding the site and St Kevin himself.  The gravestones were also fascinating, a huge variety of styles from across the years.  The location, in the heart of the glen, was very atmospheric, but the place was bustling with tourists.<\/p>\n<h3>Walking Glendalough<\/h3>\n<p>After a short time we set of on one of the walking routes.  These all seemed to be mostly well-paved and well sign-posted.  Previously in Ireland this has bothered me, but here it seemed fitting.  There&#8217;s a long board walk (a walk along raised wooden boards), which exists to protect the land from erosion&#8230;excellent stuff!  Walking on the marshland would not have been nice.  Sign posts and interpretative boards are there, but not over-done, making it feel slightly more wild.  The altitude and remoteness that you achieve also means that you feel like you&#8217;re doing some proper outdoorsy stuff.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than pick a single main route we made up our own route out of bits of the others &#8211; mostly in order to take in as much scenery and geocaching as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Once we&#8217;d left the busy shorter routes a lot of the people melted away and we were left pretty much to ourselves.  We climbed up a waterfall, walked through a forest, and up and over a hill onto the boardwalk.  This took us along a cliff edge with views that made the climb well worthwhile.<\/p>\n<h3>Spink and Kevin&#8217;s Dental Work<\/h3>\n<p>The first geocache, &#8220;Spink&#8221;, was a short walk uphill from the boardwalk.  It felt wrong walking over the peat and marshland when a clear trail had been provided to protect the land, but that&#8217;s what we did.  Our geocaching disappointment continued as this cache, which had been listed as &#8220;needing maintenance&#8221;, was not in its place at all.  Our lunch had been carried up in a biscuit tin and this was now empty, so we left that in the cache&#8217;s place, with a short note scribbled on a bit of paper.  At least there&#8217;s something there now!<\/p>\n<p>Back down to the boardwalk and along to the western extent of the path.  The second cache was here: a big army tin full of stuff, hiding&#8230;we won&#8217;t say where.  Finally&#8230;success!  We logged our visit and took a &#8220;travel bug&#8221; that was in there too, before trying to hide the cache again without other people in this busy spot seeing what we were doing.  We continued back down the path to the walk&#8217;s end and treated ourselves to an ice-cream.<\/p>\n<h3>Laragh and Home<\/h3>\n<p>Glendalough is sublime, by far the most expansive glen we&#8217;ve visited.  The terrain is varied, but never too challenging, and the occasional relic of times gone by gives you something to learn about too.<\/p>\n<p>We headed home via St Kevin&#8217;s Church, Laragh where another successful (and neatly-hidden) geocache &#8211; Kevin and the Blackbird &#8211; awaited us.  When it works it&#8217;s exciting and good fun!<\/p>\n<p>Back home for dinner, games, and relaxing.  A splendid day!  Very green, very beautiful, better than Northern Ireland, but still not as rugged and charming as the west.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h3>It&#8217;s a Sign!!<\/h3>\n<p>First a note on Irish signs.  These aren&#8217;t lacking, but they are, we find, generally pretty rubbish.  They are badly placed, usually too small, occasionally not actually related to the place\/junction at which they&#8217;re located, and completely sporadic and unpredictable.  One minute a main road is signed, the next, you&#8217;re at a junction with no idea which way to turn.  This is not confined to the countryside: on our trip to Dublin last year we couldn&#8217;t find any signs for the main M1 motorway north to Belfast and spent 40 minutes driving through the suburbs.<\/p>\n<p>Someone should really have a word.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Boots or Shoes?<\/h3>\n<p>Anyway, we were feeling good today.  The forecast was for patchy rain and our target was Glendalough &#8211; &#8220;The valley of two lakes&#8221; &#8211; for some walking and Geocaching.  Morning discussion was of what sort of shoes to wear and what to take.  I suggested that we pack for a proper hike and see what happens.  Lovely wife seemed a bit more sceptical about my potential-hiking ambitions.<\/p>\n<p>We started with a quick trip to pick some information up from Wicklow&#8217;s information office and then headed straight from there to the mostly well-signposted Glendalough.<\/p>\n<h3>Glendalough and St Kevin<\/h3>\n<p>There was a bit of rain to start with but it soon cleared and we had a beautiful day of walking ahead.   Lovely wife wasn&#8217;t so keen to start with, but I encouraged her to take walking boots and a full rucksack.  I think she appreciated this in the end.<\/p>\n<p>Glendalough has a visitor centre, which is OK, but the interpretive bit wasn&#8217;t open and there wasn&#8217;t much in terms of information there, so we grabbed a walking routes map and a leaflet about the historic relics.  Total cost, 1 Euro!<\/p>\n<p>We took a quick trip round the ruins &#8211; these were impressive and old and mostly relating to St Kevin the information leaflet was, true to its name, informative, telling us some of the history and legends surrounding the site and St Kevin himself.  The gravestones were also fascinating, a huge variety of styles from across the years.  The location, in the heart of the glen, was very atmospheric, but the place was bustling with tourists.<\/p>\n<h3>Walking Glendalough<\/h3>\n<p>After a short time we set of on one of the walking routes.  These all seemed to be mostly well-paved and well sign-posted.  Previously in Ireland this has bothered me, but here it seemed fitting.  There&#8217;s a long board walk (a walk along raised wooden boards), which exists to protect the land from erosion&#8230;excellent stuff!  Walking on the marshland would not have been nice.  Sign posts and interpretative boards are there, but not over-done, making it feel slightly more wild.  The altitude and remoteness that you achieve also means that you feel like you&#8217;re doing some proper outdoorsy stuff.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than pick a single main route we made up our own route out of bits of the others &#8211; mostly in order to take in as much scenery and geocaching as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Once we&#8217;d left the busy shorter routes a lot of the people melted away and we were left pretty much to ourselves.  We climbed up a waterfall, walked through a forest, and up and over a hill onto the boardwalk.  This took us along a cliff edge with views that made the climb well worthwhile.<\/p>\n<h3>Spink and Kevin&#8217;s Dental Work<\/h3>\n<p>The first geocache, &#8220;Spink&#8221;, was a short walk uphill from the boardwalk.  It felt wrong walking over the peat and marshland when a clear trail had been provided to protect the land, but that&#8217;s what we did.  Our geocaching disappointment continued as this cache, which had been listed as &#8220;needing maintenance&#8221;, was not in its place at all.  Our lunch had been carried up in a biscuit tin and this was now empty, so we left that in the cache&#8217;s place, with a short note scribbled on a bit of paper.  At least there&#8217;s something there now!<\/p>\n<p>Back down to the boardwalk and along to the western extent of the path.  The second cache was here: a big army tin full of stuff, hiding&#8230;we won&#8217;t say where.  Finally&#8230;success!  We logged our visit and took a &#8220;travel bug&#8221; that was in there too, before trying to hide the cache again without other people in this busy spot seeing what we were doing.  We continued back down the path to the walk&#8217;s end and treated ourselves to an ice-cream.<\/p>\n<h3>Laragh and Home<\/h3>\n<p>Glendalough is sublime, by far the most expansive glen we&#8217;ve visited.  The terrain is varied, but never too challenging, and the occasional relic of times gone by gives you something to learn about too.<\/p>\n<p>We headed home via St Kevin&#8217;s Church, Laragh where another successful (and neatly-hidden) geocache &#8211; Kevin and the Blackbird &#8211; awaited us.  When it works it&#8217;s exciting and good fun!<\/p>\n<p>Back home for dinner, games, and relaxing.  A splendid day!  Very green, very beautiful, better than Northern Ireland, but still not as rugged and charming as the west.<\/p>\n",

            "content": {
                "rendered": "<h3>The way of things to come<\/h3>\n<p>We had a very nice long sleep &#8211; a feature that would be present in most of our days in Ireland.  We had spotted in our room an electronic pest control device and had heard some odd noises from above &#8211; we wondered if there may be rats, but these failed to materialise in any tangible way during the course of the week&#8230;phew.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>On waking, I had a really intense stomach pain for a few hours.  To the extent that we nearly headed to hospital.  After a while it started to go though, and I took my mind off it by programming some Geocaches into GPS.  We were learning as we went along with this &#8211; both about Geocaching and how to use the GPS, so it was a slow process.  One key thing we discovered was that we could input the co-ordinates for the caches in longitude and latitude (as given on geocaching.com) and then get the GPS receiver to translate these into nice Irish Grid references for us on the map.  This COULD be done by hand, but was much more accurate with the technology, and the Irish Grid references would prove invaluable in our hunting.<\/p>\n<p>We then headed off to Wicklow Town.  The Information Centre (and most things) were shut on Sunday.  But we found a pharmacy and another Super Valu (with another Tesco nearby), that was open, which was what we needed.<\/p>\n<p>As we came out of Super Valu the Irish rain came down, but &#8211; as expected, it had all but stopped by the time we got back to the car.  It was on and off all day&#8230;all week!  Light and heavy, wet and then dry again, blazing sunshine evaporating the surface water of recent showers in a shimmering cloud of steam.<\/p>\n<h3>How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?<\/h3>\n<p>We took the back roads from Wicklow to Rathdrum for our first bit of solo Geocaching: the Maria&#8217;s Drum multi-cache (spoliers lie ahead if you&#8217;re a Geocacher who may one day go to Ireland).<\/p>\n<p>Multi-caches have several parts and are usually treasure-hunt-like affairs, with places to explore and clues o solve to find the co-ordinates of the cache.  The first two steps were easy and took in the local high street and a memorial park.  We solved the clues and calculated the co-ordinates, but the third and final part was an unexpectedly long walk away.<\/p>\n<p>We finally arrived at a small roadside shrine to the blessed virgin (I think).  We followed the GPS, which, in the tree cover, wasn&#8217;t being particularly accurate.  We followed the decoded clue.  We rummaged in the trees, we searched the stone walls for little holes, and we hunted high and low, but to no avail.<\/p>\n<p>We eventually gave up and headed back up to the town, disappointed; Geocaching isn&#8217;t supposed to be like this, it&#8217;s fun, and exciting, the trail, the search, the find!!!  But no, we failed at the first attempt.  Did we not look hard enough?  Or was it not there?  We&#8217;ve logged our &#8220;Not Found&#8221; and are waiting to see.<\/p>\n<p>We did head back for another go on our way back out of Rathdrum in the car, but still couldn&#8217;t find it.  We&#8217;re convinced the cache has been removed.  I, personally, didn&#8217;t like rummaging around in a shrine to Mary &#8211; I&#8217;m a Christian, but I&#8217;m not into the reverance for Mary that catholics have, but I also appreciate that some people will have regarded that as a sacred site.  Perhaps that&#8217;s why the cache was removed?<\/p>\n<h3>The Beach<\/h3>\n<p>We grabbed an ice cream&#8230;this would become another habit of our holiday&#8230;and then headed back to the cottage.<\/p>\n<p>Dinner was followed by an attempted walk to the nearest beach.  Our first attempt was via a farm and track but, despite the existence of a track on the map, we weren&#8217;t sure if we had a right of way across the field.  So we abandoned the route.<\/p>\n<p>The second attempt was via the road through the nearby &#8220;Missionary Sisters'&#8221; place, however, this was clearly signposted as private ground.<\/p>\n<p>So we headed back down past the farm that we first tried, for a longer, on-road route.  But we went too far along the road &#8211; which had confused me, because the map clearly showed a turning on the right towards the beach.  It turned out that the path to the beach marked on the map as &#8220;other road&#8221;, was actually a gated, narrow, pedestrian path!  Grrr.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually we found the path, and got to the beach.  It was nice and secluded &#8211; out own private bay for 20 minutes &#8211; but there was lots of litter.  As we left, some bikers arrived at the end of the path.  I suspect there&#8217;s a lot of fires and parties that go on on that little patch of sand, and we were probably fortunate to have a secluded stroll.<\/p>\n<h3>Finding our way<\/h3>\n<p>Ireland is &#8220;just over there&#8221;, and most people speak English, but Ireland can be quite different.<\/p>\n<p>Wicklow is very scenic but feels tamed.  We have OS maps but paths are not easily findable and some paths and even roads, seem to be private.  It makes you realise how open and accessible the UK is and how good it is for countryside rambling.<\/p>\n<p>We were still finding our way on the first day of our holiday.<\/p>\n",

        "title": "A Week in Wicklow &#8211; Part 3: The Ways of Wicklow",
        "content": "<h3>The way of things to come<\/h3>\n<p>We had a very nice long sleep &#8211; a feature that would be present in most of our days in Ireland.  We had spotted in our room an electronic pest control device and had heard some odd noises from above &#8211; we wondered if there may be rats, but these failed to materialise in any tangible way during the course of the week&#8230;phew.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>On waking, I had a really intense stomach pain for a few hours.  To the extent that we nearly headed to hospital.  After a while it started to go though, and I took my mind off it by programming some Geocaches into GPS.  We were learning as we went along with this &#8211; both about Geocaching and how to use the GPS, so it was a slow process.  One key thing we discovered was that we could input the co-ordinates for the caches in longitude and latitude (as given on geocaching.com) and then get the GPS receiver to translate these into nice Irish Grid references for us on the map.  This COULD be done by hand, but was much more accurate with the technology, and the Irish Grid references would prove invaluable in our hunting.<\/p>\n<p>We then headed off to Wicklow Town.  The Information Centre (and most things) were shut on Sunday.  But we found a pharmacy and another Super Valu (with another Tesco nearby), that was open, which was what we needed.<\/p>\n<p>As we came out of Super Valu the Irish rain came down, but &#8211; as expected, it had all but stopped by the time we got back to the car.  It was on and off all day&#8230;all week!  Light and heavy, wet and then dry again, blazing sunshine evaporating the surface water of recent showers in a shimmering cloud of steam.<\/p>\n<h3>How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?<\/h3>\n<p>We took the back roads from Wicklow to Rathdrum for our first bit of solo Geocaching: the Maria&#8217;s Drum multi-cache (spoliers lie ahead if you&#8217;re a Geocacher who may one day go to Ireland).<\/p>\n<p>Multi-caches have several parts and are usually treasure-hunt-like affairs, with places to explore and clues o solve to find the co-ordinates of the cache.  The first two steps were easy and took in the local high street and a memorial park.  We solved the clues and calculated the co-ordinates, but the third and final part was an unexpectedly long walk away.<\/p>\n<p>We finally arrived at a small roadside shrine to the blessed virgin (I think).  We followed the GPS, which, in the tree cover, wasn&#8217;t being particularly accurate.  We followed the decoded clue.  We rummaged in the trees, we searched the stone walls for little holes, and we hunted high and low, but to no avail.<\/p>\n<p>We eventually gave up and headed back up to the town, disappointed; Geocaching isn&#8217;t supposed to be like this, it&#8217;s fun, and exciting, the trail, the search, the find!!!  But no, we failed at the first attempt.  Did we not look hard enough?  Or was it not there?  We&#8217;ve logged our &#8220;Not Found&#8221; and are waiting to see.<\/p>\n<p>We did head back for another go on our way back out of Rathdrum in the car, but still couldn&#8217;t find it.  We&#8217;re convinced the cache has been removed.  I, personally, didn&#8217;t like rummaging around in a shrine to Mary &#8211; I&#8217;m a Christian, but I&#8217;m not into the reverance for Mary that catholics have, but I also appreciate that some people will have regarded that as a sacred site.  Perhaps that&#8217;s why the cache was removed?<\/p>\n<h3>The Beach<\/h3>\n<p>We grabbed an ice cream&#8230;this would become another habit of our holiday&#8230;and then headed back to the cottage.<\/p>\n<p>Dinner was followed by an attempted walk to the nearest beach.  Our first attempt was via a farm and track but, despite the existence of a track on the map, we weren&#8217;t sure if we had a right of way across the field.  So we abandoned the route.<\/p>\n<p>The second attempt was via the road through the nearby &#8220;Missionary Sisters'&#8221; place, however, this was clearly signposted as private ground.<\/p>\n<p>So we headed back down past the farm that we first tried, for a longer, on-road route.  But we went too far along the road &#8211; which had confused me, because the map clearly showed a turning on the right towards the beach.  It turned out that the path to the beach marked on the map as &#8220;other road&#8221;, was actually a gated, narrow, pedestrian path!  Grrr.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually we found the path, and got to the beach.  It was nice and secluded &#8211; out own private bay for 20 minutes &#8211; but there was lots of litter.  As we left, some bikers arrived at the end of the path.  I suspect there&#8217;s a lot of fires and parties that go on on that little patch of sand, and we were probably fortunate to have a secluded stroll.<\/p>\n<h3>Finding our way<\/h3>\n<p>Ireland is &#8220;just over there&#8221;, and most people speak English, but Ireland can be quite different.<\/p>\n<p>Wicklow is very scenic but feels tamed.  We have OS maps but paths are not easily findable and some paths and even roads, seem to be private.  It makes you realise how open and accessible the UK is and how good it is for countryside rambling.<\/p>\n<p>We were still finding our way on the first day of our holiday.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<h3>An Early Start<\/h3>\n<p>It was an early start on the first Saturday.  Holidays shouldn&#8217;t start so early, but as my sister said, it meant that we didn&#8217;t just spend the whole day travelling, and we got there with some hours to relax and find our way around before bedtime.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>We were crossing from Fishguard to Rosslare on the Ferry with our little car.  We toyed with doing Rail-Sail, which worked out pretty cheap, but by the time you&#8217;ve taken into account hiring a car at the other end and the inflexibility of having to carry all your luggage, the ferry wasn&#8217;t too bad in terms of value.<\/p>\n<h3>On and on<\/h3>\n<p>The M4 goes on much longer than I thought.  And Wales goes on much further than that!  I know that this is a generalisation, but people drive crazy in Wales &#8211; they go much faster than mandatory speed limits, even where these are explicitly for safety reasons.<\/p>\n<p>Traffic was very quiet so early in the morning and we arrived nice and early.  Ports aren&#8217;t great places to have to spend a couple of hours, but we waited around at Fishguard, enjoying a cuppa and a pastry, and passing the time with a game of cribbage (which we&#8217;ve recently discovered).<\/p>\n<h3>Food for thought<\/h3>\n<p>Eventually we got going.  The crossing &#8211; on the &#8220;express&#8221; ferry &#8211; was good (actually, in hindsight and with the experience of the crossing back, it wasn&#8217;t THAT good) but we both felt sea sick &#8211; which has never happened to me before.  At first we wondered if we were hungry, so we ordered some nice-looking pies, but nether of us could face eating more than half of it.  We resorted to standing on deck, and wishing it would be over quickly.<\/p>\n<p>We were on time into Rosslare.  We disembarked and had a quick and easy, journey to Blackditch &#8211; our home for the week &#8211; via the surprisingly-large town of Arklow.  The good old Irish supermarket &#8220;Supa Value&#8221; is still here but, further down the road was evidence that Tesco is taking over this country too.  Food is EXPENSIVE here &#8211; the weak pound contributes, but even so, the number of Euros we were paying was high!!!<\/p>\n<h3>Cottages and Games<\/h3>\n<p>Blackditch turned out to be less of a village and more an un-signed collection of houses.  We drove passed at first but eventually worked out where we needed to be and we were welcomed by our landlord for the week.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shamrockcottages.co.uk\/properties\/wicklow\/wicklow-1\/\">The cottage<\/a> we stayed in was lovely and the pictures on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shamrockcottages.co.uk\/\">Shamrock Cottages<\/a> website didn&#8217;t do it justice.  We were expecting much smaller bedrooms, but the whole place was much bigger than we expected.<\/p>\n<p>The weather was fine and we sat outside and had a restful afternoon.  The evening was spent playing my new, birthday-present card game, Munchkin: A possibly slightly over-complicated parody of fantasy role-playing games, which is fun but, we thing, more fun with 3 or more players.<\/p>\n<p>After an early morning we had an early night and were looking forward to exploring County Wicklow in the days to come.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<h3>An Early Start<\/h3>\n<p>It was an early start on the first Saturday.  Holidays shouldn&#8217;t start so early, but as my sister said, it meant that we didn&#8217;t just spend the whole day travelling, and we got there with some hours to relax and find our way around before bedtime.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>We were crossing from Fishguard to Rosslare on the Ferry with our little car.  We toyed with doing Rail-Sail, which worked out pretty cheap, but by the time you&#8217;ve taken into account hiring a car at the other end and the inflexibility of having to carry all your luggage, the ferry wasn&#8217;t too bad in terms of value.<\/p>\n<h3>On and on<\/h3>\n<p>The M4 goes on much longer than I thought.  And Wales goes on much further than that!  I know that this is a generalisation, but people drive crazy in Wales &#8211; they go much faster than mandatory speed limits, even where these are explicitly for safety reasons.<\/p>\n<p>Traffic was very quiet so early in the morning and we arrived nice and early.  Ports aren&#8217;t great places to have to spend a couple of hours, but we waited around at Fishguard, enjoying a cuppa and a pastry, and passing the time with a game of cribbage (which we&#8217;ve recently discovered).<\/p>\n<h3>Food for thought<\/h3>\n<p>Eventually we got going.  The crossing &#8211; on the &#8220;express&#8221; ferry &#8211; was good (actually, in hindsight and with the experience of the crossing back, it wasn&#8217;t THAT good) but we both felt sea sick &#8211; which has never happened to me before.  At first we wondered if we were hungry, so we ordered some nice-looking pies, but nether of us could face eating more than half of it.  We resorted to standing on deck, and wishing it would be over quickly.<\/p>\n<p>We were on time into Rosslare.  We disembarked and had a quick and easy, journey to Blackditch &#8211; our home for the week &#8211; via the surprisingly-large town of Arklow.  The good old Irish supermarket &#8220;Supa Value&#8221; is still here but, further down the road was evidence that Tesco is taking over this country too.  Food is EXPENSIVE here &#8211; the weak pound contributes, but even so, the number of Euros we were paying was high!!!<\/p>\n<h3>Cottages and Games<\/h3>\n<p>Blackditch turned out to be less of a village and more an un-signed collection of houses.  We drove passed at first but eventually worked out where we needed to be and we were welcomed by our landlord for the week.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shamrockcottages.co.uk\/properties\/wicklow\/wicklow-1\/\">The cottage<\/a> we stayed in was lovely and the pictures on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shamrockcottages.co.uk\/\">Shamrock Cottages<\/a> website didn&#8217;t do it justice.  We were expecting much smaller bedrooms, but the whole place was much bigger than we expected.<\/p>\n<p>The weather was fine and we sat outside and had a restful afternoon.  The evening was spent playing my new, birthday-present card game, Munchkin: A possibly slightly over-complicated parody of fantasy role-playing games, which is fun but, we thing, more fun with 3 or more players.<\/p>\n<p>After an early morning we had an early night and were looking forward to exploring County Wicklow in the days to come.<\/p>\n",

Partly because I want to remember what&#8217;s happened, so that I can refer back when I need to.  And partly for the benefit of others.  When people want to know what our holiday in such-and-such a place was like, where we stayed and ate, and what we enjoyed and learned, I can just refer them here.<\/p>\n<p>So comes my write up of a week in Wicklow, on the East Coast of Ireland.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Introduction: Cottages and Caches<\/h3>\n<p>We love Ireland.  I&#8217;ve visited the Dingle Peninsula in the south-west twice now, once with lovely wife and once, many years ago, with others.  We&#8217;ve done Northern Ireland, and so, this year, we thought we&#8217;d try the east coast.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d heard good things about Wicklow and there&#8217;s a national park with some mountains in, so we booked some time off, a small cottage, and a ferry, and planned our trip away.<\/p>\n<p>Finding a cottage for two is hard.  Most are much bigger, or really pokey and small, so we booked into a 4-bed cottage, accepting the extra cost as the price for some extra space.<\/p>\n<p>We got online and bought some Ordnance Survey of Ireland, 1:50,000, &#8220;Explorer&#8221; maps, and a Harvey map of the Wicklow Mountains.  We ordered a book of mountain walks too, but it didn&#8217;t arrive in time.  Our experience of walking in Ireland is that it&#8217;s not as easy as the UK &#8211; land is less accessible, paths are not as clear, and maps are not as easy to get hold of, so we wanted as much information as we could get up front.<\/p>\n<p>We also managed to get hold of a GPS receiver.  After our long weekend in the Lakes with some friends who introduced us to the &#8220;sport&#8221; of Geocaching, we&#8217;ve been wanting to incorporate some geocaching of our own into a holiday.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, our birthdays are both in early June and some very kind people clubbed together to get us a Garmin eTrex Legend H: slightly above the basic model with mapping capability and some geocaching features.<\/p>\n<p>We printed out details of a pile of caches before we went, as access to the Internet and a printer was not expected to be easy to find.<\/p>\n<p>So, booked, packed, equipped, and informed, we expectantly headed to bed early on Friday night.<\/p>\n",

Partly because I want to remember what&#8217;s happened, so that I can refer back when I need to.  And partly for the benefit of others.  When people want to know what our holiday in such-and-such a place was like, where we stayed and ate, and what we enjoyed and learned, I can just refer them here.<\/p>\n<p>So comes my write up of a week in Wicklow, on the East Coast of Ireland.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Introduction: Cottages and Caches<\/h3>\n<p>We love Ireland.  I&#8217;ve visited the Dingle Peninsula in the south-west twice now, once with lovely wife and once, many years ago, with others.  We&#8217;ve done Northern Ireland, and so, this year, we thought we&#8217;d try the east coast.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d heard good things about Wicklow and there&#8217;s a national park with some mountains in, so we booked some time off, a small cottage, and a ferry, and planned our trip away.<\/p>\n<p>Finding a cottage for two is hard.  Most are much bigger, or really pokey and small, so we booked into a 4-bed cottage, accepting the extra cost as the price for some extra space.<\/p>\n<p>We got online and bought some Ordnance Survey of Ireland, 1:50,000, &#8220;Explorer&#8221; maps, and a Harvey map of the Wicklow Mountains.  We ordered a book of mountain walks too, but it didn&#8217;t arrive in time.  Our experience of walking in Ireland is that it&#8217;s not as easy as the UK &#8211; land is less accessible, paths are not as clear, and maps are not as easy to get hold of, so we wanted as much information as we could get up front.<\/p>\n<p>We also managed to get hold of a GPS receiver.  After our long weekend in the Lakes with some friends who introduced us to the &#8220;sport&#8221; of Geocaching, we&#8217;ve been wanting to incorporate some geocaching of our own into a holiday.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, our birthdays are both in early June and some very kind people clubbed together to get us a Garmin eTrex Legend H: slightly above the basic model with mapping capability and some geocaching features.<\/p>\n<p>We printed out details of a pile of caches before we went, as access to the Internet and a printer was not expected to be easy to find.<\/p>\n<p>So, booked, packed, equipped, and informed, we expectantly headed to bed early on Friday night.<\/p>\n",

Does he want a high-five?\u00a0 What should I do?<\/p>\n<p>No time to change my mind now&#8230;I&#8217;m going.\u00a0 I&#8217;ll give a cheery &#8220;Thanks mate&#8221; as I go past.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Thanks mate!!!!!!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Hang on.\u00a0 What WAS he doing?\u00a0 I know I&#8217;ll look back.<\/p>\n<p>CRIKEY!!! He&#8217;s just completed a right turn into that field.\u00a0 I could have been run down!!!<\/p>\n<p>Oo-err.<\/p>\n<p>In hindsight, the poor tractor driver did exactly the right thing and gave the clearest possible signal that he could.\u00a0 I simply didn&#8217;t get it.\u00a0 I&#8217;m not used to seeing hand signals from vehicles, and I&#8217;m not used to seeing vehicles turn right where there&#8217;s nowhere to turn into.<\/p>\n<p>Still, I&#8217;m safe, and I&#8217;ve learned something.<\/p>\n<p>Stupid cyclists!!!<\/p>\n",
