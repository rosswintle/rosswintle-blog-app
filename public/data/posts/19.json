No. \u00a0So let&#8217;s do some work on balancing that out.<\/li>\n<li>Is my saddle straight? \u00a0Yes, and it&#8217;s at a good height too. \u00a0But I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m sat on it straight. \u00a0Maybe I sag to one side a little? \u00a0Have to think about my position there too.<\/li>\n<li>What about my feet? \u00a0Well, my cleats (the clips on the bottom of cycling shoes that clip into &#8220;clipless&#8221; pedals), weren&#8217;t in the same position on both feet &#8211; so I&#8217;ve adjusted them, and replaced the cleats at the same time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Will all this make a difference? \u00a0It&#8217;s hard to say right now as I&#8217;ve not done a longer ride for a while. \u00a0It will be interesting to see how things are now.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Of course, in the background the stretching and strength work that I don&#8217;t do enough of will have to continue too, and as the nights draw in perhaps I&#8217;ll get more opportunity to do that. \u00a0Then, come next spring, I&#8217;ll be REALLY fit and ready to go!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Maybe.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

No. \u00a0So let&#8217;s do some work on balancing that out.<\/li>\n<li>Is my saddle straight? \u00a0Yes, and it&#8217;s at a good height too. \u00a0But I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m sat on it straight. \u00a0Maybe I sag to one side a little? \u00a0Have to think about my position there too.<\/li>\n<li>What about my feet? \u00a0Well, my cleats (the clips on the bottom of cycling shoes that clip into &#8220;clipless&#8221; pedals), weren&#8217;t in the same position on both feet &#8211; so I&#8217;ve adjusted them, and replaced the cleats at the same time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Will all this make a difference? \u00a0It&#8217;s hard to say right now as I&#8217;ve not done a longer ride for a while. \u00a0It will be interesting to see how things are now.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Of course, in the background the stretching and strength work that I don&#8217;t do enough of will have to continue too, and as the nights draw in perhaps I&#8217;ll get more opportunity to do that. \u00a0Then, come next spring, I&#8217;ll be REALLY fit and ready to go!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Maybe.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

\u00a0And who&#8217;s flying the planes at that time of morning? \u00a0Weird.<\/li>\n<li>We did lots of looking online too, but trying hard to get an all-in-one package.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div>In the end we booked a Flight\/Car\/Hotel online with Expedia. \u00a0It was a bit above our budget but we really wanted to go to Sicily and had exhausted pretty much all other options.<\/div>\n<div>The package would have been cheaper had we booked with Alitalia, but we found out about their looming bankruptcy and paid over-the-odds to fly British Airways. \u00a0This had other advantages, such as being a direct flight, and departing at the more sensible hour of 8am. \u00a0Thanks to my dad for pointing out Alitalia&#8217;s troubles as we were about to head home and click the &#8220;Buy this holiday&#8221; button!!<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What we got<\/span><\/div>\n<div>A little more detail&#8230;<\/div>\n<div>We flew BA direct to Catania\/Fontarossa Airport on the East Coast of Sicily, then hired a small car, and headed south towards the ancient town of Syracuse.<\/div>\n<div>Our hotel &#8211; the simple, charming, out-in-the-country retreat of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.masseriadegliulivi.com\/\">Masseria Degli Ulivi<\/a> &#8211; was located just outside the nearby town of Noto &#8211; itself a beautiful and historic place worth exploring (and one of the highlights of the holiday, if I might say so).<\/div>\n<div>We were there for a week, driving round, exploring the Eastern side of the island, sampling the food and wine, and relaxing poolside and on the beach.<\/div>\n<div>It was a great, relaxing break.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Highlights<\/span><\/div>\n<div>There will be more about the holiday posted later, but if you don&#8217;t want the detail, here&#8217;s the stuff that you really should know if you want to know what we got up to, or if you fancy a trip to Sicily yourself.<\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.masseriadegliulivi.com\/\">The Hotel<\/a>, mentioned above, is a great place to chill out and explore the island &#8211; just watch out for the naughty puppy on site!<\/li>\n<li>Sicily is a very rural and traditional place &#8211; at least, the Eastern Coast is. \u00a0This means that everything shuts from about noon until about 4pm. \u00a0So MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A LUNCH PLAN. \u00a0I had a very stressful day driving around trying to find lunch with only a minimal grasp of the language. \u00a0It was not fun.<\/li>\n<li>In fact, the hotel didn&#8217;t offer lunch, so we were out and about most days. \u00a0The best way is to find a grocery or supermarket and get some supplies and make your own lunch. \u00a0Milano Salami is fantastic! \u00a0Don&#8217;t go for the sliced bread&#8230;yuk!<\/li>\n<li>We borrowed a Sat Nav system with European mapping from a friend. \u00a0This was hugely helpful and saved us hours of time, lots of faff, and probably lots of arguments too. \u00a0But, as always, use wisely! \u00a0They do get funny ideas about where to go sometimes. \u00a0If you think you need to stick to the main road, then sitck to it!<\/li>\n<li>Sicilians are lunatic drivers with little regard for the road. \u00a0Pay attention, drive with confidence, and give them a wide berth and you&#8217;ll a)\u00a0be fine b) witness some crazy overtaking and turning first hand!<\/li>\n<li>Driving on the continent for the first time wasn&#8217;t so hard, though turning at junctions was often confusing. \u00a0Having the car layout the other way around was probably more taxing for my head than the driving.<\/li>\n<li>Things that must be done: \u00a01) Climb Mt Etna (more detail on this later) 2) Visit Pantalica 3) Explore Syracuse on foot<\/li>\n<li>Food is generally good to excellent and you get what you pay for. \u00a0Coffee is awesome! \u00a0Local wine is also pretty incredible, but watch out &#8211; it&#8217;s strong too!<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t take any kangaroos with you. \u00a0 You&#8217;ll have to read on to find out why! \ud83d\ude09<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/05\/a-week-in-sicily-part-2-travel\/\">Read part two<\/a><\/div>\n",

\u00a0And who&#8217;s flying the planes at that time of morning? \u00a0Weird.<\/li>\n<li>We did lots of looking online too, but trying hard to get an all-in-one package.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div>In the end we booked a Flight\/Car\/Hotel online with Expedia. \u00a0It was a bit above our budget but we really wanted to go to Sicily and had exhausted pretty much all other options.<\/div>\n<div>The package would have been cheaper had we booked with Alitalia, but we found out about their looming bankruptcy and paid over-the-odds to fly British Airways. \u00a0This had other advantages, such as being a direct flight, and departing at the more sensible hour of 8am. \u00a0Thanks to my dad for pointing out Alitalia&#8217;s troubles as we were about to head home and click the &#8220;Buy this holiday&#8221; button!!<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What we got<\/span><\/div>\n<div>A little more detail&#8230;<\/div>\n<div>We flew BA direct to Catania\/Fontarossa Airport on the East Coast of Sicily, then hired a small car, and headed south towards the ancient town of Syracuse.<\/div>\n<div>Our hotel &#8211; the simple, charming, out-in-the-country retreat of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.masseriadegliulivi.com\/\">Masseria Degli Ulivi<\/a> &#8211; was located just outside the nearby town of Noto &#8211; itself a beautiful and historic place worth exploring (and one of the highlights of the holiday, if I might say so).<\/div>\n<div>We were there for a week, driving round, exploring the Eastern side of the island, sampling the food and wine, and relaxing poolside and on the beach.<\/div>\n<div>It was a great, relaxing break.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Highlights<\/span><\/div>\n<div>There will be more about the holiday posted later, but if you don&#8217;t want the detail, here&#8217;s the stuff that you really should know if you want to know what we got up to, or if you fancy a trip to Sicily yourself.<\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.masseriadegliulivi.com\/\">The Hotel<\/a>, mentioned above, is a great place to chill out and explore the island &#8211; just watch out for the naughty puppy on site!<\/li>\n<li>Sicily is a very rural and traditional place &#8211; at least, the Eastern Coast is. \u00a0This means that everything shuts from about noon until about 4pm. \u00a0So MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A LUNCH PLAN. \u00a0I had a very stressful day driving around trying to find lunch with only a minimal grasp of the language. \u00a0It was not fun.<\/li>\n<li>In fact, the hotel didn&#8217;t offer lunch, so we were out and about most days. \u00a0The best way is to find a grocery or supermarket and get some supplies and make your own lunch. \u00a0Milano Salami is fantastic! \u00a0Don&#8217;t go for the sliced bread&#8230;yuk!<\/li>\n<li>We borrowed a Sat Nav system with European mapping from a friend. \u00a0This was hugely helpful and saved us hours of time, lots of faff, and probably lots of arguments too. \u00a0But, as always, use wisely! \u00a0They do get funny ideas about where to go sometimes. \u00a0If you think you need to stick to the main road, then sitck to it!<\/li>\n<li>Sicilians are lunatic drivers with little regard for the road. \u00a0Pay attention, drive with confidence, and give them a wide berth and you&#8217;ll a)\u00a0be fine b) witness some crazy overtaking and turning first hand!<\/li>\n<li>Driving on the continent for the first time wasn&#8217;t so hard, though turning at junctions was often confusing. \u00a0Having the car layout the other way around was probably more taxing for my head than the driving.<\/li>\n<li>Things that must be done: \u00a01) Climb Mt Etna (more detail on this later) 2) Visit Pantalica 3) Explore Syracuse on foot<\/li>\n<li>Food is generally good to excellent and you get what you pay for. \u00a0Coffee is awesome! \u00a0Local wine is also pretty incredible, but watch out &#8211; it&#8217;s strong too!<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t take any kangaroos with you. \u00a0 You&#8217;ll have to read on to find out why! \ud83d\ude09<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/05\/a-week-in-sicily-part-2-travel\/\">Read part two<\/a><\/div>\n",

I do waffle!!!<\/div>\n<div>\n<div>An alarm at 5am, a quick rise and off to <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">AirParks<\/span> <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Gatwick<\/span> (booked as part of the package with <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Expedia<\/span>). I&#8217;m not a <span class=\"blsp-spelling-corrected\">connoisseur<\/span> of airport parking but this seemed fine, other than their new computer system not working at first. But we dropped the car off, checked in, and got the bus to the terminal. Easy peasey.<\/div>\n<div>Having checked in online the day before, we did a quick and easy bag drop. We heard others checking in and not getting seats together so it seems lots of people check in online, and it&#8217;s worth doing to get the good seats.<\/div>\n<div>We headed through security with it&#8217;s baffling no-liquids rules and dedicated shoe X-ray system (this always seems ridiculous but who are we to argue with the security experts). Breakfast was at &#8220;eat&#8221;. A quick sausage sandwich&#8230;pittifully small, far too expensive, and lacking ketchup, but just what we needed&#8230;and then off to the gate.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A very British flight<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">The flight was quite entertaining. British Airways crew are typically British. With a vague aloofness, slight lack of dedication to the job, dry humour and no apparent foreign language capability. It was fine.<\/span><\/div>\n<div>The pilot was the funniest. Before we took off he informed us that &#8220;The engineers have now fixed the intercom but, in the airline industry we have a saying that the flight can&#8217;t take off until the weight of the paperwork matches the weight of the plane&#8221;. And upon landing we were welcomed to Catania Airport and blessed with the catchphrase &#8220;If you&#8217;re here on business, may it be a pleasure, and if you&#8217;re here for pleasure, may it be the business&#8221;.<\/div>\n<div>The flight was good, and the little &#8220;Deli&#8221; snack pack that we got with a salmon roll and some other goodies, was surprisingly good quality.<\/div>\n<div>We arrived at Catania in sunny and warmth and sat on the plane watching our baggage being grossly mishandled by Italian airport staff before heading to arrivals.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">First Impressions<\/span><\/div>\n<div>Don&#8217;t you find that first impressions of a foreign country are always of the loos! After a two or three hour flight you kinda need to go, and it&#8217;s the first thing that you notice is different. The brand names are different, the flushes work differently, the signs are in different languages. If I was designing an airport I&#8217;d make the toilets in arrivals the most amazing place, shiny, gleaming, spotless, automated. Just to make a good first impression. Catania&#8217;s loos were reasonable, but it alerted me to the fact that I really was no longer in the UK and I&#8217;d have to get used to things being a bit different.<\/div>\n<div>Baggage collection was a bit slow. The Italians might throw your luggage around but they take they don&#8217;t do it because they&#8217;re in a hurry.<\/div>\n<div>We grabbed some pizza (cheap, yummy, and needs little Italian to order) and then headed to collect our car. And guess what? IT&#8217;S BLOODY RAINING!! We&#8217;ve travelled 2000 miles to escape the crappy English &#8220;summer&#8221; weather. We&#8217;re about as far south as you can go without leaving Europe. And it&#8217;s dull, cloudy, and wet. How depressing.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Driving&#8230;.getting it right!<\/span><\/div>\n<div>We picked up our hire car, a little Nissan Micra with aircon, central locking, radio and all the mod cons, without needing to speak much Italian&#8230;thankfully.<\/div>\n<div>We reported some un-documented scratches to a very stern Italian lady who didn&#8217;t seem to care all that much. And then the fun began.<\/div>\n<div>I&#8217;ve never driven on the continent. I&#8217;d been told lots of things about it:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>it&#8217;s fine<\/li>\n<li>you&#8217;ll pick it up quickly<\/li>\n<li>just follow everyone else<\/li>\n<li>watch out for roundabouts<\/li>\n<li>the biggest problem is grabbing the door handle instead of the gear stick<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div>And most of them proved true.<\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTWWiV7flI\/AAAAAAAAEQg\/q8FELD5e-ns\/s288\/IMG_1452.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:216px;cursor:pointer;height:288px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTWWiV7flI\/AAAAAAAAEQg\/q8FELD5e-ns\/s288\/IMG_1452.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>Driving on the right wasn&#8217;t a problem at all. Judging the width of car was hard &#8211; I&#8217;m so used to having the middle and edge of the road being the other way around, and Sally let out a few muffled &#8220;eeeks&#8221; as I drifted too far right, but <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">generally it was OK. My biggest problem was non-roundabout junctions; turning left off main roads (must remember to stay on the right) and working out which direction traffic was coming from.<\/span><\/div>\n<div>So, psyched up and ready to get it right, we headed off. Now, I&#8217;m a pretty organised person. I had a little green plastic folder with our passports, all the printed-out doucumentation for the holiday, pre-paid vouchers, maps of the airport parking and hotel, and so on. So when Sally ask &#8220;Where&#8217;s the directions to the hotel?&#8221; I naturally had the answer.<\/div>\n<div>&#8220;Errr&#8230;I don&#8217;t have them&#8221;<\/div>\n<div>So &#8211; praise the LORD (literally!) for our borrowed SatNav. A few screen-touches and we had directions to Masseria degli Ulivi. Phew! What an idiot I am.<\/div>\n<div>The drive was quick and easy. The Sicilian driving didn&#8217;t seem as crazy as I expected (though this was to change later in the week), and we arrived safely at our hotel. To find&#8230;.oh.<\/div>\n<div>It looks like it&#8217;s still being built.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Masseria Degli Ulivi<\/span><\/div>\n<div>You hear all these nightmare stories about people turning up to their holiday destination to find that their hotel is still a pile of bricks and a bunch of uninterested builders. So when we turned through some blank, concrete pillars, into a gravel courtyard with several diggers and some big piles of aggregates, we had to do a quick double take. &#8220;It&#8217;s fine&#8230;everything&#8217;s fine&#8221; we said to ourselves.<\/div>\n<div>The hotel turned out to be amazing and we think they were just building some new rooms.<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMW8GDUqI\/AAAAAAAAD-E\/VHg9aV8aThc\/s288\/IMG_1158.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMW8GDUqI\/AAAAAAAAD-E\/VHg9aV8aThc\/s288\/IMG_1158.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>Set about 15 km outside the town of Noto, Masseria degli Ulivi is a converted olive farm. Simple, but charming. Not grandiose, and fairly limited in facilities, but with only 18 rooms, an excellent (if a little expensive) restaurant on site, acres of land, a tennis court and swimming pool, and no one or nothing around for miles, it&#8217;s a perfect place for a quiet retreat, and to use as a base for exploring the historic south-east of Sicily. If you want a 5-star luxury experience, look elsewhere, but if you want to get away from it all and chill out, we&#8217;d highly recommend it.<\/p>\n<div>But it was still cloudy and cold. Boooo.<\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMeNSAUBI\/AAAAAAAAD-U\/3hNTFwpPO7U\/s288\/IMG_1160.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:left;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 10px 10px 0;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMeNSAUBI\/AAAAAAAAD-U\/3hNTFwpPO7U\/s288\/IMG_1160.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>We ignored the dullness and the lack of sunshine and took a very B<span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">ritish<\/span> dip in the cold swimming pool before wandering around the hotel grounds. Foreign places often feel like they&#8217;re not quite finished and this is no exception. Bits of path were missing, and it felt like they&#8217;d not quite completed some of the work they&#8217;d planned. But this is the <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">mediterranean<\/span> way and it in no way detracted from our enjoyment &#8211; I offer it as a simple observation.<\/div>\n<div>We grabbed an amazing proper Italian Cappucino and set and planned our week- there&#8217;s lots to do!<\/div>\n<div>The hotel dog arrived to welcome us and took a liking to my clothing. He was VERY naughty and appeared to be pretty untrained and untrainable. But he was fun to have around. Perhaps Italian phrase books should have a &#8220;dog instructions&#8221; section. I sense he didn&#8217;t understand &#8220;SIT!&#8221; and &#8220;DOWN!&#8221; but I didn&#8217;t know the Italian equivalents and my attempts at Italian-style arm waving and gesturing seemed to go unnoticed too.<\/div>\n<div>We ate in the hotel&#8217;s excellent restaurant. It was expensive for a full meal with wine but really good food. Very earthy Sicilian dishes &#8211; I had <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Gnocci and <\/span>rabbit &#8211; and truly heavenly, but strong, local wine. Worth the money, but we probably couldn&#8217;t afford to eat here all week.<\/div>\n<div>We enjoyed many hours deep sleep that night!<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTWRvdeu5I\/AAAAAAAAEQI\/qIuRXH-vzUM\/s400\/IMG_1440.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;width:400px;cursor:pointer;height:300px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTWRvdeu5I\/AAAAAAAAEQI\/qIuRXH-vzUM\/s400\/IMG_1440.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/07\/a-week-in-sicily-part-4-yummy-historic-crazy-stressful-amazing-wet-complicated-and-incorrect\/\">Part four<\/a><\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Flying Out<\/span><\/p>\n<div>Part 3 and we haven&#8217;t even left yet. I do waffle!!!<\/div>\n<div>\n<div>An alarm at 5am, a quick rise and off to <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">AirParks<\/span> <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Gatwick<\/span> (booked as part of the package with <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Expedia<\/span>). I&#8217;m not a <span class=\"blsp-spelling-corrected\">connoisseur<\/span> of airport parking but this seemed fine, other than their new computer system not working at first. But we dropped the car off, checked in, and got the bus to the terminal. Easy peasey.<\/div>\n<div>Having checked in online the day before, we did a quick and easy bag drop. We heard others checking in and not getting seats together so it seems lots of people check in online, and it&#8217;s worth doing to get the good seats.<\/div>\n<div>We headed through security with it&#8217;s baffling no-liquids rules and dedicated shoe X-ray system (this always seems ridiculous but who are we to argue with the security experts). Breakfast was at &#8220;eat&#8221;. A quick sausage sandwich&#8230;pittifully small, far too expensive, and lacking ketchup, but just what we needed&#8230;and then off to the gate.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A very British flight<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">The flight was quite entertaining. British Airways crew are typically British. With a vague aloofness, slight lack of dedication to the job, dry humour and no apparent foreign language capability. It was fine.<\/span><\/div>\n<div>The pilot was the funniest. Before we took off he informed us that &#8220;The engineers have now fixed the intercom but, in the airline industry we have a saying that the flight can&#8217;t take off until the weight of the paperwork matches the weight of the plane&#8221;. And upon landing we were welcomed to Catania Airport and blessed with the catchphrase &#8220;If you&#8217;re here on business, may it be a pleasure, and if you&#8217;re here for pleasure, may it be the business&#8221;.<\/div>\n<div>The flight was good, and the little &#8220;Deli&#8221; snack pack that we got with a salmon roll and some other goodies, was surprisingly good quality.<\/div>\n<div>We arrived at Catania in sunny and warmth and sat on the plane watching our baggage being grossly mishandled by Italian airport staff before heading to arrivals.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">First Impressions<\/span><\/div>\n<div>Don&#8217;t you find that first impressions of a foreign country are always of the loos! After a two or three hour flight you kinda need to go, and it&#8217;s the first thing that you notice is different. The brand names are different, the flushes work differently, the signs are in different languages. If I was designing an airport I&#8217;d make the toilets in arrivals the most amazing place, shiny, gleaming, spotless, automated. Just to make a good first impression. Catania&#8217;s loos were reasonable, but it alerted me to the fact that I really was no longer in the UK and I&#8217;d have to get used to things being a bit different.<\/div>\n<div>Baggage collection was a bit slow. The Italians might throw your luggage around but they take they don&#8217;t do it because they&#8217;re in a hurry.<\/div>\n<div>We grabbed some pizza (cheap, yummy, and needs little Italian to order) and then headed to collect our car. And guess what? IT&#8217;S BLOODY RAINING!! We&#8217;ve travelled 2000 miles to escape the crappy English &#8220;summer&#8221; weather. We&#8217;re about as far south as you can go without leaving Europe. And it&#8217;s dull, cloudy, and wet. How depressing.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Driving&#8230;.getting it right!<\/span><\/div>\n<div>We picked up our hire car, a little Nissan Micra with aircon, central locking, radio and all the mod cons, without needing to speak much Italian&#8230;thankfully.<\/div>\n<div>We reported some un-documented scratches to a very stern Italian lady who didn&#8217;t seem to care all that much. And then the fun began.<\/div>\n<div>I&#8217;ve never driven on the continent. I&#8217;d been told lots of things about it:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>it&#8217;s fine<\/li>\n<li>you&#8217;ll pick it up quickly<\/li>\n<li>just follow everyone else<\/li>\n<li>watch out for roundabouts<\/li>\n<li>the biggest problem is grabbing the door handle instead of the gear stick<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div>And most of them proved true.<\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTWWiV7flI\/AAAAAAAAEQg\/q8FELD5e-ns\/s288\/IMG_1452.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:216px;cursor:pointer;height:288px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTWWiV7flI\/AAAAAAAAEQg\/q8FELD5e-ns\/s288\/IMG_1452.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>Driving on the right wasn&#8217;t a problem at all. Judging the width of car was hard &#8211; I&#8217;m so used to having the middle and edge of the road being the other way around, and Sally let out a few muffled &#8220;eeeks&#8221; as I drifted too far right, but <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">generally it was OK. My biggest problem was non-roundabout junctions; turning left off main roads (must remember to stay on the right) and working out which direction traffic was coming from.<\/span><\/div>\n<div>So, psyched up and ready to get it right, we headed off. Now, I&#8217;m a pretty organised person. I had a little green plastic folder with our passports, all the printed-out doucumentation for the holiday, pre-paid vouchers, maps of the airport parking and hotel, and so on. So when Sally ask &#8220;Where&#8217;s the directions to the hotel?&#8221; I naturally had the answer.<\/div>\n<div>&#8220;Errr&#8230;I don&#8217;t have them&#8221;<\/div>\n<div>So &#8211; praise the LORD (literally!) for our borrowed SatNav. A few screen-touches and we had directions to Masseria degli Ulivi. Phew! What an idiot I am.<\/div>\n<div>The drive was quick and easy. The Sicilian driving didn&#8217;t seem as crazy as I expected (though this was to change later in the week), and we arrived safely at our hotel. To find&#8230;.oh.<\/div>\n<div>It looks like it&#8217;s still being built.<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Masseria Degli Ulivi<\/span><\/div>\n<div>You hear all these nightmare stories about people turning up to their holiday destination to find that their hotel is still a pile of bricks and a bunch of uninterested builders. So when we turned through some blank, concrete pillars, into a gravel courtyard with several diggers and some big piles of aggregates, we had to do a quick double take. &#8220;It&#8217;s fine&#8230;everything&#8217;s fine&#8221; we said to ourselves.<\/div>\n<div>The hotel turned out to be amazing and we think they were just building some new rooms.<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMW8GDUqI\/AAAAAAAAD-E\/VHg9aV8aThc\/s288\/IMG_1158.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:right;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMW8GDUqI\/AAAAAAAAD-E\/VHg9aV8aThc\/s288\/IMG_1158.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>Set about 15 km outside the town of Noto, Masseria degli Ulivi is a converted olive farm. Simple, but charming. Not grandiose, and fairly limited in facilities, but with only 18 rooms, an excellent (if a little expensive) restaurant on site, acres of land, a tennis court and swimming pool, and no one or nothing around for miles, it&#8217;s a perfect place for a quiet retreat, and to use as a base for exploring the historic south-east of Sicily. If you want a 5-star luxury experience, look elsewhere, but if you want to get away from it all and chill out, we&#8217;d highly recommend it.<\/p>\n<div>But it was still cloudy and cold. Boooo.<\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMeNSAUBI\/AAAAAAAAD-U\/3hNTFwpPO7U\/s288\/IMG_1160.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:left;width:288px;cursor:pointer;height:216px;margin:0 10px 10px 0;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTMeNSAUBI\/AAAAAAAAD-U\/3hNTFwpPO7U\/s288\/IMG_1160.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>We ignored the dullness and the lack of sunshine and took a very B<span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">ritish<\/span> dip in the cold swimming pool before wandering around the hotel grounds. Foreign places often feel like they&#8217;re not quite finished and this is no exception. Bits of path were missing, and it felt like they&#8217;d not quite completed some of the work they&#8217;d planned. But this is the <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">mediterranean<\/span> way and it in no way detracted from our enjoyment &#8211; I offer it as a simple observation.<\/div>\n<div>We grabbed an amazing proper Italian Cappucino and set and planned our week- there&#8217;s lots to do!<\/div>\n<div>The hotel dog arrived to welcome us and took a liking to my clothing. He was VERY naughty and appeared to be pretty untrained and untrainable. But he was fun to have around. Perhaps Italian phrase books should have a &#8220;dog instructions&#8221; section. I sense he didn&#8217;t understand &#8220;SIT!&#8221; and &#8220;DOWN!&#8221; but I didn&#8217;t know the Italian equivalents and my attempts at Italian-style arm waving and gesturing seemed to go unnoticed too.<\/div>\n<div>We ate in the hotel&#8217;s excellent restaurant. It was expensive for a full meal with wine but really good food. Very earthy Sicilian dishes &#8211; I had <span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\">Gnocci and <\/span>rabbit &#8211; and truly heavenly, but strong, local wine. Worth the money, but we probably couldn&#8217;t afford to eat here all week.<\/div>\n<div>We enjoyed many hours deep sleep that night!<\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTWRvdeu5I\/AAAAAAAAEQI\/qIuRXH-vzUM\/s400\/IMG_1440.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;width:400px;cursor:pointer;height:300px;text-align:center;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SPTWRvdeu5I\/AAAAAAAAEQI\/qIuRXH-vzUM\/s400\/IMG_1440.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/07\/a-week-in-sicily-part-4-yummy-historic-crazy-stressful-amazing-wet-complicated-and-incorrect\/\">Part four<\/a><\/p>\n",
