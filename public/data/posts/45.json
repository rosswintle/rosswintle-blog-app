                "rendered": "<p>The Guardian and the makers of the film &#8216;Age of Stupid&#8217; have created a new climate change campaign called 10:10 (see <a title=\"10:10 UK Campaign\" href=\"http:\/\/www.1010uk.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.1010uk.org<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>The idea is that you sign up and try to cut your carbon emissions by 10% by the end of 2010. Lots of famous people and big businesses have signed up, but, despite being a keen-though -ow-key climate change campaigner, I&#8217;ve not yet made that pledge.<\/p>\n<p>Why not?<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Well, I think it&#8217;s a good idea and will spur people on to make positive changes towards sustainability, but it doesn&#8217;t seem well thought out.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I think is missing from the campaign:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Measurement<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t see 10:10 providing a way of measuring your carbon emissions.  Surely this would be key if you&#8217;re committing people to reduce those emissions by 10%.  How will they measure success of this campaign?<\/p>\n<p>Not even the <a title=\"10:10 FAQs\" href=\"http:\/\/www.1010uk.org\/1010\/what_is_1010\/faq\" target=\"_blank\">10:10 FAQ<\/a> is of help here!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Focus<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If I knew my carbon footprint, I&#8217;d then want to know the quickest ways to get them reduced. Knowing whether a certain action will save me 5% or 0.5% would probably be useful in helping me priortise and calculate cost\/benefit ratios of my energy saving efforts.<\/p>\n<p>(Actually, a guy at the Guardian has written <a title=\"The Guardian: How to reduce your carbon emissions by 10%\" href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/environment\/2009\/sep\/01\/how-to-reduce-emissions-10-10\" target=\"_blank\">this useful article<\/a> &#8211; but still nothing directly from 10:10 themselves!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Detail<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a thing. My employer is a big energy consumer.  But, apparently, most of the electricity they buy is nuclear.  Does cutting their energy use count to cutting carbon emissions? Well, no!<\/p>\n<p>Would reducing their energy use be s good thing? Well, yes!<\/p>\n<p>And personally, we buy green energy. What&#8217;s the deal there?<\/p>\n<p>If we do something to improve efficiency of our home, does that count for both me and my wife? Or do we get half of the saving each?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m being slightly picky, but it&#8217;s not entirely clear what I need to do to meet the target.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Freedom<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For some people, 10:10 will get them started, they will enjoy it and be proud of what they achieve, and they will go on to cut more!<\/p>\n<p>Others will find it a burden and feel guilt for not hitting the target.<\/p>\n<p>And others will do 10%, think that&#8217;s their bit done and not do any more.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d rather people believed the message and did things because they wanted to, rather than to hit some arbitrary numerical target.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Completeness<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Cutting carbon emissions is the focus of 10:10 and maybe it&#8217;s good that it has a clear focus. \u00a0But we must do more than cut carbon; we must reduce waste and consumption, and we must build infrastructure that will get us way below 90% of where we are now and allow us to stay there.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sustainability<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Getting thousands of people to cut 10% of their carbon emissions will be great for the planet. But will it instill in people the values of sustainability? Will it create ground level social change? Will it change political will? Will it make businesses environmentally conscious?<\/p>\n<p>Plus, we &#8211; my household &#8211; already do lots to reduce energy use, live sustainably and cut emissions. We don&#8217;t do anything like enough&#8230;we&#8217;re lazy climateers really. But we try already without 10:10.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And we must try harder.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>10:10 sounds great.<\/p>\n<p>Can I honestly urge you to sign up?<\/p>\n<p>No.  Not yet at least.<\/p>\n<p>Can I honestly ask you to consider your consumption of the earth&#8217;s resources, to evaluate what you need and what you want, to think about giving a few things up for the greater good?<\/p>\n<p>Absolutely!  Go for it. Reduce your carbon emissions, energy use, plastic consumption, meat-eating and food waste. Do as much if it as you can. Do it now. And do it regardless of what targets you&#8217;ve signed up to.<\/p>\n<p>If you have signed up then fantastic.  Seriously, you&#8217;ve done a really good, positive thing and I&#8217;m excited about how many people have signed up and what impact that might have.<\/p>\n<p>I may even join myself at some point.  In the meantime I need to get on with consuming less, driving less, fixing my home&#8217;s draughts and making my life more simple and efficient.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>The Guardian and the makers of the film &#8216;Age of Stupid&#8217; have created a new climate change campaign called 10:10 (see <a title=\"10:10 UK Campaign\" href=\"http:\/\/www.1010uk.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.1010uk.org<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>The idea is that you sign up and try to cut your carbon emissions by 10% by the end of 2010. Lots of famous people and big businesses have signed up, but, despite being a keen-though -ow-key climate change campaigner, I&#8217;ve not yet made that pledge.<\/p>\n<p>Why not?<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Well, I think it&#8217;s a good idea and will spur people on to make positive changes towards sustainability, but it doesn&#8217;t seem well thought out.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I think is missing from the campaign:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Measurement<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t see 10:10 providing a way of measuring your carbon emissions.  Surely this would be key if you&#8217;re committing people to reduce those emissions by 10%.  How will they measure success of this campaign?<\/p>\n<p>Not even the <a title=\"10:10 FAQs\" href=\"http:\/\/www.1010uk.org\/1010\/what_is_1010\/faq\" target=\"_blank\">10:10 FAQ<\/a> is of help here!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Focus<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If I knew my carbon footprint, I&#8217;d then want to know the quickest ways to get them reduced. Knowing whether a certain action will save me 5% or 0.5% would probably be useful in helping me priortise and calculate cost\/benefit ratios of my energy saving efforts.<\/p>\n<p>(Actually, a guy at the Guardian has written <a title=\"The Guardian: How to reduce your carbon emissions by 10%\" href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/environment\/2009\/sep\/01\/how-to-reduce-emissions-10-10\" target=\"_blank\">this useful article<\/a> &#8211; but still nothing directly from 10:10 themselves!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Detail<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a thing. My employer is a big energy consumer.  But, apparently, most of the electricity they buy is nuclear.  Does cutting their energy use count to cutting carbon emissions? Well, no!<\/p>\n<p>Would reducing their energy use be s good thing? Well, yes!<\/p>\n<p>And personally, we buy green energy. What&#8217;s the deal there?<\/p>\n<p>If we do something to improve efficiency of our home, does that count for both me and my wife? Or do we get half of the saving each?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m being slightly picky, but it&#8217;s not entirely clear what I need to do to meet the target.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Freedom<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For some people, 10:10 will get them started, they will enjoy it and be proud of what they achieve, and they will go on to cut more!<\/p>\n<p>Others will find it a burden and feel guilt for not hitting the target.<\/p>\n<p>And others will do 10%, think that&#8217;s their bit done and not do any more.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d rather people believed the message and did things because they wanted to, rather than to hit some arbitrary numerical target.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Completeness<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Cutting carbon emissions is the focus of 10:10 and maybe it&#8217;s good that it has a clear focus. \u00a0But we must do more than cut carbon; we must reduce waste and consumption, and we must build infrastructure that will get us way below 90% of where we are now and allow us to stay there.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sustainability<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Getting thousands of people to cut 10% of their carbon emissions will be great for the planet. But will it instill in people the values of sustainability? Will it create ground level social change? Will it change political will? Will it make businesses environmentally conscious?<\/p>\n<p>Plus, we &#8211; my household &#8211; already do lots to reduce energy use, live sustainably and cut emissions. We don&#8217;t do anything like enough&#8230;we&#8217;re lazy climateers really. But we try already without 10:10.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And we must try harder.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>10:10 sounds great.<\/p>\n<p>Can I honestly urge you to sign up?<\/p>\n<p>No.  Not yet at least.<\/p>\n<p>Can I honestly ask you to consider your consumption of the earth&#8217;s resources, to evaluate what you need and what you want, to think about giving a few things up for the greater good?<\/p>\n<p>Absolutely!  Go for it. Reduce your carbon emissions, energy use, plastic consumption, meat-eating and food waste. Do as much if it as you can. Do it now. And do it regardless of what targets you&#8217;ve signed up to.<\/p>\n<p>If you have signed up then fantastic.  Seriously, you&#8217;ve done a really good, positive thing and I&#8217;m excited about how many people have signed up and what impact that might have.<\/p>\n<p>I may even join myself at some point.  In the meantime I need to get on with consuming less, driving less, fixing my home&#8217;s draughts and making my life more simple and efficient.<\/p>\n",

But a different and nice kind of busy.<\/p>\n<p>We spent a week in France with good friends, followed by a day at the Christian arts and music festival Greenbelt.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to do my usual multi-part holiday post &#8211; it was too relaxed a holiday and there&#8217;s not so much to say &#8211; but a few experiences and thoughts are given here.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><strong>Trains<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We took the train all the way to Bordeaux! Which was a brilliant experience. Starting on Friday night with First Great Western (and a fantastically Spanish train manager sounding like a cross between Manuel from Fawlty Towers and the &#8220;Compare the Market&#8221; meercats), and continuing on the fabulously relaxed Eurostar to Paris on Saturday (with a brass band playing as you wait to board&#8230;superb!).<\/p>\n<p>The Paris Metro was a bit of a scrum, but the TGV was a delight.\u00a0 Remind me why we fly again?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Chateau La Bruyere<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The place we stayed was incredible.\u00a0 It was a bit out in the sticks but we had an enormous and unique 16-bedroom place with HUGE dining room and indoor heated swimming pool all to ourselves.\u00a0 It was excellent value for money and, aside from the relatively poorly equipped kitchen, more than met our needs whilst at the same time enthralling us with its charm and character.<\/p>\n<p>I took a quick video tour if you want a speedy look around.<\/p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><param name=\"src\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/v\/fW_owL7-59E&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0\" \/><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" \/><embed type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/v\/fW_owL7-59E&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/embed><\/object><\/p>\n<p><strong>Booking Cars &#8211; Driving Cars<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There was a slight mix up with the hire car booking site (Thanks Opodo!) which had reset the pickup times after doing a search, so there was a little confusion when we turned up 6 hours late to pick up one of our 2 hire cars, but it was all sorted out in the end.<\/p>\n<p>Driving on the continent was fine again other than that odd incident where was passed a guy who was driving with the bonnet up against his windscreen, peering through the gap at the bottom of the bonnet.\u00a0 Man, these continentals really need to get places sometimes!<\/p>\n<p>We got hideously lost trying to get back to Bordeaux Station, and were then charged for fuel one of the cars even though it was full.\u00a0 But we got that refunded.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Food, Language &amp; Culture<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m definitely NOT xenophobic, but I am pretty bad at getting to grips with foreign places and being in unusual places where things work differently and I can&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s going on stresses me out a bit.\u00a0 This holiday was helped by my own fairly-good latent knowledge of French, and the presence of many other good French speakers in the group.\u00a0 Altogether a more enjoyable experience than last years trip to Sicily!<\/p>\n<p><strong>A Fantastic Group<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We were with some brilliant people too.\u00a0 Old friends, new friends, cultured and fun, intelligent and witty, some great cooks, some very creative people, and everyone willing to chip in and contribute to the holiday in all sorts of ways.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll always remember sharing book recommendations, larking around in the pool, the fantastic array of food, the excellent drink (including the discovery of Pineau!),messing around with kindred spirits, the chilled-out-ness of it all, and the joy of being with such good people.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, it was warm, but not too hot, dry, and sunny.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s do it again!<\/p>\n",

Which was a brilliant experience. Starting on Friday night with First Great Western (and a fantastically Spanish train manager sounding like a cross between Manuel from Fawlty Towers and the &#8220;Compare the Market&#8221; meercats), and continuing on the fabulously relaxed Eurostar to Paris on Saturday (with a brass band playing as you wait to board&#8230;superb!).<\/p>\n<p>The Paris Metro was a bit of a scrum, but the TGV was a delight.\u00a0 Remind me why we fly again?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Chateau La Bruyere<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The place we stayed was incredible.\u00a0 It was a bit out in the sticks but we had an enormous and unique 16-bedroom place with HUGE dining room and indoor heated swimming pool all to ourselves.\u00a0 It was excellent value for money and, aside from the relatively poorly equipped kitchen, more than met our needs whilst at the same time enthralling us with its charm and character.<\/p>\n<p>I took a quick video tour if you want a speedy look around.<\/p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><param name=\"src\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/v\/fW_owL7-59E&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0\" \/><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" \/><embed type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/v\/fW_owL7-59E&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/embed><\/object><\/p>\n<p><strong>Booking Cars &#8211; Driving Cars<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There was a slight mix up with the hire car booking site (Thanks Opodo!) which had reset the pickup times after doing a search, so there was a little confusion when we turned up 6 hours late to pick up one of our 2 hire cars, but it was all sorted out in the end.<\/p>\n<p>Driving on the continent was fine again other than that odd incident where was passed a guy who was driving with the bonnet up against his windscreen, peering through the gap at the bottom of the bonnet.\u00a0 Man, these continentals really need to get places sometimes!<\/p>\n<p>We got hideously lost trying to get back to Bordeaux Station, and were then charged for fuel one of the cars even though it was full.\u00a0 But we got that refunded.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Food, Language &amp; Culture<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m definitely NOT xenophobic, but I am pretty bad at getting to grips with foreign places and being in unusual places where things work differently and I can&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s going on stresses me out a bit.\u00a0 This holiday was helped by my own fairly-good latent knowledge of French, and the presence of many other good French speakers in the group.\u00a0 Altogether a more enjoyable experience than last years trip to Sicily!<\/p>\n<p><strong>A Fantastic Group<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We were with some brilliant people too.\u00a0 Old friends, new friends, cultured and fun, intelligent and witty, some great cooks, some very creative people, and everyone willing to chip in and contribute to the holiday in all sorts of ways.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll always remember sharing book recommendations, larking around in the pool, the fantastic array of food, the excellent drink (including the discovery of Pineau!),messing around with kindred spirits, the chilled-out-ness of it all, and the joy of being with such good people.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, it was warm, but not too hot, dry, and sunny.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s do it again!<\/p>\n",

Was this weather related? Part of some natural cycle? Or because we used nematodes?\u00a0 No idea.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s use nematodes again next year and see what happens.<\/p>\n<p>Caterpillars were the new arch enemy and we must find a way to control those on the brassicas and raspberries next year.<\/p>\n<p>The lawn was infested with ants.\u00a0 There are nematodes for ants which we tried but this needs to be planned well in advance really and I wasn&#8217;t sure how effective it really was.\u00a0 Hot water also seemed to do the trick.\u00a0 We didn&#8217;t really have a flying ant day this year, which was weird.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Weeds<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We seem to be getting the Creeping Cinquefoil under control, though I continue to be concerned by its presence in the lawn.\u00a0 Bindweed was new but seemed to be contained and limited in its reach &#8211; so far.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Diseases<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Blight continued to be a problem.\u00a0 It kicked in later on the spuds but did kick in, and got a lot of the tomatoes too.<\/p>\n<p>We also had white rot on onions, which is a more serious issue and very hard to get rid of from the soil.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Good Crops<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Potatoes, chard, perpetual spinach, bulb fennel, cabbages (despite the caterpillars), french beans, sugar snap peas, onions and shallots all did particularly well.\u00a0 We loved the taste of flashy butter oak lettuce, and were overwhelmed with the never ending supply of courgettes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bad Crops<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Carrots and parsnips struggled and we got nothing (again) from any of our squash plants.\u00a0 Squashes have been in pots so far so we&#8217;ll try them in the ground next year.\u00a0 Tomatoes succumbed to blight and didn&#8217;t really ripen.\u00a0 Lettuce was hit and miss.\u00a0 We tried to grow calabrese from seed but the seedlings were demolished one night be slugs.\u00a0 Grrr.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Next Year<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One more bed to dig and we have a full complement of 4.5 beds.\u00a0 There will be some rotation and re-stocking on seeds, but generally it&#8217;s looking in pretty good shape.\u00a0 We looke forward to using what we&#8217;ve learned this year to make next year even better!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>We tried lots of new things in the garden this year.\u00a0 Has it worked and what have we learned?<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><strong>Water<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We dug a pong to encourage wildlife.\u00a0 We&#8217;ve not seen much of an increase yet and we mostly put it in to give the frogs somewhere to go when we dug up their existing environment.\u00a0 The frogs do seem to like the pond but also seem to prefer covered ground &#8211; they seem to inhabit the strawberry patch more than the pond area.\u00a0 I also unexpectedly came across (and injured) a slow worm in the long grass while mowing it.\u00a0 To that end, we&#8217;re leaving some grass to grow wild now to ensure that such creatures have somewhere to go.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Beds<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While plans for raised beds were over-ambitious and never realised, we did put a bedding system in place and this worked a treat.\u00a0 Soil quality is much higher from not being trodden down all the time, and things seem to have grown more extensively &#8211; presumably because their roots aren&#8217;t having to penetrate dense, compacted clay soil.\u00a0 Our potato crop was particularly good!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pests<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Slugs were less of a problem. Was this weather related? Part of some natural cycle? Or because we used nematodes?\u00a0 No idea.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s use nematodes again next year and see what happens.<\/p>\n<p>Caterpillars were the new arch enemy and we must find a way to control those on the brassicas and raspberries next year.<\/p>\n<p>The lawn was infested with ants.\u00a0 There are nematodes for ants which we tried but this needs to be planned well in advance really and I wasn&#8217;t sure how effective it really was.\u00a0 Hot water also seemed to do the trick.\u00a0 We didn&#8217;t really have a flying ant day this year, which was weird.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Weeds<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We seem to be getting the Creeping Cinquefoil under control, though I continue to be concerned by its presence in the lawn.\u00a0 Bindweed was new but seemed to be contained and limited in its reach &#8211; so far.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Diseases<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Blight continued to be a problem.\u00a0 It kicked in later on the spuds but did kick in, and got a lot of the tomatoes too.<\/p>\n<p>We also had white rot on onions, which is a more serious issue and very hard to get rid of from the soil.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Good Crops<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Potatoes, chard, perpetual spinach, bulb fennel, cabbages (despite the caterpillars), french beans, sugar snap peas, onions and shallots all did particularly well.\u00a0 We loved the taste of flashy butter oak lettuce, and were overwhelmed with the never ending supply of courgettes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bad Crops<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Carrots and parsnips struggled and we got nothing (again) from any of our squash plants.\u00a0 Squashes have been in pots so far so we&#8217;ll try them in the ground next year.\u00a0 Tomatoes succumbed to blight and didn&#8217;t really ripen.\u00a0 Lettuce was hit and miss.\u00a0 We tried to grow calabrese from seed but the seedlings were demolished one night be slugs.\u00a0 Grrr.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Next Year<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One more bed to dig and we have a full complement of 4.5 beds.\u00a0 There will be some rotation and re-stocking on seeds, but generally it&#8217;s looking in pretty good shape.\u00a0 We looke forward to using what we&#8217;ve learned this year to make next year even better!<\/p>\n",

though it should be pointed out that those we have seen have been HUGE!<\/p>\n<h3>Ants<\/h3>\n<p>We did have some ants last year, but they&#8217;ve multiplied in a big way this year, nesting on the veg patch and munching our lettuce roots as well as causing plenty of lumps on the lawn.<\/p>\n<p>Again, there are Nematodes for these and we&#8217;ve used them with slightly limited success. \u00a0Other strategies of little bait stations and boiling water have helped too, but no one strategy seems to work completely.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps experience will help us out next year.<\/p>\n<p>For now I take some hope in the fact that we have had &#8220;flying ant day&#8221; this year &#8211; or maybe that&#8217;s to come.<\/p>\n<h3>Caterpillars<\/h3>\n<p>Again, not something that was a problem last year, the caterpillars have been probably the worst pest this year. \u00a0Possibly our planting of brassicas (cabbages and broccoli) this year initiated the problem.<\/p>\n<p>It started with small holes nibbled, which led to us finding some small, bright green critters crawling on the underside of leaves.<\/p>\n<p>There is no real defence (except, maybe, attracing as many birds as you can to get them eaten), so we started daily checks and squashings. \u00a0Though it seemed that the more we squashed the more there were. \u00a0We just couldn&#8217;t get rid of them.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_499\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-499\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/dsc00264.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-499\" title=\"Caterpillars\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/dsc00264.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"The Very Hungry Caterpillars\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/dsc00264.jpg 1632w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/dsc00264-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/dsc00264-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-499\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Very Hungry Caterpillars<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Then they start growing and so squashing starts to get on your conscience. \u00a0Killing a large and very squishy caterpillar seems cruel in comparison to the smaller loss of a tiny baby thing. \u00a0The larger ones also seemed to migrate to from the red cabbages to the green broccoli where they were better camoflagued, but then they got brave too and started crawling on the tops of the leaves.<\/p>\n<p>They infested the cabbage hearts and made a huge yucky mess (they seem to make a LOT of poo or something greeny-browny and sludgy).<\/p>\n<p>Yes, these things do turn into beautiful butterflies, but the larval stage of this creature has annoyed us no end.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really remember seeing lots of butterflies &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s one of those things that you only notice once you care about it &#8211; but there&#8217;s been huge numbers of cabbage whites flapping around this year. \u00a0My hopes for less of these things next year are not high.<\/p>\n<h3>Cinquefoil and bindweed<\/h3>\n<p>Already mentioned&#8230;not all of the pests in our garden are animal in nature. \u00a0Fortunately the cinquefoil and bindweed were mostly eradicated from the veg patch when we dug it over and pulled all of the deep roots out. \u00a0There&#8217;s some around the edges but it&#8217;s easy enough to control. \u00a0The same goes for the borders, so it&#8217;s only really the lawn that it&#8217;s tricky to remove it from.<\/p>\n<h3>Next Year?<\/h3>\n<p>This year we&#8217;ve had some new critters: caterpillars and bindweed in particular. \u00a0As we make our garden more suitable for growing, it also seems to become more suitable for some pests.<\/p>\n<p>Next year we hope to see even more growing. \u00a0I desperately hope that that the numbers of our enemies shalln&#8217;t be going the same way.<\/p>\n",

though it should be pointed out that those we have seen have been HUGE!<\/p>\n<h3>Ants<\/h3>\n<p>We did have some ants last year, but they&#8217;ve multiplied in a big way this year, nesting on the veg patch and munching our lettuce roots as well as causing plenty of lumps on the lawn.<\/p>\n<p>Again, there are Nematodes for these and we&#8217;ve used them with slightly limited success. \u00a0Other strategies of little bait stations and boiling water have helped too, but no one strategy seems to work completely.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps experience will help us out next year.<\/p>\n<p>For now I take some hope in the fact that we have had &#8220;flying ant day&#8221; this year &#8211; or maybe that&#8217;s to come.<\/p>\n<h3>Caterpillars<\/h3>\n<p>Again, not something that was a problem last year, the caterpillars have been probably the worst pest this year. \u00a0Possibly our planting of brassicas (cabbages and broccoli) this year initiated the problem.<\/p>\n<p>It started with small holes nibbled, which led to us finding some small, bright green critters crawling on the underside of leaves.<\/p>\n<p>There is no real defence (except, maybe, attracing as many birds as you can to get them eaten), so we started daily checks and squashings. \u00a0Though it seemed that the more we squashed the more there were. \u00a0We just couldn&#8217;t get rid of them.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_499\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-499\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/dsc00264.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-499\" title=\"Caterpillars\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/dsc00264.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"The Very Hungry Caterpillars\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/dsc00264.jpg 1632w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/dsc00264-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/dsc00264-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-499\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Very Hungry Caterpillars<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Then they start growing and so squashing starts to get on your conscience. \u00a0Killing a large and very squishy caterpillar seems cruel in comparison to the smaller loss of a tiny baby thing. \u00a0The larger ones also seemed to migrate to from the red cabbages to the green broccoli where they were better camoflagued, but then they got brave too and started crawling on the tops of the leaves.<\/p>\n<p>They infested the cabbage hearts and made a huge yucky mess (they seem to make a LOT of poo or something greeny-browny and sludgy).<\/p>\n<p>Yes, these things do turn into beautiful butterflies, but the larval stage of this creature has annoyed us no end.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really remember seeing lots of butterflies &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s one of those things that you only notice once you care about it &#8211; but there&#8217;s been huge numbers of cabbage whites flapping around this year. \u00a0My hopes for less of these things next year are not high.<\/p>\n<h3>Cinquefoil and bindweed<\/h3>\n<p>Already mentioned&#8230;not all of the pests in our garden are animal in nature. \u00a0Fortunately the cinquefoil and bindweed were mostly eradicated from the veg patch when we dug it over and pulled all of the deep roots out. \u00a0There&#8217;s some around the edges but it&#8217;s easy enough to control. \u00a0The same goes for the borders, so it&#8217;s only really the lawn that it&#8217;s tricky to remove it from.<\/p>\n<h3>Next Year?<\/h3>\n<p>This year we&#8217;ve had some new critters: caterpillars and bindweed in particular. \u00a0As we make our garden more suitable for growing, it also seems to become more suitable for some pests.<\/p>\n<p>Next year we hope to see even more growing. \u00a0I desperately hope that that the numbers of our enemies shalln&#8217;t be going the same way.<\/p>\n",
