maybe that&#8217;s for another day, but the premise will be that internet reviews of anything are either by people who are so completely in awe of the product that it&#8217;s worth 5 stars, or people who&#8217;ve had a problem and therefore thing it&#8217;s the worst thing in the world and so worth zero stars and lots of use of the words &#8220;suck&#8221;, &#8220;sucks&#8221; and &#8220;sucky&#8221;. \u00a0Such reviews have made objectively choosing a host difficult.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hosting Requirements and Recommendations<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My requirements for a web host are basically that I need lots of php, domain name, and MySQL flexibility at low cost and, preferably, on a month-by-month contract while I try things out. \u00a0I can see the benefits of having limits on storage and data transfer &#8211; this will put off people who just want to waste server resources and probably make for a speedier service.<\/p>\n<p>I also really wanted a UK-based host &#8211; because it would make for localised support and less trans-atlantic lag, while helping out the UK economy (a LITTLE!!)<\/p>\n<p>With internet reviews being mostly very unhelpful I Tweeted for recommendations and was surprised to only get one. \u00a0But the company looked good, met the requirements and allowed me to sign up for a month at a time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DNS woes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Once up and running I then had to delve into the world of DNS, subdomains, add-on domains, CNAMEs, MX records, virtual hosts, domain transfers, and&#8230;err&#8230;other stuff. \u00a0I know about all this, but it&#8217;s been a while since I practically did anything with it, so it took a bit of refreshing. \u00a0Plus, you&#8217;re playing with the real live internet when you&#8217;re doing this and I didn&#8217;t want people&#8217;s email and websites going off line, so I was doing things cautiously.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s worked out that I understand things better then the hosting company&#8217;s support team &#8211; who are quick but don&#8217;t seem to really read what I&#8217;ve asked of them and understand my problem. \u00a0It&#8217;s been difficult to convince them of what needs to happen, but I think we&#8217;re getting there. \u00a0Currently the host does NEARLY all that I need it to, but not quite. \u00a0If their support team can turn around adding me a new domain that&#8217;s hosted with them but DNS-managed elsewhere then I&#8217;ll be happy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CSS complications<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With that all sorted I could turn to doing some web-page mock-ups for one of my apps. \u00a0I&#8217;ve moved on a bit from when I was <a title=\"Debugging the Borders\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/02\/12\/debugging-the-borders\/\" target=\"_self\">Debugging the Borders<\/a>, but I still find CSS awkward to use.<\/p>\n<p>When I was a software engineer we used to say that the engineering principles were the key skill and that languages were like tools. \u00a0What&#8217;s important for a woodworker is knowing how to build things out of wood. \u00a0What type of plane or screwdriver you use is almost irrelevant. \u00a0And to a well-trained software engineer a new language is like a new type of screwdriver, it&#8217;s a tool that you use to apply the engineering principles and can be learned and applied quickly.<\/p>\n<p>However, as I previously wrote, HTML and CSS aren&#8217;t really\u00a0programming languages and so don&#8217;t fit with an existing paradigm in my head. \u00a0It&#8217;s not just another type of screwdriver &#8211; it requires learning a new set of principles and practices.<\/p>\n<p>In the past I&#8217;ve just applied what little CSS I know in a fairly unstructured fashion. \u00a0But what I really need to do is learn CSS from first principles and see it applied by others to get to grips with it. \u00a0I need to understand &#8220;non-replaced elements&#8221;, &#8220;block-level layouts&#8221; and &#8220;selectors&#8221; and how these, and other things, fit together in &#8220;the cascade&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, does anyone know how to left-align text in a centre-aligned box?<\/p>\n",

maybe that&#8217;s for another day, but the premise will be that internet reviews of anything are either by people who are so completely in awe of the product that it&#8217;s worth 5 stars, or people who&#8217;ve had a problem and therefore thing it&#8217;s the worst thing in the world and so worth zero stars and lots of use of the words &#8220;suck&#8221;, &#8220;sucks&#8221; and &#8220;sucky&#8221;. \u00a0Such reviews have made objectively choosing a host difficult.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hosting Requirements and Recommendations<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My requirements for a web host are basically that I need lots of php, domain name, and MySQL flexibility at low cost and, preferably, on a month-by-month contract while I try things out. \u00a0I can see the benefits of having limits on storage and data transfer &#8211; this will put off people who just want to waste server resources and probably make for a speedier service.<\/p>\n<p>I also really wanted a UK-based host &#8211; because it would make for localised support and less trans-atlantic lag, while helping out the UK economy (a LITTLE!!)<\/p>\n<p>With internet reviews being mostly very unhelpful I Tweeted for recommendations and was surprised to only get one. \u00a0But the company looked good, met the requirements and allowed me to sign up for a month at a time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DNS woes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Once up and running I then had to delve into the world of DNS, subdomains, add-on domains, CNAMEs, MX records, virtual hosts, domain transfers, and&#8230;err&#8230;other stuff. \u00a0I know about all this, but it&#8217;s been a while since I practically did anything with it, so it took a bit of refreshing. \u00a0Plus, you&#8217;re playing with the real live internet when you&#8217;re doing this and I didn&#8217;t want people&#8217;s email and websites going off line, so I was doing things cautiously.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s worked out that I understand things better then the hosting company&#8217;s support team &#8211; who are quick but don&#8217;t seem to really read what I&#8217;ve asked of them and understand my problem. \u00a0It&#8217;s been difficult to convince them of what needs to happen, but I think we&#8217;re getting there. \u00a0Currently the host does NEARLY all that I need it to, but not quite. \u00a0If their support team can turn around adding me a new domain that&#8217;s hosted with them but DNS-managed elsewhere then I&#8217;ll be happy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CSS complications<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With that all sorted I could turn to doing some web-page mock-ups for one of my apps. \u00a0I&#8217;ve moved on a bit from when I was <a title=\"Debugging the Borders\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/02\/12\/debugging-the-borders\/\" target=\"_self\">Debugging the Borders<\/a>, but I still find CSS awkward to use.<\/p>\n<p>When I was a software engineer we used to say that the engineering principles were the key skill and that languages were like tools. \u00a0What&#8217;s important for a woodworker is knowing how to build things out of wood. \u00a0What type of plane or screwdriver you use is almost irrelevant. \u00a0And to a well-trained software engineer a new language is like a new type of screwdriver, it&#8217;s a tool that you use to apply the engineering principles and can be learned and applied quickly.<\/p>\n<p>However, as I previously wrote, HTML and CSS aren&#8217;t really\u00a0programming languages and so don&#8217;t fit with an existing paradigm in my head. \u00a0It&#8217;s not just another type of screwdriver &#8211; it requires learning a new set of principles and practices.<\/p>\n<p>In the past I&#8217;ve just applied what little CSS I know in a fairly unstructured fashion. \u00a0But what I really need to do is learn CSS from first principles and see it applied by others to get to grips with it. \u00a0I need to understand &#8220;non-replaced elements&#8221;, &#8220;block-level layouts&#8221; and &#8220;selectors&#8221; and how these, and other things, fit together in &#8220;the cascade&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, does anyone know how to left-align text in a centre-aligned box?<\/p>\n",

I think it&#8217;s fine to tell off red light runners, lane splitters and pavement cyclists because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don&#8217;t do those things.<\/li>\n<li>They are dangerous and, in most cases, illegal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I think bad cycling causes people to dislike cyclists and makes cycling less safe.  Though I have no stats to back this up.<\/p>\n<p>However, cycling in general should be encouraged. Does this mean that bad cycling should be encouraged? Well, put it this way: I would rather encounter a bad cyclist than a bad driver on the road.  The former is always safer.<\/p>\n<p>Thursday evening&#8217;s activity, that prompted my tweet, was a talk by a man from Sustrans organised by a local group that are working to create a better Swindon.<\/p>\n<p>The talk was fascinating as the Sustrans man outlined the need for cycling, the benefits of cycling, and the obstacles to cycling.\u00a0 There was plenty of science and statistics, lots of photos demonstrating possible improvements to cycling infrastructure, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>There then followed a question and answer session.\u00a0 During which I slowly boiled.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been thinking that such a group of people would be excited by the possibilities of bettering people&#8217;s health, reducing congestion in the town and allowing people to see more of the place by encouraging them to get outdoors.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;no.\u00a0 The questions were mostly asking the Sustrans man why cyclists and cycling cause so much trouble.\u00a0 Why don&#8217;t people have lights, or bells?\u00a0 Why do people cycle on pavements?\u00a0 Why isn&#8217;t there a cycle path where the council have been promising one?\u00a0 I sensed that most of the group thought that cyclists were reckless and that the idea of getting more cyclists on bikes was a dream if not a bad idea in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>So my reason for being annoyed at bad cycling is somewhat validated.\u00a0 A lot of people don&#8217;t like cyclists because they break the law and aren&#8217;t courteous to other road users and pedestrians.\u00a0 Is this fair?\u00a0 Or is it a stereotype that&#8217;s applied too sweepingly?\u00a0 I suspect bits of both.\u00a0 In any case, it seems that we have work to do to convince people that, not only is cycling safe for the cyclist, but that it&#8217;s safe for everyone else too!<\/p>\n<p>I should add that at no point was it pointed out that cars break the rules too and that&#8217;s a LOT more dangerous.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s OK to criticise bad cycling, if you&#8217;re doing it from the point of view of wanting to change that and make the roads better, more friendly, safer places.\u00a0 The poor Sustrans man was asked about loads of things that aren&#8217;t his fault, and I was annoyed that the group didn&#8217;t take the opportunity to ask him what we can do to support Sustrans&#8217; work.<\/p>\n<p>After all, it seems they have a lot of work to do.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>It was interesting, after <a title=\"A Little Trip\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/11\/11\/a-little-trip\/\" target=\"_blank\">my rant at misbehaving cyclists<\/a>, to find myself angered by people who rant at misbehaving cyclists on Thursday.\u00a0 For the record I Tweeted: &#8220;Why why WHY invite a nice man from Sustrans to come and talk to you about the importance of cycling and then rant at him about bad cycling?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This may sound like hypocrisy, but let me explain.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>My frustrations with misbehaving cyclists stem from the fact the cyclists get a bad reputation. I think it&#8217;s fine to tell off red light runners, lane splitters and pavement cyclists because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don&#8217;t do those things.<\/li>\n<li>They are dangerous and, in most cases, illegal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I think bad cycling causes people to dislike cyclists and makes cycling less safe.  Though I have no stats to back this up.<\/p>\n<p>However, cycling in general should be encouraged. Does this mean that bad cycling should be encouraged? Well, put it this way: I would rather encounter a bad cyclist than a bad driver on the road.  The former is always safer.<\/p>\n<p>Thursday evening&#8217;s activity, that prompted my tweet, was a talk by a man from Sustrans organised by a local group that are working to create a better Swindon.<\/p>\n<p>The talk was fascinating as the Sustrans man outlined the need for cycling, the benefits of cycling, and the obstacles to cycling.\u00a0 There was plenty of science and statistics, lots of photos demonstrating possible improvements to cycling infrastructure, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>There then followed a question and answer session.\u00a0 During which I slowly boiled.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been thinking that such a group of people would be excited by the possibilities of bettering people&#8217;s health, reducing congestion in the town and allowing people to see more of the place by encouraging them to get outdoors.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;no.\u00a0 The questions were mostly asking the Sustrans man why cyclists and cycling cause so much trouble.\u00a0 Why don&#8217;t people have lights, or bells?\u00a0 Why do people cycle on pavements?\u00a0 Why isn&#8217;t there a cycle path where the council have been promising one?\u00a0 I sensed that most of the group thought that cyclists were reckless and that the idea of getting more cyclists on bikes was a dream if not a bad idea in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>So my reason for being annoyed at bad cycling is somewhat validated.\u00a0 A lot of people don&#8217;t like cyclists because they break the law and aren&#8217;t courteous to other road users and pedestrians.\u00a0 Is this fair?\u00a0 Or is it a stereotype that&#8217;s applied too sweepingly?\u00a0 I suspect bits of both.\u00a0 In any case, it seems that we have work to do to convince people that, not only is cycling safe for the cyclist, but that it&#8217;s safe for everyone else too!<\/p>\n<p>I should add that at no point was it pointed out that cars break the rules too and that&#8217;s a LOT more dangerous.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s OK to criticise bad cycling, if you&#8217;re doing it from the point of view of wanting to change that and make the roads better, more friendly, safer places.\u00a0 The poor Sustrans man was asked about loads of things that aren&#8217;t his fault, and I was annoyed that the group didn&#8217;t take the opportunity to ask him what we can do to support Sustrans&#8217; work.<\/p>\n<p>After all, it seems they have a lot of work to do.<\/p>\n",

One unlit, one highly visible.<\/li>\n<li>One high-vis female cyclist cycling up the inside of a queue of traffic, then switching through a tiny gap onto the outside and zooming off.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I can almost understand the young lad on the BMX.  He&#8217;s just a kid: young and reckless.  In some ways it&#8217;s good that he&#8217;s on a bike.  But does he know how dangerous it is to be unseen?<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But what about the grown-ups in high-vis clothing and lycra doing dangerous and annoying stuff?  Yes, I confess, when I&#8217;m a driver lane splitting annoys me. And as a pedestrian, pavement-cycling annoys me.\u00a0 Perhaps they think that being hi-vis means they&#8217;re allowed to go wherever they like on the road because they&#8217;re safe, but being seen is complementary to being sensible, not a substitute for it.<\/p>\n<p>And what&#8217;s with the cycling on the pavement?  Do they think that because they can&#8217;t go on the road it&#8217;s OK to cycle on the pavement?<\/p>\n<p>Oooh, look, I&#8217;ve gone all <a title=\"The Lycra louts: MPs call for curbs on cyclists who put lives at risk\" href=\"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-1222067\/The-Lycra-louts-MPs-curbs-cyclists-lives-risk.html\" target=\"_blank\">Daily Mail<\/a>!!<\/p>\n<p>The point is that sometimes cyclists do themselves no favours at all.  They should remember that they&#8217;re small and hard to see.  They need to make their actions obvious and predictable to drivers, not behave erratically.  I work on the principle that if I want to be treated like a proper vehicle then I need to behave like one too.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Piracy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While we&#8217;re on the topic of otherwise-law-abiding-citizens exercising their &#8220;rights&#8221; regardless of whether or not it contravenes the law.  Why is it that pleasant, professional, grown-up people, think it&#8217;s OK and normal, if not highly amusing, to commit the crime of piracy?<\/p>\n<p>This week saw some people I know whingeing that their <a title=\"BBC NEWS | Technology | Microsoft disconnects Xbox gamers\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/8354166.stm\" target=\"_blank\">X-Boxes got locked out of X-Box live<\/a> because they&#8217;d hacked them to play pirated games.  Of course, piracy is theft and they should think themselves lucky they&#8217;re not in court and quit moaning about it.<\/p>\n<p>Plenty of people who pirate films, TV programmes, music, and software in this country  can actually afford to buy DVDs, CDs, MP3s, etc.  I&#8217;ve been offered stuff in the past and I&#8217;ve really wanted to tell the offere that I don&#8217;t want it because it&#8217;s illegal, but I feel like I&#8217;ll be laughed at, so I just make excuses about not wanting the content.<\/p>\n<p>Why do people do this?\u00a0 Just because you CAN file share, hack your console and pass around sound and video files everyone thinks it&#8217;s a perfectly acceptable thing to do.  Well, it&#8217;s not.\u00a0 They wouldn&#8217;t steal a media player from Currys so why do they steal the media that goes on it?<\/p>\n<p>I feel like the rebel for obeying the law.\u00a0 That&#8217;s not right is it?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bad Cyclist\/Good Cyclist Part 2<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Northern cities are cool places.  My train back was delayed, but it was kinda good to hang out in the station for a bit. In some ways the station environment is full of annoying, rapidly repeating stuff intended for the hurried traveller, but in other ways a busy station is a great place to observe human behaviour and fashion.<\/p>\n<p>There were lots of people on bikes in the city and a lot of them were using the station.  I was particularly eyeing up two customised fixed-wheel bikes.  Unbranded, black, sleek, simple city bikes.  They looked sharp, fast, elegant.  Bike envy?  I don&#8217;t know what you mean.<\/p>\n<p>There was also a short, fat guy in an orange suit.  I&#8217;m not sure that counted as fashion, but he seemed to be expressing the spirit and freedom that seems to be present in big northern cities.\u00a0 I was reminded recently that &#8220;Zeitgeist&#8221; means &#8220;Spirit of the Times&#8221; &#8211; literally &#8220;Time Ghost&#8221;.\u00a0 Perhaps the Germans would call my experience up North one of Platzgeist?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Had a trip to a big northern city this week which left me with some thoughts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bad Cyclist\/Good Cyclist Part 1<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On my walk to Swindon station I saw some pretty bad cycling:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>One kid in dark clothes weaving his way up a residential street unlit and showing no recognition of the three or four cars that were also on the road.<\/li>\n<li>Two cyclists committing the offence of riding on the pavement because the road was one-way and they wanted to go the other way.  One unlit, one highly visible.<\/li>\n<li>One high-vis female cyclist cycling up the inside of a queue of traffic, then switching through a tiny gap onto the outside and zooming off.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I can almost understand the young lad on the BMX.  He&#8217;s just a kid: young and reckless.  In some ways it&#8217;s good that he&#8217;s on a bike.  But does he know how dangerous it is to be unseen?<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But what about the grown-ups in high-vis clothing and lycra doing dangerous and annoying stuff?  Yes, I confess, when I&#8217;m a driver lane splitting annoys me. And as a pedestrian, pavement-cycling annoys me.\u00a0 Perhaps they think that being hi-vis means they&#8217;re allowed to go wherever they like on the road because they&#8217;re safe, but being seen is complementary to being sensible, not a substitute for it.<\/p>\n<p>And what&#8217;s with the cycling on the pavement?  Do they think that because they can&#8217;t go on the road it&#8217;s OK to cycle on the pavement?<\/p>\n<p>Oooh, look, I&#8217;ve gone all <a title=\"The Lycra louts: MPs call for curbs on cyclists who put lives at risk\" href=\"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-1222067\/The-Lycra-louts-MPs-curbs-cyclists-lives-risk.html\" target=\"_blank\">Daily Mail<\/a>!!<\/p>\n<p>The point is that sometimes cyclists do themselves no favours at all.  They should remember that they&#8217;re small and hard to see.  They need to make their actions obvious and predictable to drivers, not behave erratically.  I work on the principle that if I want to be treated like a proper vehicle then I need to behave like one too.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Piracy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While we&#8217;re on the topic of otherwise-law-abiding-citizens exercising their &#8220;rights&#8221; regardless of whether or not it contravenes the law.  Why is it that pleasant, professional, grown-up people, think it&#8217;s OK and normal, if not highly amusing, to commit the crime of piracy?<\/p>\n<p>This week saw some people I know whingeing that their <a title=\"BBC NEWS | Technology | Microsoft disconnects Xbox gamers\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/8354166.stm\" target=\"_blank\">X-Boxes got locked out of X-Box live<\/a> because they&#8217;d hacked them to play pirated games.  Of course, piracy is theft and they should think themselves lucky they&#8217;re not in court and quit moaning about it.<\/p>\n<p>Plenty of people who pirate films, TV programmes, music, and software in this country  can actually afford to buy DVDs, CDs, MP3s, etc.  I&#8217;ve been offered stuff in the past and I&#8217;ve really wanted to tell the offere that I don&#8217;t want it because it&#8217;s illegal, but I feel like I&#8217;ll be laughed at, so I just make excuses about not wanting the content.<\/p>\n<p>Why do people do this?\u00a0 Just because you CAN file share, hack your console and pass around sound and video files everyone thinks it&#8217;s a perfectly acceptable thing to do.  Well, it&#8217;s not.\u00a0 They wouldn&#8217;t steal a media player from Currys so why do they steal the media that goes on it?<\/p>\n<p>I feel like the rebel for obeying the law.\u00a0 That&#8217;s not right is it?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bad Cyclist\/Good Cyclist Part 2<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Northern cities are cool places.  My train back was delayed, but it was kinda good to hang out in the station for a bit. In some ways the station environment is full of annoying, rapidly repeating stuff intended for the hurried traveller, but in other ways a busy station is a great place to observe human behaviour and fashion.<\/p>\n<p>There were lots of people on bikes in the city and a lot of them were using the station.  I was particularly eyeing up two customised fixed-wheel bikes.  Unbranded, black, sleek, simple city bikes.  They looked sharp, fast, elegant.  Bike envy?  I don&#8217;t know what you mean.<\/p>\n<p>There was also a short, fat guy in an orange suit.  I&#8217;m not sure that counted as fashion, but he seemed to be expressing the spirit and freedom that seems to be present in big northern cities.\u00a0 I was reminded recently that &#8220;Zeitgeist&#8221; means &#8220;Spirit of the Times&#8221; &#8211; literally &#8220;Time Ghost&#8221;.\u00a0 Perhaps the Germans would call my experience up North one of Platzgeist?<\/p>\n",

Yeah, that&#8217;s right, no one should earn that much when people in the world are homeless, starving, without sanitation, lacking health facilities, dying from HIV and AIDS. \u00a0It&#8217;s obscene. \u00a0So come up with some creative ways to share the wealth around. \u00a0And stop those dishonest people tax-dodging too &#8211; they work and do business in this country so they should pay like everyone else. \u00a0 I do my bit &#8211; they need to do theirs. \u00a0And in case you&#8217;re wondering, I count myself as rich, so&#8230;as long as you&#8217;re going to do something good &#8211; I mean, ethical, generous, caring, clever, or just &#8211; with it, I don&#8217;t mind paying some extra.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Of course, any attempts you make to improve the cycling infrastructure, sort out our crappy, overcrowded and expensive trains, and get people out of their cars and using sustainable transport will help too&#8230;particularly the cycling infrastructure bits.<\/p>\n<p>So, it&#8217;s up to you. \u00a0The Honourable Michael Wills MP is going and you might be next. \u00a0Do you want me hassling you with pleading letters, or telling all my friends to vote for you because you&#8217;re fantastic?<\/p>\n",

Yeah, that&#8217;s right, no one should earn that much when people in the world are homeless, starving, without sanitation, lacking health facilities, dying from HIV and AIDS. \u00a0It&#8217;s obscene. \u00a0So come up with some creative ways to share the wealth around. \u00a0And stop those dishonest people tax-dodging too &#8211; they work and do business in this country so they should pay like everyone else. \u00a0 I do my bit &#8211; they need to do theirs. \u00a0And in case you&#8217;re wondering, I count myself as rich, so&#8230;as long as you&#8217;re going to do something good &#8211; I mean, ethical, generous, caring, clever, or just &#8211; with it, I don&#8217;t mind paying some extra.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Of course, any attempts you make to improve the cycling infrastructure, sort out our crappy, overcrowded and expensive trains, and get people out of their cars and using sustainable transport will help too&#8230;particularly the cycling infrastructure bits.<\/p>\n<p>So, it&#8217;s up to you. \u00a0The Honourable Michael Wills MP is going and you might be next. \u00a0Do you want me hassling you with pleading letters, or telling all my friends to vote for you because you&#8217;re fantastic?<\/p>\n",
