maybe that&#8217;s for another day, but the premise will be that internet reviews of anything are either by people who are so completely in awe of the product that it&#8217;s worth 5 stars, or people who&#8217;ve had a problem and therefore thing it&#8217;s the worst thing in the world and so worth zero stars and lots of use of the words &#8220;suck&#8221;, &#8220;sucks&#8221; and &#8220;sucky&#8221;. \u00a0Such reviews have made objectively choosing a host difficult.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hosting Requirements and Recommendations<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My requirements for a web host are basically that I need lots of php, domain name, and MySQL flexibility at low cost and, preferably, on a month-by-month contract while I try things out. \u00a0I can see the benefits of having limits on storage and data transfer &#8211; this will put off people who just want to waste server resources and probably make for a speedier service.<\/p>\n<p>I also really wanted a UK-based host &#8211; because it would make for localised support and less trans-atlantic lag, while helping out the UK economy (a LITTLE!!)<\/p>\n<p>With internet reviews being mostly very unhelpful I Tweeted for recommendations and was surprised to only get one. \u00a0But the company looked good, met the requirements and allowed me to sign up for a month at a time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DNS woes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Once up and running I then had to delve into the world of DNS, subdomains, add-on domains, CNAMEs, MX records, virtual hosts, domain transfers, and&#8230;err&#8230;other stuff. \u00a0I know about all this, but it&#8217;s been a while since I practically did anything with it, so it took a bit of refreshing. \u00a0Plus, you&#8217;re playing with the real live internet when you&#8217;re doing this and I didn&#8217;t want people&#8217;s email and websites going off line, so I was doing things cautiously.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s worked out that I understand things better then the hosting company&#8217;s support team &#8211; who are quick but don&#8217;t seem to really read what I&#8217;ve asked of them and understand my problem. \u00a0It&#8217;s been difficult to convince them of what needs to happen, but I think we&#8217;re getting there. \u00a0Currently the host does NEARLY all that I need it to, but not quite. \u00a0If their support team can turn around adding me a new domain that&#8217;s hosted with them but DNS-managed elsewhere then I&#8217;ll be happy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CSS complications<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With that all sorted I could turn to doing some web-page mock-ups for one of my apps. \u00a0I&#8217;ve moved on a bit from when I was <a title=\"Debugging the Borders\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/02\/12\/debugging-the-borders\/\" target=\"_self\">Debugging the Borders<\/a>, but I still find CSS awkward to use.<\/p>\n<p>When I was a software engineer we used to say that the engineering principles were the key skill and that languages were like tools. \u00a0What&#8217;s important for a woodworker is knowing how to build things out of wood. \u00a0What type of plane or screwdriver you use is almost irrelevant. \u00a0And to a well-trained software engineer a new language is like a new type of screwdriver, it&#8217;s a tool that you use to apply the engineering principles and can be learned and applied quickly.<\/p>\n<p>However, as I previously wrote, HTML and CSS aren&#8217;t really\u00a0programming languages and so don&#8217;t fit with an existing paradigm in my head. \u00a0It&#8217;s not just another type of screwdriver &#8211; it requires learning a new set of principles and practices.<\/p>\n<p>In the past I&#8217;ve just applied what little CSS I know in a fairly unstructured fashion. \u00a0But what I really need to do is learn CSS from first principles and see it applied by others to get to grips with it. \u00a0I need to understand &#8220;non-replaced elements&#8221;, &#8220;block-level layouts&#8221; and &#8220;selectors&#8221; and how these, and other things, fit together in &#8220;the cascade&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, does anyone know how to left-align text in a centre-aligned box?<\/p>\n",

maybe that&#8217;s for another day, but the premise will be that internet reviews of anything are either by people who are so completely in awe of the product that it&#8217;s worth 5 stars, or people who&#8217;ve had a problem and therefore thing it&#8217;s the worst thing in the world and so worth zero stars and lots of use of the words &#8220;suck&#8221;, &#8220;sucks&#8221; and &#8220;sucky&#8221;. \u00a0Such reviews have made objectively choosing a host difficult.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hosting Requirements and Recommendations<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My requirements for a web host are basically that I need lots of php, domain name, and MySQL flexibility at low cost and, preferably, on a month-by-month contract while I try things out. \u00a0I can see the benefits of having limits on storage and data transfer &#8211; this will put off people who just want to waste server resources and probably make for a speedier service.<\/p>\n<p>I also really wanted a UK-based host &#8211; because it would make for localised support and less trans-atlantic lag, while helping out the UK economy (a LITTLE!!)<\/p>\n<p>With internet reviews being mostly very unhelpful I Tweeted for recommendations and was surprised to only get one. \u00a0But the company looked good, met the requirements and allowed me to sign up for a month at a time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>DNS woes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Once up and running I then had to delve into the world of DNS, subdomains, add-on domains, CNAMEs, MX records, virtual hosts, domain transfers, and&#8230;err&#8230;other stuff. \u00a0I know about all this, but it&#8217;s been a while since I practically did anything with it, so it took a bit of refreshing. \u00a0Plus, you&#8217;re playing with the real live internet when you&#8217;re doing this and I didn&#8217;t want people&#8217;s email and websites going off line, so I was doing things cautiously.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s worked out that I understand things better then the hosting company&#8217;s support team &#8211; who are quick but don&#8217;t seem to really read what I&#8217;ve asked of them and understand my problem. \u00a0It&#8217;s been difficult to convince them of what needs to happen, but I think we&#8217;re getting there. \u00a0Currently the host does NEARLY all that I need it to, but not quite. \u00a0If their support team can turn around adding me a new domain that&#8217;s hosted with them but DNS-managed elsewhere then I&#8217;ll be happy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CSS complications<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With that all sorted I could turn to doing some web-page mock-ups for one of my apps. \u00a0I&#8217;ve moved on a bit from when I was <a title=\"Debugging the Borders\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/02\/12\/debugging-the-borders\/\" target=\"_self\">Debugging the Borders<\/a>, but I still find CSS awkward to use.<\/p>\n<p>When I was a software engineer we used to say that the engineering principles were the key skill and that languages were like tools. \u00a0What&#8217;s important for a woodworker is knowing how to build things out of wood. \u00a0What type of plane or screwdriver you use is almost irrelevant. \u00a0And to a well-trained software engineer a new language is like a new type of screwdriver, it&#8217;s a tool that you use to apply the engineering principles and can be learned and applied quickly.<\/p>\n<p>However, as I previously wrote, HTML and CSS aren&#8217;t really\u00a0programming languages and so don&#8217;t fit with an existing paradigm in my head. \u00a0It&#8217;s not just another type of screwdriver &#8211; it requires learning a new set of principles and practices.<\/p>\n<p>In the past I&#8217;ve just applied what little CSS I know in a fairly unstructured fashion. \u00a0But what I really need to do is learn CSS from first principles and see it applied by others to get to grips with it. \u00a0I need to understand &#8220;non-replaced elements&#8221;, &#8220;block-level layouts&#8221; and &#8220;selectors&#8221; and how these, and other things, fit together in &#8220;the cascade&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, does anyone know how to left-align text in a centre-aligned box?<\/p>\n",

I think it&#8217;s fine to tell off red light runners, lane splitters and pavement cyclists because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don&#8217;t do those things.<\/li>\n<li>They are dangerous and, in most cases, illegal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I think bad cycling causes people to dislike cyclists and makes cycling less safe.  Though I have no stats to back this up.<\/p>\n<p>However, cycling in general should be encouraged. Does this mean that bad cycling should be encouraged? Well, put it this way: I would rather encounter a bad cyclist than a bad driver on the road.  The former is always safer.<\/p>\n<p>Thursday evening&#8217;s activity, that prompted my tweet, was a talk by a man from Sustrans organised by a local group that are working to create a better Swindon.<\/p>\n<p>The talk was fascinating as the Sustrans man outlined the need for cycling, the benefits of cycling, and the obstacles to cycling.\u00a0 There was plenty of science and statistics, lots of photos demonstrating possible improvements to cycling infrastructure, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>There then followed a question and answer session.\u00a0 During which I slowly boiled.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been thinking that such a group of people would be excited by the possibilities of bettering people&#8217;s health, reducing congestion in the town and allowing people to see more of the place by encouraging them to get outdoors.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;no.\u00a0 The questions were mostly asking the Sustrans man why cyclists and cycling cause so much trouble.\u00a0 Why don&#8217;t people have lights, or bells?\u00a0 Why do people cycle on pavements?\u00a0 Why isn&#8217;t there a cycle path where the council have been promising one?\u00a0 I sensed that most of the group thought that cyclists were reckless and that the idea of getting more cyclists on bikes was a dream if not a bad idea in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>So my reason for being annoyed at bad cycling is somewhat validated.\u00a0 A lot of people don&#8217;t like cyclists because they break the law and aren&#8217;t courteous to other road users and pedestrians.\u00a0 Is this fair?\u00a0 Or is it a stereotype that&#8217;s applied too sweepingly?\u00a0 I suspect bits of both.\u00a0 In any case, it seems that we have work to do to convince people that, not only is cycling safe for the cyclist, but that it&#8217;s safe for everyone else too!<\/p>\n<p>I should add that at no point was it pointed out that cars break the rules too and that&#8217;s a LOT more dangerous.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s OK to criticise bad cycling, if you&#8217;re doing it from the point of view of wanting to change that and make the roads better, more friendly, safer places.\u00a0 The poor Sustrans man was asked about loads of things that aren&#8217;t his fault, and I was annoyed that the group didn&#8217;t take the opportunity to ask him what we can do to support Sustrans&#8217; work.<\/p>\n<p>After all, it seems they have a lot of work to do.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>It was interesting, after <a title=\"A Little Trip\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/11\/11\/a-little-trip\/\" target=\"_blank\">my rant at misbehaving cyclists<\/a>, to find myself angered by people who rant at misbehaving cyclists on Thursday.\u00a0 For the record I Tweeted: &#8220;Why why WHY invite a nice man from Sustrans to come and talk to you about the importance of cycling and then rant at him about bad cycling?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This may sound like hypocrisy, but let me explain.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>My frustrations with misbehaving cyclists stem from the fact the cyclists get a bad reputation. I think it&#8217;s fine to tell off red light runners, lane splitters and pavement cyclists because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don&#8217;t do those things.<\/li>\n<li>They are dangerous and, in most cases, illegal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I think bad cycling causes people to dislike cyclists and makes cycling less safe.  Though I have no stats to back this up.<\/p>\n<p>However, cycling in general should be encouraged. Does this mean that bad cycling should be encouraged? Well, put it this way: I would rather encounter a bad cyclist than a bad driver on the road.  The former is always safer.<\/p>\n<p>Thursday evening&#8217;s activity, that prompted my tweet, was a talk by a man from Sustrans organised by a local group that are working to create a better Swindon.<\/p>\n<p>The talk was fascinating as the Sustrans man outlined the need for cycling, the benefits of cycling, and the obstacles to cycling.\u00a0 There was plenty of science and statistics, lots of photos demonstrating possible improvements to cycling infrastructure, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>There then followed a question and answer session.\u00a0 During which I slowly boiled.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d been thinking that such a group of people would be excited by the possibilities of bettering people&#8217;s health, reducing congestion in the town and allowing people to see more of the place by encouraging them to get outdoors.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;no.\u00a0 The questions were mostly asking the Sustrans man why cyclists and cycling cause so much trouble.\u00a0 Why don&#8217;t people have lights, or bells?\u00a0 Why do people cycle on pavements?\u00a0 Why isn&#8217;t there a cycle path where the council have been promising one?\u00a0 I sensed that most of the group thought that cyclists were reckless and that the idea of getting more cyclists on bikes was a dream if not a bad idea in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>So my reason for being annoyed at bad cycling is somewhat validated.\u00a0 A lot of people don&#8217;t like cyclists because they break the law and aren&#8217;t courteous to other road users and pedestrians.\u00a0 Is this fair?\u00a0 Or is it a stereotype that&#8217;s applied too sweepingly?\u00a0 I suspect bits of both.\u00a0 In any case, it seems that we have work to do to convince people that, not only is cycling safe for the cyclist, but that it&#8217;s safe for everyone else too!<\/p>\n<p>I should add that at no point was it pointed out that cars break the rules too and that&#8217;s a LOT more dangerous.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s OK to criticise bad cycling, if you&#8217;re doing it from the point of view of wanting to change that and make the roads better, more friendly, safer places.\u00a0 The poor Sustrans man was asked about loads of things that aren&#8217;t his fault, and I was annoyed that the group didn&#8217;t take the opportunity to ask him what we can do to support Sustrans&#8217; work.<\/p>\n<p>After all, it seems they have a lot of work to do.<\/p>\n",

One unlit, one highly visible.<\/li>\n<li>One high-vis female cyclist cycling up the inside of a queue of traffic, then switching through a tiny gap onto the outside and zooming off.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I can almost understand the young lad on the BMX.  He&#8217;s just a kid: young and reckless.  In some ways it&#8217;s good that he&#8217;s on a bike.  But does he know how dangerous it is to be unseen?<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But what about the grown-ups in high-vis clothing and lycra doing dangerous and annoying stuff?  Yes, I confess, when I&#8217;m a driver lane splitting annoys me. And as a pedestrian, pavement-cycling annoys me.\u00a0 Perhaps they think that being hi-vis means they&#8217;re allowed to go wherever they like on the road because they&#8217;re safe, but being seen is complementary to being sensible, not a substitute for it.<\/p>\n<p>And what&#8217;s with the cycling on the pavement?  Do they think that because they can&#8217;t go on the road it&#8217;s OK to cycle on the pavement?<\/p>\n<p>Oooh, look, I&#8217;ve gone all <a title=\"The Lycra louts: MPs call for curbs on cyclists who put lives at risk\" href=\"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-1222067\/The-Lycra-louts-MPs-curbs-cyclists-lives-risk.html\" target=\"_blank\">Daily Mail<\/a>!!<\/p>\n<p>The point is that sometimes cyclists do themselves no favours at all.  They should remember that they&#8217;re small and hard to see.  They need to make their actions obvious and predictable to drivers, not behave erratically.  I work on the principle that if I want to be treated like a proper vehicle then I need to behave like one too.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Piracy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While we&#8217;re on the topic of otherwise-law-abiding-citizens exercising their &#8220;rights&#8221; regardless of whether or not it contravenes the law.  Why is it that pleasant, professional, grown-up people, think it&#8217;s OK and normal, if not highly amusing, to commit the crime of piracy?<\/p>\n<p>This week saw some people I know whingeing that their <a title=\"BBC NEWS | Technology | Microsoft disconnects Xbox gamers\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/8354166.stm\" target=\"_blank\">X-Boxes got locked out of X-Box live<\/a> because they&#8217;d hacked them to play pirated games.  Of course, piracy is theft and they should think themselves lucky they&#8217;re not in court and quit moaning about it.<\/p>\n<p>Plenty of people who pirate films, TV programmes, music, and software in this country  can actually afford to buy DVDs, CDs, MP3s, etc.  I&#8217;ve been offered stuff in the past and I&#8217;ve really wanted to tell the offere that I don&#8217;t want it because it&#8217;s illegal, but I feel like I&#8217;ll be laughed at, so I just make excuses about not wanting the content.<\/p>\n<p>Why do people do this?\u00a0 Just because you CAN file share, hack your console and pass around sound and video files everyone thinks it&#8217;s a perfectly acceptable thing to do.  Well, it&#8217;s not.\u00a0 They wouldn&#8217;t steal a media player from Currys so why do they steal the media that goes on it?<\/p>\n<p>I feel like the rebel for obeying the law.\u00a0 That&#8217;s not right is it?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bad Cyclist\/Good Cyclist Part 2<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Northern cities are cool places.  My train back was delayed, but it was kinda good to hang out in the station for a bit. In some ways the station environment is full of annoying, rapidly repeating stuff intended for the hurried traveller, but in other ways a busy station is a great place to observe human behaviour and fashion.<\/p>\n<p>There were lots of people on bikes in the city and a lot of them were using the station.  I was particularly eyeing up two customised fixed-wheel bikes.  Unbranded, black, sleek, simple city bikes.  They looked sharp, fast, elegant.  Bike envy?  I don&#8217;t know what you mean.<\/p>\n<p>There was also a short, fat guy in an orange suit.  I&#8217;m not sure that counted as fashion, but he seemed to be expressing the spirit and freedom that seems to be present in big northern cities.\u00a0 I was reminded recently that &#8220;Zeitgeist&#8221; means &#8220;Spirit of the Times&#8221; &#8211; literally &#8220;Time Ghost&#8221;.\u00a0 Perhaps the Germans would call my experience up North one of Platzgeist?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Had a trip to a big northern city this week which left me with some thoughts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bad Cyclist\/Good Cyclist Part 1<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On my walk to Swindon station I saw some pretty bad cycling:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>One kid in dark clothes weaving his way up a residential street unlit and showing no recognition of the three or four cars that were also on the road.<\/li>\n<li>Two cyclists committing the offence of riding on the pavement because the road was one-way and they wanted to go the other way.  One unlit, one highly visible.<\/li>\n<li>One high-vis female cyclist cycling up the inside of a queue of traffic, then switching through a tiny gap onto the outside and zooming off.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I can almost understand the young lad on the BMX.  He&#8217;s just a kid: young and reckless.  In some ways it&#8217;s good that he&#8217;s on a bike.  But does he know how dangerous it is to be unseen?<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But what about the grown-ups in high-vis clothing and lycra doing dangerous and annoying stuff?  Yes, I confess, when I&#8217;m a driver lane splitting annoys me. And as a pedestrian, pavement-cycling annoys me.\u00a0 Perhaps they think that being hi-vis means they&#8217;re allowed to go wherever they like on the road because they&#8217;re safe, but being seen is complementary to being sensible, not a substitute for it.<\/p>\n<p>And what&#8217;s with the cycling on the pavement?  Do they think that because they can&#8217;t go on the road it&#8217;s OK to cycle on the pavement?<\/p>\n<p>Oooh, look, I&#8217;ve gone all <a title=\"The Lycra louts: MPs call for curbs on cyclists who put lives at risk\" href=\"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-1222067\/The-Lycra-louts-MPs-curbs-cyclists-lives-risk.html\" target=\"_blank\">Daily Mail<\/a>!!<\/p>\n<p>The point is that sometimes cyclists do themselves no favours at all.  They should remember that they&#8217;re small and hard to see.  They need to make their actions obvious and predictable to drivers, not behave erratically.  I work on the principle that if I want to be treated like a proper vehicle then I need to behave like one too.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Piracy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While we&#8217;re on the topic of otherwise-law-abiding-citizens exercising their &#8220;rights&#8221; regardless of whether or not it contravenes the law.  Why is it that pleasant, professional, grown-up people, think it&#8217;s OK and normal, if not highly amusing, to commit the crime of piracy?<\/p>\n<p>This week saw some people I know whingeing that their <a title=\"BBC NEWS | Technology | Microsoft disconnects Xbox gamers\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/8354166.stm\" target=\"_blank\">X-Boxes got locked out of X-Box live<\/a> because they&#8217;d hacked them to play pirated games.  Of course, piracy is theft and they should think themselves lucky they&#8217;re not in court and quit moaning about it.<\/p>\n<p>Plenty of people who pirate films, TV programmes, music, and software in this country  can actually afford to buy DVDs, CDs, MP3s, etc.  I&#8217;ve been offered stuff in the past and I&#8217;ve really wanted to tell the offere that I don&#8217;t want it because it&#8217;s illegal, but I feel like I&#8217;ll be laughed at, so I just make excuses about not wanting the content.<\/p>\n<p>Why do people do this?\u00a0 Just because you CAN file share, hack your console and pass around sound and video files everyone thinks it&#8217;s a perfectly acceptable thing to do.  Well, it&#8217;s not.\u00a0 They wouldn&#8217;t steal a media player from Currys so why do they steal the media that goes on it?<\/p>\n<p>I feel like the rebel for obeying the law.\u00a0 That&#8217;s not right is it?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bad Cyclist\/Good Cyclist Part 2<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Northern cities are cool places.  My train back was delayed, but it was kinda good to hang out in the station for a bit. In some ways the station environment is full of annoying, rapidly repeating stuff intended for the hurried traveller, but in other ways a busy station is a great place to observe human behaviour and fashion.<\/p>\n<p>There were lots of people on bikes in the city and a lot of them were using the station.  I was particularly eyeing up two customised fixed-wheel bikes.  Unbranded, black, sleek, simple city bikes.  They looked sharp, fast, elegant.  Bike envy?  I don&#8217;t know what you mean.<\/p>\n<p>There was also a short, fat guy in an orange suit.  I&#8217;m not sure that counted as fashion, but he seemed to be expressing the spirit and freedom that seems to be present in big northern cities.\u00a0 I was reminded recently that &#8220;Zeitgeist&#8221; means &#8220;Spirit of the Times&#8221; &#8211; literally &#8220;Time Ghost&#8221;.\u00a0 Perhaps the Germans would call my experience up North one of Platzgeist?<\/p>\n",

Yeah, that&#8217;s right, no one should earn that much when people in the world are homeless, starving, without sanitation, lacking health facilities, dying from HIV and AIDS. \u00a0It&#8217;s obscene. \u00a0So come up with some creative ways to share the wealth around. \u00a0And stop those dishonest people tax-dodging too &#8211; they work and do business in this country so they should pay like everyone else. \u00a0 I do my bit &#8211; they need to do theirs. \u00a0And in case you&#8217;re wondering, I count myself as rich, so&#8230;as long as you&#8217;re going to do something good &#8211; I mean, ethical, generous, caring, clever, or just &#8211; with it, I don&#8217;t mind paying some extra.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Of course, any attempts you make to improve the cycling infrastructure, sort out our crappy, overcrowded and expensive trains, and get people out of their cars and using sustainable transport will help too&#8230;particularly the cycling infrastructure bits.<\/p>\n<p>So, it&#8217;s up to you. \u00a0The Honourable Michael Wills MP is going and you might be next. \u00a0Do you want me hassling you with pleading letters, or telling all my friends to vote for you because you&#8217;re fantastic?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>A general election is looming in the not too distant future. \u00a0I was highly disappointed with the commitments made and the messages sent out at the party conferences this summer, so, if any politicians are reading, here&#8217;s what you need to do to win my vote:<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Something radical on climate change<\/strong>. \u00a0Let&#8217;s stop messing around and take this seriously. \u00a0Creating a future UK \u00a0sustainable energy infrastructure is going to take time and we need to start investing in it now. \u00a0Not only will this reduce our carbon emissions, but it will give us energy security and, in the long term, cheap, electricity. \u00a0We can&#8217;t not do something about this. \u00a0We need emissions cuts, we need investment in sustainables, we need to provide aid to the developing world who are fighting the effects now, and we need to incentives for individuals and businesses to make changes too. \u00a0And yes, I am willing to pay for this out of my taxes (as long as you MP&#8217;s start taking your jobs, and the electorate seriously and stop blatently and flagrantly wasting our money on your own luxuries and then trying to defend yourselves).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stop bickering and tell me what you&#8217;re going to do<\/strong>. \u00a0In the run up to the last local elections, the leaflets that Labour and the Conservatives were sending us were just being nasty to each other. \u00a0I don&#8217;t want my MP to be nasty. \u00a0I want him to be positive, encouraging, honest and wholehearted. \u00a0I&#8217;d like the parties to work together for the common good, so if a policy of the other party is good, say so. \u00a0I don&#8217;t want to hear why everyone is rubbish &#8211; I end up with the impression that all politicians, regardless of party, are rubbish. \u00a0Tell me why you are good! \u00a0Oh, and if you&#8217;re a smaller party or an independant, please send me something or you won&#8217;t stand a chance either!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Be like Robin Hood<\/strong>. \u00a0Yeah, seriously, take from the rich and give to the poor. \u00a0The CEO of my employer earned something like 9 million quid this year. \u00a0HOW MUCH?! Yeah, that&#8217;s right, no one should earn that much when people in the world are homeless, starving, without sanitation, lacking health facilities, dying from HIV and AIDS. \u00a0It&#8217;s obscene. \u00a0So come up with some creative ways to share the wealth around. \u00a0And stop those dishonest people tax-dodging too &#8211; they work and do business in this country so they should pay like everyone else. \u00a0 I do my bit &#8211; they need to do theirs. \u00a0And in case you&#8217;re wondering, I count myself as rich, so&#8230;as long as you&#8217;re going to do something good &#8211; I mean, ethical, generous, caring, clever, or just &#8211; with it, I don&#8217;t mind paying some extra.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Of course, any attempts you make to improve the cycling infrastructure, sort out our crappy, overcrowded and expensive trains, and get people out of their cars and using sustainable transport will help too&#8230;particularly the cycling infrastructure bits.<\/p>\n<p>So, it&#8217;s up to you. \u00a0The Honourable Michael Wills MP is going and you might be next. \u00a0Do you want me hassling you with pleading letters, or telling all my friends to vote for you because you&#8217;re fantastic?<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>We have a new church!<\/p>\n<p>Well, there&#8217;s no building, and no official organisation.\u00a0 There are people, but not many.\u00a0 We have a leader.\u00a0 We don&#8217;t have a regular meeting time, but we do meet.<\/p>\n<p>The primary focus of this group of people is, I suppose, two-fold: loving God, and loving our neighbours.\u00a0 We meet together to worship, to pray, and to learn.\u00a0 But we are also heavily involved in the local community, and most of our &#8220;notices&#8221; when we meet are about how we can use the things that we have to help that community; not by having &#8220;church&#8221; events, where we invite people in, but by going out and helping people and spending time with people.<\/p>\n<p>And you know what? It&#8217;s amazing!!<\/p>\n<p>Since I started following Jesus about 10 years ago I&#8217;ve had a sense that the traditional, meet-in-a-big-old-building-every-Sunday church wasn&#8217;t quite right.\u00a0 It fosters a great community of people, but takes up lots of time.<\/p>\n<p>I heard an interesting talk by a guy recently who had this idea of &#8220;third place&#8221;.\u00a0 He said that we only have time for three places: our home and neighbourhood, our place of work or study, and a &#8220;third place&#8221;.\u00a0 Perhaps this is a football team, or your surfing buddies or your knitting group or just friends you go for nights out with.\u00a0 He said that for most people in churches, the church is their &#8220;third place&#8221;, and they don&#8217;t really have room to be committed to another regular activity or group of people.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s certainly my experience &#8211; being in a traditional church meant being on rotas, meeting in smaller groups, preparing for the Sunday service in some way, and being involved in other, less regular church activities too.\u00a0 Most of my &#8220;spare&#8221; time was spent with people from the church.\u00a0 And this makes the church very insular.<\/p>\n<p>We try to follow the way of Jesus, and the way of Jesus was to meet and help the poor and outcast from society.\u00a0 In my experience, church leaves little time for a guy like me to do this.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus usually upset those who had &#8220;tradition&#8221; too close to their hearts by disagreeing with them or breaking their overly-pious rules.\u00a0 From what I read, his life wasn&#8217;t well planned around temple and synagogue times, though he went there to worship.\u00a0 No, he met people&#8217;s needs as and when they had them.<\/p>\n<p>The early church was like this too.\u00a0 They were generous, pooling resources to help the needy; they were spontaneous, dealing with people and talking to people that they met as they journeyed, not just amongst themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Where mid-week activities with our old church were things like practicing the music for Sunday, planning talks, or running small study groups.\u00a0 Now we&#8217;re planning community events and parties, organising games with the young people of the area, cooking meals for people in crisis, and meeting with council officials to work out how to get people involved in caring for the environment or using sustainable forms of transport.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong.\u00a0 The traditional church holds an enormously important place in the community.\u00a0 I love it, I value it, it&#8217;s been a huge and incredibly positive influence on my life and I&#8217;ve seen it be a huge and positive influence in the community too.\u00a0 The church worldwide has a huge army of people who volunteer in soup kitches, community projects, with children and young people, with people with disabilities, with the elderly, with the homeless, with the poor.\u00a0 The church contributes millions of pounds and hours to local and national charities and to overseas aid.\u00a0 It campaigns on climate change, international justice, human rights, fair trade, water and sanititation.\u00a0\u00a0 The church has its struggles internally and externally, with politics and squabbles, and it has bits of crappy history, bits of often-still-crappy present, and probably plenty of bits of crapness to come in the future.\u00a0 But I can guarantee you that without the traditional church this nation and this world would be a lot worse off.<\/p>\n<p>[I&#8217;ll add a note here acknowledging that the church isn&#8217;t the only source of good things&#8230;there are many, many people of other faiths, and of no faith, that work tirelessly for good causes too.\u00a0 The world would be worse off without Islam, without humanism, and without people who love and serve just because they feel they should too. These people and groups should also be praised and respected.]<\/p>\n<p>But my PERSONAL experience of traditional church was that I spent more time doing things for the church than for the community.\u00a0 Most of the community work was done by the elders and ministers, or by people not holding down full-time jobs or running families who could volunteer.\u00a0 The need for people to serve on a Sunday meant that most of the people didn&#8217;t have much time to do stuff in the community &#8211; the stuff that Jesus did!<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;services&#8221; at the church we&#8217;re in now require very little planning and involvement from the &#8220;congregation&#8221;, and we are therefore free to use more of our spare time actually doing good stuff.<\/p>\n<p>And doing the good stuff in the community gives us reason to worship, and to pray.\u00a0 When we come together we give thanks for the positive things we see happen in the community, we pray for those in need, and we talk about how we can bless others &#8211; not because we want them to like us, or to become part of our group &#8211; just because we value each and every human life.<\/p>\n<p>There are said to be 4 stages of working together: forming, storming, norming and performing.\u00a0 We&#8217;re still probably in the storming phase.\u00a0 As our little gathering grows and changes we will need to &#8220;norm&#8221;.\u00a0 We will need more structure and direction in what we&#8217;re doing.\u00a0 One challenge will be finding a balance between structure and freedom.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m convinced that this is how the church &#8211; the followers of Jesus &#8211; should be.\u00a0 OK&#8230;I refine that&#8230;it&#8217;s how I think a growing proportion of the church should be.\u00a0 Not putting all their efforts into showing kindness to each other, but supporting each other and pooling resources as we show kindness to those outside of the church.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s exciting, it&#8217;s a little scary, it&#8217;s fun, it&#8217;s inspiring, and it&#8217;s great to be a part of.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>We have a new church!<\/p>\n<p>Well, there&#8217;s no building, and no official organisation.\u00a0 There are people, but not many.\u00a0 We have a leader.\u00a0 We don&#8217;t have a regular meeting time, but we do meet.<\/p>\n<p>The primary focus of this group of people is, I suppose, two-fold: loving God, and loving our neighbours.\u00a0 We meet together to worship, to pray, and to learn.\u00a0 But we are also heavily involved in the local community, and most of our &#8220;notices&#8221; when we meet are about how we can use the things that we have to help that community; not by having &#8220;church&#8221; events, where we invite people in, but by going out and helping people and spending time with people.<\/p>\n<p>And you know what? It&#8217;s amazing!!<\/p>\n<p>Since I started following Jesus about 10 years ago I&#8217;ve had a sense that the traditional, meet-in-a-big-old-building-every-Sunday church wasn&#8217;t quite right.\u00a0 It fosters a great community of people, but takes up lots of time.<\/p>\n<p>I heard an interesting talk by a guy recently who had this idea of &#8220;third place&#8221;.\u00a0 He said that we only have time for three places: our home and neighbourhood, our place of work or study, and a &#8220;third place&#8221;.\u00a0 Perhaps this is a football team, or your surfing buddies or your knitting group or just friends you go for nights out with.\u00a0 He said that for most people in churches, the church is their &#8220;third place&#8221;, and they don&#8217;t really have room to be committed to another regular activity or group of people.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s certainly my experience &#8211; being in a traditional church meant being on rotas, meeting in smaller groups, preparing for the Sunday service in some way, and being involved in other, less regular church activities too.\u00a0 Most of my &#8220;spare&#8221; time was spent with people from the church.\u00a0 And this makes the church very insular.<\/p>\n<p>We try to follow the way of Jesus, and the way of Jesus was to meet and help the poor and outcast from society.\u00a0 In my experience, church leaves little time for a guy like me to do this.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus usually upset those who had &#8220;tradition&#8221; too close to their hearts by disagreeing with them or breaking their overly-pious rules.\u00a0 From what I read, his life wasn&#8217;t well planned around temple and synagogue times, though he went there to worship.\u00a0 No, he met people&#8217;s needs as and when they had them.<\/p>\n<p>The early church was like this too.\u00a0 They were generous, pooling resources to help the needy; they were spontaneous, dealing with people and talking to people that they met as they journeyed, not just amongst themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Where mid-week activities with our old church were things like practicing the music for Sunday, planning talks, or running small study groups.\u00a0 Now we&#8217;re planning community events and parties, organising games with the young people of the area, cooking meals for people in crisis, and meeting with council officials to work out how to get people involved in caring for the environment or using sustainable forms of transport.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong.\u00a0 The traditional church holds an enormously important place in the community.\u00a0 I love it, I value it, it&#8217;s been a huge and incredibly positive influence on my life and I&#8217;ve seen it be a huge and positive influence in the community too.\u00a0 The church worldwide has a huge army of people who volunteer in soup kitches, community projects, with children and young people, with people with disabilities, with the elderly, with the homeless, with the poor.\u00a0 The church contributes millions of pounds and hours to local and national charities and to overseas aid.\u00a0 It campaigns on climate change, international justice, human rights, fair trade, water and sanititation.\u00a0\u00a0 The church has its struggles internally and externally, with politics and squabbles, and it has bits of crappy history, bits of often-still-crappy present, and probably plenty of bits of crapness to come in the future.\u00a0 But I can guarantee you that without the traditional church this nation and this world would be a lot worse off.<\/p>\n<p>[I&#8217;ll add a note here acknowledging that the church isn&#8217;t the only source of good things&#8230;there are many, many people of other faiths, and of no faith, that work tirelessly for good causes too.\u00a0 The world would be worse off without Islam, without humanism, and without people who love and serve just because they feel they should too. These people and groups should also be praised and respected.]<\/p>\n<p>But my PERSONAL experience of traditional church was that I spent more time doing things for the church than for the community.\u00a0 Most of the community work was done by the elders and ministers, or by people not holding down full-time jobs or running families who could volunteer.\u00a0 The need for people to serve on a Sunday meant that most of the people didn&#8217;t have much time to do stuff in the community &#8211; the stuff that Jesus did!<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;services&#8221; at the church we&#8217;re in now require very little planning and involvement from the &#8220;congregation&#8221;, and we are therefore free to use more of our spare time actually doing good stuff.<\/p>\n<p>And doing the good stuff in the community gives us reason to worship, and to pray.\u00a0 When we come together we give thanks for the positive things we see happen in the community, we pray for those in need, and we talk about how we can bless others &#8211; not because we want them to like us, or to become part of our group &#8211; just because we value each and every human life.<\/p>\n<p>There are said to be 4 stages of working together: forming, storming, norming and performing.\u00a0 We&#8217;re still probably in the storming phase.\u00a0 As our little gathering grows and changes we will need to &#8220;norm&#8221;.\u00a0 We will need more structure and direction in what we&#8217;re doing.\u00a0 One challenge will be finding a balance between structure and freedom.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m convinced that this is how the church &#8211; the followers of Jesus &#8211; should be.\u00a0 OK&#8230;I refine that&#8230;it&#8217;s how I think a growing proportion of the church should be.\u00a0 Not putting all their efforts into showing kindness to each other, but supporting each other and pooling resources as we show kindness to those outside of the church.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s exciting, it&#8217;s a little scary, it&#8217;s fun, it&#8217;s inspiring, and it&#8217;s great to be a part of.<\/p>\n",

First impressions are of solid build, great screen quality, and fantastically-responsive touch screen (I think it senses your touch by electric fields or something rather than by physical pressure &#8211; read up elsewhere from people that know &#8211; however it works, it works like a dream!)<\/p>\n<h3>A Good, Quick Job Won&#8217;t Be Cheap<\/h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s some truth in saying that you get what you pay for.  The iPod Touch, and, presumably, the iPhone, are expensive, but high-quality devices.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing I did was charge it and pay a few quid to update the OS (the system software) to v3.0.  This enables the device to do lots of very useful things that it couldn&#8217;t do before.<\/p>\n<p>Within a few moments of use I was almost speechless at its ease of use, fully-functional web browswer, speed, responsiveness, and after downloading a few free applications, functionality.<\/p>\n<p>The iPod Touch has a few neat tricks up its sleeve too.  I have big stubby fingers and normally hate small keyboards, but the on-screen keyboard here is REALLY good &#8211; especially combined with the often-magical auto-correction.  The little magnifying glass for positioning within text is genius and completely intuitive.  It magically knew my location (I&#8217;ve still not worked out how!).  With contacts, it knows how to put spaces into phone numbers (e.g. 01234567890 automatically becomes 01234 5678980, but 02012345678 becomes 020 1234 5678), and it knows to capitalise street names.<\/p>\n<p>First impressions: it&#8217;s jaw-droppingly good.  What more can it do?<\/p>\n<h3>It does it all!<\/h3>\n<p>Historically I&#8217;ve been against &#8220;convergence&#8221; &#8211; the idea of combining gadgets that do different things into one.  My traditional iPod has always been a good media player, but a rubbish organiser.  I&#8217;ve never been convinced that my organiser should be a phone &#8211; it&#8217;s the wrong size and shape.  And my phone has always been a rubbish media player and organiser.  But I LIKE the idea of having one set of contacts on my organiser and phone &#8211; and in my online email.  I was hoping that the iPod Touch would do some bits of convergence well.<\/p>\n<p>Email was easy to set up &#8211; give it my Google Mail details and it&#8217;s away with both a slinky mobile web interface and downloading to the iPod&#8217;s email app using IMAP.  With a few moments of configuration, I had it synchronising a Google calendar and contacts too.  My Sony Ericsson phone can also syncronise to Google contacts so my unified address book had arrived!<\/p>\n<p>Google Reader has a nice simple mobile web interface, which works a treat for catching up with Internet news feeds.  The little YouTube app just works giving high quality video with great ease.  The maps app is astonishingly slick, and you can download Google Earth too.  Downloading a few little games and tools showed off the accelerometer and what fun you can have with the touch screen.<\/p>\n<p>I downloaded a Twitter client (or several &#8211; still deciding which is best), and the free Facebook app.  I&#8217;d been recommended &#8220;Weather Pro&#8221; too, which I was initially sceptical of as it had a small cost attached, but it&#8217;s a great app with almost-real-time radar and satellite imagery so you can see what&#8217;s coming!.<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s got the organiser side of things wrapped up.  Well&#8230;in some ways it goes far beyond my old Palm organiser, and in other ways it&#8217;s a bit lacking; the standard note-taking tool is limited, and for some bizarre reason there&#8217;s no to-do list program, but these are minor complaints and can be got around.<\/p>\n<p>Being an iPod, it&#8217;s a media player too.  I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything here to blow you away.  It copies music, podcasts, video and photos from iTunes and presents them.  It&#8217;s pretty slick, but I actually think the fancy graphics and stuff get in the way a bit, and actually, the iPod bit has probably impressed the least.  There&#8217;s not much you can add to an already-decent media player.<\/p>\n<p>The one thing that did impress was the speed of the photo viewing and navigation.  Job VERY well done!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, this is an iPod touch, not an iPhone, so it&#8217;s not a completely converged device.  But two into one has gone very nicely.<\/p>\n<h3>&#8230;and it does a whole load more too!<\/h3>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s &#8220;App Store&#8221; (&#8220;app&#8221; is short for &#8220;Application&#8221;) is full of little programs that you can download, some for a small charge (most are less than a couple of quid), some for free!  And here&#8217;s where the fun begins.  What else do you want to do?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blog with the WordPress app<\/li>\n<li> Get real-time London Underground status, a map and journey planner with Tube Deluxe<\/li>\n<li>View Ordnance Survey mapping with iOSMaps<\/li>\n<li> Securely store passwords, pins and website logins.<\/li>\n<li> Chat with MSN or Yahoo contacts using eBuddy<\/li>\n<li> View Sky TV schedules and tell your Sky+ box to record with the Sky+ app<\/li>\n<li> Chat (text only) with Skype<\/li>\n<li> Browse and view photos on Flickr with the Flickr App<\/li>\n<li> Manage all aspects of you eBay account, browse the auctions, bid, watch items, leave feedback with the eBay app<\/li>\n<li> Manage a LinkedIn profile and network with the LinkedIn App<\/li>\n<li> Remotely control a computer using a VNC client<\/li>\n<li> If you&#8217;re a Geocacher, find caches, save details for offline referral, log finds &#8211; no more printing pages of logs!<\/li>\n<li> Play vast numbers of silly games &#8211; some of which are highly addictive time-killers (that&#8217;s you Flight Control!)<\/li>\n<li> Read books (I mostly use mine to carry round a reference Bible &#8211; probably the subject of a future post).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The only real problem is that, because you can do almost everything from this little device, it stays stuck to your left hand and you switch it on to answer any and all questions.  It becomes the oracle of your life.  It goes everywhere and&#8230;would I be lost without it?  Probably!<\/p>\n<h3>Flaws<\/h3>\n<p>OK.  This device is SO good, so fast, so functional, so slick, that can&#8217;t help feeling hugely let down when you find a flaw.  Here are some that I&#8217;ve noticed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> <strong>It should have a camera<\/strong>.  I know the iPhone has camera and GPS built in as well as being a phone.  But the iPod Touch really suffers by not having even just a camera (did I say that <a title=\"Pods and Parcels\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/16\/pods-and-parcels\/\" target=\"_blank\">I didn&#8217;t care about this before<\/a>?  Well with all these apps, I do now!)<\/li>\n<li><strong> To-do list<\/strong>.  It masquerades as an organiser with contacts and calendar, but it has no to-do list.  WHY???<\/li>\n<li><strong> Notes<\/strong>.  The standard notes application is half-hearted.  With a to-do list and categorised notes you could sell this as a high-spec personal information manager, but the notes app is lame.  Again&#8230;why???<\/li>\n<li><strong> Contacts-calendar-birthday sync<\/strong>.  The contacts and calendar are so good that I&#8217;m left wondering why they didn&#8217;t link the &#8220;Birthday&#8221; field in the contacts to the calendar.  Fortunately Google contacts\/calendar now does this for me, but it&#8217;s a striking omission from a device which does most things that you&#8217;d expect it to.<\/li>\n<li><strong> Not all apps have landscape<\/strong>.  I guess this is up to the application writers to code, but not all apps go widescreen when you turn the device sideways.  One app even insisted on using landscape keyboard all the time.<\/li>\n<li><strong> Too many clicks to shuffle an artist\/album or genre.<\/strong> There should be a quicker, cleverer way to do this!<\/li>\n<li><strong> It needs a universal &#8220;back&#8221; button.<\/strong> I&#8217;m definitely from the function-over-form school of design, and am sceptical of Apple minimalist devices as a result.  From what I understand they bowed to public pressure to add up\/down volume buttons to the two existing &#8220;sleep\/wake&#8221; and &#8220;Home&#8221; (i.e. &#8220;everything else&#8221;) buttons.  But I think it needs just one more&#8230;a back button.  Example: touching a contacts address takes you to that address in the maps application.  Very neat!  But what if I want to go back to the contact?  I have to press the home button, then select contacts and then find the contact again.  Being able to go back would be really useful!<\/li>\n<li> Talking of the clever address -&gt; map function&#8230;clicking an address on a contact takes you to the map, but clicking the location on an appointment in the calendar doesn&#8217;t.  Come on Apple&#8230;don&#8217;t set my expectations and then dash them.  If you&#8217;re going to let me tap an address and go to the map then make this happen consistently, or not at all!<\/li>\n<li> <strong>Audible alerts.<\/strong> Yes, the iPod Touch is the poor cousin of the iPhone, and I suspect the iPhone does this much better, but audible alerts aren&#8217;t always audible.  If I&#8217;ve turned the music volume down, I don&#8217;t hear an alert for an appointment.  If I&#8217;ve got headphones in then the alert sounds through the headphones &#8211; even if I don&#8217;t have them on\/in.  I suspect that, in some cases, this is the right thing to do, but it needs something like the &#8220;profiles&#8221; on my mobile phone so these things can be better customised.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Techies among you may be wondering if I&#8217;m disappointed by the lack of &#8220;multi-tasking&#8221;; that is, does it bother me that I can only run one app at a time and can&#8217;t have things running in the background?  The answer is no, but I&#8217;m not sure why.  I suppose it would be good to have, say, a Twitter client running in the background checking for new Tweets and alerting me.  But the truth is I don&#8217;t miss multi-tasking and it probably means that the apps that you do run run very quick.  Plus, switching apps is so quick that I don&#8217;t think it has the illusion of multi-tasking.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Summing Up<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I toyed with the idea of using the money from my headphones prize to buy a decent smart phone, but they were all too expensive.  I looked at iPhones too&#8230;WAY to expensive.  And yet, having used this device; having had it become indispensable, take over my life and change my whole notion of what it means to be &#8220;connected&#8221;, having realised that, actually, device convergance CAN be done and be done well; I find myself completely understanding those who pay over-the-odds for an iPhone.  The addition of a camera, phone and GPS would only serve to make this device more indispensable, it would complete the convergence by removing at least two other gadgets from my stash.<\/p>\n<p>I should emphasise that the iPod Touch is not just pretty, fast, slick.  It does a whole heap of useful stuff too.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s a downside to all this amazing electronic and software wizardry.<\/p>\n<p>I watched the Disney Pixar film Wall-E the other day (also highly recommended!) and there are some people in it who&#8217;ve become so immersed in portable video screens, so hooked into remote, electronic communication, and so pampered by robots and machines, that they&#8217;ve lost the simple pleasures of holding a hand, having a conversation, staring in awe at the stars, and working as a team to achieve something good.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, even for us, it&#8217;s SO easy to become immersed in technology and let ut rule us.  My iPod has taken over somewhat.  I&#8217;m slightly addicted to being so incredibly hooked up to the global internet, and perhaps a little at risk of forsaking the delights of the real world: walks in the country, sitting reading a book in the sunshine, conversing over a cup of coffee.  Technology is great but it&#8217;s addictive and does remove us from reality somewhat.  There&#8217;s something about the pages of a newspaper that beats Google Reader in a qualitative way.  There&#8217;s something special about writing a letter rather than an email.  There&#8217;s a certain joy in carrying a notebook and pen and writing things down in your own hand for later reading.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, the iPod Touch is a phenomenal and, dare I say it, life changing device &#8211; I would guess that the iPhone is more so.  But it should come with a health warning and we should constantly remind ourselves that we need to stay hooked up to the real world too!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><a title=\"Pods and Parcels\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/16\/pods-and-parcels\/\" target=\"_blank\">A while back<\/a> I mentioned that I&#8217;d sort-of won myself an Apple iPod Touch by winning a management-speak competition.<\/p>\n<p>These things are reviewed to death these days so, though this would probably be called a review, it&#8217;s more just my thoughts on the device.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Openings<\/h3>\n<p>The box it comes in is small but does the job.  First impressions are of solid build, great screen quality, and fantastically-responsive touch screen (I think it senses your touch by electric fields or something rather than by physical pressure &#8211; read up elsewhere from people that know &#8211; however it works, it works like a dream!)<\/p>\n<h3>A Good, Quick Job Won&#8217;t Be Cheap<\/h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s some truth in saying that you get what you pay for.  The iPod Touch, and, presumably, the iPhone, are expensive, but high-quality devices.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing I did was charge it and pay a few quid to update the OS (the system software) to v3.0.  This enables the device to do lots of very useful things that it couldn&#8217;t do before.<\/p>\n<p>Within a few moments of use I was almost speechless at its ease of use, fully-functional web browswer, speed, responsiveness, and after downloading a few free applications, functionality.<\/p>\n<p>The iPod Touch has a few neat tricks up its sleeve too.  I have big stubby fingers and normally hate small keyboards, but the on-screen keyboard here is REALLY good &#8211; especially combined with the often-magical auto-correction.  The little magnifying glass for positioning within text is genius and completely intuitive.  It magically knew my location (I&#8217;ve still not worked out how!).  With contacts, it knows how to put spaces into phone numbers (e.g. 01234567890 automatically becomes 01234 5678980, but 02012345678 becomes 020 1234 5678), and it knows to capitalise street names.<\/p>\n<p>First impressions: it&#8217;s jaw-droppingly good.  What more can it do?<\/p>\n<h3>It does it all!<\/h3>\n<p>Historically I&#8217;ve been against &#8220;convergence&#8221; &#8211; the idea of combining gadgets that do different things into one.  My traditional iPod has always been a good media player, but a rubbish organiser.  I&#8217;ve never been convinced that my organiser should be a phone &#8211; it&#8217;s the wrong size and shape.  And my phone has always been a rubbish media player and organiser.  But I LIKE the idea of having one set of contacts on my organiser and phone &#8211; and in my online email.  I was hoping that the iPod Touch would do some bits of convergence well.<\/p>\n<p>Email was easy to set up &#8211; give it my Google Mail details and it&#8217;s away with both a slinky mobile web interface and downloading to the iPod&#8217;s email app using IMAP.  With a few moments of configuration, I had it synchronising a Google calendar and contacts too.  My Sony Ericsson phone can also syncronise to Google contacts so my unified address book had arrived!<\/p>\n<p>Google Reader has a nice simple mobile web interface, which works a treat for catching up with Internet news feeds.  The little YouTube app just works giving high quality video with great ease.  The maps app is astonishingly slick, and you can download Google Earth too.  Downloading a few little games and tools showed off the accelerometer and what fun you can have with the touch screen.<\/p>\n<p>I downloaded a Twitter client (or several &#8211; still deciding which is best), and the free Facebook app.  I&#8217;d been recommended &#8220;Weather Pro&#8221; too, which I was initially sceptical of as it had a small cost attached, but it&#8217;s a great app with almost-real-time radar and satellite imagery so you can see what&#8217;s coming!.<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s got the organiser side of things wrapped up.  Well&#8230;in some ways it goes far beyond my old Palm organiser, and in other ways it&#8217;s a bit lacking; the standard note-taking tool is limited, and for some bizarre reason there&#8217;s no to-do list program, but these are minor complaints and can be got around.<\/p>\n<p>Being an iPod, it&#8217;s a media player too.  I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything here to blow you away.  It copies music, podcasts, video and photos from iTunes and presents them.  It&#8217;s pretty slick, but I actually think the fancy graphics and stuff get in the way a bit, and actually, the iPod bit has probably impressed the least.  There&#8217;s not much you can add to an already-decent media player.<\/p>\n<p>The one thing that did impress was the speed of the photo viewing and navigation.  Job VERY well done!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, this is an iPod touch, not an iPhone, so it&#8217;s not a completely converged device.  But two into one has gone very nicely.<\/p>\n<h3>&#8230;and it does a whole load more too!<\/h3>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s &#8220;App Store&#8221; (&#8220;app&#8221; is short for &#8220;Application&#8221;) is full of little programs that you can download, some for a small charge (most are less than a couple of quid), some for free!  And here&#8217;s where the fun begins.  What else do you want to do?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blog with the WordPress app<\/li>\n<li> Get real-time London Underground status, a map and journey planner with Tube Deluxe<\/li>\n<li>View Ordnance Survey mapping with iOSMaps<\/li>\n<li> Securely store passwords, pins and website logins.<\/li>\n<li> Chat with MSN or Yahoo contacts using eBuddy<\/li>\n<li> View Sky TV schedules and tell your Sky+ box to record with the Sky+ app<\/li>\n<li> Chat (text only) with Skype<\/li>\n<li> Browse and view photos on Flickr with the Flickr App<\/li>\n<li> Manage all aspects of you eBay account, browse the auctions, bid, watch items, leave feedback with the eBay app<\/li>\n<li> Manage a LinkedIn profile and network with the LinkedIn App<\/li>\n<li> Remotely control a computer using a VNC client<\/li>\n<li> If you&#8217;re a Geocacher, find caches, save details for offline referral, log finds &#8211; no more printing pages of logs!<\/li>\n<li> Play vast numbers of silly games &#8211; some of which are highly addictive time-killers (that&#8217;s you Flight Control!)<\/li>\n<li> Read books (I mostly use mine to carry round a reference Bible &#8211; probably the subject of a future post).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The only real problem is that, because you can do almost everything from this little device, it stays stuck to your left hand and you switch it on to answer any and all questions.  It becomes the oracle of your life.  It goes everywhere and&#8230;would I be lost without it?  Probably!<\/p>\n<h3>Flaws<\/h3>\n<p>OK.  This device is SO good, so fast, so functional, so slick, that can&#8217;t help feeling hugely let down when you find a flaw.  Here are some that I&#8217;ve noticed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> <strong>It should have a camera<\/strong>.  I know the iPhone has camera and GPS built in as well as being a phone.  But the iPod Touch really suffers by not having even just a camera (did I say that <a title=\"Pods and Parcels\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/16\/pods-and-parcels\/\" target=\"_blank\">I didn&#8217;t care about this before<\/a>?  Well with all these apps, I do now!)<\/li>\n<li><strong> To-do list<\/strong>.  It masquerades as an organiser with contacts and calendar, but it has no to-do list.  WHY???<\/li>\n<li><strong> Notes<\/strong>.  The standard notes application is half-hearted.  With a to-do list and categorised notes you could sell this as a high-spec personal information manager, but the notes app is lame.  Again&#8230;why???<\/li>\n<li><strong> Contacts-calendar-birthday sync<\/strong>.  The contacts and calendar are so good that I&#8217;m left wondering why they didn&#8217;t link the &#8220;Birthday&#8221; field in the contacts to the calendar.  Fortunately Google contacts\/calendar now does this for me, but it&#8217;s a striking omission from a device which does most things that you&#8217;d expect it to.<\/li>\n<li><strong> Not all apps have landscape<\/strong>.  I guess this is up to the application writers to code, but not all apps go widescreen when you turn the device sideways.  One app even insisted on using landscape keyboard all the time.<\/li>\n<li><strong> Too many clicks to shuffle an artist\/album or genre.<\/strong> There should be a quicker, cleverer way to do this!<\/li>\n<li><strong> It needs a universal &#8220;back&#8221; button.<\/strong> I&#8217;m definitely from the function-over-form school of design, and am sceptical of Apple minimalist devices as a result.  From what I understand they bowed to public pressure to add up\/down volume buttons to the two existing &#8220;sleep\/wake&#8221; and &#8220;Home&#8221; (i.e. &#8220;everything else&#8221;) buttons.  But I think it needs just one more&#8230;a back button.  Example: touching a contacts address takes you to that address in the maps application.  Very neat!  But what if I want to go back to the contact?  I have to press the home button, then select contacts and then find the contact again.  Being able to go back would be really useful!<\/li>\n<li> Talking of the clever address -&gt; map function&#8230;clicking an address on a contact takes you to the map, but clicking the location on an appointment in the calendar doesn&#8217;t.  Come on Apple&#8230;don&#8217;t set my expectations and then dash them.  If you&#8217;re going to let me tap an address and go to the map then make this happen consistently, or not at all!<\/li>\n<li> <strong>Audible alerts.<\/strong> Yes, the iPod Touch is the poor cousin of the iPhone, and I suspect the iPhone does this much better, but audible alerts aren&#8217;t always audible.  If I&#8217;ve turned the music volume down, I don&#8217;t hear an alert for an appointment.  If I&#8217;ve got headphones in then the alert sounds through the headphones &#8211; even if I don&#8217;t have them on\/in.  I suspect that, in some cases, this is the right thing to do, but it needs something like the &#8220;profiles&#8221; on my mobile phone so these things can be better customised.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Techies among you may be wondering if I&#8217;m disappointed by the lack of &#8220;multi-tasking&#8221;; that is, does it bother me that I can only run one app at a time and can&#8217;t have things running in the background?  The answer is no, but I&#8217;m not sure why.  I suppose it would be good to have, say, a Twitter client running in the background checking for new Tweets and alerting me.  But the truth is I don&#8217;t miss multi-tasking and it probably means that the apps that you do run run very quick.  Plus, switching apps is so quick that I don&#8217;t think it has the illusion of multi-tasking.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Summing Up<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I toyed with the idea of using the money from my headphones prize to buy a decent smart phone, but they were all too expensive.  I looked at iPhones too&#8230;WAY to expensive.  And yet, having used this device; having had it become indispensable, take over my life and change my whole notion of what it means to be &#8220;connected&#8221;, having realised that, actually, device convergance CAN be done and be done well; I find myself completely understanding those who pay over-the-odds for an iPhone.  The addition of a camera, phone and GPS would only serve to make this device more indispensable, it would complete the convergence by removing at least two other gadgets from my stash.<\/p>\n<p>I should emphasise that the iPod Touch is not just pretty, fast, slick.  It does a whole heap of useful stuff too.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s a downside to all this amazing electronic and software wizardry.<\/p>\n<p>I watched the Disney Pixar film Wall-E the other day (also highly recommended!) and there are some people in it who&#8217;ve become so immersed in portable video screens, so hooked into remote, electronic communication, and so pampered by robots and machines, that they&#8217;ve lost the simple pleasures of holding a hand, having a conversation, staring in awe at the stars, and working as a team to achieve something good.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, even for us, it&#8217;s SO easy to become immersed in technology and let ut rule us.  My iPod has taken over somewhat.  I&#8217;m slightly addicted to being so incredibly hooked up to the global internet, and perhaps a little at risk of forsaking the delights of the real world: walks in the country, sitting reading a book in the sunshine, conversing over a cup of coffee.  Technology is great but it&#8217;s addictive and does remove us from reality somewhat.  There&#8217;s something about the pages of a newspaper that beats Google Reader in a qualitative way.  There&#8217;s something special about writing a letter rather than an email.  There&#8217;s a certain joy in carrying a notebook and pen and writing things down in your own hand for later reading.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, the iPod Touch is a phenomenal and, dare I say it, life changing device &#8211; I would guess that the iPhone is more so.
