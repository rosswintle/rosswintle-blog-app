This means that it can be assigned to a variable, as I have done above:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$addToArray = function ($item) use ($a) { ... };\n\n$addToArray(...);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>or it can be used &#8220;inline&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\narray_map( function ($item) use($var) { ... }, $someArray );\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Auto-capturing vs non-auto-capturing<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The short <code>fn()<\/code> syntax is &#8220;auto-capturing&#8221;. This means you don&#8217;t need to use <code>use()<\/code> to import variables from the outer scope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The longer <code>function()<\/code> syntax is not &#8220;auto-capturing&#8221;. You need to manually import variables from the outer scope using <code>use()<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Statement vs expression<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The statement version is the &#8220;multi-line&#8221; version of a function definition. You use the curly braces to define the statement that the function executes. This may or may not return a value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The expression is the shorter &#8220;single-line&#8221; version (though the single expression may actually span multiple lines) and always returns the value of the expression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These three syntax forms allow up to eight different types of function:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Anonymous, auto-capturing statement (which Nuno is proposing)<\/li><li>Anonymous, non-auto-capturing, statement (which exists)<\/li><li>Names, non-auto-capturing, statement (which most people would consider a &#8216;regular&#8217; PHP function)<\/li><li>etc.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all described in the <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.php.net\/rfc\/auto-capture-closure#background\">&#8220;Background&#8221; section of the RFC<\/a> along with reasons why some of them may\/should never exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding the conventions of <code>fn()<\/code> vs <code>function()<\/code>, and  expression vs statement is really helpful in understanding PHP code and what type of function to write when.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ONE MORE THING: Scope!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230; the biggest thing that I learned about PHP closures &#8211; that is all anonymous functions regardless of auto- or non-auto-capturing &#8211; is that the imported variables from the outer scope are imported as VALUES, not REFERENCES&#8230; That is, if you change the value inside the function, the outer scope is not affected:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$a = 2;\n$fn = function() use ($a) {\n  $a = $a + 1;\n}\nvar_dump($a); \/\/ outputs 2\n$fn();\nvar_dump($a); \/\/ outputs 2\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>You can see that at work in <a href=\"https:\/\/web.tinkerwell.app\/#\/snippets\/dd4c777d-233e-4ac3-841e-995484137fe0\">this live snippet<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AND!!\u2026 the function captures that value at the time the function is declared not the time the function is called:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$a = 2;\n$fn = function() use ($a) {\n  var_dump($a); \/\/ outputs 2\n};\n$a++;\nvar_dump($a); \/\/ outputs 3\n$fn();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>You can see that at work in <a href=\"https:\/\/web.tinkerwell.app\/#\/snippets\/a907d9ee-fb50-48fb-9d29-4e94f3fc6b15\">this live snippet<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all VERY different to how closures work in JavaScript and definitely worth knowing if, like me, you&#8217;ve done functional-style programming in JS and want to switch to a similar style in PHP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230; I learned a lot diving into this little RFC. It was fun! I hope you learned something too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Useful reference: <a href=\"https:\/\/stitcher.io\/blog\/short-closures-in-php\">Short Closures in PHP on the Stitcher blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n",

This means that it can be assigned to a variable, as I have done above:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$addToArray = function ($item) use ($a) { ... };\n\n$addToArray(...);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>or it can be used &#8220;inline&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\narray_map( function ($item) use($var) { ... }, $someArray );\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Auto-capturing vs non-auto-capturing<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The short <code>fn()<\/code> syntax is &#8220;auto-capturing&#8221;. This means you don&#8217;t need to use <code>use()<\/code> to import variables from the outer scope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The longer <code>function()<\/code> syntax is not &#8220;auto-capturing&#8221;. You need to manually import variables from the outer scope using <code>use()<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Statement vs expression<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The statement version is the &#8220;multi-line&#8221; version of a function definition. You use the curly braces to define the statement that the function executes. This may or may not return a value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The expression is the shorter &#8220;single-line&#8221; version (though the single expression may actually span multiple lines) and always returns the value of the expression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These three syntax forms allow up to eight different types of function:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Anonymous, auto-capturing statement (which Nuno is proposing)<\/li><li>Anonymous, non-auto-capturing, statement (which exists)<\/li><li>Names, non-auto-capturing, statement (which most people would consider a &#8216;regular&#8217; PHP function)<\/li><li>etc.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all described in the <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.php.net\/rfc\/auto-capture-closure#background\">&#8220;Background&#8221; section of the RFC<\/a> along with reasons why some of them may\/should never exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding the conventions of <code>fn()<\/code> vs <code>function()<\/code>, and  expression vs statement is really helpful in understanding PHP code and what type of function to write when.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ONE MORE THING: Scope!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230; the biggest thing that I learned about PHP closures &#8211; that is all anonymous functions regardless of auto- or non-auto-capturing &#8211; is that the imported variables from the outer scope are imported as VALUES, not REFERENCES&#8230; That is, if you change the value inside the function, the outer scope is not affected:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$a = 2;\n$fn = function() use ($a) {\n  $a = $a + 1;\n}\nvar_dump($a); \/\/ outputs 2\n$fn();\nvar_dump($a); \/\/ outputs 2\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>You can see that at work in <a href=\"https:\/\/web.tinkerwell.app\/#\/snippets\/dd4c777d-233e-4ac3-841e-995484137fe0\">this live snippet<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AND!!\u2026 the function captures that value at the time the function is declared not the time the function is called:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n$a = 2;\n$fn = function() use ($a) {\n  var_dump($a); \/\/ outputs 2\n};\n$a++;\nvar_dump($a); \/\/ outputs 3\n$fn();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>You can see that at work in <a href=\"https:\/\/web.tinkerwell.app\/#\/snippets\/a907d9ee-fb50-48fb-9d29-4e94f3fc6b15\">this live snippet<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all VERY different to how closures work in JavaScript and definitely worth knowing if, like me, you&#8217;ve done functional-style programming in JS and want to switch to a similar style in PHP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230; I learned a lot diving into this little RFC. It was fun! I hope you learned something too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Useful reference: <a href=\"https:\/\/stitcher.io\/blog\/short-closures-in-php\">Short Closures in PHP on the Stitcher blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>There&#8217;s a sort-of-joke that there&#8217;s a bunch of things that all developers are supposed to code from scratch at some point in their career. A blog. A to-do list app. The &#8220;canonical&#8221; applications. And one of these is a static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve actually never built any of these things from scratch. But while making <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a> I wanted to make a really simple landing page. I wanted to use TailwindCSS, because I can work quickly with that and use <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\">TailwindUI<\/a>. And to use Tailwind properly you kinda need to have &#8220;components&#8221;, or at least &#8220;template partials&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I kinda needed a way to do &#8220;HTML includes&#8221;. Which is a thing that doesn&#8217;t exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I put the feelers out for a SUPER simple solution for doing this. Ideally I wanted to avoid a huge <code>node_modules<\/code> folder, and a tool that would at some point require me to downgrade node by three versions just to update a CSS class or change a hyperlink.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Responses to this were:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>FlightPHP &#8211; Micro-framework. Does routing, but not static output. via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BinaryMoon\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a>.<\/li><li>The <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/objects-in-space\/considering-a-static-site-tool-learn-gulp-2fd5f9821fc4\">Gulp-only approach<\/a> &#8211; Needs Gulp. Will probably break at some point. Also via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BinaryMoon\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a>.<\/li><li>Jekyll &#8211; Tried it before. Didn&#8217;t like it. Got confused by all the Ruby stuff. Also via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BinaryMoon\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a>.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/codekitapp.com\/help\/kit\/\">CodeKit<\/a> &#8211; Looks good, but needs CodeKit. ALSO via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BinaryMoon\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a>.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.11ty.dev\/\">11ty<\/a> &#8211; Which looks awesome but starts with <code>npm install<\/code>, and then I looked at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.11ty.dev\/docs\/resources\/\">the docs<\/a> and was overwhelmed. So big nope. via Pretty Much Everyone Else.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/mozilla.github.io\/nunjucks\/\">Nunjucks<\/a> &#8211; Which is a &#8220;a more sophisticated templating engine for JavaScript&#8221;, which meets neither my requirement for something super-simple, nor my desire to avoid JavaScript in the build. It probably needs something like Gulp as well. via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/richard_bell\">Richard Bell<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dogwonder\">Rich Holman<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I started to think: &#8220;Hang on a minute. This is a basic function of PHP isn&#8217;t it? This is just <code>&lt;?php include('some_partial.php') ?&gt;<\/code>. Can&#8217;t I just run PHP on the command line to transform files? I&#8217;ll probably have PHP installed forever anyway, and it&#8217;s very unlikely to break. Is PHP not the magic I need?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/edwario\/status\/1393275855829274625\">Scott Edward Carver<\/a> backed me up: &#8220;I sometimes use a build process which runs php files in the root directory, outputs to an .html of the same name&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>YES SCOTT!!!! THANK YOU!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ryangjchandler\">Ryan Chandler<\/a> (who is literally one of the most helpful and prolific people on the PHP internet) then chipped in with: <code>extract($data); include __DIR__.'\/path\/to\/view.php; \/\/ ;)<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out Ryan has built a quick-and-dirty vanilla-PHP-based static site generator script in the past. He called his <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ryangjchandler\/mink\">Mink<\/a>, and describes it as: &#8220;It&#8217;s disgusting really. Using globals, you can only call <code>extend()<\/code> at the very end of a template file. You have to define the name of a slot in the <code>stop<\/code> function.&#8221; And he says it&#8217;s &#8220;for educational purposes (obvs)&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it turns out that while Ryan was trying to find where he had a lefotver copy of this script so I could see it, I was already building something VERY similar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, yeah, I guess it is &#8220;disgusting&#8221;. But it works a charm and totally fulfills my criteria:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Super-simple<\/li><li>Constraints that I&#8217;m 100% happy with<\/li><li>Ability to extend a layout template of your choosing, and pass data to it<\/li><li>Ability to include partials and pass data to them<\/li><li>Ability to have &#8220;environment variables&#8221;<\/li><li>Simple build process<\/li><li>Minimal dependencies<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I COULD wrap this up in a fancy command line with <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel-zero.com\/\">Laravel Zero<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/erikaheidi\">Erika Heidi<\/a>&#8216;s <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/minicli\/minicli\">Mini CLI<\/a>. But I don&#8217;t need to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I COULD make this a PHP composer-installable package. But why should I?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m probably not going to update it. It&#8217;s a &#8220;finished&#8221; piece of software as far as I&#8217;m concerned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s unlikely to stop working in the near future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s keep it REALLY simple. Like I did with <a href=\"https:\/\/peekobot.github.io\/peekobot\/\">Peekobot<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just 160-odd lines of PHP in a Gist:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d\">https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take it. Download it. Use it. Modify it. Make it do what YOU need it to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined with the new <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/installation#using-tailwind-cli\">TailwindCSS CLI<\/a> tool, I can now have simple, static sites, with almost-zero-dependency build processes! Amazing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, I guess I built a static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now&#8230;what&#8217;s next. Todo app?<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Things all developers need to make in their career #17: A static site generator",
        "content": "\n<p>There&#8217;s a sort-of-joke that there&#8217;s a bunch of things that all developers are supposed to code from scratch at some point in their career. A blog. A to-do list app. The &#8220;canonical&#8221; applications. And one of these is a static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve actually never built any of these things from scratch. But while making <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a> I wanted to make a really simple landing page. I wanted to use TailwindCSS, because I can work quickly with that and use <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\">TailwindUI<\/a>. And to use Tailwind properly you kinda need to have &#8220;components&#8221;, or at least &#8220;template partials&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I kinda needed a way to do &#8220;HTML includes&#8221;. Which is a thing that doesn&#8217;t exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I put the feelers out for a SUPER simple solution for doing this. Ideally I wanted to avoid a huge <code>node_modules<\/code> folder, and a tool that would at some point require me to downgrade node by three versions just to update a CSS class or change a hyperlink.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Responses to this were:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>FlightPHP &#8211; Micro-framework. Does routing, but not static output. via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BinaryMoon\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a>.<\/li><li>The <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/objects-in-space\/considering-a-static-site-tool-learn-gulp-2fd5f9821fc4\">Gulp-only approach<\/a> &#8211; Needs Gulp. Will probably break at some point. Also via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BinaryMoon\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a>.<\/li><li>Jekyll &#8211; Tried it before. Didn&#8217;t like it. Got confused by all the Ruby stuff. Also via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BinaryMoon\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a>.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/codekitapp.com\/help\/kit\/\">CodeKit<\/a> &#8211; Looks good, but needs CodeKit. ALSO via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BinaryMoon\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a>.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.11ty.dev\/\">11ty<\/a> &#8211; Which looks awesome but starts with <code>npm install<\/code>, and then I looked at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.11ty.dev\/docs\/resources\/\">the docs<\/a> and was overwhelmed. So big nope. via Pretty Much Everyone Else.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/mozilla.github.io\/nunjucks\/\">Nunjucks<\/a> &#8211; Which is a &#8220;a more sophisticated templating engine for JavaScript&#8221;, which meets neither my requirement for something super-simple, nor my desire to avoid JavaScript in the build. It probably needs something like Gulp as well. via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/richard_bell\">Richard Bell<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dogwonder\">Rich Holman<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I started to think: &#8220;Hang on a minute. This is a basic function of PHP isn&#8217;t it? This is just <code>&lt;?php include('some_partial.php') ?&gt;<\/code>. Can&#8217;t I just run PHP on the command line to transform files? I&#8217;ll probably have PHP installed forever anyway, and it&#8217;s very unlikely to break. Is PHP not the magic I need?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/edwario\/status\/1393275855829274625\">Scott Edward Carver<\/a> backed me up: &#8220;I sometimes use a build process which runs php files in the root directory, outputs to an .html of the same name&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>YES SCOTT!!!! THANK YOU!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ryangjchandler\">Ryan Chandler<\/a> (who is literally one of the most helpful and prolific people on the PHP internet) then chipped in with: <code>extract($data); include __DIR__.'\/path\/to\/view.php; \/\/ ;)<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out Ryan has built a quick-and-dirty vanilla-PHP-based static site generator script in the past. He called his <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ryangjchandler\/mink\">Mink<\/a>, and describes it as: &#8220;It&#8217;s disgusting really. Using globals, you can only call <code>extend()<\/code> at the very end of a template file. You have to define the name of a slot in the <code>stop<\/code> function.&#8221; And he says it&#8217;s &#8220;for educational purposes (obvs)&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it turns out that while Ryan was trying to find where he had a lefotver copy of this script so I could see it, I was already building something VERY similar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, yeah, I guess it is &#8220;disgusting&#8221;. But it works a charm and totally fulfills my criteria:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Super-simple<\/li><li>Constraints that I&#8217;m 100% happy with<\/li><li>Ability to extend a layout template of your choosing, and pass data to it<\/li><li>Ability to include partials and pass data to them<\/li><li>Ability to have &#8220;environment variables&#8221;<\/li><li>Simple build process<\/li><li>Minimal dependencies<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I COULD wrap this up in a fancy command line with <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel-zero.com\/\">Laravel Zero<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/erikaheidi\">Erika Heidi<\/a>&#8216;s <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/minicli\/minicli\">Mini CLI<\/a>. But I don&#8217;t need to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I COULD make this a PHP composer-installable package. But why should I?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m probably not going to update it. It&#8217;s a &#8220;finished&#8221; piece of software as far as I&#8217;m concerned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s unlikely to stop working in the near future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s keep it REALLY simple. Like I did with <a href=\"https:\/\/peekobot.github.io\/peekobot\/\">Peekobot<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just 160-odd lines of PHP in a Gist:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d\">https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take it. Download it. Use it. Modify it. Make it do what YOU need it to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined with the new <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/installation#using-tailwind-cli\">TailwindCSS CLI<\/a> tool, I can now have simple, static sites, with almost-zero-dependency build processes! Amazing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, I guess I built a static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now&#8230;what&#8217;s next. Todo app?<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>It took much longer than I thought, but finally, the <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin browser extension<\/a> is here!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives you fast, keyboard-activated access to your WordPress dashboard&#8217;s menu items without needing to install a plugin. If you use a tool like Spotlight or Alfred on the Mac, or the command palette in your code editor to get stuff done, then you&#8217;ll appreciate the speed and convenience of navigating WordPress with the keyboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/565100424?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can try it out for free on WordPress sites with <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/turbo-admin\/\">the plugin version<\/a> available in the WordPress.org repository.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The browser extension works on most modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge (and other Chromium-based browsers). But, importantly, NOT on Safari (yet).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why might you want the browser extension version? Simply, it works on (almost) all WordPress sites without needing to install the plugin! It&#8217;s like magic and is always there when you need it. On your own sites, on your client sites, on sites you&#8217;re auditing or supporting. It even supports multisite!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s probably a tool that you don&#8217;t know that you need. But for some people, once you&#8217;ve tried it, there&#8217;s no going back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The extension is $35 (plus local taxes) and that&#8217;s a simple, one-off purchase. You can use the extension in up to 6 different browsers (for example, 2 computers with Firefox, Chrome and Edge on both of them). You can use it for as long as it works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll try to keep it updated &#8211; I use it myself, so that&#8217;s a strong incentive! &#8211; but I&#8217;m not making any guarantees on updates or support. I&#8217;m kinda selling it as-is and keeping things simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to give it some broad permissions in your browser to make it work, but other than collecting the sales information and the license activation, I do not track your usage of it at all. There may be an occasional ping to a server to check your license is still valid but that is it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m anticipating some questions or raised eyebrows about this so here&#8217;s some additional info about how it works and why I&#8217;m using this business model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why a single purchase?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my first software product. I am viewing it as an &#8220;asset&#8221;. Something I&#8217;ve made that I believe has value for other power users like myself. I figured I&#8217;d try selling it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don&#8217;t see it as SO useful that people will want to pay a subscription. Plus, subscriptions come with a much higher expectation of support and ongoing development, which, as a busy solo developer I simply can&#8217;t guarantee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I may, at some point, release a new version of it that is a paid upgrade, or uses a subscription. But let&#8217;s see what people think of v1 and how successful it is. Some ideas for the future roadmap are below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is Cmd\/Ctrl-Alt-Shift-P the default shortcut?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, to avoid clashing with other pre-defined browser shortcuts. I really wanted Cmd-Shift-P, like some text editors use, but this opens a Private Browsing window in Firefox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can set your own keyboard shortcut in the settings for the extension. Just try not to pick something that the browser already uses or it won&#8217;t work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why does the extension need such broad permissions?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I promise this extension does nothing naughty or bad. It needs to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Inspect the page and HTTP request headers to see if this is a site it should add the command palette to.<\/li><li>Add the JavaScript onto the page to make the palette work. (This is done at page-load time in the browser, nothing is saved to your database! I&#8217;m not adding JS to your content!)<\/li><li>Save settings in local storage (local to the extension).<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The extension doesn&#8217;t need keyboard permissions, but the JavaScript that gets injected onto the page does intercept keystrokes, by it&#8217;s very nature, to see when you&#8217;ve pressed the shortcut to activate the palette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How secure is it though?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, all it&#8217;s doing is simulating clicks on menu items. And it&#8217;s only doing that when you ask it to. It&#8217;s just another way of doing things that you are already able to do with the mouse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could another script take control of Turbo Admin and hijack it? Well, yeah. But that same script could just scrape the DOM for links and simulate clicks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future it may simulate other &#8220;events&#8221; on the page, but this will always be doing things that you already have permissions do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s no less safe than what you already have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the &#8220;(almost)&#8221; in &#8220;(almost) all your WordPress sites&#8221; for?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Turbo Admin uses a variety of techniques to detect a WordPress site. But some installs may have removed some of the bits of information that it uses, and so it may not work on all WordPress sites. But it should work on most of them!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does the browser extension do anything that the plugin doesn&#8217;t?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s funny that you ask. Because it does one neat trick that the plugin can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a neat little convenience, and sometimes it doesn&#8217;t quite work properly. But&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the extension can inspect headers, it can sometimes detect a WordPress site when you are not logged in. And it will try to guess the login URL and give you a pop-up login link when you activate the command palette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-1024x538.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of WordPress website with the Turbo Admin overlay showing the Log in link.\" class=\"wp-image-10292\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-1024x538.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-300x158.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-768x403.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-1536x806.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-2048x1075.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It has to guess because, for good security reasons, WordPress sites don&#8217;t generally advertise their login URL&#8217;s. And the code doesn&#8217;t always guess right. So, try it, but it might not work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s on the future roadmap?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are, broadly, two big directions this extension could head off in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. More WordPress admin improvements!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first interesting possibility that Turbo Admin gives us is the ability to enhance ALL your WordPress sites in different ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main thing I want to do is make use of the WordPress REST API so that you can search and access posts, pages and so on, and get directly to editing content from the command palette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I could inject other JavaScript modules to improve the WordPress Dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thought I had was that, rather than using the command palette, you could create keyboard shortcuts for common actions in WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The demo below uses Cmd-Alt-P followed by another key to get to various places. So Cmd-Alt-P then P takes you to the posts list. Cmd-Alt-P then U takes you to users. Cmd-Alt-P then D takes you to the Dashboard. The screen recorder only recorded the Cmd-Alt-P bits, not the secondary key-press.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/565100710?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"342\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption>Keyboard Shortcuts with Turbo Admin<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another feature idea was inspired by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.binarymoon.co.uk\/2021\/06\/take-control-of-wordpress-plugin-and-theme-notifications\/\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a> adding a notifications-tidying system to his excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-toolbelt\/\">Toolbelt plugin<\/a>. I thought &#8220;I can do that with Turbo Admin&#8221;. And promptly put together a little prototype of that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/565103088?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"392\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption>Notification tidying with Turbo Admin<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thought I&#8217;ve had is that you could permanently disable the block editor&#8217;s full-screen mode. Basically, if you can make an admin tweak with just JS and\/or CSS, then there&#8217;s a possibility I can build it into Turbo Admin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember: I can build these into the plugin, but with the browser extension you&#8217;ll get this on ANY WordPress site that you log into!! It really does feel like magic to me, and I made the darned thing!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Turbo Admin for All The Things<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second idea is that this could be a single browser extension that can:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>detect what sort of site you are on using HTTP headers, URLs or some custom function;<\/li><li>inject a command palette script on page load;<\/li><li>include pre-set commands or;<\/li><li>detect available commands by scraping the DOM or by loading a config from a file or API.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is pretty powerful. I&#8217;ve built in the ability to extend it with simple configurations that can work on other applications or sites. It&#8217;s not perfect, but I&#8217;ve had prototypes of this working on cPanel, Laravel Forge, and even for selecting folders in GMail!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Turbo Admin on Laravel Forge\" class=\"wp-image-10293\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-1536x807.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-2048x1076.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Trying out Turbo Admin on Laravel Forge<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"390\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-1024x390.jpg\" alt=\"Turbo Admin prototype working on GMail\" class=\"wp-image-10294\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-1024x390.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-300x114.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-768x292.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-1536x584.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-2048x779.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Trying out Turbo Admin on GMail<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a single extension that speeds up work across a variety of sites seems like a cool thing. Sites\/applications could even serve up their own config files letting Turbo Admin know what actions were available!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I&#8217;m sold &#8211; how do I buy it?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hooray! I hoped you would be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head to the <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin website<\/a>. You can purchase with a card or PayPal. Once you purchase you will be sent full instructions, the Chrome\/Chromium install link, and the Firefox download.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really hope you enjoy it, get hooked on using it, and tell all your WordPress friends!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>It took much longer than I thought, but finally, the <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin browser extension<\/a> is here!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives you fast, keyboard-activated access to your WordPress dashboard&#8217;s menu items without needing to install a plugin. If you use a tool like Spotlight or Alfred on the Mac, or the command palette in your code editor to get stuff done, then you&#8217;ll appreciate the speed and convenience of navigating WordPress with the keyboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/565100424?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can try it out for free on WordPress sites with <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/turbo-admin\/\">the plugin version<\/a> available in the WordPress.org repository.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The browser extension works on most modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge (and other Chromium-based browsers). But, importantly, NOT on Safari (yet).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why might you want the browser extension version? Simply, it works on (almost) all WordPress sites without needing to install the plugin! It&#8217;s like magic and is always there when you need it. On your own sites, on your client sites, on sites you&#8217;re auditing or supporting. It even supports multisite!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s probably a tool that you don&#8217;t know that you need. But for some people, once you&#8217;ve tried it, there&#8217;s no going back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The extension is $35 (plus local taxes) and that&#8217;s a simple, one-off purchase. You can use the extension in up to 6 different browsers (for example, 2 computers with Firefox, Chrome and Edge on both of them). You can use it for as long as it works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll try to keep it updated &#8211; I use it myself, so that&#8217;s a strong incentive! &#8211; but I&#8217;m not making any guarantees on updates or support. I&#8217;m kinda selling it as-is and keeping things simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to give it some broad permissions in your browser to make it work, but other than collecting the sales information and the license activation, I do not track your usage of it at all. There may be an occasional ping to a server to check your license is still valid but that is it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m anticipating some questions or raised eyebrows about this so here&#8217;s some additional info about how it works and why I&#8217;m using this business model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why a single purchase?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my first software product. I am viewing it as an &#8220;asset&#8221;. Something I&#8217;ve made that I believe has value for other power users like myself. I figured I&#8217;d try selling it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don&#8217;t see it as SO useful that people will want to pay a subscription. Plus, subscriptions come with a much higher expectation of support and ongoing development, which, as a busy solo developer I simply can&#8217;t guarantee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I may, at some point, release a new version of it that is a paid upgrade, or uses a subscription. But let&#8217;s see what people think of v1 and how successful it is. Some ideas for the future roadmap are below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is Cmd\/Ctrl-Alt-Shift-P the default shortcut?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, to avoid clashing with other pre-defined browser shortcuts. I really wanted Cmd-Shift-P, like some text editors use, but this opens a Private Browsing window in Firefox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can set your own keyboard shortcut in the settings for the extension. Just try not to pick something that the browser already uses or it won&#8217;t work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why does the extension need such broad permissions?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I promise this extension does nothing naughty or bad. It needs to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Inspect the page and HTTP request headers to see if this is a site it should add the command palette to.<\/li><li>Add the JavaScript onto the page to make the palette work. (This is done at page-load time in the browser, nothing is saved to your database! I&#8217;m not adding JS to your content!)<\/li><li>Save settings in local storage (local to the extension).<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The extension doesn&#8217;t need keyboard permissions, but the JavaScript that gets injected onto the page does intercept keystrokes, by it&#8217;s very nature, to see when you&#8217;ve pressed the shortcut to activate the palette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How secure is it though?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, all it&#8217;s doing is simulating clicks on menu items. And it&#8217;s only doing that when you ask it to. It&#8217;s just another way of doing things that you are already able to do with the mouse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could another script take control of Turbo Admin and hijack it? Well, yeah. But that same script could just scrape the DOM for links and simulate clicks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future it may simulate other &#8220;events&#8221; on the page, but this will always be doing things that you already have permissions do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s no less safe than what you already have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the &#8220;(almost)&#8221; in &#8220;(almost) all your WordPress sites&#8221; for?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Turbo Admin uses a variety of techniques to detect a WordPress site. But some installs may have removed some of the bits of information that it uses, and so it may not work on all WordPress sites. But it should work on most of them!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does the browser extension do anything that the plugin doesn&#8217;t?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s funny that you ask. Because it does one neat trick that the plugin can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a neat little convenience, and sometimes it doesn&#8217;t quite work properly. But&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the extension can inspect headers, it can sometimes detect a WordPress site when you are not logged in. And it will try to guess the login URL and give you a pop-up login link when you activate the command palette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-1024x538.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of WordPress website with the Turbo Admin overlay showing the Log in link.\" class=\"wp-image-10292\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-1024x538.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-300x158.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-768x403.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-1536x806.png 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/CleanShot-2021-06-19-at-22.12.32@2x-2048x1075.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It has to guess because, for good security reasons, WordPress sites don&#8217;t generally advertise their login URL&#8217;s. And the code doesn&#8217;t always guess right. So, try it, but it might not work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s on the future roadmap?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are, broadly, two big directions this extension could head off in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. More WordPress admin improvements!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first interesting possibility that Turbo Admin gives us is the ability to enhance ALL your WordPress sites in different ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main thing I want to do is make use of the WordPress REST API so that you can search and access posts, pages and so on, and get directly to editing content from the command palette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I could inject other JavaScript modules to improve the WordPress Dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thought I had was that, rather than using the command palette, you could create keyboard shortcuts for common actions in WordPress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The demo below uses Cmd-Alt-P followed by another key to get to various places. So Cmd-Alt-P then P takes you to the posts list. Cmd-Alt-P then U takes you to users. Cmd-Alt-P then D takes you to the Dashboard. The screen recorder only recorded the Cmd-Alt-P bits, not the secondary key-press.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/565100710?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"342\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption>Keyboard Shortcuts with Turbo Admin<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another feature idea was inspired by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.binarymoon.co.uk\/2021\/06\/take-control-of-wordpress-plugin-and-theme-notifications\/\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a> adding a notifications-tidying system to his excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-toolbelt\/\">Toolbelt plugin<\/a>. I thought &#8220;I can do that with Turbo Admin&#8221;. And promptly put together a little prototype of that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/565103088?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"392\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption>Notification tidying with Turbo Admin<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thought I&#8217;ve had is that you could permanently disable the block editor&#8217;s full-screen mode. Basically, if you can make an admin tweak with just JS and\/or CSS, then there&#8217;s a possibility I can build it into Turbo Admin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember: I can build these into the plugin, but with the browser extension you&#8217;ll get this on ANY WordPress site that you log into!! It really does feel like magic to me, and I made the darned thing!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Turbo Admin for All The Things<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second idea is that this could be a single browser extension that can:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>detect what sort of site you are on using HTTP headers, URLs or some custom function;<\/li><li>inject a command palette script on page load;<\/li><li>include pre-set commands or;<\/li><li>detect available commands by scraping the DOM or by loading a config from a file or API.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is pretty powerful. I&#8217;ve built in the ability to extend it with simple configurations that can work on other applications or sites. It&#8217;s not perfect, but I&#8217;ve had prototypes of this working on cPanel, Laravel Forge, and even for selecting folders in GMail!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Turbo Admin on Laravel Forge\" class=\"wp-image-10293\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-1536x807.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-forge-2048x1076.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Trying out Turbo Admin on Laravel Forge<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"390\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-1024x390.jpg\" alt=\"Turbo Admin prototype working on GMail\" class=\"wp-image-10294\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-1024x390.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-300x114.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-768x292.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-1536x584.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/turbo-admin-gmail-2048x779.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Trying out Turbo Admin on GMail<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a single extension that speeds up work across a variety of sites seems like a cool thing.

But enjoy these learnings&#8230;<\/em> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-2\/\">part 2<\/a> and a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/10\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-part-3\/\">part 3<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a Saturday (when I\u2019m writing &#8211; it will probably take a few days to write and publish this) and I realised yesterday that I have ten working days left of freelancing after more than ten years of working for myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps I should share some &#8220;wisdom&#8221; I&#8217;ve gained in doing this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few caveats\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I\u2019ve occupied a particular space in freelancing where people are really nice to each other and help each other out; where clients pay invoices quickly and people are forgiving of your work situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not sure if this is the ONLY freelancing space out there. Perhaps there is a darker side of it with highly-competitive people who are cut-throat in their approach, stingy with both money and time, and rude and unpleasant? But I\u2019ve not come across it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, if there is more than one freelancing culture, I\u2019m not sure if I landed in this particular freelancing space by chance, or because I subconsciously am drawn to people who operate in the same ways that I try to. Did I engineer where I landed somehow?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of how I got here, here\u2019s some things I learned along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-never-say-never\">1. Never say never<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I always said there are two things I would never do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is move back to home town of Swindon after leaving it aged 18.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the second was work for myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My parents (who still live in Swindon and are the most wonderfully supportive, generous and lovely people) ran a successful business that they loved and put so much into, but I saw how stressful it could be at times. And I didn\u2019t want that stress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT\u2026 it turns out employment can be stressful too. And I ended up leaving it to do my own thing\u2026 shortly after moving back to my home town!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ran my business my own way, I learned lots from my folks, both what works and what doesn\u2019t &#8211; for me at least!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did freelancing and self-employment my own way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at someone else and saying \u201cI don\u2019t want that\u201d is one thing, but ruling out a whole class of things based on a single experience is not really helpful. You can put your own twist on a thing that someone else has done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t say \u201cnever\u201d based on what you see someone else doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(But also, ALWAYS be as kind and generous and supportive as my parents!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-it-doesn-t-have-to-be-forever\">2. It doesn\u2019t have to be forever<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some have asked why I\u2019m stopping freelancing. But to understand that it\u2019s helpful to understand why I started and continued for so long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The world I left was corporate IT world. Corporate IT world was really not for me. I had an amazing boss and immediate team, and it paid well, but leadership higher up seemed very questionable, or, at least, incompatible with my own sensibilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after I left employment we found out we were having our first kid. And a big reason I kept at freelancing was that I wanted the flexibility to spend time with my kids when they were young. And I wanted my wife to continue her career too, as well as being an awesome mum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve taken full advantage of the flexibility of freelance life. I\u2019ve worked part-time-ish. I\u2019ve done the school and nursery run. I\u2019ve been dad a lot!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So two things that have nudged me back into employment:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Now that both kids are at school (pandemic depending! ?) I don\u2019t need the flexibility as much. In fact, it\u2019s arguable that being freelance means I actually get LESS quality time with them now, because I\u2019m often still in work mode once school is finished.<\/li><li>The realisation that not all suitable employment is in corporate IT. There are companies out there that are small, friendly, somewhat flexible, doing great work, successful and that pay well.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve had in my head a (very!) short list of companies that I\u2019d love to work for for a while, and I\u2019ve kinda been winding down the freelancing to a point where I could more easily take a job should the right one come up (take note &#8211; freelancing has lock in!).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when the perfect job description came up at one of these companies, I HAD to give it a punt. And here I am! Contract signed and ready to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s the right job, for the right company, and at the right time for me. All the stars aligned. Hooray!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So freelancing doesn&#8217;t have to be your long term plan. There is probably a ramping-up period, and maybe a ramping-down one too. But you can go back to employment without shame or feeling like a failure. There can be really positive reasons to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-i-don-t-know-what-burnout-is-but-it-s-probably-real\">3. I don\u2019t know what \u201cburnout\u201d is but it\u2019s probably real<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I hear lots of people talking about burnout, but I\u2019ve never heard a succinct definition of it that made sense to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, when I started applying for this dream job, I started thinking about what it would be like to have one client. One person I was ultimately accountable to. One set of communication and project management tools and processes. No leads to find and follow. No proposals to write. No sub-contractors to find and manage. No self-marketing to do. Way less \u201cadmin\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I had this kind of anticipatory relief in my heart. A peace in my soul. An almost physical relaxation in my body at the thought of what it would be like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the feeling made me ask: Am I burned out on freelancing?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is burnout one of those things that you know when you see it. If it looks like burnout and it quacks like burnout, it\u2019s probably burnout?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Note to future boss: I\u2019m under no illusion that \u201cemployment\u201d won\u2019t have its own unique set of challenges, and I\u2019ll still have to do some of the things listed above. It will just be very different! I\u2019m totally ready for it!!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-you-define-success\">4. YOU define success<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is huge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Success doesn\u2019t have to be all about money. Or fame. Or growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think it does then you\u2019re reading the wrong article. You\u2019re not my tribe. Stop wasting your time now. Go read something else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Success can be flexibility. It can be having fun and enjoying your work. It can be choosing who you work for. It can be continuously learning and defining your own career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>I\u2019ve not made a ton of money. I\u2019m hardly <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tom_hirst\">Tom Hirst<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jonathanstark\">Jonathan Stark<\/a>. But I kept paying the bills and feeding the family while doing something I enjoy.<\/li><li>I could have worked more paid hours. But I took advantage of the flexibility to spend time with family.<\/li><li>I spent time learning new things and honing my craft as well as working on paid projects. Unpaid side projects have been huge for me to keep me interested and to define the way forward.<\/li><li>I did good work for good clients who respected me and paid me well. I could probably have taken bigger gigs with bigger clients in different sectors, but I liked who I was working with.<\/li><li>I made friends and was able to make a mark on my little online world in my own unique little ways.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Bootstrapping a small, sustainable business that keeps you going, with no debt or investment, with zero employees, with no plans to grow, with revenue that changes according to your circumstances, is fine. Hourly billing is fine. Not building a SaaS or product is fine. Dips in annual revenue are fine (as long as it\u2019s expected and not a trend!). Doing work for free is fine (in some carefully thought through cases).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look at what others are doing and be inspired. Look at what others say to do, and not to do, but don\u2019t blindly follow. Consider advice (even this advice!) and weigh it against your own circumstances and goals. But remember that you are not them. This is your journey. You are unique and your business is unique. (See also <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2012\/05\/parenthood-the-sum-of-my-knowledge\/\">parenting<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-trust-your-instincts-but-also-understand-business\">5. Trust your instincts &#8211; but also: understand business<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Early on I had an enquiry from a person who wanted to make \u201cFacebook for &lt;thing&gt;\u201d. His business model involved selling effectively, stickers, that had links to profiles on Facebook-for-thing. He had no money, and was offering me a share of profits of a non-existent business with what looked like a very iffy business plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years later in I had a conversation with someone that wanted help with a platform that put ads around videos because he thought that he was better at putting ads around videos than YouTube were.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One time I was pitching to a medium-sized-charity client who were getting \u201chelp\u201d from a financial services firm. This firm had put some security requirements in place that were more suited to financial services than to a medium sized charity. We pushed back and pretty much all the requirements were dropped.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, these projects were full of huge red flags. We actually won and delivered the third example, and it was one of my best pieces of work. The point is: I learned to trust my instincts when talking to potential clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think I also learned that I had developed good instincts by having a very basic understanding of business. Perhaps from sitting on my mums lap while she filled in paper-based ledger sheets (think paper-based spreadsheets) all those years ago. Perhaps from being overly obsessed with watching Dragon\u2019s Den on telly. Who knows?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Briefs that are too short. Briefs that are too long. Questions answered with \u201cthat\u2019s just what we\u2019ve decided to do\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s what the boss wants\u201d. Arbitrary hard deadlines (launching an advent calendar on Dec 1st is one thing, launching a new website on January 17th is another). &#8220;We\u2019ll pay you with the profits.&#8221;, &#8220;Our previous developer has stopped working on it.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all red flags.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to ask:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Will there be money to pay me?<\/li><li>Is this idea REALLY viable? Have you REALLY thought it through?<\/li><li>Why is the deadline fixed? And what happens if we&#8217;re heading towards it and aren&#8217;t finished?<\/li><li>Are the requirements really appropriate for the project?<\/li><li>Why did the previous developer stop working on the project?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You learn what to look for. And yes, it\u2019s not only acceptable to say \u201cNo\u201d, you really SHOULD say \u201cNo\u201d if you feel the project isn\u2019t for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"more-to-come\">More to come&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, that&#8217;s part 1 done. You can now <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-2\/\">read part 2<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have some titles for part 2 to tease. And if you&#8217;re mathsy\/computery you may note that I didn&#8217;t state what number base &#8220;10&#8221; is &#8211; there may not be ten learnings here. So hopefully I&#8217;ll soon write about some or all of the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Invest in tools (but only those you actually need)<\/li><li>Freelancers help each other<\/li><li>People are EVERYTHING<\/li><li>Business vs personal branding<\/li><li>You get freedom &#8211; you lose freedom<\/li><li>It\u2019s not for everyone<\/li><li>Curiosity is the superpower<\/li><li>Be a jack of all trades, but a master of one<\/li><\/ul>\n",

But enjoy these learnings&#8230;<\/em> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-2\/\">part 2<\/a> and a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/10\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-part-3\/\">part 3<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a Saturday (when I\u2019m writing &#8211; it will probably take a few days to write and publish this) and I realised yesterday that I have ten working days left of freelancing after more than ten years of working for myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps I should share some &#8220;wisdom&#8221; I&#8217;ve gained in doing this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few caveats\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I\u2019ve occupied a particular space in freelancing where people are really nice to each other and help each other out; where clients pay invoices quickly and people are forgiving of your work situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not sure if this is the ONLY freelancing space out there. Perhaps there is a darker side of it with highly-competitive people who are cut-throat in their approach, stingy with both money and time, and rude and unpleasant? But I\u2019ve not come across it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, if there is more than one freelancing culture, I\u2019m not sure if I landed in this particular freelancing space by chance, or because I subconsciously am drawn to people who operate in the same ways that I try to. Did I engineer where I landed somehow?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of how I got here, here\u2019s some things I learned along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-never-say-never\">1. Never say never<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I always said there are two things I would never do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is move back to home town of Swindon after leaving it aged 18.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the second was work for myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My parents (who still live in Swindon and are the most wonderfully supportive, generous and lovely people) ran a successful business that they loved and put so much into, but I saw how stressful it could be at times. And I didn\u2019t want that stress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT\u2026 it turns out employment can be stressful too. And I ended up leaving it to do my own thing\u2026 shortly after moving back to my home town!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ran my business my own way, I learned lots from my folks, both what works and what doesn\u2019t &#8211; for me at least!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did freelancing and self-employment my own way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at someone else and saying \u201cI don\u2019t want that\u201d is one thing, but ruling out a whole class of things based on a single experience is not really helpful. You can put your own twist on a thing that someone else has done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t say \u201cnever\u201d based on what you see someone else doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(But also, ALWAYS be as kind and generous and supportive as my parents!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-it-doesn-t-have-to-be-forever\">2. It doesn\u2019t have to be forever<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some have asked why I\u2019m stopping freelancing. But to understand that it\u2019s helpful to understand why I started and continued for so long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The world I left was corporate IT world. Corporate IT world was really not for me. I had an amazing boss and immediate team, and it paid well, but leadership higher up seemed very questionable, or, at least, incompatible with my own sensibilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after I left employment we found out we were having our first kid. And a big reason I kept at freelancing was that I wanted the flexibility to spend time with my kids when they were young. And I wanted my wife to continue her career too, as well as being an awesome mum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve taken full advantage of the flexibility of freelance life. I\u2019ve worked part-time-ish. I\u2019ve done the school and nursery run. I\u2019ve been dad a lot!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So two things that have nudged me back into employment:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Now that both kids are at school (pandemic depending! ?) I don\u2019t need the flexibility as much. In fact, it\u2019s arguable that being freelance means I actually get LESS quality time with them now, because I\u2019m often still in work mode once school is finished.<\/li><li>The realisation that not all suitable employment is in corporate IT. There are companies out there that are small, friendly, somewhat flexible, doing great work, successful and that pay well.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve had in my head a (very!) short list of companies that I\u2019d love to work for for a while, and I\u2019ve kinda been winding down the freelancing to a point where I could more easily take a job should the right one come up (take note &#8211; freelancing has lock in!).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when the perfect job description came up at one of these companies, I HAD to give it a punt. And here I am! Contract signed and ready to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s the right job, for the right company, and at the right time for me. All the stars aligned. Hooray!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So freelancing doesn&#8217;t have to be your long term plan. There is probably a ramping-up period, and maybe a ramping-down one too. But you can go back to employment without shame or feeling like a failure. There can be really positive reasons to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-i-don-t-know-what-burnout-is-but-it-s-probably-real\">3. I don\u2019t know what \u201cburnout\u201d is but it\u2019s probably real<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I hear lots of people talking about burnout, but I\u2019ve never heard a succinct definition of it that made sense to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, when I started applying for this dream job, I started thinking about what it would be like to have one client. One person I was ultimately accountable to. One set of communication and project management tools and processes. No leads to find and follow. No proposals to write. No sub-contractors to find and manage. No self-marketing to do. Way less \u201cadmin\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I had this kind of anticipatory relief in my heart. A peace in my soul. An almost physical relaxation in my body at the thought of what it would be like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the feeling made me ask: Am I burned out on freelancing?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is burnout one of those things that you know when you see it. If it looks like burnout and it quacks like burnout, it\u2019s probably burnout?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Note to future boss: I\u2019m under no illusion that \u201cemployment\u201d won\u2019t have its own unique set of challenges, and I\u2019ll still have to do some of the things listed above. It will just be very different! I\u2019m totally ready for it!!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-you-define-success\">4. YOU define success<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is huge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Success doesn\u2019t have to be all about money. Or fame. Or growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think it does then you\u2019re reading the wrong article. You\u2019re not my tribe. Stop wasting your time now. Go read something else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Success can be flexibility. It can be having fun and enjoying your work. It can be choosing who you work for. It can be continuously learning and defining your own career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>I\u2019ve not made a ton of money. I\u2019m hardly <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tom_hirst\">Tom Hirst<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jonathanstark\">Jonathan Stark<\/a>. But I kept paying the bills and feeding the family while doing something I enjoy.<\/li><li>I could have worked more paid hours. But I took advantage of the flexibility to spend time with family.<\/li><li>I spent time learning new things and honing my craft as well as working on paid projects. Unpaid side projects have been huge for me to keep me interested and to define the way forward.<\/li><li>I did good work for good clients who respected me and paid me well. I could probably have taken bigger gigs with bigger clients in different sectors, but I liked who I was working with.<\/li><li>I made friends and was able to make a mark on my little online world in my own unique little ways.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Bootstrapping a small, sustainable business that keeps you going, with no debt or investment, with zero employees, with no plans to grow, with revenue that changes according to your circumstances, is fine. Hourly billing is fine. Not building a SaaS or product is fine. Dips in annual revenue are fine (as long as it\u2019s expected and not a trend!). Doing work for free is fine (in some carefully thought through cases).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look at what others are doing and be inspired. Look at what others say to do, and not to do, but don\u2019t blindly follow. Consider advice (even this advice!) and weigh it against your own circumstances and goals. But remember that you are not them. This is your journey. You are unique and your business is unique.

Trust your instincts &#8211; but also: understand business<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Early on I had an enquiry from a person who wanted to make \u201cFacebook for &lt;thing&gt;\u201d. His business model involved selling effectively, stickers, that had links to profiles on Facebook-for-thing. He had no money, and was offering me a share of profits of a non-existent business with what looked like a very iffy business plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years later in I had a conversation with someone that wanted help with a platform that put ads around videos because he thought that he was better at putting ads around videos than YouTube were.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One time I was pitching to a medium-sized-charity client who were getting \u201chelp\u201d from a financial services firm. This firm had put some security requirements in place that were more suited to financial services than to a medium sized charity. We pushed back and pretty much all the requirements were dropped.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, these projects were full of huge red flags. We actually won and delivered the third example, and it was one of my best pieces of work. The point is: I learned to trust my instincts when talking to potential clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think I also learned that I had developed good instincts by having a very basic understanding of business. Perhaps from sitting on my mums lap while she filled in paper-based ledger sheets (think paper-based spreadsheets) all those years ago. Perhaps from being overly obsessed with watching Dragon\u2019s Den on telly. Who knows?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Briefs that are too short. Briefs that are too long. Questions answered with \u201cthat\u2019s just what we\u2019ve decided to do\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s what the boss wants\u201d. Arbitrary hard deadlines (launching an advent calendar on Dec 1st is one thing, launching a new website on January 17th is another). &#8220;We\u2019ll pay you with the profits.&#8221;, &#8220;Our previous developer has stopped working on it.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all red flags.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to ask:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Will there be money to pay me?<\/li><li>Is this idea REALLY viable? Have you REALLY thought it through?<\/li><li>Why is the deadline fixed? And what happens if we&#8217;re heading towards it and aren&#8217;t finished?<\/li><li>Are the requirements really appropriate for the project?<\/li><li>Why did the previous developer stop working on the project?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You learn what to look for. And yes, it\u2019s not only acceptable to say \u201cNo\u201d, you really SHOULD say \u201cNo\u201d if you feel the project isn\u2019t for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"more-to-come\">More to come&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, that&#8217;s part 1 done. You can now <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-2\/\">read part 2<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have some titles for part 2 to tease. And if you&#8217;re mathsy\/computery you may note that I didn&#8217;t state what number base &#8220;10&#8221; is &#8211; there may not be ten learnings here. So hopefully I&#8217;ll soon write about some or all of the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Invest in tools (but only those you actually need)<\/li><li>Freelancers help each other<\/li><li>People are EVERYTHING<\/li><li>Business vs personal branding<\/li><li>You get freedom &#8211; you lose freedom<\/li><li>It\u2019s not for everyone<\/li><li>Curiosity is the superpower<\/li><li>Be a jack of all trades, but a master of one<\/li><\/ul>\n",

If you want to understand why, see thing number 7<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you didn&#8217;t already: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-1\/\">read part 1<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-invest-in-tools-but-only-those-you-actually-need\">6. Invest in tools (but only those you actually need)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a job like mine you spend may hours at a desk, working at a computer, using a mouse and keyboard, looking at a screen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a hobby.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in the same way that a builder or decorator will spend good money buying decent power tools, I learned to see the things on my desk as my tools. And that they were worth spending extra on so that they were reliable, fast, powerful, and long-lasting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT\u2026 you don\u2019t need to go over the top. I see so much \u201cdesk\/setup porn\u201d and it frustrates me because I\u2019m sure so much of this is not actually what many peoples\u2019 desks look like when they work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reckon that only people with really tidy, fancy, expensive setups will share them. You don\u2019t see the less-fancy desks of many, many people who are busy and who are tucked away in the corner of ordinary bedrooms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, invest in good tools, but don\u2019t go overboard just because of what you see on Instagram or what the person who made that expensive video course had. You can waste an awful lot of money on things you don&#8217;t need too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-estimating-isn-t-that-hard-managing-scope-creep-is\">7. Estimating isn\u2019t THAT hard. Managing scope creep is.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I got pretty good at estimating how long it would take to do things I\u2019d been asked to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the things I hadn\u2019t been asked to do that were tricky.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8-freelancers-help-each-other\">8. Freelancers help each other<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019d think people running similar businesses would compete heavily against each other. And I\u2019m sure there are places where this happens. But in general I\u2019ve found freelancers and agency owners to be incredibly helpful and collaborative and supportive of each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess if you run a business you know what it\u2019s like to run a business. If you\u2019re a web developer, you know what it\u2019s like to be a web developer. You understand the struggles. And any reasonable person is going to have empathy and be supportive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, I was amazed at how much cheering on there was, and I like to think I did my bit sharing, mentoring, encouraging and cheering others on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9-niching-is-helpful-at-least-it-was-for-me\">9. Niching is helpful (at least, it was for me!)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s debate about operating your business in a niche, be it in an industry sector or geographic location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I, personally, found it very helpful to have a sector that I worked in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got referrals within that sector. I built up an understanding of the needs of the sector. I attended sector-specific events and joined sector-specific Slack and Facebook groups. I built up a personal profile and contacts in that sector. It meant I could focus a bit, and be especially interested in what my clients were doing, AND be extra helpful when work did come in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"10-people-are-everything\">10. People are EVERYTHING<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, you will work FOR people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will work WITH people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People may work for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will use the things you make (or, if you get it wrong, they may choose not to).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will send you work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will review your work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to be good at people stuff. You have to have empathy. You have to be good at communication. You have to be able to listen. And sometimes lead or take charge of a situation (even when it doesn\u2019t feel like your job to).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\u2019t just be a tech freelancer. People are always at the heart of every project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-part-three\">In part three&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This got really out of hand didn&#8217;t it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m still gonna write more.

        "content": "\n<p><em>This is part 2. The next five things. I got it written and wanted to post it. There will be a part three! And yes, there will be more than ten. If you want to understand why, see thing number 7<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you didn&#8217;t already: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-1\/\">read part 1<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-invest-in-tools-but-only-those-you-actually-need\">6. Invest in tools (but only those you actually need)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a job like mine you spend may hours at a desk, working at a computer, using a mouse and keyboard, looking at a screen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a hobby.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in the same way that a builder or decorator will spend good money buying decent power tools, I learned to see the things on my desk as my tools. And that they were worth spending extra on so that they were reliable, fast, powerful, and long-lasting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT\u2026 you don\u2019t need to go over the top. I see so much \u201cdesk\/setup porn\u201d and it frustrates me because I\u2019m sure so much of this is not actually what many peoples\u2019 desks look like when they work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reckon that only people with really tidy, fancy, expensive setups will share them. You don\u2019t see the less-fancy desks of many, many people who are busy and who are tucked away in the corner of ordinary bedrooms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, invest in good tools, but don\u2019t go overboard just because of what you see on Instagram or what the person who made that expensive video course had. You can waste an awful lot of money on things you don&#8217;t need too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-estimating-isn-t-that-hard-managing-scope-creep-is\">7. Estimating isn\u2019t THAT hard. Managing scope creep is.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I got pretty good at estimating how long it would take to do things I\u2019d been asked to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the things I hadn\u2019t been asked to do that were tricky.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8-freelancers-help-each-other\">8. Freelancers help each other<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019d think people running similar businesses would compete heavily against each other. And I\u2019m sure there are places where this happens. But in general I\u2019ve found freelancers and agency owners to be incredibly helpful and collaborative and supportive of each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess if you run a business you know what it\u2019s like to run a business. If you\u2019re a web developer, you know what it\u2019s like to be a web developer. You understand the struggles. And any reasonable person is going to have empathy and be supportive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, I was amazed at how much cheering on there was, and I like to think I did my bit sharing, mentoring, encouraging and cheering others on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9-niching-is-helpful-at-least-it-was-for-me\">9. Niching is helpful (at least, it was for me!)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s debate about operating your business in a niche, be it in an industry sector or geographic location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I, personally, found it very helpful to have a sector that I worked in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got referrals within that sector. I built up an understanding of the needs of the sector. I attended sector-specific events and joined sector-specific Slack and Facebook groups. I built up a personal profile and contacts in that sector. It meant I could focus a bit, and be especially interested in what my clients were doing, AND be extra helpful when work did come in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"10-people-are-everything\">10. People are EVERYTHING<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, you will work FOR people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will work WITH people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People may work for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will use the things you make (or, if you get it wrong, they may choose not to).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will send you work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will review your work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to be good at people stuff. You have to have empathy. You have to be good at communication. You have to be able to listen. And sometimes lead or take charge of a situation (even when it doesn\u2019t feel like your job to).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\u2019t just be a tech freelancer. People are always at the heart of every project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-part-three\">In part three&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This got really out of hand didn&#8217;t it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m still gonna write more. Here are some teasers:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Business vs Personal branding<\/li><li>You get freedom &#8211; you lose freedom<\/li><li>It\u2019s not for everyone<\/li><li>Curiosity is the superpower<\/li><li>Be a jack of all trades, but a master of one<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can go and <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/10\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-part-3\/\">read that now<\/a>!<\/p>\n",

            "content": {
                "rendered": "\n<p>Today I visited a local &#8220;Electric Vehicle Roadshow&#8221; where you could get information about eBikes, eCars, eMotorbikes, and stuff from people who sold them and owners clubs and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve long had the idea that our next car might be electric. Our current 13-year-old 1.8l petrol midi-MPV has been a superbly-reliable asset to our family life. But it&#8217;s getting old and tired (despite only 85,000 miles on it).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is that instead of one medium-sized car that we use for everything, we could get a small electric for getting round town and for longer trips where we&#8217;re not taking much luggage. Then for bigger or longer holidays we&#8217;ll just rent a bigger car. There&#8217;s no point owning a particular car because you need it&#8217;s size two or three times a year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for an electric car, charging is an issue. We don&#8217;t have a drive or garage. We have on-street parking. So if we wanted to charge something, we&#8217;d have to somehow park outside our house, and then run a cable out across the pavement!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But today, I think I was tipped over the edge with a realisation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was chatting with a chap about range and different battery capacities. He asked:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What sort of mileage do yo do?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Well, if we use the car a lot in a week it&#8217;s probably 30 miles.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;30 miles a day?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;No. 30 miles a WEEK.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HAaaaaaaannnnng on a mo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the small electric cars have a range of 120 miles. So even if we were busy and using the car a lot, we&#8217;ll charge it about once a month (assuming charge holds well).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason I had it in my head that we&#8217;d be charging this thing every other day. But the truth is that we go for days at a time without using our car. So driving to, say, a relative&#8217;s house and charging overnight every now and then, or finding a fast charger near a cafe occasionally. These are viable solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly the big blocker seems to have gone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NOW&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electric cars are still expensive. There&#8217;s an second-hand market now, which is good. And maybe that would work for us. But there&#8217;s possibly a question of: &#8220;If you&#8217;re only doing 30 miles a week, will it pay for itself? Is it good value?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might even be thinking &#8220;Why own a car at all?&#8221; and the answer really is convenience and the lack of a decent car club. Seriously, if I could borrow a car from a shared pool when I needed one I&#8217;d be on it like a shot. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don&#8217;t think &#8220;will it save us money&#8221; is a relevant question on it&#8217;s own. We don&#8217;t own a car because it&#8217;s cheap. We own a car because it gives us very flexible travel options. And anyway, currently we keep a 1.8l petrol car on the go. \u00a3100&#8217;s in vehicle duty. \u00a3100&#8217;s in servicing. And we only use it&#8217;s size and power a few times a year. Mostly it&#8217;s wasted. It THAT good value?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is wrong thinking then let me know. Really do!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, now I&#8217;m properly looking and researching and I&#8217;m likely to become a complete EV bore. So look forward to that!<\/p>\n",

        "title": "The Electric Car Idea",
        "content": "\n<p>Today I visited a local &#8220;Electric Vehicle Roadshow&#8221; where you could get information about eBikes, eCars, eMotorbikes, and stuff from people who sold them and owners clubs and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve long had the idea that our next car might be electric. Our current 13-year-old 1.8l petrol midi-MPV has been a superbly-reliable asset to our family life. But it&#8217;s getting old and tired (despite only 85,000 miles on it).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is that instead of one medium-sized car that we use for everything, we could get a small electric for getting round town and for longer trips where we&#8217;re not taking much luggage. Then for bigger or longer holidays we&#8217;ll just rent a bigger car. There&#8217;s no point owning a particular car because you need it&#8217;s size two or three times a year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for an electric car, charging is an issue. We don&#8217;t have a drive or garage. We have on-street parking. So if we wanted to charge something, we&#8217;d have to somehow park outside our house, and then run a cable out across the pavement!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But today, I think I was tipped over the edge with a realisation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was chatting with a chap about range and different battery capacities. He asked:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What sort of mileage do yo do?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Well, if we use the car a lot in a week it&#8217;s probably 30 miles.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;30 miles a day?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;No. 30 miles a WEEK.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HAaaaaaaannnnng on a mo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the small electric cars have a range of 120 miles. So even if we were busy and using the car a lot, we&#8217;ll charge it about once a month (assuming charge holds well).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason I had it in my head that we&#8217;d be charging this thing every other day. But the truth is that we go for days at a time without using our car. So driving to, say, a relative&#8217;s house and charging overnight every now and then, or finding a fast charger near a cafe occasionally. These are viable solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly the big blocker seems to have gone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NOW&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electric cars are still expensive. There&#8217;s an second-hand market now, which is good. And maybe that would work for us. But there&#8217;s possibly a question of: &#8220;If you&#8217;re only doing 30 miles a week, will it pay for itself? Is it good value?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might even be thinking &#8220;Why own a car at all?&#8221; and the answer really is convenience and the lack of a decent car club. Seriously, if I could borrow a car from a shared pool when I needed one I&#8217;d be on it like a shot. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don&#8217;t think &#8220;will it save us money&#8221; is a relevant question on it&#8217;s own. We don&#8217;t own a car because it&#8217;s cheap. We own a car because it gives us very flexible travel options. And anyway, currently we keep a 1.8l petrol car on the go. \u00a3100&#8217;s in vehicle duty. \u00a3100&#8217;s in servicing. And we only use it&#8217;s size and power a few times a year. Mostly it&#8217;s wasted. It THAT good value?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is wrong thinking then let me know. Really do!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, now I&#8217;m properly looking and researching and I&#8217;m likely to become a complete EV bore. So look forward to that!<\/p>\n",

You will never regret not tweeting.<\/li><li>Is it intended to delight, inform or amuse? Then go ahead. If not, don&#8217;t.<\/li><li>Never argue with anybody about anything. Really.<\/li><li>\u2026..except pizza, whether hot dogs are sandwiches, and old movies\/TV shows.<\/li><li>Don&#8217;t say anything about a piece of current art\/writing\/culture you wouldn&#8217;t say to the face of the person who created it.<\/li><li>Never promote any info or news unless it comes from a trust to tell you which door the tiger is behind. source you would<\/li><li>The only useful purpose of having a bigger platform a than other people is to use it to benefit those other people, so boost and recommend widely.<\/li><li>Resist the common urge to engage with the one critic rather than the many fans.<\/li><li>Never, ever insult anyone personally. Mockery is fine, as long as it aimed upwards.<\/li><li>To survive on the veldt, humans evolved to crave sugars and fats and to get energized by anger and fear. We don&#8217;t live on the veldt anymore. Refrain from feeding obsolete hungers.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know that I have some unwritten rules of my own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve had enough bad interactions on social media (and really, I acknowledge my privilege and it&#8217;s not very many at all, but it&#8217;s enough) to have learned some lessons. And I&#8217;ve spent enough time scrolling and curating my feed into a happy and useful place that I think there&#8217;s some wisdom here. So here&#8217;s how I use Twitter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Disable trends. Focus on your own timeline. Don&#8217;t get distracted by the algorithm. I use <a href=\"https:\/\/tapbots.com\/tweetbot\/\">Tweetbot<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/better-twitter\/illmpnnkeobcgnnjghammeohfjpjoljp\">Better Twitter<\/a>.<\/li><li>Learn when something is a fact and when something is an opinion. Always ask if you can put &#8220;IMO&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;I think that&#8230;&#8221; in front of your &#8220;fact&#8221;. There&#8217;s a world of difference between &#8220;Avocados are horrid&#8221; and &#8220;I think that Avocados are horrid&#8221;.<\/li><li>Related: Not everyone&#8217;s brain thinks the same way. Your shitpost might be insulting to someone that doesn&#8217;t &#8211; or just plain isn&#8217;t able to &#8211; get it. Kindness always wins.<\/li><li>Following is not a two-way thing. I don&#8217;t have to follow back. I don&#8217;t have to follow you at all. I reserve the right to unfollow at any point.<\/li><li>Mute judiciously: Learn to recognise when a topic is causing anxiety or anger and eliminate it. Mute people. Mute keywords. You won&#8217;t miss those Tweets. I honestly look at my mute list and think &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t read Tweets with that in? Ah well. ?\u200d\u2642\ufe0f&#8221;<\/li><li>Never argue with anybody about anything. Really.<\/li><li>If you must engage with something controversial, asking questions is always better than stating opinions. &#8220;Why do you think that?&#8221; is a great start. But mostly, never argue with anybody.<\/li><li>Not Tweeting about a topic doesn&#8217;t say anything about my opinion on that topic.<\/li><li>Avoid topics that can&#8217;t be effectively discussed in Tweets. Recognise when something has nuance and either don&#8217;t mention it, or find a better way to discuss it.<\/li><li>Researching before retweeting. Even if you agree with or like a message, make sure it&#8217;s correct before sharing it.<\/li><li>Say nice things. Share what your friends make and do. Kindness is free. You have an unlimited reserve of it if you look inside of you.<\/li><\/ol>\n",

You will never regret not tweeting.<\/li><li>Is it intended to delight, inform or amuse? Then go ahead. If not, don&#8217;t.<\/li><li>Never argue with anybody about anything. Really.<\/li><li>\u2026..except pizza, whether hot dogs are sandwiches, and old movies\/TV shows.<\/li><li>Don&#8217;t say anything about a piece of current art\/writing\/culture you wouldn&#8217;t say to the face of the person who created it.<\/li><li>Never promote any info or news unless it comes from a trust to tell you which door the tiger is behind. source you would<\/li><li>The only useful purpose of having a bigger platform a than other people is to use it to benefit those other people, so boost and recommend widely.<\/li><li>Resist the common urge to engage with the one critic rather than the many fans.<\/li><li>Never, ever insult anyone personally. Mockery is fine, as long as it aimed upwards.<\/li><li>To survive on the veldt, humans evolved to crave sugars and fats and to get energized by anger and fear. We don&#8217;t live on the veldt anymore. Refrain from feeding obsolete hungers.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know that I have some unwritten rules of my own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve had enough bad interactions on social media (and really, I acknowledge my privilege and it&#8217;s not very many at all, but it&#8217;s enough) to have learned some lessons. And I&#8217;ve spent enough time scrolling and curating my feed into a happy and useful place that I think there&#8217;s some wisdom here. So here&#8217;s how I use Twitter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Disable trends. Focus on your own timeline. Don&#8217;t get distracted by the algorithm. I use <a href=\"https:\/\/tapbots.com\/tweetbot\/\">Tweetbot<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/better-twitter\/illmpnnkeobcgnnjghammeohfjpjoljp\">Better Twitter<\/a>.<\/li><li>Learn when something is a fact and when something is an opinion. Always ask if you can put &#8220;IMO&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;I think that&#8230;&#8221; in front of your &#8220;fact&#8221;. There&#8217;s a world of difference between &#8220;Avocados are horrid&#8221; and &#8220;I think that Avocados are horrid&#8221;.<\/li><li>Related: Not everyone&#8217;s brain thinks the same way. Your shitpost might be insulting to someone that doesn&#8217;t &#8211; or just plain isn&#8217;t able to &#8211; get it. Kindness always wins.<\/li><li>Following is not a two-way thing. I don&#8217;t have to follow back. I don&#8217;t have to follow you at all. I reserve the right to unfollow at any point.<\/li><li>Mute judiciously: Learn to recognise when a topic is causing anxiety or anger and eliminate it. Mute people. Mute keywords. You won&#8217;t miss those Tweets. I honestly look at my mute list and think &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t read Tweets with that in? Ah well. ?\u200d\u2642\ufe0f&#8221;<\/li><li>Never argue with anybody about anything. Really.<\/li><li>If you must engage with something controversial, asking questions is always better than stating opinions. &#8220;Why do you think that?&#8221; is a great start. But mostly, never argue with anybody.<\/li><li>Not Tweeting about a topic doesn&#8217;t say anything about my opinion on that topic.<\/li><li>Avoid topics that can&#8217;t be effectively discussed in Tweets. Recognise when something has nuance and either don&#8217;t mention it, or find a better way to discuss it.<\/li><li>Researching before retweeting. Even if you agree with or like a message, make sure it&#8217;s correct before sharing it.<\/li><li>Say nice things. Share what your friends make and do. Kindness is free. You have an unlimited reserve of it if you look inside of you.<\/li><\/ol>\n",

There are still some loose ends to tie up but I really ought to close out my thoughts on freelancing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also read <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-1\/\">part 1<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-2\/\">part 2<\/a> if you missed them. I&#8217;ve already given you 10 things, so here are some bonus experiences. What can I say? It all got a bit out of hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"11-business-vs-personal-branding\">11. Business vs Personal branding<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started out I had no idea what &#8220;Oikos&#8221; &#8211; my business &#8211; would become. And I was nervous about being just myself. That didn&#8217;t seem right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I set up the business with a business name and worked under that. &#8220;Oikos&#8221; was the brand and it had some ideas and principles behind it. And maybe one day it would be more than just me. That was the main reason I avoided being &#8220;Ross Wintle&#8221; as a brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, though, my personal reputation seemed to become more important. As I started doing some public speaking and taking part in conferences and community events and forums, it was me that was well know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, over time, I realised that I didn&#8217;t want to grow and become more than just me. I was quite happy to not have the stress of directly employing other people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I kinda switched back to being &#8220;Ross Wintle&#8221; a bit more. Oikos was still the face of the business and the legal entity that clients dealt with, but I focussed much more on just being me, because that was really what Oikos was selling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was important to have the limited company for various reasons that are well documented elsewhere. And I don&#8217;t think I have an opinion one way or another on what you should be. It&#8217;s YOUR business, and the key is to understand the pros and cons of personal vs business branding. And know that it&#8217;s OK to change too&#8230; you can scale back on one and focus on the other if that&#8217;s what you need to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"12-you-get-freedom-you-lose-freedom\">12. You get freedom \u2013 you lose freedom<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of the big sell of Freelance life is the freedom that you get. And there IS a lot of freedom in freelancing. It&#8217;s a huge privilege actually: to have skills that allow you to work remotely doing something you enjoy in your own place and in your own time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But (and maybe this is just because of how my brain works) freelancing is a bit of a lifestyle. It can consume you. It occupies your thoughts and time when you&#8217;re not doing it. And this actually takes away some freedom too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure some people can switch off better than I can, but I found it hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of my rationale for taking a full-time role recently was that both of my kids are now at school and I don&#8217;t need as much flexibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with the full time rule I get to switch off. I get to the end of the day and I don&#8217;t have to work any more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s taking time to adjust &#8211; to train my brain that I don&#8217;t need to be thinking about work right now. But I can stop thinking about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"13-it-s-not-for-everyone\">13. It\u2019s not for everyone<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of hype around freelancing and many of the messages are that &#8220;Anyone can do it&#8221;, &#8220;You can achieve your dreams&#8221;, &#8220;Do what you love&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also see a lot of people struggling. And some that probably shouldn&#8217;t have started their freelance\/startup\/founder journey. So here&#8217;s some things that I believe about freelancing:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>You have to be very motivated &#8211; you won&#8217;t get by without a good work ethic.<\/li><li>You need to be good (or willing to get good) at a whole load of other things in addition to whatever it is you do for a living (communication, organisation, marketing, etc)<\/li><li>You probably need some kind of financial buffer to get started.<\/li><li>You actually need to have a service or product that people want to pay decent money for.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have no money, no specialist thing that you&#8217;re good at, and you&#8217;re not willing to throw yourself into things then I don&#8217;t believe that just &#8220;following your dream&#8221; is enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"14-curiosity-is-a-superpower\">14. Curiosity is a superpower<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another trait that I think is really helpful is curiosity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Aside: &#8220;Curious&#8221; is my favourite word. I love the double meaning of &#8220;unusual&#8221; and &#8220;inquisitive&#8221;. I think both are highly undervalued traits. So to wrap them up in a single word is ACE!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I think about this I think about some of the things I&#8217;ve had to be curious about in my freelancing that aren&#8217;t my core competency of coding:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Data protection and GDPR<\/li><li>Video and audio production<\/li><li>SEO and social media<\/li><li>Bookkeeping and accounting<\/li><li>Insurance<\/li><li>Writing<\/li><li>Business planning<\/li><li>Coffee brewing (kinda half-joking here)<\/li><li>Psychology (habits, mental health, productivity)<\/li><li>Software, hardward and other tools<\/li><li>Project management<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Being curious isn&#8217;t <em>required<\/em>. You can pay other people to do some of these things for you. You can try to ignore them. But I reckon that if you&#8217;re willing to spend time going down some of these rabbit holes on your own you&#8217;ll broaden your knowledge and this will make you a more useful freelancer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent a lot of time advising my clients on some of these things that weren&#8217;t only ancillary to MY business, but to THEIR business\/organisation too. My knowledge made me more valuable to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"15-be-a-jack-of-all-trades-but-a-master-of-one\">15. Be a jack of all trades, but a master of one<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all of this stuff &#8211; broadening your horizons, being curious and learning lots being to your advantage &#8211; I believe it still pays to have a focus. I tried to sell myself too broadly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to help small organisations, but it was the bigger ones that paid the bills. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to do back-end work, but it was the front-end work that paid the bills. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to use my flexibility to work on side projects and build passive income, but it was the paid project work that paid the bills. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to offer hosting and support services, but these were often a distraction from the project work. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, I was overwhelmed with wanting to be and do everything. And this meant I wasn&#8217;t as effective at serving my clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should probably have chosen to be a back-end consultant who worked full time on a single project at a time for a big client, did no hosting, and worked minimally on my side projects in my spare time. I&#8217;d have made more money, been less stressed, and&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hang on&#8230; wait&#8230; this sounds like having a full time job? And this is what I&#8217;m experiencing right now!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you see where I ended up?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-summary\">In summary<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You might thing I&#8217;m saying don&#8217;t freelance because it&#8217;s hard, and you need to be a special kind of person, and you&#8217;ll burn out. It&#8217;s entirely possibly that I just wasn&#8217;t very good at it and should have stuck to employment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No. I&#8217;ve used the flexibility of freelancing for 10 years and it&#8217;s served me really well, especially with a young family in my care too. It was totally the right thing for me to do. But I am saying: it&#8217;s not a golden goose or a silver bullet. It&#8217;s not for everyone. It&#8217;s sold as a dream that everyone should aspire to, but honestly, I don&#8217;t think it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be really convenient and a great way to broaden your skills, make a name for yourself, and escape corporate culture or the apparent drudgery of employment. But you need to be sure it&#8217;s what you really want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And despite all the hyped-up positive of many business owners, remember that it&#8217;s OK to try it and not like it. It&#8217;s OK to stop being a freelancer too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope this helps you in your own journey.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>So I&#8217;ve had my last official day as a freelancer. There are still some loose ends to tie up but I really ought to close out my thoughts on freelancing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also read <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-1\/\">part 1<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-2\/\">part 2<\/a> if you missed them. I&#8217;ve already given you 10 things, so here are some bonus experiences. What can I say? It all got a bit out of hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"11-business-vs-personal-branding\">11. Business vs Personal branding<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started out I had no idea what &#8220;Oikos&#8221; &#8211; my business &#8211; would become. And I was nervous about being just myself. That didn&#8217;t seem right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I set up the business with a business name and worked under that. &#8220;Oikos&#8221; was the brand and it had some ideas and principles behind it. And maybe one day it would be more than just me. That was the main reason I avoided being &#8220;Ross Wintle&#8221; as a brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, though, my personal reputation seemed to become more important. As I started doing some public speaking and taking part in conferences and community events and forums, it was me that was well know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, over time, I realised that I didn&#8217;t want to grow and become more than just me. I was quite happy to not have the stress of directly employing other people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I kinda switched back to being &#8220;Ross Wintle&#8221; a bit more. Oikos was still the face of the business and the legal entity that clients dealt with, but I focussed much more on just being me, because that was really what Oikos was selling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was important to have the limited company for various reasons that are well documented elsewhere. And I don&#8217;t think I have an opinion one way or another on what you should be. It&#8217;s YOUR business, and the key is to understand the pros and cons of personal vs business branding. And know that it&#8217;s OK to change too&#8230; you can scale back on one and focus on the other if that&#8217;s what you need to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"12-you-get-freedom-you-lose-freedom\">12. You get freedom \u2013 you lose freedom<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of the big sell of Freelance life is the freedom that you get. And there IS a lot of freedom in freelancing. It&#8217;s a huge privilege actually: to have skills that allow you to work remotely doing something you enjoy in your own place and in your own time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But (and maybe this is just because of how my brain works) freelancing is a bit of a lifestyle. It can consume you. It occupies your thoughts and time when you&#8217;re not doing it. And this actually takes away some freedom too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure some people can switch off better than I can, but I found it hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of my rationale for taking a full-time role recently was that both of my kids are now at school and I don&#8217;t need as much flexibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with the full time rule I get to switch off. I get to the end of the day and I don&#8217;t have to work any more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s taking time to adjust &#8211; to train my brain that I don&#8217;t need to be thinking about work right now. But I can stop thinking about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"13-it-s-not-for-everyone\">13. It\u2019s not for everyone<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of hype around freelancing and many of the messages are that &#8220;Anyone can do it&#8221;, &#8220;You can achieve your dreams&#8221;, &#8220;Do what you love&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also see a lot of people struggling. And some that probably shouldn&#8217;t have started their freelance\/startup\/founder journey. So here&#8217;s some things that I believe about freelancing:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>You have to be very motivated &#8211; you won&#8217;t get by without a good work ethic.<\/li><li>You need to be good (or willing to get good) at a whole load of other things in addition to whatever it is you do for a living (communication, organisation, marketing, etc)<\/li><li>You probably need some kind of financial buffer to get started.<\/li><li>You actually need to have a service or product that people want to pay decent money for.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have no money, no specialist thing that you&#8217;re good at, and you&#8217;re not willing to throw yourself into things then I don&#8217;t believe that just &#8220;following your dream&#8221; is enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"14-curiosity-is-a-superpower\">14. Curiosity is a superpower<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another trait that I think is really helpful is curiosity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Aside: &#8220;Curious&#8221; is my favourite word. I love the double meaning of &#8220;unusual&#8221; and &#8220;inquisitive&#8221;. I think both are highly undervalued traits. So to wrap them up in a single word is ACE!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I think about this I think about some of the things I&#8217;ve had to be curious about in my freelancing that aren&#8217;t my core competency of coding:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Data protection and GDPR<\/li><li>Video and audio production<\/li><li>SEO and social media<\/li><li>Bookkeeping and accounting<\/li><li>Insurance<\/li><li>Writing<\/li><li>Business planning<\/li><li>Coffee brewing (kinda half-joking here)<\/li><li>Psychology (habits, mental health, productivity)<\/li><li>Software, hardward and other tools<\/li><li>Project management<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Being curious isn&#8217;t <em>required<\/em>. You can pay other people to do some of these things for you. You can try to ignore them. But I reckon that if you&#8217;re willing to spend time going down some of these rabbit holes on your own you&#8217;ll broaden your knowledge and this will make you a more useful freelancer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent a lot of time advising my clients on some of these things that weren&#8217;t only ancillary to MY business, but to THEIR business\/organisation too. My knowledge made me more valuable to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"15-be-a-jack-of-all-trades-but-a-master-of-one\">15. Be a jack of all trades, but a master of one<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all of this stuff &#8211; broadening your horizons, being curious and learning lots being to your advantage &#8211; I believe it still pays to have a focus. I tried to sell myself too broadly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to help small organisations, but it was the bigger ones that paid the bills. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to do back-end work, but it was the front-end work that paid the bills. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to use my flexibility to work on side projects and build passive income, but it was the paid project work that paid the bills. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to offer hosting and support services, but these were often a distraction from the project work. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, I was overwhelmed with wanting to be and do everything. And this meant I wasn&#8217;t as effective at serving my clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should probably have chosen to be a back-end consultant who worked full time on a single project at a time for a big client, did no hosting, and worked minimally on my side projects in my spare time. I&#8217;d have made more money, been less stressed, and&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hang on&#8230; wait&#8230; this sounds like having a full time job? And this is what I&#8217;m experiencing right now!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you see where I ended up?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-summary\">In summary<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You might thing I&#8217;m saying don&#8217;t freelance because it&#8217;s hard, and you need to be a special kind of person, and you&#8217;ll burn out. It&#8217;s entirely possibly that I just wasn&#8217;t very good at it and should have stuck to employment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No. I&#8217;ve used the flexibility of freelancing for 10 years and it&#8217;s served me really well, especially with a young family in my care too. It was totally the right thing for me to do. But I am saying: it&#8217;s not a golden goose or a silver bullet. It&#8217;s not for everyone. It&#8217;s sold as a dream that everyone should aspire to, but honestly, I don&#8217;t think it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be really convenient and a great way to broaden your skills, make a name for yourself, and escape corporate culture or the apparent drudgery of employment. But you need to be sure it&#8217;s what you really want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And despite all the hyped-up positive of many business owners, remember that it&#8217;s OK to try it and not like it. It&#8217;s OK to stop being a freelancer too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope this helps you in your own journey.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>Regular followers will have heard me talk about <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a>. And you may also know that I am, where possible, trying to #DitchTheBuild and use vanilla HTML, CSS and JS as much as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for the Turbo Admin website I kinda wanted to embrace this philosophy, get cheap-and-easy, static-file hosting, and make my build and maintenance process as simple as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230; I also wanted to make use of the <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\">Tailwind UI<\/a> component library that I have access to, so I wanted to embrace TailwindCSS and it&#8217;s component-based philosophy as well. How could I do all this but with a minimal build process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I investigated a number of options like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.11ty.dev\">Eleventy<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/mozilla.github.io\/nunjucks\/\">Nunjucks<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/jigsaw.tighten.co\/\">Jigsaw<\/a>, and some others. I decided that they were all too much for what I needed and that I didn&#8217;t want such a big dependency for the build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what DID I need? It&#8217;s just a few HTML pages with a common header and footer, and some template partials with a bit of conditional logic. Maybe some environment variables for testing, API keys, tags and stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>variables<\/li><li>some simple logic for building different environments<\/li><li>simple template includes\/extends<\/li><li>a command-line build process for a few files.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it occurred to me: PHP does all of this! Can&#8217;t I just use PHP?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>PHP has includes for templates<\/li><li>PHP has variables and logic<\/li><li>PHP can be run from the command line<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So I set out to see what was possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with a bit of clever <a href=\"https:\/\/www.php.net\/manual\/en\/book.outcontrol.php\">output buffering<\/a> it turns out that it&#8217;s not so hard to loop over a bunch of files, processing them with PHP, capturing the output, injecting it into a template and writing it out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a bit hacky, but it&#8217;s all standard PHP. It may not be the easiest code to understand, but <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d\">these 162 lines of PHP<\/a> are a simple, command-line static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined with <a href=\"https:\/\/esbuild.github.io\/\">esbuild<\/a> (only required because I&#8217;m using JavaScript modules to power the interactive parts of the homepage) and the <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/installation\">Tailwind CLI<\/a> this can build my whole site with very few dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tailwind can even now be <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/blog\/standalone-cli\">used standalone without node\/npm<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also use standardised build scripts for my projects. So each project has a <code>build.sh<\/code> and a <code>prod.sh<\/code> so I don&#8217;t have to remember what commands to run for each.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious, the script for this project is:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n#!\/bin\/sh\nnode_modules\/.bin\/esbuild src\/js\/turbo-admin\/main.js --bundle --minify --sourcemap --outfile=public\/js\/turbo-admin\/main.min.js\nphp .\/build.php\nnpm run build:dev\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Sure, this doesn&#8217;t have hot-module reloading or automatic browser refresh. But it&#8217;s not changing so much that I need those things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, this project has a build step. It uses npm (for now). But it&#8217;s pretty minimal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there you go. Summary:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Vanilla <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d\">PHP static site builder<\/a> in 162 lines<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/esbuild.github.io\/\">ESBuild<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/installation\">Tailwind CLI<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All you need to build a simple site with minimal dependencies.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Regular followers will have heard me talk about <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a>. And you may also know that I am, where possible, trying to #DitchTheBuild and use vanilla HTML, CSS and JS as much as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for the Turbo Admin website I kinda wanted to embrace this philosophy, get cheap-and-easy, static-file hosting, and make my build and maintenance process as simple as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230; I also wanted to make use of the <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\">Tailwind UI<\/a> component library that I have access to, so I wanted to embrace TailwindCSS and it&#8217;s component-based philosophy as well. How could I do all this but with a minimal build process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I investigated a number of options like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.11ty.dev\">Eleventy<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/mozilla.github.io\/nunjucks\/\">Nunjucks<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/jigsaw.tighten.co\/\">Jigsaw<\/a>, and some others. I decided that they were all too much for what I needed and that I didn&#8217;t want such a big dependency for the build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what DID I need? It&#8217;s just a few HTML pages with a common header and footer, and some template partials with a bit of conditional logic. Maybe some environment variables for testing, API keys, tags and stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>variables<\/li><li>some simple logic for building different environments<\/li><li>simple template includes\/extends<\/li><li>a command-line build process for a few files.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it occurred to me: PHP does all of this! Can&#8217;t I just use PHP?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>PHP has includes for templates<\/li><li>PHP has variables and logic<\/li><li>PHP can be run from the command line<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So I set out to see what was possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with a bit of clever <a href=\"https:\/\/www.php.net\/manual\/en\/book.outcontrol.php\">output buffering<\/a> it turns out that it&#8217;s not so hard to loop over a bunch of files, processing them with PHP, capturing the output, injecting it into a template and writing it out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a bit hacky, but it&#8217;s all standard PHP. It may not be the easiest code to understand, but <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d\">these 162 lines of PHP<\/a> are a simple, command-line static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined with <a href=\"https:\/\/esbuild.github.io\/\">esbuild<\/a> (only required because I&#8217;m using JavaScript modules to power the interactive parts of the homepage) and the <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/installation\">Tailwind CLI<\/a> this can build my whole site with very few dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tailwind can even now be <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/blog\/standalone-cli\">used standalone without node\/npm<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also use standardised build scripts for my projects. So each project has a <code>build.sh<\/code> and a <code>prod.sh<\/code> so I don&#8217;t have to remember what commands to run for each.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious, the script for this project is:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: bash; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n#!\/bin\/sh\nnode_modules\/.bin\/esbuild src\/js\/turbo-admin\/main.js --bundle --minify --sourcemap --outfile=public\/js\/turbo-admin\/main.min.js\nphp .\/build.php\nnpm run build:dev\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Sure, this doesn&#8217;t have hot-module reloading or automatic browser refresh. But it&#8217;s not changing so much that I need those things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, this project has a build step. It uses npm (for now). But it&#8217;s pretty minimal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there you go. Summary:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Vanilla <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d\">PHP static site builder<\/a> in 162 lines<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/esbuild.github.io\/\">ESBuild<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/installation\">Tailwind CLI<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All you need to build a simple site with minimal dependencies.<\/p>\n",

It\u2019s a difficult tool to market because people don\u2019t know they need it until they have it. People don\u2019t seem to be Googling for this kind of tool because they don\u2019t know it\u2019s something that exists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Although the number of people who want to <a href=\"https:\/\/wptavern.com\/clarity-ad-blocker-for-wordpress-announced-receives-mixed-reactions\">hide notices<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dimensionmedia\/status\/1485617351617826822\">punch the block editor welcome screen in the face<\/a> seems huge! Both of which are things that Turbo Admin helps with!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people have come across Turbo Admin, however, they weren&#8217;t able to immediately see the big benefit of a browser extension because they had to pay for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now I\u2019ve found a way to make it available to everyone to try out: from today, you can use Turbo Admin on up to three sites for free!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/try.html\">Try Turbo Admin!<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m still in the process of updating the website and documentation to reflect this change, but I didn\u2019t want that to stop you trying it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-this-work\">How does this work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, download\/install the extension &#8211; start at <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/try.html\">turbo-admin.com\/try.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turbo Admin tries to detect WordPress sites from both the front and back-end, so be careful what you do next! The next three WordPress sites you visit will (probably) use up your three site limit. So you may want to visit three sites that you will log in to to be able to properly try it out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sites that are included in your limit will have a green dot on the Turbo Admin icon in your browser. Turbo Admin will work on these sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any other sites will have a red dot on the Turbo Admin icon and Turbo Admin will not work on these.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that if you don\u2019t see the coloured dots on Chrome\/Chromium then you may need to \u201cpin\u201d the icon. To do this, click the jigsaw puzzle icon and then click the pin icon next to Turbo Admin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve decided you can\u2019t do WordPress without Turbo Admin any more, it\u2019s only $35 (plus local taxes) to <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\">buy a license<\/a> to remove the three-site limit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a one-time purchase of version 1 that will last for as long as the extension works and will get any updates that to version 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-did-you-do-it-this-way\">Why did you do it this way?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d considered free trials before. But always as a time-limited thing. But for various reasons this didn\u2019t seem like a great idea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/turbo-admin\/\">the plugin<\/a>, which is free, but doesn\u2019t demonstrate the HUGE benefit of the browser extension. Plus the extension has some features that just don\u2019t make sense in the plugin so you don\u2019t get the full functionality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I realised I could easily limit by number of sites, I loved the idea. It\u2019s a much better way to see the benefits for free, while still making the purchase attractive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I won\u2019t lie, I\u2019m a little scared about how much support work this might generate. So to make it clear: this is a side gig, I have limited time, and I make no promises about support. And anyway, Turbo Admin should, mostly, \u201cjust work\u201d!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m hoping that this free-trial removes the barrier to trying out the extension, and to people accessing what I consider to be complete \u201cmagic\u201d in the WordPress dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s see what\u2019s next!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sign off with HUGE thanks to everyone who has bought Turbo Admin, shared it, promoted it, reviewed it, loved it, and helped me develop it and get it into the world.<\/p>\n",

It\u2019s a difficult tool to market because people don\u2019t know they need it until they have it. People don\u2019t seem to be Googling for this kind of tool because they don\u2019t know it\u2019s something that exists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Although the number of people who want to <a href=\"https:\/\/wptavern.com\/clarity-ad-blocker-for-wordpress-announced-receives-mixed-reactions\">hide notices<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dimensionmedia\/status\/1485617351617826822\">punch the block editor welcome screen in the face<\/a> seems huge! Both of which are things that Turbo Admin helps with!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people have come across Turbo Admin, however, they weren&#8217;t able to immediately see the big benefit of a browser extension because they had to pay for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now I\u2019ve found a way to make it available to everyone to try out: from today, you can use Turbo Admin on up to three sites for free!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/try.html\">Try Turbo Admin!<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m still in the process of updating the website and documentation to reflect this change, but I didn\u2019t want that to stop you trying it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-this-work\">How does this work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, download\/install the extension &#8211; start at <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/try.html\">turbo-admin.com\/try.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turbo Admin tries to detect WordPress sites from both the front and back-end, so be careful what you do next! The next three WordPress sites you visit will (probably) use up your three site limit. So you may want to visit three sites that you will log in to to be able to properly try it out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sites that are included in your limit will have a green dot on the Turbo Admin icon in your browser. Turbo Admin will work on these sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any other sites will have a red dot on the Turbo Admin icon and Turbo Admin will not work on these.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that if you don\u2019t see the coloured dots on Chrome\/Chromium then you may need to \u201cpin\u201d the icon. To do this, click the jigsaw puzzle icon and then click the pin icon next to Turbo Admin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve decided you can\u2019t do WordPress without Turbo Admin any more, it\u2019s only $35 (plus local taxes) to <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\">buy a license<\/a> to remove the three-site limit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a one-time purchase of version 1 that will last for as long as the extension works and will get any updates that to version 1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-did-you-do-it-this-way\">Why did you do it this way?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d considered free trials before. But always as a time-limited thing. But for various reasons this didn\u2019t seem like a great idea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/turbo-admin\/\">the plugin<\/a>, which is free, but doesn\u2019t demonstrate the HUGE benefit of the browser extension. Plus the extension has some features that just don\u2019t make sense in the plugin so you don\u2019t get the full functionality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I realised I could easily limit by number of sites, I loved the idea. It\u2019s a much better way to see the benefits for free, while still making the purchase attractive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I won\u2019t lie, I\u2019m a little scared about how much support work this might generate. So to make it clear: this is a side gig, I have limited time, and I make no promises about support. And anyway, Turbo Admin should, mostly, \u201cjust work\u201d!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m hoping that this free-trial removes the barrier to trying out the extension, and to people accessing what I consider to be complete \u201cmagic\u201d in the WordPress dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s see what\u2019s next!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sign off with HUGE thanks to everyone who has bought Turbo Admin, shared it, promoted it, reviewed it, loved it, and helped me develop it and get it into the world.<\/p>\n",
