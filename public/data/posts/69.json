So quickly that I didn&#8217;t get to write anything about the house-hunting process.<\/p>\n<p>You build it up in your head as being this huge thing that&#8217;s really hard and takes ages to do but no&#8230;despite the differences that Sally and I had about what we wanted from a house and a neighbourhood, the fourth place that we looked out got us both very excited. We put an offer in<br \/>on Saturday and it was duly accepted.<\/p>\n<p>I had some hesitations. Does God want us to buy a house? How do the notions of borrowing and spending that much money fit in with my faith? Am I just following the crowd and the culture? Is this really something that we should be doing, or should we be stepping out in a different,<br \/>more counter-cultural direction?<\/p>\n<p>I never asked those questions about renting. Perhaps I should have?<\/p>\n<p>I did spend some time praying about the decision. I thought hard about a little story in the bible where a man goes to Jesus and, excitedly, says &#8220;I will follow you wherever you go&#8221;. Brilliant, we might think.  How good, we might think, to see someone making such a passionate statement of commitment to following Jesus&#8217; teaching!<\/p>\n<p>But Jesus knows the man&#8217;s true motives and replies by saying that &#8220;foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean? Does it mean that if we want to follow Jesus we should never settle anywhere? How does that fit the theme of community that runs through the bible, of living, sharing, and serving God together? Is buying a house too much of a commitment to stay in one<br \/>place? Or should I be settling into a community and trying to make a difference there by sticking it out, making friends and serving others?<\/p>\n<p>This story is followed by another about a man who wants to follow Jesus but has a few things he wants to do first. It&#8217;s a story about priorities. We should be following Jesus first, whatever that may mean for us, and doing the other things alongside that.<\/p>\n<p>As I prayed and asked God about the passage and about our move I felt God saying that the most important thing was to follow Jesus. Buying a house is fine, as long as it doesn&#8217;t make you lose sight of what&#8217;s really important. If the house, job, money, friends, car, holiday, wide-screen TV, or any worldly thing starts to get in the way of loving God and loving our neighbours, then we need to re-prioritise.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s early days yet and there&#8217;s plenty that can go wrong, but we hope that one day soon we will own our house. But doing so MUST be an activity that enables us to love and serve and follow our God, not one that distracts us from it.<\/p>\n",

So quickly that I didn&#8217;t get to write anything about the house-hunting process.<\/p>\n<p>You build it up in your head as being this huge thing that&#8217;s really hard and takes ages to do but no&#8230;despite the differences that Sally and I had about what we wanted from a house and a neighbourhood, the fourth place that we looked out got us both very excited. We put an offer in<br \/>on Saturday and it was duly accepted.<\/p>\n<p>I had some hesitations. Does God want us to buy a house? How do the notions of borrowing and spending that much money fit in with my faith? Am I just following the crowd and the culture? Is this really something that we should be doing, or should we be stepping out in a different,<br \/>more counter-cultural direction?<\/p>\n<p>I never asked those questions about renting. Perhaps I should have?<\/p>\n<p>I did spend some time praying about the decision. I thought hard about a little story in the bible where a man goes to Jesus and, excitedly, says &#8220;I will follow you wherever you go&#8221;. Brilliant, we might think.  How good, we might think, to see someone making such a passionate statement of commitment to following Jesus&#8217; teaching!<\/p>\n<p>But Jesus knows the man&#8217;s true motives and replies by saying that &#8220;foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean? Does it mean that if we want to follow Jesus we should never settle anywhere? How does that fit the theme of community that runs through the bible, of living, sharing, and serving God together? Is buying a house too much of a commitment to stay in one<br \/>place? Or should I be settling into a community and trying to make a difference there by sticking it out, making friends and serving others?<\/p>\n<p>This story is followed by another about a man who wants to follow Jesus but has a few things he wants to do first. It&#8217;s a story about priorities. We should be following Jesus first, whatever that may mean for us, and doing the other things alongside that.<\/p>\n<p>As I prayed and asked God about the passage and about our move I felt God saying that the most important thing was to follow Jesus. Buying a house is fine, as long as it doesn&#8217;t make you lose sight of what&#8217;s really important. If the house, job, money, friends, car, holiday, wide-screen TV, or any worldly thing starts to get in the way of loving God and loving our neighbours, then we need to re-prioritise.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s early days yet and there&#8217;s plenty that can go wrong, but we hope that one day soon we will own our house. But doing so MUST be an activity that enables us to love and serve and follow our God, not one that distracts us from it.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>For a while now we&#8217;ve had cockroaches in our house!  And I wanted to write up my experiences in case we ever get them again.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cockroach\">Wikipedia article<\/a> is pretty good and has been very helpful.  My experiences are given below.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Finding them<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It started ages ago when I found one in the bath.  I then found another, and then we had little baby ones crawling around the bathroom floor at night.  We eventually got rid of them from the bathroom but then we started finding them in the kitchen (downstairs) and the hallway of our house.<\/p>\n<p>Finding them is not always easy as they only seem to come out at night.  So, you don&#8217;t necessarily know you&#8217;ve got them until too late.  We eventually got rid of ours when we opened the back door late at night and found lots of them scurrying around on the patio.  So if you think you have some living nearby, it&#8217;s a good idea to go scouting with a torch late at night.  Of course, if they&#8217;re inside then they&#8217;re very good at hiding and you&#8217;ll just have to wait until they come out, or get caught somewhere with slippery walls that they can&#8217;t escape.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Living with them<\/span><\/p>\n<p>They&#8217;re pretty harmless, and they don&#8217;t like people or light so they&#8217;re very scared of you and tend to run away.  They&#8217;re not aggressive or dnagerous at all, though they can be dirty and spread disease (apparently).<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve read that they like warmth and moisture (hence initially finding them in our bathroom).  They also like food and we&#8217;ve read that recent research has shown that they leave trails of faeces around so that they can follow each other to the food.<\/p>\n<p>We seemed to find that this was the case.  We were cleaning the floor of our kitchen a lot but still getting them coming into the kitchen.  So, we started cleaning the hallway and other downstairs areas too, that lead from outside doors to the kitchen, and this seemed to reduce their presence in the kitchen.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dealing with them<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/span>As just mentioned, cleanliness helps.  Roaches are omnivorous so will eat whatever&#8217;s around.  Keeping floors clean &#8211; not just around where you&#8217;re finding them, but generally, and especially near entrances, seems to help.<\/p>\n<p>Roaches are quite easy to catch, but hard to kill.  I, personally, don&#8217;t like killing big insects&#8230;I can do the small ones, but stomping on a 3cm-long, crusty cockroach feels too much like really killing something.  Plus, we&#8217;re told that they carry their eggs around so, if you do stomp on them, you often just release the eggs and end up with more of a problem than you started with (though this is probably an urban myth).  Dropping them down drains in the road got rid of them but didn&#8217;t kill them.  The most effective non-crunchy method was drowning &#8211; catch them in a glass or tub, tip them into the loo and flush.  Some of them float, but these can be sent down by placing some toilet paper on top of the roach to make sure it gets dragged down.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p><\/span>In terms of catching them&#8230;we did come across a thing called a &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vegas_roach_trap\">Vegas Roach Trap<\/a>&#8220;, which seemed like a good, organic way to catch the beasties.  Sadly, despite use of the finest coffee grounds on several occasions, we never caught any this way.  Though, this, and other similar methods, are cited in many places.<\/p>\n<p>We ended up going to B&amp;Q and buying some &#8220;Ant and Crawling Insect Killer&#8221;.  This is a bait spray.  The cockroaches find it, eat it and it attacks their nervous system.  This usually means that they go into spasm, flip onto their backs, and then can&#8217;t get up again.  It doesn&#8217;t take effect immediately, and you won&#8217;t get any joy spraying it AT a roach, but if you put it down they&#8217;ll find it and eat it.  You find them in the morning dead, or mostly dead, ready to be caught and flushed down the loo!<\/p>\n<p>The ultimate plan is thus&#8230;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Eradicate them from inside the house: use bait spray (it could take weeks or months to get rid of them)<\/li>\n<li>Stop them coming into the house: again, use bait spray &#8211; around doors and entrances to catch them as they come in from outside.<\/li>\n<li>Take the fight to them outside:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>go out at night and find where they are<\/li>\n<li>spray the insecticide bait down outside<\/li>\n<li>go to sleep<\/li>\n<li>wake up, take your jar or tub outside, and collect up the half-dead critters<\/li>\n<li>flush them away!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We successfully removed them from our house, stopped them coming inside and then caught 14 in one day outside doing this and we&#8217;ve hardly seen any since!!!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Other interesting facts<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/span>Funny what you find when researching these things.  Some people are very interested in roaches.  Some even seem to keep them as pets!!!  One man who knows far too much about them has a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bio.umass.edu\/biology\/kunkel\/cockroach_faq.html\">Cockroach FAQ<\/a> which answers more questions than I could think of, from &#8220;What are cockroaches good for?&#8221; to &#8220;What would cockroach vision be like?&#8221;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><br \/><\/span><\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>For a while now we&#8217;ve had cockroaches in our house!  And I wanted to write up my experiences in case we ever get them again.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cockroach\">Wikipedia article<\/a> is pretty good and has been very helpful.  My experiences are given below.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Finding them<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It started ages ago when I found one in the bath.  I then found another, and then we had little baby ones crawling around the bathroom floor at night.  We eventually got rid of them from the bathroom but then we started finding them in the kitchen (downstairs) and the hallway of our house.<\/p>\n<p>Finding them is not always easy as they only seem to come out at night.  So, you don&#8217;t necessarily know you&#8217;ve got them until too late.  We eventually got rid of ours when we opened the back door late at night and found lots of them scurrying around on the patio.  So if you think you have some living nearby, it&#8217;s a good idea to go scouting with a torch late at night.  Of course, if they&#8217;re inside then they&#8217;re very good at hiding and you&#8217;ll just have to wait until they come out, or get caught somewhere with slippery walls that they can&#8217;t escape.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Living with them<\/span><\/p>\n<p>They&#8217;re pretty harmless, and they don&#8217;t like people or light so they&#8217;re very scared of you and tend to run away.  They&#8217;re not aggressive or dnagerous at all, though they can be dirty and spread disease (apparently).<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve read that they like warmth and moisture (hence initially finding them in our bathroom).  They also like food and we&#8217;ve read that recent research has shown that they leave trails of faeces around so that they can follow each other to the food.<\/p>\n<p>We seemed to find that this was the case.  We were cleaning the floor of our kitchen a lot but still getting them coming into the kitchen.  So, we started cleaning the hallway and other downstairs areas too, that lead from outside doors to the kitchen, and this seemed to reduce their presence in the kitchen.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Dealing with them<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/span>As just mentioned, cleanliness helps.  Roaches are omnivorous so will eat whatever&#8217;s around.  Keeping floors clean &#8211; not just around where you&#8217;re finding them, but generally, and especially near entrances, seems to help.<\/p>\n<p>Roaches are quite easy to catch, but hard to kill.  I, personally, don&#8217;t like killing big insects&#8230;I can do the small ones, but stomping on a 3cm-long, crusty cockroach feels too much like really killing something.  Plus, we&#8217;re told that they carry their eggs around so, if you do stomp on them, you often just release the eggs and end up with more of a problem than you started with (though this is probably an urban myth).  Dropping them down drains in the road got rid of them but didn&#8217;t kill them.  The most effective non-crunchy method was drowning &#8211; catch them in a glass or tub, tip them into the loo and flush.  Some of them float, but these can be sent down by placing some toilet paper on top of the roach to make sure it gets dragged down.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p><\/span>In terms of catching them&#8230;we did come across a thing called a &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vegas_roach_trap\">Vegas Roach Trap<\/a>&#8220;, which seemed like a good, organic way to catch the beasties.  Sadly, despite use of the finest coffee grounds on several occasions, we never caught any this way.  Though, this, and other similar methods, are cited in many places.<\/p>\n<p>We ended up going to B&amp;Q and buying some &#8220;Ant and Crawling Insect Killer&#8221;.  This is a bait spray.  The cockroaches find it, eat it and it attacks their nervous system.  This usually means that they go into spasm, flip onto their backs, and then can&#8217;t get up again.  It doesn&#8217;t take effect immediately, and you won&#8217;t get any joy spraying it AT a roach, but if you put it down they&#8217;ll find it and eat it.  You find them in the morning dead, or mostly dead, ready to be caught and flushed down the loo!<\/p>\n<p>The ultimate plan is thus&#8230;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Eradicate them from inside the house: use bait spray (it could take weeks or months to get rid of them)<\/li>\n<li>Stop them coming into the house: again, use bait spray &#8211; around doors and entrances to catch them as they come in from outside.<\/li>\n<li>Take the fight to them outside:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>go out at night and find where they are<\/li>\n<li>spray the insecticide bait down outside<\/li>\n<li>go to sleep<\/li>\n<li>wake up, take your jar or tub outside, and collect up the half-dead critters<\/li>\n<li>flush them away!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We successfully removed them from our house, stopped them coming inside and then caught 14 in one day outside doing this and we&#8217;ve hardly seen any since!!!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Other interesting facts<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/span>Funny what you find when researching these things.  Some people are very interested in roaches.  Some even seem to keep them as pets!!!  One man who knows far too much about them has a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bio.umass.edu\/biology\/kunkel\/cockroach_faq.html\">Cockroach FAQ<\/a> which answers more questions than I could think of, from &#8220;What are cockroaches good for?&#8221; to &#8220;What would cockroach vision be like?&#8221;<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><br \/><\/span><\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p><!-- Converted from text\/rtf format -->For my birthday, back in June, my sister and her boyfriend offered to take me on a &#8220;Mountain Biking Experience&#8221;.  As someone who&#8217;s got quite into road cycling, but who also loves the great outdoors, mountain biking really appeals, however, you have to have a decent mountain bike before you can even start, and my cheap hybrid really isn&#8217;t up to the job.<\/p>\n<p>So the idea was that they&#8217;d borrow a decent bike from someone, kit me up, and take me out onto some proper off-road terrain.<\/p>\n<p>This weekend, the moment came for the experience!  And I had a wail of a time.  The weather was great, and Sarah, Guy and another friend called Dave, took me out and around a hilly forest near Bracknell.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/album.php?aid=10718&amp;id=561521789\">Photos here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now, as I&#8217;ve got into cycling on my cheap bike, I&#8217;ve been thinking that I might spend some decent money (if Sally will let me) and buy myself a decent machine at some point. Which raises the question &#8211; what sort of bike would I buy?<\/p>\n<p>At one end of the spectrum is a road bike.  The narrow, slick tyres, aerodynamic riding position, and high gearing, all making it easy to travel long and fast.  At the other end is a mountain bike.  I&#8217;ve been recommended against full suspension (looks like more trouble than it&#8217;s worth), so I&#8217;d get front-shocks, a wide range of gearing, an upright riding position, and some big chunky tyres.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there are points along that spectrum.  Cyclocross bikes are racing bikes with a small amount of off-roadness built in &#8211; carbon forks to absorb vibration and less-skinny, and slightly chunky tyres.  Hybrids are basically mountain bike frames with large, narrow wheels.  Or you could do your own customisations, or have two sets of wheels?<\/p>\n<p>A big dilemma.  Of course, the best solution is two decent bikes &#8211; one road, one off-road.  But I don&#8217;t really see this happening. So what do I do?<\/p>\n<p>The mountain biking experience has helped move this decision along somewhat.  Much as I enjoyed it, it&#8217;s a fun, occasional leisure activity.  Road biking is something I can easily do around here during the week, and I can do a longer ride at weekends without having to go anywhere.  It&#8217;s my day-to-day fitness training activity, rather than an occasional fun day out.  I think I&#8217;d get much more mileage out of a road bike and would use it much more often.

        "content": "<p><!-- Converted from text\/rtf format -->For my birthday, back in June, my sister and her boyfriend offered to take me on a &#8220;Mountain Biking Experience&#8221;.  As someone who&#8217;s got quite into road cycling, but who also loves the great outdoors, mountain biking really appeals, however, you have to have a decent mountain bike before you can even start, and my cheap hybrid really isn&#8217;t up to the job.<\/p>\n<p>So the idea was that they&#8217;d borrow a decent bike from someone, kit me up, and take me out onto some proper off-road terrain.<\/p>\n<p>This weekend, the moment came for the experience!  And I had a wail of a time.  The weather was great, and Sarah, Guy and another friend called Dave, took me out and around a hilly forest near Bracknell.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/album.php?aid=10718&amp;id=561521789\">Photos here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now, as I&#8217;ve got into cycling on my cheap bike, I&#8217;ve been thinking that I might spend some decent money (if Sally will let me) and buy myself a decent machine at some point. Which raises the question &#8211; what sort of bike would I buy?<\/p>\n<p>At one end of the spectrum is a road bike.  The narrow, slick tyres, aerodynamic riding position, and high gearing, all making it easy to travel long and fast.  At the other end is a mountain bike.  I&#8217;ve been recommended against full suspension (looks like more trouble than it&#8217;s worth), so I&#8217;d get front-shocks, a wide range of gearing, an upright riding position, and some big chunky tyres.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there are points along that spectrum.  Cyclocross bikes are racing bikes with a small amount of off-roadness built in &#8211; carbon forks to absorb vibration and less-skinny, and slightly chunky tyres.  Hybrids are basically mountain bike frames with large, narrow wheels.  Or you could do your own customisations, or have two sets of wheels?<\/p>\n<p>A big dilemma.  Of course, the best solution is two decent bikes &#8211; one road, one off-road.  But I don&#8217;t really see this happening. So what do I do?<\/p>\n<p>The mountain biking experience has helped move this decision along somewhat.  Much as I enjoyed it, it&#8217;s a fun, occasional leisure activity.  Road biking is something I can easily do around here during the week, and I can do a longer ride at weekends without having to go anywhere.  It&#8217;s my day-to-day fitness training activity, rather than an occasional fun day out.  I think I&#8217;d get much more mileage out of a road bike and would use it much more often.  And I can always hire a mountain bike should I want to.<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;now it&#8217;s just a case of saving the money and finding the right machine!<\/p>\n",

This room is the home of an exercise class called &#8220;RPM&#8221; (TM), which is what most people would call a &#8220;spinning&#8221; class.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been to this class once before a few months ago &#8211; but Sally and I both went along last night.  Her first time, my second.<\/p>\n<p>In theory &#8211; because I like cycling &#8211; this should be my ideal workout.  45 minutes of intense cycling, to the beat of a good selection of music, with simulated time trials, hill climbs, and interval training.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, though Sally really enjoyed it and felt great afterwards, I don&#8217;t like it.  Most people come out of it tired but energised and feeling good.  But, as I did the first time I went, I came out feeling rubbish, and I&#8217;ve still feel pretty rubbish nearly 24 hours later.<\/p>\n<p>Theories for not liking RPM:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I naturally push myself when exercising so having someone else shouting at me to push myself harder still just makes me overdo it.<\/li>\n<li>I generally don&#8217;t like people telling me what to do when I think I know what I&#8217;m doing anyway.<\/li>\n<li>The heat!  I sweat a LOT so being in a crowded room full of people all working at near-maximum power output is quite uncomfortable for me and my body loses a lot of fluid &#8211; maybe that&#8217;s not good for me.<\/li>\n<li>Perhaps I&#8217;m just not used to pushing myself that hard and how it feels afterwards.  Perhaps I&#8217;m worrying about nothing.  Perhaps I should just make sure I eat and drink enough beforehand, and have a proper recovery time afterwards.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I WILL go again.  I was particularly tired yesterday so maybe it was just a bad day to do it.  But overall I&#8217;d much rather be outside &#8211; even in the rain.  Having the countryside whizzing passed, clocking up real miles, wind keeping you cool with real hill climbs and no one shouting at me to &#8220;TURN IT UP!!!&#8221;.  Much nicer.<\/p>\n",

This room is the home of an exercise class called &#8220;RPM&#8221; (TM), which is what most people would call a &#8220;spinning&#8221; class.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been to this class once before a few months ago &#8211; but Sally and I both went along last night.  Her first time, my second.<\/p>\n<p>In theory &#8211; because I like cycling &#8211; this should be my ideal workout.  45 minutes of intense cycling, to the beat of a good selection of music, with simulated time trials, hill climbs, and interval training.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, though Sally really enjoyed it and felt great afterwards, I don&#8217;t like it.  Most people come out of it tired but energised and feeling good.  But, as I did the first time I went, I came out feeling rubbish, and I&#8217;ve still feel pretty rubbish nearly 24 hours later.<\/p>\n<p>Theories for not liking RPM:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I naturally push myself when exercising so having someone else shouting at me to push myself harder still just makes me overdo it.<\/li>\n<li>I generally don&#8217;t like people telling me what to do when I think I know what I&#8217;m doing anyway.<\/li>\n<li>The heat!  I sweat a LOT so being in a crowded room full of people all working at near-maximum power output is quite uncomfortable for me and my body loses a lot of fluid &#8211; maybe that&#8217;s not good for me.<\/li>\n<li>Perhaps I&#8217;m just not used to pushing myself that hard and how it feels afterwards.  Perhaps I&#8217;m worrying about nothing.  Perhaps I should just make sure I eat and drink enough beforehand, and have a proper recovery time afterwards.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I WILL go again.  I was particularly tired yesterday so maybe it was just a bad day to do it.  But overall I&#8217;d much rather be outside &#8211; even in the rain.  Having the countryside whizzing passed, clocking up real miles, wind keeping you cool with real hill climbs and no one shouting at me to &#8220;TURN IT UP!!!&#8221;.  Much nicer.<\/p>\n",

We bought a 6-year old Peugeot 206 when we moved to Swindon.  It&#8217;s actually the second car I&#8217;ve owned but the first one was old enough and small enough to be easily repairable and this second purchase has entered me into the realm of the &#8220;modern&#8221; car.<\/p>\n<p>Initially I had BIG regrets about this as it broke down twice, in quite dangerous situations, in the first couple of months.  When I say broke down I mean that the engine just stopped for no apparent reason.<\/p>\n<p>After MUCH work convincing the garage that there really was something wrong, they finally identified that the intermittent fault was an old relay which, when it go too hot, cut out most of the electrics &#8211; including the spark plugs!  We did get it fixed, and the car has been running fine now for some time.<\/p>\n<p>However &#8211; having just reached our first 10,000 miles it, the engine has developed a nasty rattle which the garage want \u00a3200 just to take apart and diagnose (and then another \u00a3200 to put it back together).  What with MOT&#8217;s and insurance and depreciation and servicing, I&#8217;m starting to question the value of owning a car.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m continuing to cycle and this week&#8217;s mini celebration is that the odometer on my cycle computer says that I finally clocked 1,000 miles.  Only took 9 months, which is pretty rubbish really.  Must start upping my distances!<\/p>\n<p>But that milestone also came at a price too as my bottom bracket disintegrated and the batteries on my cycle computer finally got low on power and needed replacing.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been an expensive month!!!<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s actually the second car I&#8217;ve owned but the first one was old enough and small enough to be easily repairable and this second purchase has entered me into the realm of the &#8220;modern&#8221; car.<\/p>\n<p>Initially I had BIG regrets about this as it broke down twice, in quite dangerous situations, in the first couple of months.  When I say broke down I mean that the engine just stopped for no apparent reason.<\/p>\n<p>After MUCH work convincing the garage that there really was something wrong, they finally identified that the intermittent fault was an old relay which, when it go too hot, cut out most of the electrics &#8211; including the spark plugs!  We did get it fixed, and the car has been running fine now for some time.<\/p>\n<p>However &#8211; having just reached our first 10,000 miles it, the engine has developed a nasty rattle which the garage want \u00a3200 just to take apart and diagnose (and then another \u00a3200 to put it back together).  What with MOT&#8217;s and insurance and depreciation and servicing, I&#8217;m starting to question the value of owning a car.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m continuing to cycle and this week&#8217;s mini celebration is that the odometer on my cycle computer says that I finally clocked 1,000 miles.  Only took 9 months, which is pretty rubbish really.  Must start upping my distances!<\/p>\n<p>But that milestone also came at a price too as my bottom bracket disintegrated and the batteries on my cycle computer finally got low on power and needed replacing.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been an expensive month!!!<\/p>\n",

He suggested the intuitive method (you&#8217;d expect them to be threaded so that they tighten when you pedal) but it doesn&#8217;t work like that.  For reference the RIGHT pedal has a NORMAL thread and the LEFT pedal is backwards.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Unclipping yourself<\/p>\n<p><\/span>I was initially a bit scared of falling off so I went for a ride up and down the alleyway at the back.  Where I learned that I tend to fall off to the left.  So though my brain decided that, because I&#8217;m right footed, I should unclip my right foot first, that also turns out to be counter-intuitive.  Actually, it does make sense if you think about it harder: I use my right foot to &#8220;lead&#8221; when I start pedalling, PLUS, when I stop I normally have the kerb on my left.  So when I stop I naturally remove my left foot and put it down, and I lean left to make that happen.<\/p>\n<p>So, with pedals replaced, brain correctly programmed to unclip left-foot-first, I set out on a short ride and managed not to fall off at all!<\/p>\n<p>My thighs hurt today though &#8211; the action of applying force for the full &#8220;cycle&#8221; of the crank means that you use other muscles&#8230;so more training may be required before I get fully up to speed.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll watch the speeds with interest!<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

For reference the RIGHT pedal has a NORMAL thread and the LEFT pedal is backwards.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Unclipping yourself<\/p>\n<p><\/span>I was initially a bit scared of falling off so I went for a ride up and down the alleyway at the back.  Where I learned that I tend to fall off to the left.  So though my brain decided that, because I&#8217;m right footed, I should unclip my right foot first, that also turns out to be counter-intuitive.  Actually, it does make sense if you think about it harder: I use my right foot to &#8220;lead&#8221; when I start pedalling, PLUS, when I stop I normally have the kerb on my left.  So when I stop I naturally remove my left foot and put it down, and I lean left to make that happen.<\/p>\n<p>So, with pedals replaced, brain correctly programmed to unclip left-foot-first, I set out on a short ride and managed not to fall off at all!<\/p>\n<p>My thighs hurt today though &#8211; the action of applying force for the full &#8220;cycle&#8221; of the crank means that you use other muscles&#8230;so more training may be required before I get fully up to speed.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll watch the speeds with interest!<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>As a bit of a techie I like my gadgets.  I&#8217;m not over the top in this respect, but I like it when technology can improve my life or do something useful.  So when I buy new &#8220;toys&#8221;, I&#8217;ve generally thought quite hard about it.<\/p>\n<p>I really don&#8217;t intend to start making this a &#8220;Gadget Review Blog&#8221;, but when I buy new &#8220;toys&#8221; I&#8217;ll try and say why I bought them and what I think about them in the hope that my thoughts benefit someone else &#8211; or myself at a later date.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Why buy a little MP3 player?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The background to this is that, after much deliberation, I bought a big-proper 30GB Apple iPod about a year ago.  I&#8217;m very pleased with this and it&#8217;s good for long journeys, by train or car, or to give me a day&#8217;s tunes at work.  But, despite being almost miraculously small for what it does, it&#8217;s too big and too fragile to be used when walking, cycling (on quiet roads only of course), or when at the gym.<\/p>\n<p>So, for a while I&#8217;ve been thinking about a cheap, ultra-small, solid-state music player to go alongside it.  For the less-technical, solid-state means that it has no moving parts.  Given that I like iTunes (for reasons I won&#8217;t go into here), an iPod Shuffle seems like the obvious choice &#8211; as it will easily sync to an iTunes playlist (or smart playlist).  It took a while to come around to the idea of a player without a screen, but I can see how it fulfills the need to just shove something in your pocket full of your favourite tunes, and go.  So a Shuffle has been on my shopping list for a while.<\/p>\n<p>THEN, I discovered <a href=\"http:\/\/ita.sourceforge.net\/\">iTunes Agent<\/a>, which is a far-from perfect piece of software, but one which allows you to sync non-Apple devices with iTunes.  This opens up the possibilities a bit more.<\/p>\n<p>Originally I sync&#8217;ed my Sony Ericsson Walkman mobile phone with it, and took that to the gym a few times.  However, the controls on the walkman phone aren&#8217;t great (they get locked out by the phone&#8217;s &#8220;auto-lock&#8221; feature) but then I found the Creative &#8220;Stone&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Stone&#8221; is Creative&#8217;s equivalent of the iPod Shuffle.  It&#8217;s got 1GB capacity, no display, simple controls and ~8 hours battery life.  At around \u00a323, it&#8217;s about half the price of an iPod Shuffle!  Bargain.<\/p>\n<p>So I got one.  Here it is with headphones, close up, and next to some chewing gum for scale!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwonQOpJI\/AAAAAAAAAWo\/nxhCu3eECII\/s1600-h\/DSC00024.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"cursor:pointer;width:177px;height:132px;margin:5px auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwonQOpJI\/AAAAAAAAAWo\/nxhCu3eECII\/s400\/DSC00024.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>     <a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwwnQOpKI\/AAAAAAAAAWw\/SNRXPb07y1k\/s1600-h\/DSC00025.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"cursor:pointer;width:177px;height:133px;margin:5px auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwwnQOpKI\/AAAAAAAAAWw\/SNRXPb07y1k\/s400\/DSC00025.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>     <a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqxnHQOpMI\/AAAAAAAAAXA\/1F_7TcnEjB0\/s1600-h\/DSC00026.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"cursor:pointer;width:178px;height:133px;margin:5px auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqxnHQOpMI\/AAAAAAAAAXA\/1F_7TcnEjB0\/s400\/DSC00026.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Looks pretty.  Looks TINY!!! But does it do the job?<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m happy to say that yes, it does.  It&#8217;s easy to use, sounds good and does everything that it says it does.  I&#8217;ve not had the battery run out on me yet.  It feels sturdy and has survived many hours in my pocket already without much damage.<\/p>\n<p>I could only pick out three odd things, though these are more observations than annoyances.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It can only be charged from a USB port<\/span>.  It comes with a short mini-USB cable to do this, but other charging options would be nice. Having said that, charging is quick and the battery lasts a good while, particularly as it&#8217;s not a device I&#8217;ll use for LONG periods of time.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It takes a while to start up<\/span>.  When you turns it on there&#8217;s about 20 seconds of silence before it does anything.  My guess is that it&#8217;s scanning the files that you&#8217;ve loaded onto it. Fortunately it only does this after a total shutdown.  You can happily pause and restart music and it will only turn completely off if you leave it paused for a long time.<\/li>\n<li>Unlike the iPod Shuffle, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">it doesn&#8217;t have a &#8220;hold&#8221; switch<\/span> &#8211; used to &#8220;lock&#8221; the controls so that you don&#8217;t make accidental <a href=\"void(0)\"><span><\/span><\/a>button presses when the thing is in your pocket.  However, this isn&#8217;t a problem as the buttons are very nicely set up so that they need too much force to press accidentally, but not so much that you can&#8217;t easily use the controls.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Overall, I like my &#8220;Stone&#8221; and I&#8217;m glad I bought it.  It serves a simple purpose and will make many a trip to the gym with me.  I&#8217;d recommend it to someone that wants a simple, cheap, micro-sized media player, and with iTA, you can sync with iTunes and have a &#8220;Shuffle&#8221; equivalent for half the price.<\/p>\n",

So when I buy new &#8220;toys&#8221;, I&#8217;ve generally thought quite hard about it.<\/p>\n<p>I really don&#8217;t intend to start making this a &#8220;Gadget Review Blog&#8221;, but when I buy new &#8220;toys&#8221; I&#8217;ll try and say why I bought them and what I think about them in the hope that my thoughts benefit someone else &#8211; or myself at a later date.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Why buy a little MP3 player?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The background to this is that, after much deliberation, I bought a big-proper 30GB Apple iPod about a year ago.  I&#8217;m very pleased with this and it&#8217;s good for long journeys, by train or car, or to give me a day&#8217;s tunes at work.  But, despite being almost miraculously small for what it does, it&#8217;s too big and too fragile to be used when walking, cycling (on quiet roads only of course), or when at the gym.<\/p>\n<p>So, for a while I&#8217;ve been thinking about a cheap, ultra-small, solid-state music player to go alongside it.  For the less-technical, solid-state means that it has no moving parts.  Given that I like iTunes (for reasons I won&#8217;t go into here), an iPod Shuffle seems like the obvious choice &#8211; as it will easily sync to an iTunes playlist (or smart playlist).  It took a while to come around to the idea of a player without a screen, but I can see how it fulfills the need to just shove something in your pocket full of your favourite tunes, and go.  So a Shuffle has been on my shopping list for a while.<\/p>\n<p>THEN, I discovered <a href=\"http:\/\/ita.sourceforge.net\/\">iTunes Agent<\/a>, which is a far-from perfect piece of software, but one which allows you to sync non-Apple devices with iTunes.  This opens up the possibilities a bit more.<\/p>\n<p>Originally I sync&#8217;ed my Sony Ericsson Walkman mobile phone with it, and took that to the gym a few times.  However, the controls on the walkman phone aren&#8217;t great (they get locked out by the phone&#8217;s &#8220;auto-lock&#8221; feature) but then I found the Creative &#8220;Stone&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Stone&#8221; is Creative&#8217;s equivalent of the iPod Shuffle.  It&#8217;s got 1GB capacity, no display, simple controls and ~8 hours battery life.  At around \u00a323, it&#8217;s about half the price of an iPod Shuffle!  Bargain.<\/p>\n<p>So I got one.  Here it is with headphones, close up, and next to some chewing gum for scale!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwonQOpJI\/AAAAAAAAAWo\/nxhCu3eECII\/s1600-h\/DSC00024.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"cursor:pointer;width:177px;height:132px;margin:5px auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwonQOpJI\/AAAAAAAAAWo\/nxhCu3eECII\/s400\/DSC00024.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>     <a href=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwwnQOpKI\/AAAAAAAAAWw\/SNRXPb07y1k\/s1600-h\/DSC00025.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"cursor:pointer;width:177px;height:133px;margin:5px auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqwwnQOpKI\/AAAAAAAAAWw\/SNRXPb07y1k\/s400\/DSC00025.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>     <a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqxnHQOpMI\/AAAAAAAAAXA\/1F_7TcnEjB0\/s1600-h\/DSC00026.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"cursor:pointer;width:178px;height:133px;margin:5px auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/RoqxnHQOpMI\/AAAAAAAAAXA\/1F_7TcnEjB0\/s400\/DSC00026.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Looks pretty.  Looks TINY!!! But does it do the job?<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m happy to say that yes, it does.  It&#8217;s easy to use, sounds good and does everything that it says it does.  I&#8217;ve not had the battery run out on me yet.  It feels sturdy and has survived many hours in my pocket already without much damage.<\/p>\n<p>I could only pick out three odd things, though these are more observations than annoyances.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It can only be charged from a USB port<\/span>.  It comes with a short mini-USB cable to do this, but other charging options would be nice. Having said that, charging is quick and the battery lasts a good while, particularly as it&#8217;s not a device I&#8217;ll use for LONG periods of time.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">It takes a while to start up<\/span>.  When you turns it on there&#8217;s about 20 seconds of silence before it does anything.  My guess is that it&#8217;s scanning the files that you&#8217;ve loaded onto it. Fortunately it only does this after a total shutdown.  You can happily pause and restart music and it will only turn completely off if you leave it paused for a long time.<\/li>\n<li>Unlike the iPod Shuffle, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">it doesn&#8217;t have a &#8220;hold&#8221; switch<\/span> &#8211; used to &#8220;lock&#8221; the controls so that you don&#8217;t make accidental <a href=\"void(0)\"><span><\/span><\/a>button presses when the thing is in your pocket.  However, this isn&#8217;t a problem as the buttons are very nicely set up so that they need too much force to press accidentally, but not so much that you can&#8217;t easily use the controls.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Overall, I like my &#8220;Stone&#8221; and I&#8217;m glad I bought it.  It serves a simple purpose and will make many a trip to the gym with me.  I&#8217;d recommend it to someone that wants a simple, cheap, micro-sized media player, and with iTA, you can sync with iTunes and have a &#8220;Shuffle&#8221; equivalent for half the price.<\/p>\n",
