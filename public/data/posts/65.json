Booooo!<\/p>\n<p>They seem confined to the loft above our extension and the wall cavities.  After calling the council and hearing that it would take up to 5 working days to get back to us, we put poisoned bait down and this didn&#8217;t initially seem to help.<\/p>\n<p>The man from the council came today though.   He was a very helpful little Yorkshire man, who&#8217;s been doing the job of pest control for about 5 years &#8211; though I sense he could actually &#8220;smell a rat&#8221; if required &#8211; probably at a hundred paces.<\/p>\n<p>He identified where they are probably coming in and out (rats have to get food and water, and there ain&#8217;t none of that in our loft), and put down lots&#8230;LOTS more bait.  We&#8217;ll have to wait and see what happens.  &#8220;They&#8217;re wild animals&#8221;, he said, and their behaviour is not predictable.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, they&#8217;ve chewed our electric cables, tripping out our electricity, and subsequently causing us to have a non-functioning boiler.  No electric, ho heating.<\/p>\n<p>The fuse panel has several fuses and an RCD device.  The RCD was what was tripping and this takes out the whole panel.  Again, after a few phone calls and chats with other people, we worked out that our fuse box is completely incorrectly labelled, ran around the house flicking fuses and switches until we knew which fuse did what, and have isloated the upstairs lighting circuit (which is why we think it&#8217;s caused by the rats nibbling cables).<\/p>\n<p>So, we now have rats, and no upstairs lights, but our heating and other electrics are back on.<\/p>\n<p>If that wasn&#8217;t enough.  I&#8217;ve done my back in (so I&#8217;m off the bike&#8230;AGAIN!), we have a leaky connection at the end of our washing machine inlet hose, which had caused a big puddle to form in our utility room, and our oven broke just before we had 6 people coming for new year (the timer switch, which has to be on for the oven to be on, had burnt out its contacts).<\/p>\n<p>The joys of owning a house!!!  Can 2008 have had a worse start??  (Well, yes, we could be in Kenya, which is in a right state at the moment &#8211; our problems are kinda put into perspective when you watch the news at the moment).<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>So, we thought we had mice in our loft but, after further inspection, a little web research, and discussions with other people about the size of droppings, we&#8217;ve decided we have rats.  Booooo!<\/p>\n<p>They seem confined to the loft above our extension and the wall cavities.  After calling the council and hearing that it would take up to 5 working days to get back to us, we put poisoned bait down and this didn&#8217;t initially seem to help.<\/p>\n<p>The man from the council came today though.   He was a very helpful little Yorkshire man, who&#8217;s been doing the job of pest control for about 5 years &#8211; though I sense he could actually &#8220;smell a rat&#8221; if required &#8211; probably at a hundred paces.<\/p>\n<p>He identified where they are probably coming in and out (rats have to get food and water, and there ain&#8217;t none of that in our loft), and put down lots&#8230;LOTS more bait.  We&#8217;ll have to wait and see what happens.  &#8220;They&#8217;re wild animals&#8221;, he said, and their behaviour is not predictable.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, they&#8217;ve chewed our electric cables, tripping out our electricity, and subsequently causing us to have a non-functioning boiler.  No electric, ho heating.<\/p>\n<p>The fuse panel has several fuses and an RCD device.  The RCD was what was tripping and this takes out the whole panel.  Again, after a few phone calls and chats with other people, we worked out that our fuse box is completely incorrectly labelled, ran around the house flicking fuses and switches until we knew which fuse did what, and have isloated the upstairs lighting circuit (which is why we think it&#8217;s caused by the rats nibbling cables).<\/p>\n<p>So, we now have rats, and no upstairs lights, but our heating and other electrics are back on.<\/p>\n<p>If that wasn&#8217;t enough.  I&#8217;ve done my back in (so I&#8217;m off the bike&#8230;AGAIN!), we have a leaky connection at the end of our washing machine inlet hose, which had caused a big puddle to form in our utility room, and our oven broke just before we had 6 people coming for new year (the timer switch, which has to be on for the oven to be on, had burnt out its contacts).<\/p>\n<p>The joys of owning a house!!!  Can 2008 have had a worse start??  (Well, yes, we could be in Kenya, which is in a right state at the moment &#8211; our problems are kinda put into perspective when you watch the news at the moment).<\/p>\n",

Learn a popular song every week for a year.<\/p>\n<p>There were various discussions about which to do first, but I&#8217;ve decided on Sally&#8217;s suggestion of The Pogues&#8217; &#8220;A Fairytale of New York&#8221;.  Pretty simple music, mostly Gs, Ds and As with a few Bm&#8217;s, but with some interesting words.  It helps that the words kind of tell a story as it&#8217;s easier to remember.<\/p>\n<p>The choice of a male\/female duet may probe interesting too.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve actually spent more time trying to learn the words than the music.  That will have to change.  The problem is that it&#8217;s one of those songs that I&#8217;ve heard a million time and I think I know some of the words from what they sound like.  e.g. I always thought the chorus bit was:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The wise and the unwise singing (something) were singing going (something)&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>when it&#8217;s actually<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The boys of the NYPD choir were singing Galway Bay&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>which makes a LOT more sense.<\/p>\n<p>In other &#8220;52 songs&#8221; news, I&#8217;ve using technology to help me!  I&#8217;ve started downloading some popular tracks from iTunes at 79p each.  I&#8217;m going to create a &#8220;52 songs&#8221; playlist to help me along, and I have a folder for keeping the tabs (guitar chord music) in.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway&#8230;off to learn the music!  Report back &#8211; and a new song! &#8211; at the end of the week.<\/p>\n",

Learn a popular song every week for a year.<\/p>\n<p>There were various discussions about which to do first, but I&#8217;ve decided on Sally&#8217;s suggestion of The Pogues&#8217; &#8220;A Fairytale of New York&#8221;.  Pretty simple music, mostly Gs, Ds and As with a few Bm&#8217;s, but with some interesting words.  It helps that the words kind of tell a story as it&#8217;s easier to remember.<\/p>\n<p>The choice of a male\/female duet may probe interesting too.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve actually spent more time trying to learn the words than the music.  That will have to change.  The problem is that it&#8217;s one of those songs that I&#8217;ve heard a million time and I think I know some of the words from what they sound like.  e.g. I always thought the chorus bit was:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The wise and the unwise singing (something) were singing going (something)&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>when it&#8217;s actually<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The boys of the NYPD choir were singing Galway Bay&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>which makes a LOT more sense.<\/p>\n<p>In other &#8220;52 songs&#8221; news, I&#8217;ve using technology to help me!  I&#8217;ve started downloading some popular tracks from iTunes at 79p each.  I&#8217;m going to create a &#8220;52 songs&#8221; playlist to help me along, and I have a folder for keeping the tabs (guitar chord music) in.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway&#8230;off to learn the music!  Report back &#8211; and a new song! &#8211; at the end of the week.<\/p>\n",

A job well done, even if I STILL have black hands a few hours later.<\/p>\n<p>There was a LOT of crap on my chain and cassette (the cogs) and the deep clean has really made a difference.  Well worth the investment in both cost and time.

We listen to the radio quite a lot and it&#8217;s been annoying us that we get bad reception in the new house.<\/p>\n<p>But DAB radio&#8217;s are expensive and we&#8217;ve questioned the value.  Several of our friends have them though &#8211; a surprising number in fact! &#8211; and with moving out of London meaning we get less access to stations like XFM that we like, we decided to look into them a bit more closely.<\/p>\n<p>I, with my techie hat on, was looking for features.  We like the &#8220;live pause and rewind&#8221; on our Sky+ box, and I was hoping to get that functionality in the radio too &#8211; should be simple enough you would think.  I also wanted to be able to plug an iPod into it &#8211; preferable through a line-in socket.  Sally, with her aesthetics hat on (we&#8217;re a good team) wouldn&#8217;t let me get a cheap, plastic-looking one &#8211; preferring the slightly vintage look of the Pure and Robert&#8217;s models.<\/p>\n<p>We tested the water by getting a cheap (\u00a335) Roberts clock radio.  A lot of our listening is done in bed as we attempt to wake up, so this seemed like a good way to try it out.  And&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I was astonished!<\/p>\n<p>I thought we&#8217;d get poor reception, with it constantly breaking up.  But, no.  DAB, here in Swindon at least, is crystal clear.  We get a good range of stations.  The sound quality is excellent.  And the radios are incredibly easy to use &#8211; I don&#8217;t say that lightly by the way, but you literally plug it in and it works with barely a button press.<\/p>\n<p>We were SO impressed that we almost immediately went to Amazon and spent a lot more money on a Pure Evoke 1S for the kitchen.  Which is equally easy to use, crystal clear, well built, has most of the technical features I wanted (not live pause and rewind &#8211; surprisingly few models had this!), and looks the business.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d happily evangelise DAB radio to anyone.  If you&#8217;re thinking you have reason to switch &#8211; do it!<\/p>\n<p>I still think the receivers aren&#8217;t particularly good value but in this case I&#8217;m happy to pay the premium for being a fairly-early adopter.  Perhaps prices will come down as take-up increases?  Or maybe the signal is sufficiently poor on other places to limit its take up.  I guess only time will tell.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>We&#8217;ve been toying with the idea of digital radio for a while.  We listen to the radio quite a lot and it&#8217;s been annoying us that we get bad reception in the new house.<\/p>\n<p>But DAB radio&#8217;s are expensive and we&#8217;ve questioned the value.  Several of our friends have them though &#8211; a surprising number in fact! &#8211; and with moving out of London meaning we get less access to stations like XFM that we like, we decided to look into them a bit more closely.<\/p>\n<p>I, with my techie hat on, was looking for features.  We like the &#8220;live pause and rewind&#8221; on our Sky+ box, and I was hoping to get that functionality in the radio too &#8211; should be simple enough you would think.  I also wanted to be able to plug an iPod into it &#8211; preferable through a line-in socket.  Sally, with her aesthetics hat on (we&#8217;re a good team) wouldn&#8217;t let me get a cheap, plastic-looking one &#8211; preferring the slightly vintage look of the Pure and Robert&#8217;s models.<\/p>\n<p>We tested the water by getting a cheap (\u00a335) Roberts clock radio.  A lot of our listening is done in bed as we attempt to wake up, so this seemed like a good way to try it out.  And&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I was astonished!<\/p>\n<p>I thought we&#8217;d get poor reception, with it constantly breaking up.  But, no.  DAB, here in Swindon at least, is crystal clear.  We get a good range of stations.  The sound quality is excellent.  And the radios are incredibly easy to use &#8211; I don&#8217;t say that lightly by the way, but you literally plug it in and it works with barely a button press.<\/p>\n<p>We were SO impressed that we almost immediately went to Amazon and spent a lot more money on a Pure Evoke 1S for the kitchen.  Which is equally easy to use, crystal clear, well built, has most of the technical features I wanted (not live pause and rewind &#8211; surprisingly few models had this!), and looks the business.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d happily evangelise DAB radio to anyone.  If you&#8217;re thinking you have reason to switch &#8211; do it!<\/p>\n<p>I still think the receivers aren&#8217;t particularly good value but in this case I&#8217;m happy to pay the premium for being a fairly-early adopter.  Perhaps prices will come down as take-up increases?  Or maybe the signal is sufficiently poor on other places to limit its take up.  I guess only time will tell.<\/p>\n",

Sally got two top-price tickets to the musical Chicago!<\/p>\n<p>Sally loves the film version of this, I quite like it myself, and we both wanted to see it &#8220;Live&#8221;.  So, yesterday, off we went to London (luckily she chose to go with me), for a fun day out.<\/p>\n<p>As part of the present I&#8217;d bought the CD of the soundtrack too.  The film and the CD are, as you would expect highly polished, well produced, with dazzling effects, stunning performances from all the artists, and plenty of razzmatazz and razzle-dazzle.<\/p>\n<p>We love the music, which is lively and varied and really captures the mood of 1920&#8217;s America.<\/p>\n<p>Did the stage show live up to the promise of the film and soundtrack?<\/p>\n<p>Well, yes!  But they we&#8217;re very different.  The show was&#8230;well&#8230;I guess it was more of a show.  It was less polished but it knew that and made up for it by being slightly tongue-in-cheek.  The show girl scene portrayed in the movie as sleazy and sensational, came across in the show as slightly silly &#8211; more Blackpool Pier than Chicago!<\/p>\n<p>The stage was less sophisticated than I was expecting.  It was quite a basic set up but with the band on platforms behind a limited stage space.  The musicians were very prominent and played a big part in the show.  There was even some clever interaction between the cast, the band and the conductor, which worked very well.  The music was brilliant and I thought the band were just as much stars as the cast were.<\/p>\n<p>It was highly entertaining and, while not worthy of a standing ovation, very well performed by some very fit, strong and talented people who can dance, act, sing, climb, and do acrobatics &#8211; usually more than one at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>All in all it was well worth going to see.  The excellent soundtrack (bar the last few tracks which are modern songs &#8220;based on&#8221; the story) will be revived occasionally I&#8217;m sure, but, as is my experience with most musical soundtracks, won&#8217;t be an often-heard CD.  The film, however, will be watched again and again on dull evenings that need a bit of livening up.<\/p>\n",

Sally got two top-price tickets to the musical Chicago!<\/p>\n<p>Sally loves the film version of this, I quite like it myself, and we both wanted to see it &#8220;Live&#8221;.  So, yesterday, off we went to London (luckily she chose to go with me), for a fun day out.<\/p>\n<p>As part of the present I&#8217;d bought the CD of the soundtrack too.  The film and the CD are, as you would expect highly polished, well produced, with dazzling effects, stunning performances from all the artists, and plenty of razzmatazz and razzle-dazzle.<\/p>\n<p>We love the music, which is lively and varied and really captures the mood of 1920&#8217;s America.<\/p>\n<p>Did the stage show live up to the promise of the film and soundtrack?<\/p>\n<p>Well, yes!  But they we&#8217;re very different.  The show was&#8230;well&#8230;I guess it was more of a show.  It was less polished but it knew that and made up for it by being slightly tongue-in-cheek.  The show girl scene portrayed in the movie as sleazy and sensational, came across in the show as slightly silly &#8211; more Blackpool Pier than Chicago!<\/p>\n<p>The stage was less sophisticated than I was expecting.  It was quite a basic set up but with the band on platforms behind a limited stage space.  The musicians were very prominent and played a big part in the show.  There was even some clever interaction between the cast, the band and the conductor, which worked very well.  The music was brilliant and I thought the band were just as much stars as the cast were.<\/p>\n<p>It was highly entertaining and, while not worthy of a standing ovation, very well performed by some very fit, strong and talented people who can dance, act, sing, climb, and do acrobatics &#8211; usually more than one at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>All in all it was well worth going to see.  The excellent soundtrack (bar the last few tracks which are modern songs &#8220;based on&#8221; the story) will be revived occasionally I&#8217;m sure, but, as is my experience with most musical soundtracks, won&#8217;t be an often-heard CD.  The film, however, will be watched again and again on dull evenings that need a bit of livening up.<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s stuff that I&#8217;d like good friends to be able to see, but not stuff that I want the whole world to see.<\/div>\n<p>Truth is that, though there&#8217;s an element of pride in having a set of hopefully interesting\/funny \/useful notes that others can read, I&#8217;m slightly embarassed about it.  Some people recently heard that I had a Blog and all questioned with surprise&#8230;&#8221;you have a blog???&#8221;.  In opening it up to the world, I open myself to the critical eye of the world.<\/p>\n<p>I originally set up my Blog such that people had to be approved as readers.  However, I recently &#8220;imported&#8221; my Blog into my Facebook &#8220;notes&#8221; application &#8211; which meant that people could easily be updated when I post something new, and I really value having RSS feeds of other people&#8217;s Blogs as it makes it easier to stay up to date.  Both of these required me to open up my Blogger RSS feed, which I can only do by opening up the whole Blog to the world.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m nervous about this.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t mind people that I know are nice and won&#8217;t make silly comments reading and commenting but I don&#8217;t think I want everyone to see.  There&#8217;s a security risk in there, and, though I&#8217;m careful about what I write and I make sure I set my Blog up so that search engines aren&#8217;t informed about my posts, I don&#8217;t want all of what I write searchable by Google and so on.<\/p>\n<p>This, though, poses some challenges.<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, I don&#8217;t currently have a way to only allow RSS access to a select group.  I&#8217;ve tried importing my notes into a WordPress setup, but this doesn&#8217;t seem to allow secure RSS feeds either (if such things exist). <\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also pride in knowing who&#8217;s reading too.  I don&#8217;t want to think I&#8217;m big because the world can read my musings and hopefully be entertained by them.  But having control of who can see means I&#8217;m retaining control and I become aware of how popular I am (or am not).  That could work either way.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m challenged about what I&#8217;m writing too.  Why am I nervous about the world seeing it?  Do I not believe it?  Do I not think it&#8217;s interesting\/useful\/funny?  Am I not prepared to stand by what I&#8217;ve written and be identified with it?<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m a bit confused about what to do at the moment.  I think I&#8217;ve turned public access off, but it may be on and off for a while, while I work out what to do.<\/p>\n<p>If anyone IS reading (I know at least one person is), I&#8217;d appreciate your comments and thoughts.<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s stuff that I&#8217;d like good friends to be able to see, but not stuff that I want the whole world to see.<\/div>\n<p>Truth is that, though there&#8217;s an element of pride in having a set of hopefully interesting\/funny \/useful notes that others can read, I&#8217;m slightly embarassed about it.  Some people recently heard that I had a Blog and all questioned with surprise&#8230;&#8221;you have a blog???&#8221;.  In opening it up to the world, I open myself to the critical eye of the world.<\/p>\n<p>I originally set up my Blog such that people had to be approved as readers.  However, I recently &#8220;imported&#8221; my Blog into my Facebook &#8220;notes&#8221; application &#8211; which meant that people could easily be updated when I post something new, and I really value having RSS feeds of other people&#8217;s Blogs as it makes it easier to stay up to date.  Both of these required me to open up my Blogger RSS feed, which I can only do by opening up the whole Blog to the world.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m nervous about this.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t mind people that I know are nice and won&#8217;t make silly comments reading and commenting but I don&#8217;t think I want everyone to see.  There&#8217;s a security risk in there, and, though I&#8217;m careful about what I write and I make sure I set my Blog up so that search engines aren&#8217;t informed about my posts, I don&#8217;t want all of what I write searchable by Google and so on.<\/p>\n<p>This, though, poses some challenges.<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, I don&#8217;t currently have a way to only allow RSS access to a select group.  I&#8217;ve tried importing my notes into a WordPress setup, but this doesn&#8217;t seem to allow secure RSS feeds either (if such things exist). <\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also pride in knowing who&#8217;s reading too.  I don&#8217;t want to think I&#8217;m big because the world can read my musings and hopefully be entertained by them.  But having control of who can see means I&#8217;m retaining control and I become aware of how popular I am (or am not).  That could work either way.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m challenged about what I&#8217;m writing too.  Why am I nervous about the world seeing it?  Do I not believe it?  Do I not think it&#8217;s interesting\/useful\/funny?  Am I not prepared to stand by what I&#8217;ve written and be identified with it?<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m a bit confused about what to do at the moment.  I think I&#8217;ve turned public access off, but it may be on and off for a while, while I work out what to do.<\/p>\n<p>If anyone IS reading (I know at least one person is), I&#8217;d appreciate your comments and thoughts.<\/p>\n",

He&#8217;s a musician and has lots of musical friends, so part of the party was there was a PA and some musical instruments set up and a thrown-together band that played some well known party songs.<\/p>\n<p>This was MOST entertaining, particularly the random, unrehearsed singalong at the end of the evening.<\/p>\n<p>It gave me the (crazy, stupid) idea of having a new years resolution to learn a popular song each week.  I&#8217;ve been playing guitar for about 8 years now and don&#8217;t know many pop songs by heart, this would be a good way to learn.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I never really thought I&#8217;d do it.  But Sally&#8217;s gone and bought me some chord books of pop songs for Christmas, so I guess I have to.<\/p>\n<p>I doubt I&#8217;ll make one per week, but I&#8217;ll start a new thread here and maybe use it to keep people posted on how I&#8217;m getting on (if at all).  Maybe this is a good way to be accountable and have people suggest songs too.  If you&#8217;re one of my limited readership, feel free to post comments or email me suggestions\/ideas.<\/p>\n<p>Thoughts turn to what the first few songs might be.  &#8220;Love me do&#8221; by the Beatles is a good choice as it REALLY is three chords and has simple words. Though Robbie Williams&#8217; &#8220;Angels&#8221; may also be a good start as I sort-of learnt it before.  Or maybe a Christmas song&#8230;especially as I&#8217;ve been playing LOTS on Christmas Carol services at church of late.<\/p>\n<p>An update sometime soon&#8230;I hope.<\/p>\n",

He&#8217;s a musician and has lots of musical friends, so part of the party was there was a PA and some musical instruments set up and a thrown-together band that played some well known party songs.<\/p>\n<p>This was MOST entertaining, particularly the random, unrehearsed singalong at the end of the evening.<\/p>\n<p>It gave me the (crazy, stupid) idea of having a new years resolution to learn a popular song each week.  I&#8217;ve been playing guitar for about 8 years now and don&#8217;t know many pop songs by heart, this would be a good way to learn.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I never really thought I&#8217;d do it.  But Sally&#8217;s gone and bought me some chord books of pop songs for Christmas, so I guess I have to.<\/p>\n<p>I doubt I&#8217;ll make one per week, but I&#8217;ll start a new thread here and maybe use it to keep people posted on how I&#8217;m getting on (if at all).  Maybe this is a good way to be accountable and have people suggest songs too.  If you&#8217;re one of my limited readership, feel free to post comments or email me suggestions\/ideas.<\/p>\n<p>Thoughts turn to what the first few songs might be.  &#8220;Love me do&#8221; by the Beatles is a good choice as it REALLY is three chords and has simple words. Though Robbie Williams&#8217; &#8220;Angels&#8221; may also be a good start as I sort-of learnt it before.  Or maybe a Christmas song&#8230;especially as I&#8217;ve been playing LOTS on Christmas Carol services at church of late.<\/p>\n<p>An update sometime soon&#8230;I hope.<\/p>\n",

His writing was one of the things that inspired me to take up my own note taking here, but the quality and entertainment value of his posts is far greater than mine.<\/p>\n<p>Links:<br \/> &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/maclure.blogspot.com\/\">Maps and Legends: Dave Maclure&#8217;s Blog<\/a><br \/> &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/maclure.blogspot.com\/2007\/12\/things-i-miss-about-england-100-weather.html\">The specific post I commented on<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;<br \/>In response to &#8220;Things I love about Brazil #25: informal dress codes&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m still reading and still enjoying your writing.

I was in a business meeting with a supplier. The guys from the supplier company were both wearing suits. But us as &#8220;supply-ees&#8221; were, at best, smart casual. (In amusing contrast, someone had bought along some Chuppa Chupps lollipops, so we were all sat there eating kids&#8217; candy&#8230;in suits&#8230;bizzare)<\/p>\n<p>It reminded me that I hate wearing suits. I feel like a fraud in them. It&#8217;s not who I am. But I am pretty clean-cut, and I find myself frowning at people who dress really scruffily. And yet, that&#8217;s who they are. They&#8217;d feel like a fraud wearing what I wear. I don&#8217;t wear suits, but I AM a clothing snob!<\/p>\n<p>Brazil sounds like the kind of place where you can just be yourself. Whereas in England we&#8217;re forced to dress certain ways at certain times. I wonder why that is and what it achieves?<\/p>\n<p>Hmmm&#8230;<\/p>\n",

Hope you don&#8217;t mind. I particularly like your random numbering of &#8220;things I miss&#8230;things I love&#8230;&#8221;!!<\/p>\n<p>I was thinking about dress codes the other day. I was in a business meeting with a supplier. The guys from the supplier company were both wearing suits. But us as &#8220;supply-ees&#8221; were, at best, smart casual. (In amusing contrast, someone had bought along some Chuppa Chupps lollipops, so we were all sat there eating kids&#8217; candy&#8230;in suits&#8230;bizzare)<\/p>\n<p>It reminded me that I hate wearing suits. I feel like a fraud in them. It&#8217;s not who I am. But I am pretty clean-cut, and I find myself frowning at people who dress really scruffily. And yet, that&#8217;s who they are. They&#8217;d feel like a fraud wearing what I wear. I don&#8217;t wear suits, but I AM a clothing snob!<\/p>\n<p>Brazil sounds like the kind of place where you can just be yourself. Whereas in England we&#8217;re forced to dress certain ways at certain times. I wonder why that is and what it achieves?<\/p>\n<p>Hmmm&#8230;<\/p>\n",
