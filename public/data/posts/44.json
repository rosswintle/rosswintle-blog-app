                "rendered": "<p>As someone who both cares about issues of poverty and justice, and who works in the charity sector &#8211; and in particular, the campaigning sector &#8211; I am on quite a lot of campaigning email lists.<\/p>\n<p>And it feels like lately the number of \u2019email your MP\u2019 campaigns has increased.  I don&#8217;t feel like I can take all of the actions I get, and so I end up ignoring most of them, and probably missing something that I consider really important.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been thinking about making my own campaigning more focused: choosing one or two causes or charities, and making sure that I&#8217;m signed up and take action for those causes.  But&#8230;which ones to choose?<\/p>\n<p>I was reading the latest issue of Tearfund&#8217;s newsletter, &#8216;Tear Times\u2019 over Christmas, and an article on the issue of hunger really caught my eye.<\/p>\n<p>Hunger affects one in every seven people on the planet. 925 million people go to bed hungry tonight. It&#8217;s a massive issue that causes so much pain and suffering.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also constantly troubled by the issue of water and sanitation.<\/p>\n<p>Food and water are two things that I totally take for granted. I have vastly more than I need of both, and I can&#8217;t imagine what life is like without them.<\/p>\n<p>The causes of hunger include climate change, corruption, and greed.<\/p>\n<p>The impact of hunger, water and sanitation reaches into issues of health, education, crime, street children and general poverty.<\/p>\n<p>So to fix it, we need to tackle lots of other things. But fixing it helps improve lots of other things too.<\/p>\n<p>However, I also think it&#8217;s a fixable issue. With better trade and distribution, and with training, tools and technologies, we can feed everyone on the planet.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have stats and facts for all of those things, but that all seems pretty obvious to me.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, there are things wrong in our country: with energy and transport policy, with the tax system, with corporate greed, with banking, with privatisation.<\/p>\n<p>There are big global problems too: trade issues, climate change, debt, war, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>But these things just don&#8217;t seem important when you consider that there are people who don&#8217;t have food to eat or water to drink.<\/p>\n<p>From what I read, Tearfund and a group of other charities are putting together some new campaigning around hunger for 2013.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to focus my campaigning there. I&#8217;m going to write to my MP about hunger. I&#8217;m going to send whatever postcards or letters I get to whatever people in power seem important on the issue.<\/p>\n<p>I will pray, I will give, I will read and I will share.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps you&#8217;ll join me?<\/p>\n<p>The plans for 2013 don&#8217;t seem to be firm yet, but <a href=\u201dhttp:\/\/www.tearfund.org\/en\/get_involved\/campaign\/hunger\/\u201d>here&#8217;s an action you can start with<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m going to focus my support on Tearfund. As a Christian, I support the foundations and basis of their work and I like that its a charity I can connect with at a spiritual as well as practical level.  I know them well and I&#8217;m privileged to do some bits of  <\/p>\n<p>work for them. I think their approach to aid and development is effective and sustainable. I believe in what they&#8217;re doing and I trust them.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t care for or support other charities or campaigns. I just think that my campaigning energy is better if its focused rather than diluted.  Of course I&#8217;ll stay up to date with other organisations and campaigns, but hunger and water will be my focus, and Tearfund will be my charity if choice.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s to a great year of focused campaigning!  I&#8217;ll try and keep you updated.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>As someone who both cares about issues of poverty and justice, and who works in the charity sector &#8211; and in particular, the campaigning sector &#8211; I am on quite a lot of campaigning email lists.<\/p>\n<p>And it feels like lately the number of \u2019email your MP\u2019 campaigns has increased.  I don&#8217;t feel like I can take all of the actions I get, and so I end up ignoring most of them, and probably missing something that I consider really important.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been thinking about making my own campaigning more focused: choosing one or two causes or charities, and making sure that I&#8217;m signed up and take action for those causes.  But&#8230;which ones to choose?<\/p>\n<p>I was reading the latest issue of Tearfund&#8217;s newsletter, &#8216;Tear Times\u2019 over Christmas, and an article on the issue of hunger really caught my eye.<\/p>\n<p>Hunger affects one in every seven people on the planet. 925 million people go to bed hungry tonight. It&#8217;s a massive issue that causes so much pain and suffering.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also constantly troubled by the issue of water and sanitation.<\/p>\n<p>Food and water are two things that I totally take for granted. I have vastly more than I need of both, and I can&#8217;t imagine what life is like without them.<\/p>\n<p>The causes of hunger include climate change, corruption, and greed.<\/p>\n<p>The impact of hunger, water and sanitation reaches into issues of health, education, crime, street children and general poverty.<\/p>\n<p>So to fix it, we need to tackle lots of other things. But fixing it helps improve lots of other things too.<\/p>\n<p>However, I also think it&#8217;s a fixable issue. With better trade and distribution, and with training, tools and technologies, we can feed everyone on the planet.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have stats and facts for all of those things, but that all seems pretty obvious to me.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, there are things wrong in our country: with energy and transport policy, with the tax system, with corporate greed, with banking, with privatisation.<\/p>\n<p>There are big global problems too: trade issues, climate change, debt, war, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>But these things just don&#8217;t seem important when you consider that there are people who don&#8217;t have food to eat or water to drink.<\/p>\n<p>From what I read, Tearfund and a group of other charities are putting together some new campaigning around hunger for 2013.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to focus my campaigning there. I&#8217;m going to write to my MP about hunger. I&#8217;m going to send whatever postcards or letters I get to whatever people in power seem important on the issue.<\/p>\n<p>I will pray, I will give, I will read and I will share.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps you&#8217;ll join me?<\/p>\n<p>The plans for 2013 don&#8217;t seem to be firm yet, but <a href=\u201dhttp:\/\/www.tearfund.org\/en\/get_involved\/campaign\/hunger\/\u201d>here&#8217;s an action you can start with<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m going to focus my support on Tearfund. As a Christian, I support the foundations and basis of their work and I like that its a charity I can connect with at a spiritual as well as practical level.  I know them well and I&#8217;m privileged to do some bits of  <\/p>\n<p>work for them. I think their approach to aid and development is effective and sustainable. I believe in what they&#8217;re doing and I trust them.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t care for or support other charities or campaigns. I just think that my campaigning energy is better if its focused rather than diluted.  Of course I&#8217;ll stay up to date with other organisations and campaigns, but hunger and water will be my focus, and Tearfund will be my charity if choice.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s to a great year of focused campaigning!  I&#8217;ll try and keep you updated.<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s been a while&#8230;again.<\/p>\n<p>This is really an extended Tweet which makes idea blog post material.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve not been cycling much lately. A combination of working from home and not really having any spare time due to running a business and being a dad. But I still love my bike and my cycling and think getting more people cycling would be a great idea for a whole load of reasons.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been following The Times&#8217; &#8216;Cities Fit for Cycling&#8217; campaign and the All Party Parliamentary Cycling Group&#8217;s &#8216;<a href=\"http:\/\/allpartycycling.org\">Get Britain Cycling<\/a>&#8216;<br \/>\nInquiry and the <a href=\"http:\/\/allpartycycling.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/get-britain-cycling_goodwin-report.pdf\">subsequent report<\/a>, published a few days ago.<\/p>\n<p>I confess I&#8217;ve not read the report but the headlines seem to be a recommendation to get 10% of journeys made by bike by 2025 and at least \u00a310 per person per year of the transport budget spent by the government on cycling.<\/p>\n<p>This sounds to me like seriously good stuff. If would ease congestion, make people fitter and healthier leading to a more healthy workforce and less strain on the NHS, reduce road maintenance and building costs, improve road safety for all, reduce carbon emissions, boost bike manufacturing and sales in the UK, and lead to a greater service industry around cycling. So many good things.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thetimes.co.uk\/tto\/public\/cyclesafety\/article3749149.ece\">not just me that thinks so<\/a>.  Lord Sugar, Barclays Bank, Sainsburys, the Confederation of British Industry and a whole load of others think this is a good idea.<\/p>\n<p>The president of the AA said: \u201cImplementation of the Get Britain Cycling recommendations would bring tangible business and economic benefits by reducing congestion, absenteeism, NHS costs and by producing a more creative and active workforce.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses said that more people cycling to work would help &#8220;both the health of the high street as well as the nation&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I simply don&#8217;t see how anyone can argue that the &#8216;reduced congestion, environmental benefits and healthier citizens&#8217; that the APPCG claim as benefits would be good for our nation.  This is the conclusion of an all-party parliamentary inquiry with extensive evidence from over 100 individuals and organisations.<\/p>\n<p>So, whether you walk, cycle, get the bus, or drive to work, school, college, or wherever. Or even if, like me, you simply stagger down the landing in your pyjamas to start your day, can I point you at <a href=\"http:\/\/epetitions.direct.gov.uk\/petitions\/49196\">this petition<\/a> to get the government to pay attention to the recommendations of the report.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Hello blog. It&#8217;s been a while&#8230;again.<\/p>\n<p>This is really an extended Tweet which makes idea blog post material.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve not been cycling much lately. A combination of working from home and not really having any spare time due to running a business and being a dad. But I still love my bike and my cycling and think getting more people cycling would be a great idea for a whole load of reasons.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been following The Times&#8217; &#8216;Cities Fit for Cycling&#8217; campaign and the All Party Parliamentary Cycling Group&#8217;s &#8216;<a href=\"http:\/\/allpartycycling.org\">Get Britain Cycling<\/a>&#8216;<br \/>\nInquiry and the <a href=\"http:\/\/allpartycycling.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/get-britain-cycling_goodwin-report.pdf\">subsequent report<\/a>, published a few days ago.<\/p>\n<p>I confess I&#8217;ve not read the report but the headlines seem to be a recommendation to get 10% of journeys made by bike by 2025 and at least \u00a310 per person per year of the transport budget spent by the government on cycling.<\/p>\n<p>This sounds to me like seriously good stuff. If would ease congestion, make people fitter and healthier leading to a more healthy workforce and less strain on the NHS, reduce road maintenance and building costs, improve road safety for all, reduce carbon emissions, boost bike manufacturing and sales in the UK, and lead to a greater service industry around cycling. So many good things.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thetimes.co.uk\/tto\/public\/cyclesafety\/article3749149.ece\">not just me that thinks so<\/a>.  Lord Sugar, Barclays Bank, Sainsburys, the Confederation of British Industry and a whole load of others think this is a good idea.<\/p>\n<p>The president of the AA said: \u201cImplementation of the Get Britain Cycling recommendations would bring tangible business and economic benefits by reducing congestion, absenteeism, NHS costs and by producing a more creative and active workforce.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses said that more people cycling to work would help &#8220;both the health of the high street as well as the nation&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I simply don&#8217;t see how anyone can argue that the &#8216;reduced congestion, environmental benefits and healthier citizens&#8217; that the APPCG claim as benefits would be good for our nation.  This is the conclusion of an all-party parliamentary inquiry with extensive evidence from over 100 individuals and organisations.<\/p>\n<p>So, whether you walk, cycle, get the bus, or drive to work, school, college, or wherever. Or even if, like me, you simply stagger down the landing in your pyjamas to start your day, can I point you at <a href=\"http:\/\/epetitions.direct.gov.uk\/petitions\/49196\">this petition<\/a> to get the government to pay attention to the recommendations of the report.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>A little while ago there was some discussion on Twitter about cycling in Swindon.  It started from a question asked by whoever was running the PeopleOfSwindon account that week, and we got onto the topic of Swindon&#8217;s cycle paths.<\/p>\n<p>The following observation was made:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">@Surfseekerdin &#8211; public cycle paths seem extensive, though I don&#39;t cycle, what&#39;s wrong with them ?<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; People of Swindon (@PeopleofSwindon) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PeopleofSwindon\/status\/322004517199679489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 10, 2013<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>To which I replied:<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/322008765815717889<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/322009335804866562<\/p>\n<p>and one of our local councillors asked more, and I replied that, to see what&#8217;s wrong with the new Wichelstowe road, he should hop on a bike and cycle it end-to-end.  I then offered to take him on a guided tour.<\/p>\n<p>What I actually did was go and record a video tour.<\/p>\n<p>Now&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>In this video, I&#8217;m slightly over-egging my reaction to the complexities and absurdities I encounter en-route. I&#8217;m playing the hammed-up cycle campaigner and come across as much grumpier and more confused than I probably really am.<\/p>\n<p>And I willingly acknowledge that this path is incomplete and that it may all make sense once the rest of the Wichelstowe development is created.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;I think that this road and the facilities it has for cyclists is typical of the UK&#8217;s cycle infrastructure in general:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cyclists are forced to stop and start frequently<\/li>\n<li>There&#8217;s no continuity of the journey &#8211; you are directed <strong>around<\/strong> everything else, rather than having your own route <strong>through<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>The signposting is bad<\/li>\n<li>In some places things are over-engineered and highly confusing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This was a brand new road to a brand new housing estate <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wichelstowe.co.uk\/Home\/Media-Centre\/Press-release-archive\/10\">that promised to<\/a> &#8216;set new standards of urban design, sustainability and modal shift in transportation away from the private car.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>It represented an opportunity to do something bold, different, and challenging that would demonstrate real thought for cyclists. Instead it&#8217;s a broken, confused piece of infrastructure that hinders the cyclists progress to such an extent that it&#8217;s quicker and easier just to hop onto the road for most of it.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, when reflecting on the tour, it seemed to me that to make cyclists cross the road, choose to share with buses or pedestrians, and then cross back again is the main cause of all the problems. Simply extending the existing path all the way along the northern side of the road would have been so much simpler.<\/p>\n<p>So here it is&#8230;The Grumpy Cyclists guide to cycling the new Wichelstowe road.<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6tSfWscDicQ<\/p>\n",

It started from a question asked by whoever was running the PeopleOfSwindon account that week, and we got onto the topic of Swindon&#8217;s cycle paths.<\/p>\n<p>The following observation was made:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">@Surfseekerdin &#8211; public cycle paths seem extensive, though I don&#39;t cycle, what&#39;s wrong with them ?<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; People of Swindon (@PeopleofSwindon) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PeopleofSwindon\/status\/322004517199679489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 10, 2013<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>To which I replied:<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/322008765815717889<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\/status\/322009335804866562<\/p>\n<p>and one of our local councillors asked more, and I replied that, to see what&#8217;s wrong with the new Wichelstowe road, he should hop on a bike and cycle it end-to-end.  I then offered to take him on a guided tour.<\/p>\n<p>What I actually did was go and record a video tour.<\/p>\n<p>Now&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>In this video, I&#8217;m slightly over-egging my reaction to the complexities and absurdities I encounter en-route. I&#8217;m playing the hammed-up cycle campaigner and come across as much grumpier and more confused than I probably really am.<\/p>\n<p>And I willingly acknowledge that this path is incomplete and that it may all make sense once the rest of the Wichelstowe development is created.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;I think that this road and the facilities it has for cyclists is typical of the UK&#8217;s cycle infrastructure in general:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cyclists are forced to stop and start frequently<\/li>\n<li>There&#8217;s no continuity of the journey &#8211; you are directed <strong>around<\/strong> everything else, rather than having your own route <strong>through<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>The signposting is bad<\/li>\n<li>In some places things are over-engineered and highly confusing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This was a brand new road to a brand new housing estate <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wichelstowe.co.uk\/Home\/Media-Centre\/Press-release-archive\/10\">that promised to<\/a> &#8216;set new standards of urban design, sustainability and modal shift in transportation away from the private car.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>It represented an opportunity to do something bold, different, and challenging that would demonstrate real thought for cyclists. Instead it&#8217;s a broken, confused piece of infrastructure that hinders the cyclists progress to such an extent that it&#8217;s quicker and easier just to hop onto the road for most of it.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, when reflecting on the tour, it seemed to me that to make cyclists cross the road, choose to share with buses or pedestrians, and then cross back again is the main cause of all the problems. Simply extending the existing path all the way along the northern side of the road would have been so much simpler.<\/p>\n<p>So here it is&#8230;The Grumpy Cyclists guide to cycling the new Wichelstowe road.<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6tSfWscDicQ<\/p>\n",

Some people have done some really creative things with it and the 6-second limit kinda forces you to be creative. It reminds me of the early days of Twitter where people were really creative with what they could do in 140 chars.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;you can probably tell by the tone of my voice&#8230;I don&#8217;t really get it. The app is really clever in how it lets you record and do animation and so on, but I just haven&#8217;t taken to it. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s that 6 seconds is too short, or if its the looping that means you don&#8217;t get to dwell on the message, or if it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m not a visual person and I simply don&#8217;t &#8216;get it&#8217;. Or some or all three of those.<\/p>\n<p>What I have really taken to is a little app called &#8216;<a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/gb\/app\/takes\/id605815535?mt=8\">Takes<\/a>&#8216;. Takes rolls video while you line up a photo and then, at the point at which you take the photo, it saves a snapshot of video from around the time you took the photo. The app uses information from your smartphone&#8217;s movement sensors to decide how long the video clip should be. The app then lets you select video snippets and stitches them together, with an optional soundtrack, for you.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, the uses are totally different to that of Vine, the still photos it takes aren&#8217;t great, and the pre-loaded soundtracks are cheesey, but for me, Takes is a magic way of making little documentary videos.<\/p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s a little video of some ducks on our decking on holiday to show you what it does, followed by one of our trip to the aquarium (yes, I made the mistake of doing most of this in portrait&#8230;sorry!)<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Decking Ducks\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ErHEbxK79u0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"At the aquarium\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Lbb__9temtY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Lots of people have been taking up the new Vine app that lets you record 6 second videos and gotten really enthusiastic about it. Some people have done some really creative things with it and the 6-second limit kinda forces you to be creative. It reminds me of the early days of Twitter where people were really creative with what they could do in 140 chars.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;you can probably tell by the tone of my voice&#8230;I don&#8217;t really get it. The app is really clever in how it lets you record and do animation and so on, but I just haven&#8217;t taken to it. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s that 6 seconds is too short, or if its the looping that means you don&#8217;t get to dwell on the message, or if it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m not a visual person and I simply don&#8217;t &#8216;get it&#8217;. Or some or all three of those.<\/p>\n<p>What I have really taken to is a little app called &#8216;<a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/gb\/app\/takes\/id605815535?mt=8\">Takes<\/a>&#8216;. Takes rolls video while you line up a photo and then, at the point at which you take the photo, it saves a snapshot of video from around the time you took the photo. The app uses information from your smartphone&#8217;s movement sensors to decide how long the video clip should be. The app then lets you select video snippets and stitches them together, with an optional soundtrack, for you.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, the uses are totally different to that of Vine, the still photos it takes aren&#8217;t great, and the pre-loaded soundtracks are cheesey, but for me, Takes is a magic way of making little documentary videos.<\/p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s a little video of some ducks on our decking on holiday to show you what it does, followed by one of our trip to the aquarium (yes, I made the mistake of doing most of this in portrait&#8230;sorry!)<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Decking Ducks\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ErHEbxK79u0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"At the aquarium\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Lbb__9temtY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n",
