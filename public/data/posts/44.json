                "rendered": "<p>I feel like I grumble a lot about some of the positive things that are going on with fighting climate change.\u00a0 I suppose my frustration comes from the fact that I see little bits of progress, but no one&#8217;s really willing to go out on a limb and make the big commitment, to say &#8220;Actually, this is REALLY important so lets make some sacrifices and do what we have to do to really tackle it&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So,two little bits of climate change news which have struck me in the last few days.\u00a0 But first, a revelation.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Fossil Fuels<\/h3>\n<p>You know, it never occurred to me that the term &#8220;fossil fuels&#8221; contained the word &#8220;fossil&#8221; and that this is hugely significant.\u00a0 Our fuels are the ancient remains of dead trees and plants.\u00a0 All that carbon was once living matter.\u00a0 And what gives fossil fuels their potency is that this is carbon that has accumulated over millions of years.<\/p>\n<p>And we&#8217;re releasing all that carbon by burning it.\u00a0 Millions of years worth of carbon taken out of the air, suddenly being put back into the air in a (relatively) VERY short space of time.<\/p>\n<p>And it will take millions of years to sink it all back into the ground again.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll let you make up your own mind whether this is a good idea or not.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;ve not tied these things together before, but it reinforces in my mind lots of things about our energy sources.<\/p>\n<h3>Energy Price Fears<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Fear of Steep Energy Bill Rises\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/business\/8297882.stm\" target=\"_blank\">This article<\/a>&#8216;s headline and opening paragraph caught my attention because the answer seems to simple.\u00a0 Energy prices rise?\u00a0 Well invest in energy efficiency!\u00a0 I don&#8217;t understand why people don&#8217;t get this.<\/p>\n<p>We import gas and oil, both of which will, eventually, run out, or become difficult to get hold of.\u00a0 Our supply of these things is by no means guaranteed, so if we wish to sustain any sort of economy, we must invest in becoming a self-sustaining nation.\u00a0 If we reduce consumption now we will be able to pay more per-energy unit to fund investment in sustainable solutions.\u00a0 If we have growing sustainable energy production then we both fight climate change and become more energy-secure. It&#8217;s win-win, if not win-win-win.\u00a0\u00a0 So why aren&#8217;t we getting on a doing it?<\/p>\n<h3>The Copenhagen Communiqu\u00e9<\/h3>\n<p>When I first read the Copenhagen Communiqu\u00e9 I was incensed at the seeming hypocrisy of it.\u00a0 More than 500 big companies, many multi-nationals, signing a request for the UN to put in place a climate change framework.\u00a0 Companies including BAA, BA, Air France, EasyJet, BP and Royal Dutch Shell.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, seriously?<\/p>\n<p>I can see what they&#8217;re trying to do.\u00a0 They&#8217;re saying &#8220;we&#8217;ve got the money and power to make big change, but we&#8217;ll only do it if the UN make conditions favourable for us to do it&#8221; (at least, that&#8217;s my reading of it).<\/p>\n<p>I like the Communiqu\u00e9&#8217;s holistic approach: developing and developed countries; adaptation frameworks for the poorest countries; halting deforestation.\u00a0 But it lacks something!<\/p>\n<p>Yes&#8230;it lacks any sort of commitment from the companies themselves.\u00a0 It looks, to me, too much like these companies are putting the onus on the governments and the developing countries without wanting to do much themselves.\u00a0 They want conditions that make it easy for them to survive.<\/p>\n<p>Of course I agree with the call for &#8220;an ambitions, robust and equitable global deal on climate change&#8221;, but it&#8217;s just something else that&#8217;s not enough&#8230;the big companies have to do their bit too and I don&#8217;t see that happening.\u00a0 If they think it&#8217;s so important, if they think it&#8217;s needed for the future why aren&#8217;t they leading the way?\u00a0 What right do they have to be lobbying the UN if their own house isn&#8217;t in, or getting in, order?\u00a0 And what are they going to when the UN turn around and ask for their help?<\/p>\n<p>Yes, I feel like a grumble guts.\u00a0 I like seeing progress on climate change, but I want MORE.\u00a0 More from our governments, more from the UN, more from big businesses, more from developed and developing countries, more aid, more targets, more investment.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t see a future without it.<\/p>\n<h3>P.S.<\/h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s one other little thing I wanted to mention on this topic.<\/p>\n<p>We were down in Devon lately and we visited a working water mill that powered tools used in a blacksmiths (Finch Foundry, if you&#8217;re wondering).<\/p>\n<p>It was incredible when the demonstrator pulled a leaver, the water was released, the wheel turned and this huge machinery came to life.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll never get all of our power from water, but seeing this simple, free, sustainable, green form of energy in use just got me thinking about how microgeneration could contribute.\u00a0 Perhaps it would do us all some good if we knew exactly where our energy came from!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I feel like I grumble a lot about some of the positive things that are going on with fighting climate change.\u00a0 I suppose my frustration comes from the fact that I see little bits of progress, but no one&#8217;s really willing to go out on a limb and make the big commitment, to say &#8220;Actually, this is REALLY important so lets make some sacrifices and do what we have to do to really tackle it&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So,two little bits of climate change news which have struck me in the last few days.\u00a0 But first, a revelation.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Fossil Fuels<\/h3>\n<p>You know, it never occurred to me that the term &#8220;fossil fuels&#8221; contained the word &#8220;fossil&#8221; and that this is hugely significant.\u00a0 Our fuels are the ancient remains of dead trees and plants.\u00a0 All that carbon was once living matter.\u00a0 And what gives fossil fuels their potency is that this is carbon that has accumulated over millions of years.<\/p>\n<p>And we&#8217;re releasing all that carbon by burning it.\u00a0 Millions of years worth of carbon taken out of the air, suddenly being put back into the air in a (relatively) VERY short space of time.<\/p>\n<p>And it will take millions of years to sink it all back into the ground again.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll let you make up your own mind whether this is a good idea or not.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;ve not tied these things together before, but it reinforces in my mind lots of things about our energy sources.<\/p>\n<h3>Energy Price Fears<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Fear of Steep Energy Bill Rises\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/business\/8297882.stm\" target=\"_blank\">This article<\/a>&#8216;s headline and opening paragraph caught my attention because the answer seems to simple.\u00a0 Energy prices rise?\u00a0 Well invest in energy efficiency!\u00a0 I don&#8217;t understand why people don&#8217;t get this.<\/p>\n<p>We import gas and oil, both of which will, eventually, run out, or become difficult to get hold of.\u00a0 Our supply of these things is by no means guaranteed, so if we wish to sustain any sort of economy, we must invest in becoming a self-sustaining nation.\u00a0 If we reduce consumption now we will be able to pay more per-energy unit to fund investment in sustainable solutions.\u00a0 If we have growing sustainable energy production then we both fight climate change and become more energy-secure. It&#8217;s win-win, if not win-win-win.\u00a0\u00a0 So why aren&#8217;t we getting on a doing it?<\/p>\n<h3>The Copenhagen Communiqu\u00e9<\/h3>\n<p>When I first read the Copenhagen Communiqu\u00e9 I was incensed at the seeming hypocrisy of it.\u00a0 More than 500 big companies, many multi-nationals, signing a request for the UN to put in place a climate change framework.\u00a0 Companies including BAA, BA, Air France, EasyJet, BP and Royal Dutch Shell.<\/p>\n<p>I mean, seriously?<\/p>\n<p>I can see what they&#8217;re trying to do.\u00a0 They&#8217;re saying &#8220;we&#8217;ve got the money and power to make big change, but we&#8217;ll only do it if the UN make conditions favourable for us to do it&#8221; (at least, that&#8217;s my reading of it).<\/p>\n<p>I like the Communiqu\u00e9&#8217;s holistic approach: developing and developed countries; adaptation frameworks for the poorest countries; halting deforestation.\u00a0 But it lacks something!<\/p>\n<p>Yes&#8230;it lacks any sort of commitment from the companies themselves.\u00a0 It looks, to me, too much like these companies are putting the onus on the governments and the developing countries without wanting to do much themselves.\u00a0 They want conditions that make it easy for them to survive.<\/p>\n<p>Of course I agree with the call for &#8220;an ambitions, robust and equitable global deal on climate change&#8221;, but it&#8217;s just something else that&#8217;s not enough&#8230;the big companies have to do their bit too and I don&#8217;t see that happening.\u00a0 If they think it&#8217;s so important, if they think it&#8217;s needed for the future why aren&#8217;t they leading the way?\u00a0 What right do they have to be lobbying the UN if their own house isn&#8217;t in, or getting in, order?\u00a0 And what are they going to when the UN turn around and ask for their help?<\/p>\n<p>Yes, I feel like a grumble guts.\u00a0 I like seeing progress on climate change, but I want MORE.\u00a0 More from our governments, more from the UN, more from big businesses, more from developed and developing countries, more aid, more targets, more investment.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t see a future without it.<\/p>\n<h3>P.S.<\/h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s one other little thing I wanted to mention on this topic.<\/p>\n<p>We were down in Devon lately and we visited a working water mill that powered tools used in a blacksmiths (Finch Foundry, if you&#8217;re wondering).<\/p>\n<p>It was incredible when the demonstrator pulled a leaver, the water was released, the wheel turned and this huge machinery came to life.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll never get all of our power from water, but seeing this simple, free, sustainable, green form of energy in use just got me thinking about how microgeneration could contribute.\u00a0 Perhaps it would do us all some good if we knew exactly where our energy came from!<\/p>\n",

They&#8217;re friendly, honest and do a good deal. \u00a0In the past they&#8217;ve done most repairs same-day too. \u00a0I&#8217;ve never had a reason not to go there. They shall remain nameless for now.<\/p>\n<p>I took the wheel in on Tuesday and was told it wouldn&#8217;t be ready until Friday at 4pm. \u00a0Hmm..OK. \u00a0Not hugely impressed but the fact that they&#8217;re busy is good right? \u00a0Means more bikes are in use! \u00a0Win!<\/p>\n<p>Friday at 3:15pm, I call them to check that it&#8217;ll be ready. \u00a0There&#8217;s some conversation and some scrabbling around and I&#8217;m told it&#8217;ll be ready by 4 as promised. \u00a0I was not so convinced.<\/p>\n<p>The wheel was ready by 4, but I wasn&#8217;t sure they&#8217;d done much to it. \u00a0I paid up and left half-satisfied.<\/p>\n<p>Then the front-wheel started making similar noises. \u00a0I decided to try somewhere new.<\/p>\n<p>The Big Adventure Store (I will name them as they&#8217;re excellent!) is a small shop for running, cycling, triathlon and adventure racing gear, with a bike clinic to boot!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the right side of town, open &#8217;til 7pm 4 days a week and run by people who really know their stuff. \u00a0It&#8217;s a little expensive and I was originally nervous about going there because I felt a little intimidated.<\/p>\n<p>But, can I say, their bike guy is superb! \u00a0He not only clearly demonstrated that he&#8217;d properly serviced my wheel by describing the damage done to the cones and talking about replacing the bearings and grease, but he went the extra mile by tightening up the spokes and cleaning the rims and hub. \u00a0And for only a couple of pounds more.<\/p>\n<p>I have a new favourite bike shop!<\/p>\n<p>The Big Adventure Store was also busy and took several days to turn the work around.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s great news that Swindon&#8217;s bike shops are busy, but annoying that that busyness means that work is being rushed and that I have to wait to have work done. \u00a0Perhaps we need a new bike shop?! \u00a0Any takers?<\/p>\n",

They&#8217;re friendly, honest and do a good deal. \u00a0In the past they&#8217;ve done most repairs same-day too. \u00a0I&#8217;ve never had a reason not to go there. They shall remain nameless for now.<\/p>\n<p>I took the wheel in on Tuesday and was told it wouldn&#8217;t be ready until Friday at 4pm. \u00a0Hmm..OK. \u00a0Not hugely impressed but the fact that they&#8217;re busy is good right? \u00a0Means more bikes are in use! \u00a0Win!<\/p>\n<p>Friday at 3:15pm, I call them to check that it&#8217;ll be ready. \u00a0There&#8217;s some conversation and some scrabbling around and I&#8217;m told it&#8217;ll be ready by 4 as promised. \u00a0I was not so convinced.<\/p>\n<p>The wheel was ready by 4, but I wasn&#8217;t sure they&#8217;d done much to it. \u00a0I paid up and left half-satisfied.<\/p>\n<p>Then the front-wheel started making similar noises. \u00a0I decided to try somewhere new.<\/p>\n<p>The Big Adventure Store (I will name them as they&#8217;re excellent!) is a small shop for running, cycling, triathlon and adventure racing gear, with a bike clinic to boot!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the right side of town, open &#8217;til 7pm 4 days a week and run by people who really know their stuff. \u00a0It&#8217;s a little expensive and I was originally nervous about going there because I felt a little intimidated.<\/p>\n<p>But, can I say, their bike guy is superb! \u00a0He not only clearly demonstrated that he&#8217;d properly serviced my wheel by describing the damage done to the cones and talking about replacing the bearings and grease, but he went the extra mile by tightening up the spokes and cleaning the rims and hub. \u00a0And for only a couple of pounds more.<\/p>\n<p>I have a new favourite bike shop!<\/p>\n<p>The Big Adventure Store was also busy and took several days to turn the work around.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s great news that Swindon&#8217;s bike shops are busy, but annoying that that busyness means that work is being rushed and that I have to wait to have work done. \u00a0Perhaps we need a new bike shop?! \u00a0Any takers?<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ve tried to flesh it out into something that may be of interest to others.<\/p>\n<h3>A geek&#8217;s dilemma<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s probably quite clear that I&#8217;m a bit of a geek.  In fact I&#8217;ve already proudly annouced this fact at least twice here.  And one of the things about being a geek (of the computer kind) is that you discover lots of useful software tools for doing computery-type things.<\/p>\n<p>Some of these things aren&#8217;t useful for the everyday person.  I wouldn&#8217;t expect my average reader to care about <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/01\/10\/tools-of-the-trade\/\">subversion, vi or X<\/a> because you don&#8217;t do the sorts of tasks that those tools are designed to help with.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the tools are useful to non-geeks, but require some investment in learning about new technologies or concepts.\u00a0 Perhaps something like an RSS Feed Reader would come into this category.\u00a0 Some people jump at the idea of using a new tool to do something useful.\u00a0 Others take an &#8220;it ain&#8217;t broken so don&#8217;t fix it&#8221; approach.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the tools are not obviously useful in that they don&#8217;t let you do anything new or different &#8211; but they are &#8220;important&#8221;.\u00a0 Things like virus checkers, firewalls, and other security tools fit this category.<\/p>\n<p>And some of the tools are quick, simple little things, or incredibly useful things and you&#8217;ll wonder why you don&#8217;t know about them already (or perhaps you already do).<\/p>\n<p>This post is a little list of things that I&#8217;ve found useful as a computer user, making his way around the internet and sharing things with his friends as he does so.<\/p>\n<p>Not all of them fit into the last category, but I offer them for, as I said, both my own future reference and for the information of any readers.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Avast and AVG<\/h3>\n<p>Most virus software comes with updated for a year and I used to have a policy of buying new virus software within the last 3 months (when it started nagging me that the updates were running out). \u00a0There was almost always something for sale in WHSmith for half price.<\/p>\n<p>But most of the major anti-virus vendors sell huge packages full of software, most of which you don&#8217;t need, and some of which has, in my experience, broken other bits of software.<\/p>\n<p>So I started looking for something that was more light-weight &#8211; JUST a virus scanner.<\/p>\n<p>And it turns out there are some free ones around. \u00a0I&#8217;ve given both <a title=\"AVG Free\" href=\"http:\/\/free.avg.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">AVG Free<\/a> and <a title=\"Avast Home Edition Anti-Virus\" href=\"http:\/\/www.avast.com\/eng\/download-avast-home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Avast<\/a> a go and have had no problems with either. \u00a0Why pay?<\/p>\n<h3>Internet Link Tools<\/h3>\n<p>As you float around the Internet and surf the vast oceans of information that are out there, occasionally you come across things that you want to remember for later, or to send on to others.<\/p>\n<p>There are many ways of doing these things, but two that I use a lot are bit.ly and Delicious.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bit.ly<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Bit.ly\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/bit.ly<\/a> is a URL shortener. \u00a0This takes a long internet link like, say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><a title=\"BBC News: Barack Obama Wins Nobel Peace Prize\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/americas\/8299824.stm\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/americas\/8299824.stm<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a title=\"BBC News: Barack Obama Wins Nobel Peace Prize\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/americas\/8299824.stm\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a>and shortens it to something like<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><a title=\"BBC News: Barack Wins Nobel Peace Prize, via bit.ly\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2t8Oua\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/2t8Oua<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Why is this useful? \u00a0Well, mostly if you want to share a link when you&#8217;re constrained by the length of your message &#8211; like with Twitter where you can only use 140 characters. \u00a0But you could send links like this in SMS or emails.<\/p>\n<p>To make life quick and easy there are &#8220;bookmarklets&#8221; and plug-ins that let you get one-click buttons for shortening links.<\/p>\n<p>There are LOADS of link shortening services but bit.ly offers plenty more. \u00a0If it&#8217;s not taken already you can use your own reference for the link. It wouldn&#8217;t let me shorten this link to news about Obama&#8217;s Nobel prize to ObNob, but it would let me use <a title=\"BBC News: Obama Wins Nobel Prize\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/0bNob\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/0bNob<\/a><\/p>\n<p>And it tracks stats too&#8230;so if you&#8217;re running a marketing campaign and don&#8217;t have tools that will let you track who&#8217;s clicked on links that you&#8217;ve sent, bit.ly will tell you how many times the shortened link is clicked.<\/p>\n<p>A quick warning &#8211; when you shortened link you don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s going. It could go somewhere bad! \u00a0You can check the destination of a bit.ly link by adding a &#8220;+&#8221; to the end; e.g. <a title=\"Link Info\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/0bNob+\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/0bNob+<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Delicious<\/h3>\n<p>Do you ever, while browsing the internet, come across something &#8211; \u00a0say, a news article or a knitting pattern, or a nice bike &#8211; that you want to remember and recall, but you don&#8217;t want to clog up your browser bookmarks?<\/p>\n<p>I use a tool called Delicious for this. \u00a0It&#8217;s a &#8220;social bookmarking&#8221; tool&#8230;don&#8217;t get scared&#8230;it allows you to set up a user account and install a bookmarklet (a little button) or a browser plug in that lets you save stuff like this for later use.<\/p>\n<p>You can &#8220;tag&#8221; links to help you remember them. \u00a0So you could tag my Obama getting his Nobel Prize artical with the terms &#8220;obama, nobel, prize, news&#8221; and then use those tags to recall the article later.<\/p>\n<p>Then, when you think &#8220;Ah, didn&#8217;t I see a nice commuter bike the other day?&#8221;, you can <a title=\"Search Delicious for Bike and Commuter\" href=\"http:\/\/delicious.com\/rwintle\/bike+commuter\" target=\"_blank\">search for bike and commuter<\/a> tags and find it!<\/p>\n<p>Bookmarks can be shared too (this happens by default), so you can search for links that other people have tagged. \u00a0Here&#8217;s the <a title=\"Search Delicious for Bike and Commuter\" href=\"http:\/\/delicious.com\/tag\/bike+commuter\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;bike + commuter&#8221; list<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To top it all, there&#8217;s a great plug in for Firefox (see below) which makes saving and recall links easy!<\/p>\n<h3>Firefox\/Chrome<\/h3>\n<p>I suspect that if you&#8217;re reading my blog you&#8217;re probably a fairly advanced internet used. \u00a0But maybe not. \u00a0In which case, let me say a little about the tool that you use to browse the internet.<\/p>\n<p>Most people will use Internet Explorer (the big blue &#8220;e&#8221;) to get to the Internet. \u00a0But a lot of people would argue that this isn&#8217;t the best way.<\/p>\n<p>There are other free programs that do what Internet Explorer does, and they do it much better.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Firefox\" href=\"http:\/\/www.mozilla-europe.org\/en\/firefox\/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox<\/a> has been around for a while and, while I find it slow to start up, it&#8217;s quick once it gets going and has lots of options and a great plug-in system that makes it do more stuff (read about some of the plug-ins that I use below).<\/p>\n<p>I depend on it for most of my internet access both at home and at work because it&#8217;s fast and flexible.<\/p>\n<p>Google have recently released a web browser too, called <a title=\"Google Chrome\" href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/chrome\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome<\/a>. \u00a0It&#8217;s lightning fast, but still quite new on the scene so it doesn&#8217;t do quite as much as Firefox, but it will improve quickly.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a Mac user then you&#8217;re probably happy with Safari but Firefox is also available for you and will, with the right plug-ins handily syncronise your data with Firefox running on another computer.<\/p>\n<p>Installing a new program may sound a bit scary, but these things are hard to break and I encourage you to give them a try and check out the help pages and tutorials that show you what they do.<\/p>\n<h3>Firefox Add-Ons<\/h3>\n<p>Firefox does lots when you first install it, but people have written little <a title=\"Firefox Add Ons\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/\" target=\"_blank\">add-on bits<\/a> for it that make it do more. \u00a0Here are some that I use.<\/p>\n<h4>Fire Gestures<\/h4>\n<p>Gestures debuted in the Opera Web Browser which is also still around). \u00a0They allow you to move around the internet more easily with just a mouse. \u00a0A gesture usually involves holding down a mouse button and &#8220;swiping&#8221; the mouse in a direction to do something. \u00a0For example, holding down the right mouse button and moving the mouse left goes &#8220;back&#8221; (like clicking the big left arrow button).<\/p>\n<p>This can save you time and lots of mouse movement.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"FireGestures\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/6366\" target=\"_blank\">Fire Gestures<\/a> brings this to Firefox and it works a treat. \u00a0I get confused now when I CAN&#8217;T use gestures&#8230;why doesn&#8217;t it work?<\/p>\n<h4>Foxmarks\/XMarks<\/h4>\n<p>All web browsers have favourites, or bookmarks; places to store links that you go to often. \u00a0But a lot of people these days have more than one computer, so it would be handy to have the same lists of bookmarks on each computer.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"XMarks - Bookmark Sync and Search\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xmarks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">XMarks<\/a> (previously known as Foxmarks) does this; it synchronises your lists of bookmarks across different computers and broswers.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s clever, works without you really knowing it&#8217;s there, you can get to your bookmarks by going to a web page (e.g. if you&#8217;re in an internet cafe and can&#8217;t install the add-on), and you can even have &#8220;profiles&#8221; to keep your work and leisure bookmarks separate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gui:Config<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As the name might suggest, probably not for the average user, but <a title=\"GUI:Config add on\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/5523\" target=\"_blank\">this add on<\/a> gives you a whole extra load of settings for changing how the browser works<\/p>\n<h4>NoScript<\/h4>\n<p>A lot of the clever stuff that you can do on the Internet these days is accomplished using scripts &#8211; small bits of code that are downloaded from the internet and run on your computer.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with this is that people can write nasty scripts that do stuff that you don&#8217;t want.<\/p>\n<p>Again, don&#8217;t get scared. \u00a0For the average internet user this doesn&#8217;t happen much.<\/p>\n<p>What <a title=\"NoScript\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/722\" target=\"_blank\">NoScript<\/a> does is it blocks scripts from any sites that you haven&#8217;t approved. \u00a0This is highly annoying at first while you &#8220;whitelist&#8221; all the things that you actually need to be able to do. \u00a0But once you&#8217;ve been through that process you&#8217;re a fair bit safer than you were.<\/p>\n<p>Blocking scripts can also:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove adverts and automatically-appearing videos and sounds.<\/li>\n<li>Prevent you being redirected to nasty web sites.<\/li>\n<li>Prevent your visits being registered by sites which track visits<\/li>\n<li>Give you an insight into where all these scripts come from.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t essential security, but useful extra protection if you can spend some time working it out.<\/p>\n<h4>URLBarExt<\/h4>\n<p>Again, for more advanced users. \u00a0I&#8217;m not entirely convinced of its use just yet, but it adds a load of extra little icons to the address bar (aka the &#8220;Awesome Bar&#8221;) at the top of the browser.<\/p>\n<p>My favourite is the link shortener.<\/p>\n<p><em>[Advanced user note and note to self:<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>If you have a bit.ly API key you can configure the shortener to use a URL like: <\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>http:\/\/api.bit.ly\/shorten?version=2.0.1&amp;login=&lt;login&gt;&amp;apiKey=&lt;apiKey&gt;&amp;history=1&amp;longUrl=<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>and a filter like:<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>\\&#8221;shortUrl\\&#8221;: \\&#8221;(.+)\\&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>to have all shortened links tracked in your bit.ly account]<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>Other Add-Ons<\/h4>\n<p>Other add-ons I use are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Compact Menu 2\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/4550\" target=\"_blank\">Compact Menu 2<\/a> &#8211; reduces the menu bar to a single icon with a drop-down menu system &#8211; great for saving screen space and especially great for use on a NetBook with a small screen.<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Delicious Bookmarks Addon\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/3615\" target=\"_blank\">Delicious Bookmarks<\/a> &#8211; plug in for Delicious bookmarks mentioned above.<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Feedly\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/8538\" target=\"_blank\">Feedly<\/a> &#8211; if you use Google Reader you MUST check this out &#8211; it&#8217;s a magazine-style layout for your Google Reader items. \u00a0Brilliant!<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Tab Mix Plus\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/1122\" target=\"_blank\">Tab Mix Plus<\/a> &#8211; almost-essential new options for using tabs.<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"EchoFon\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/5081\" target=\"_blank\">EchoFon<\/a> (was Twitterfox) &#8211; neat and unobtrusive Twitter gadget for Firefox.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Firefox Keyword Searches<\/h3>\n<p>One final note on Firefox before I shut up. Firefox has the ability to use &#8220;keywords&#8221; for searches. \u00a0This means that you can things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;amazon the da vinci code&#8221; to go straight to Amazon results for &#8220;the da vinci code&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;ebay food processor&#8221; to find food processors on ebay<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You get the idea.<\/p>\n<p>But these are also customisable. \u00a0So if there&#8217;s a site that you search a lot, set up a key word for it. \u00a0It&#8217;s usually enough just to find the text box where you type your search, right-click in it and select &#8220;Add a Keyword for this search&#8221;. \u00a0This is all described in more detail <a title=\"Mozillazine - Keyword Searches\" href=\"http:\/\/kb.mozillazine.org\/Using_keyword_searches\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Combined with the fact that pressing Ctrl-L on the keyboard takes you to the bar and you can do quick and easy searches without even using the mouse!<\/p>\n<h3>Summing Up<\/h3>\n<p>I like to think I&#8217;m a pretty advanced web user but I don&#8217;t know the half of what&#8217;s out there. I get lots of tips from the <a title=\"Lifehacker Blog\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lifehacker.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">LifeHacker Blog<\/a> and from people on Twitter who know more than I.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not entirely happy that I pitched this post at the right technical level. \u00a0Man, you could run week-long courses on this stuff. \u00a0Remember it was mostly notes to self, but hopefully there&#8217;s something useful for someone else too.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d encourage you not to be content with a half-hearted internet-browsing experience! \u00a0If you&#8217;re a novice, feel free to use the comments to ask me more. \u00a0Or perhaps you&#8217;d like to share a tip or two of your own&#8230;be my guest.<\/p>\n<p>Happy Browsing!<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;ve tried to flesh it out into something that may be of interest to others.<\/p>\n<h3>A geek&#8217;s dilemma<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s probably quite clear that I&#8217;m a bit of a geek.  In fact I&#8217;ve already proudly annouced this fact at least twice here.  And one of the things about being a geek (of the computer kind) is that you discover lots of useful software tools for doing computery-type things.<\/p>\n<p>Some of these things aren&#8217;t useful for the everyday person.  I wouldn&#8217;t expect my average reader to care about <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/01\/10\/tools-of-the-trade\/\">subversion, vi or X<\/a> because you don&#8217;t do the sorts of tasks that those tools are designed to help with.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the tools are useful to non-geeks, but require some investment in learning about new technologies or concepts.\u00a0 Perhaps something like an RSS Feed Reader would come into this category.\u00a0 Some people jump at the idea of using a new tool to do something useful.\u00a0 Others take an &#8220;it ain&#8217;t broken so don&#8217;t fix it&#8221; approach.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the tools are not obviously useful in that they don&#8217;t let you do anything new or different &#8211; but they are &#8220;important&#8221;.\u00a0 Things like virus checkers, firewalls, and other security tools fit this category.<\/p>\n<p>And some of the tools are quick, simple little things, or incredibly useful things and you&#8217;ll wonder why you don&#8217;t know about them already (or perhaps you already do).<\/p>\n<p>This post is a little list of things that I&#8217;ve found useful as a computer user, making his way around the internet and sharing things with his friends as he does so.<\/p>\n<p>Not all of them fit into the last category, but I offer them for, as I said, both my own future reference and for the information of any readers.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Avast and AVG<\/h3>\n<p>Most virus software comes with updated for a year and I used to have a policy of buying new virus software within the last 3 months (when it started nagging me that the updates were running out). \u00a0There was almost always something for sale in WHSmith for half price.<\/p>\n<p>But most of the major anti-virus vendors sell huge packages full of software, most of which you don&#8217;t need, and some of which has, in my experience, broken other bits of software.<\/p>\n<p>So I started looking for something that was more light-weight &#8211; JUST a virus scanner.<\/p>\n<p>And it turns out there are some free ones around. \u00a0I&#8217;ve given both <a title=\"AVG Free\" href=\"http:\/\/free.avg.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">AVG Free<\/a> and <a title=\"Avast Home Edition Anti-Virus\" href=\"http:\/\/www.avast.com\/eng\/download-avast-home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Avast<\/a> a go and have had no problems with either. \u00a0Why pay?<\/p>\n<h3>Internet Link Tools<\/h3>\n<p>As you float around the Internet and surf the vast oceans of information that are out there, occasionally you come across things that you want to remember for later, or to send on to others.<\/p>\n<p>There are many ways of doing these things, but two that I use a lot are bit.ly and Delicious.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bit.ly<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Bit.ly\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/bit.ly<\/a> is a URL shortener. \u00a0This takes a long internet link like, say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><a title=\"BBC News: Barack Obama Wins Nobel Peace Prize\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/americas\/8299824.stm\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/americas\/8299824.stm<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a title=\"BBC News: Barack Obama Wins Nobel Peace Prize\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/americas\/8299824.stm\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a>and shortens it to something like<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><a title=\"BBC News: Barack Wins Nobel Peace Prize, via bit.ly\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2t8Oua\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/2t8Oua<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Why is this useful? \u00a0Well, mostly if you want to share a link when you&#8217;re constrained by the length of your message &#8211; like with Twitter where you can only use 140 characters. \u00a0But you could send links like this in SMS or emails.<\/p>\n<p>To make life quick and easy there are &#8220;bookmarklets&#8221; and plug-ins that let you get one-click buttons for shortening links.<\/p>\n<p>There are LOADS of link shortening services but bit.ly offers plenty more. \u00a0If it&#8217;s not taken already you can use your own reference for the link. It wouldn&#8217;t let me shorten this link to news about Obama&#8217;s Nobel prize to ObNob, but it would let me use <a title=\"BBC News: Obama Wins Nobel Prize\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/0bNob\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/0bNob<\/a><\/p>\n<p>And it tracks stats too&#8230;so if you&#8217;re running a marketing campaign and don&#8217;t have tools that will let you track who&#8217;s clicked on links that you&#8217;ve sent, bit.ly will tell you how many times the shortened link is clicked.<\/p>\n<p>A quick warning &#8211; when you shortened link you don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;s going. It could go somewhere bad! \u00a0You can check the destination of a bit.ly link by adding a &#8220;+&#8221; to the end; e.g. <a title=\"Link Info\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/0bNob+\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/bit.ly\/0bNob+<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Delicious<\/h3>\n<p>Do you ever, while browsing the internet, come across something &#8211; \u00a0say, a news article or a knitting pattern, or a nice bike &#8211; that you want to remember and recall, but you don&#8217;t want to clog up your browser bookmarks?<\/p>\n<p>I use a tool called Delicious for this. \u00a0It&#8217;s a &#8220;social bookmarking&#8221; tool&#8230;don&#8217;t get scared&#8230;it allows you to set up a user account and install a bookmarklet (a little button) or a browser plug in that lets you save stuff like this for later use.<\/p>\n<p>You can &#8220;tag&#8221; links to help you remember them. \u00a0So you could tag my Obama getting his Nobel Prize artical with the terms &#8220;obama, nobel, prize, news&#8221; and then use those tags to recall the article later.<\/p>\n<p>Then, when you think &#8220;Ah, didn&#8217;t I see a nice commuter bike the other day?&#8221;, you can <a title=\"Search Delicious for Bike and Commuter\" href=\"http:\/\/delicious.com\/rwintle\/bike+commuter\" target=\"_blank\">search for bike and commuter<\/a> tags and find it!<\/p>\n<p>Bookmarks can be shared too (this happens by default), so you can search for links that other people have tagged. \u00a0Here&#8217;s the <a title=\"Search Delicious for Bike and Commuter\" href=\"http:\/\/delicious.com\/tag\/bike+commuter\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;bike + commuter&#8221; list<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To top it all, there&#8217;s a great plug in for Firefox (see below) which makes saving and recall links easy!<\/p>\n<h3>Firefox\/Chrome<\/h3>\n<p>I suspect that if you&#8217;re reading my blog you&#8217;re probably a fairly advanced internet used. \u00a0But maybe not. \u00a0In which case, let me say a little about the tool that you use to browse the internet.<\/p>\n<p>Most people will use Internet Explorer (the big blue &#8220;e&#8221;) to get to the Internet. \u00a0But a lot of people would argue that this isn&#8217;t the best way.<\/p>\n<p>There are other free programs that do what Internet Explorer does, and they do it much better.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Firefox\" href=\"http:\/\/www.mozilla-europe.org\/en\/firefox\/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox<\/a> has been around for a while and, while I find it slow to start up, it&#8217;s quick once it gets going and has lots of options and a great plug-in system that makes it do more stuff (read about some of the plug-ins that I use below).<\/p>\n<p>I depend on it for most of my internet access both at home and at work because it&#8217;s fast and flexible.<\/p>\n<p>Google have recently released a web browser too, called <a title=\"Google Chrome\" href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/chrome\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome<\/a>. \u00a0It&#8217;s lightning fast, but still quite new on the scene so it doesn&#8217;t do quite as much as Firefox, but it will improve quickly.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a Mac user then you&#8217;re probably happy with Safari but Firefox is also available for you and will, with the right plug-ins handily syncronise your data with Firefox running on another computer.<\/p>\n<p>Installing a new program may sound a bit scary, but these things are hard to break and I encourage you to give them a try and check out the help pages and tutorials that show you what they do.<\/p>\n<h3>Firefox Add-Ons<\/h3>\n<p>Firefox does lots when you first install it, but people have written little <a title=\"Firefox Add Ons\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/\" target=\"_blank\">add-on bits<\/a> for it that make it do more. \u00a0Here are some that I use.<\/p>\n<h4>Fire Gestures<\/h4>\n<p>Gestures debuted in the Opera Web Browser which is also still around). \u00a0They allow you to move around the internet more easily with just a mouse. \u00a0A gesture usually involves holding down a mouse button and &#8220;swiping&#8221; the mouse in a direction to do something. \u00a0For example, holding down the right mouse button and moving the mouse left goes &#8220;back&#8221; (like clicking the big left arrow button).<\/p>\n<p>This can save you time and lots of mouse movement.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"FireGestures\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/6366\" target=\"_blank\">Fire Gestures<\/a> brings this to Firefox and it works a treat. \u00a0I get confused now when I CAN&#8217;T use gestures&#8230;why doesn&#8217;t it work?<\/p>\n<h4>Foxmarks\/XMarks<\/h4>\n<p>All web browsers have favourites, or bookmarks; places to store links that you go to often. \u00a0But a lot of people these days have more than one computer, so it would be handy to have the same lists of bookmarks on each computer.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"XMarks - Bookmark Sync and Search\" href=\"http:\/\/www.xmarks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">XMarks<\/a> (previously known as Foxmarks) does this; it synchronises your lists of bookmarks across different computers and broswers.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s clever, works without you really knowing it&#8217;s there, you can get to your bookmarks by going to a web page (e.g. if you&#8217;re in an internet cafe and can&#8217;t install the add-on), and you can even have &#8220;profiles&#8221; to keep your work and leisure bookmarks separate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gui:Config<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As the name might suggest, probably not for the average user, but <a title=\"GUI:Config add on\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/5523\" target=\"_blank\">this add on<\/a> gives you a whole extra load of settings for changing how the browser works<\/p>\n<h4>NoScript<\/h4>\n<p>A lot of the clever stuff that you can do on the Internet these days is accomplished using scripts &#8211; small bits of code that are downloaded from the internet and run on your computer.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with this is that people can write nasty scripts that do stuff that you don&#8217;t want.<\/p>\n<p>Again, don&#8217;t get scared. \u00a0For the average internet user this doesn&#8217;t happen much.<\/p>\n<p>What <a title=\"NoScript\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/722\" target=\"_blank\">NoScript<\/a> does is it blocks scripts from any sites that you haven&#8217;t approved. \u00a0This is highly annoying at first while you &#8220;whitelist&#8221; all the things that you actually need to be able to do. \u00a0But once you&#8217;ve been through that process you&#8217;re a fair bit safer than you were.<\/p>\n<p>Blocking scripts can also:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove adverts and automatically-appearing videos and sounds.<\/li>\n<li>Prevent you being redirected to nasty web sites.<\/li>\n<li>Prevent your visits being registered by sites which track visits<\/li>\n<li>Give you an insight into where all these scripts come from.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t essential security, but useful extra protection if you can spend some time working it out.<\/p>\n<h4>URLBarExt<\/h4>\n<p>Again, for more advanced users. \u00a0I&#8217;m not entirely convinced of its use just yet, but it adds a load of extra little icons to the address bar (aka the &#8220;Awesome Bar&#8221;) at the top of the browser.<\/p>\n<p>My favourite is the link shortener.<\/p>\n<p><em>[Advanced user note and note to self:<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>If you have a bit.ly API key you can configure the shortener to use a URL like: <\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>http:\/\/api.bit.ly\/shorten?version=2.0.1&amp;login=&lt;login&gt;&amp;apiKey=&lt;apiKey&gt;&amp;history=1&amp;longUrl=<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>and a filter like:<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>\\&#8221;shortUrl\\&#8221;: \\&#8221;(.+)\\&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>to have all shortened links tracked in your bit.ly account]<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>Other Add-Ons<\/h4>\n<p>Other add-ons I use are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Compact Menu 2\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/4550\" target=\"_blank\">Compact Menu 2<\/a> &#8211; reduces the menu bar to a single icon with a drop-down menu system &#8211; great for saving screen space and especially great for use on a NetBook with a small screen.<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Delicious Bookmarks Addon\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/3615\" target=\"_blank\">Delicious Bookmarks<\/a> &#8211; plug in for Delicious bookmarks mentioned above.<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Feedly\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/8538\" target=\"_blank\">Feedly<\/a> &#8211; if you use Google Reader you MUST check this out &#8211; it&#8217;s a magazine-style layout for your Google Reader items. \u00a0Brilliant!<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Tab Mix Plus\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/1122\" target=\"_blank\">Tab Mix Plus<\/a> &#8211; almost-essential new options for using tabs.<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"EchoFon\" href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/addon\/5081\" target=\"_blank\">EchoFon<\/a> (was Twitterfox) &#8211; neat and unobtrusive Twitter gadget for Firefox.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Firefox Keyword Searches<\/h3>\n<p>One final note on Firefox before I shut up. Firefox has the ability to use &#8220;keywords&#8221; for searches. \u00a0This means that you can things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;amazon the da vinci code&#8221; to go straight to Amazon results for &#8220;the da vinci code&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;ebay food processor&#8221; to find food processors on ebay<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You get the idea.<\/p>\n<p>But these are also customisable. \u00a0So if there&#8217;s a site that you search a lot, set up a key word for it. \u00a0It&#8217;s usually enough just to find the text box where you type your search, right-click in it and select &#8220;Add a Keyword for this search&#8221;. \u00a0This is all described in more detail <a title=\"Mozillazine - Keyword Searches\" href=\"http:\/\/kb.mozillazine.org\/Using_keyword_searches\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Combined with the fact that pressing Ctrl-L on the keyboard takes you to the bar and you can do quick and easy searches without even using the mouse!<\/p>\n<h3>Summing Up<\/h3>\n<p>I like to think I&#8217;m a pretty advanced web user but I don&#8217;t know the half of what&#8217;s out there. I get lots of tips from the <a title=\"Lifehacker Blog\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lifehacker.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">LifeHacker Blog<\/a> and from people on Twitter who know more than I.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not entirely happy that I pitched this post at the right technical level. \u00a0Man, you could run week-long courses on this stuff. \u00a0Remember it was mostly notes to self, but hopefully there&#8217;s something useful for someone else too.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d encourage you not to be content with a half-hearted internet-browsing experience! \u00a0If you&#8217;re a novice, feel free to use the comments to ask me more. \u00a0Or perhaps you&#8217;d like to share a tip or two of your own&#8230;be my guest.<\/p>\n<p>Happy Browsing!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>After finally posting &#8220;<a title=\"Post: Crossings\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/10\/01\/crossings\/\" target=\"_self\">Crossings<\/a>&#8221; the other day, and after having more roundabout difficulty this week, I went back to the brilliant book &#8220;<a title=\"CycleCraft\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclecraft.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclecraft<\/a>&#8221; (recommended reading for anyone who ever cycles on a road) to see what it said about roundabouts.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><em>[At this point I should say that I&#8217;ve tried to contact both Mr Franklin and his publishers, The Stationary Office, for permission to quote the book, but the online form didn&#8217;t work and the email bounced respectivel.\u00a0 So, somewhat tentatively, I&#8217;m going to go ahead and just do it.\u00a0 Mr Franklin, TSO, WordPress.com, if there&#8217;s a problem with this then please contact me and I&#8217;ll happily remove the content.\u00a0 I&#8217;m hoping that my recommendation to buy this excellent book will cause you to look upon my plagiarism favourably.\u00a0 Thanks\/apologies.]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The book (mine is a less-up-to-date versions) explains the problem of dangerous approaches to roundabouts.\u00a0 This from the section on &#8220;single-lane roundabouts&#8221;, where I experience less difficulty:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The greatest danger is that some drivers race a cyclist to the roundabout, cutting sharply across the cyclists path in order to enter.\u00a0 Drivers often do not realise how great a cyclists speed can be [I love that bit&#8230;&#8221;how great&#8221;!- MR], and as a result there is often insufficient space to complete the overtaking manoeuvre safely, and the cyclist is put at risk&#8230;if there is an [entry] island and a driver still overtakes, it can act as a further hazard by creating a squeeze point.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Franklin agrees with the dilemma expressed in my previous post, but has a much better way and less aggressive way of putting it:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The difficulty for a cyclist lies in knowing the intentions of a driver behind. Can you ride normally and comfortably, or you should accelerate or brake in order to prevent or counter a dangerous manoeuvre?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Among other hazards, the book also talks a lot about how it&#8217;s dangerous being ON a roundabout and how drivers coming onto the roundabout as you cycle past the other approaches may not see you on a bike:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The biggest danger to cyclists is on the circulating road as you pass an intermediate entry&#8230;Frequently drivers fail to cede your right of way at these places, sometimes because they haven&#8217;t noticed you.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been paying attention while driving up to and on roundabouts in the last few days, thinking about whether or not I would see a cyclist and how I would respond.<\/p>\n<p>Living in, and learning to drive in Swindon, I consider myself to be a bit of a roundabout expert.\u00a0 Franklin says &#8220;In fact, many motorists themselves fear roundabouts&#8221;&#8230;whereas I take great glee in negotiating the many circular islands of Swindon.\u00a0 So I often approach roundabouts at speed, using my experience to anticipate the movements of those on the roundabout to get onto and across it as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>But reading Cyclecraft has made me aware of the inherent danger of this type of manoeuvre, especially to cyclists!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s fascinating, and it strikes me that it&#8217;s probably more important that drivers understand some of what&#8217;s in Cyclecraft, than it is that cyclists understand it.<\/p>\n<p>I wonder how much bike-awareness is in modern-day driving lessons and tests, and how much there should be.\u00a0 Anyone learn to drive recently and care to comment?<\/p>\n<p>Finally, of course, I love Swindon&#8217;s &#8220;Magic&#8221; Roundabout.\u00a0 But what does Cyclecraft say about it?\u00a0 Simply this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Another, rarer, type of multiple roundabout is where there is a ring of mini-roundabouts around a large roundabout which can be travelled in either direction.\u00a0 These, too, need to be treated with caution.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Mr Franklin, the cyclists of Swindon appreciate your non&#8211;specific reference to their holy grail of gyratory systems&#8230;and <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">all<\/span> your wise experience and advice.<\/p>\n",

Can you ride normally and comfortably, or you should accelerate or brake in order to prevent or counter a dangerous manoeuvre?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Among other hazards, the book also talks a lot about how it&#8217;s dangerous being ON a roundabout and how drivers coming onto the roundabout as you cycle past the other approaches may not see you on a bike:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The biggest danger to cyclists is on the circulating road as you pass an intermediate entry&#8230;Frequently drivers fail to cede your right of way at these places, sometimes because they haven&#8217;t noticed you.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been paying attention while driving up to and on roundabouts in the last few days, thinking about whether or not I would see a cyclist and how I would respond.<\/p>\n<p>Living in, and learning to drive in Swindon, I consider myself to be a bit of a roundabout expert.\u00a0 Franklin says &#8220;In fact, many motorists themselves fear roundabouts&#8221;&#8230;whereas I take great glee in negotiating the many circular islands of Swindon.\u00a0 So I often approach roundabouts at speed, using my experience to anticipate the movements of those on the roundabout to get onto and across it as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>But reading Cyclecraft has made me aware of the inherent danger of this type of manoeuvre, especially to cyclists!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s fascinating, and it strikes me that it&#8217;s probably more important that drivers understand some of what&#8217;s in Cyclecraft, than it is that cyclists understand it.<\/p>\n<p>I wonder how much bike-awareness is in modern-day driving lessons and tests, and how much there should be.\u00a0 Anyone learn to drive recently and care to comment?<\/p>\n<p>Finally, of course, I love Swindon&#8217;s &#8220;Magic&#8221; Roundabout.\u00a0 But what does Cyclecraft say about it?\u00a0 Simply this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Another, rarer, type of multiple roundabout is where there is a ring of mini-roundabouts around a large roundabout which can be travelled in either direction.\u00a0 These, too, need to be treated with caution.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Mr Franklin, the cyclists of Swindon appreciate your non&#8211;specific reference to their holy grail of gyratory systems&#8230;and <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">all<\/span> your wise experience and advice.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>[I wrote this post ages ago, but after re-reading it, discussing the incidents with my wife, and mulling it over, I&#8217;ve decided to re-write it slightly.\u00a0 At the time it felt right, but as I thought about it I realised that, sometimes I&#8217;m at fault, sometimes I&#8217;m unsafe, sometimes I&#8217;m an inconsiderate cyclist.<\/p>\n<p>I wonder what you think?<span style=\"color:#3366ff;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">]<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Crossings<\/h2>\n<p>There are some places that I ride where I know that one day someone&#8217;s going to try something daft and plenty of other places that I don&#8217;t often go with equal capacity for daftness.<\/p>\n<p>The last few days have seen a couple of minor incidents made amusing by the responses of the people involved.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>The Gesticulating Roundabout Crosser<\/h3>\n<p>There is one place where I cross a major dual carriageway by using a traffic-lit roundabout. The approach is a single lane which splits in two, and then both lanes splits in two again. I&#8217;m going straight on, so I take the lane one from the left.<\/p>\n<p>It was clear to me that at some point someone would try to overtake, mis-judge it, and end up either bashing me into the left-most lane, or getting stuck too far on the right. \u00a0Fortunately, and amusingly, what happened on Friday was the latter.<\/p>\n<p>A woman pulled out to go around me as the lights turned red. Now, I&#8217;m not certain what the mindset is. Is it &#8220;I&#8217;ll get past before the roundabout&#8221;? Is it &#8220;He&#8217;ll get out of my way&#8221;? Is it a simple or accidental misjudgment of speed, distance, and the timing of the lights? I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<p>Anyhow, she made that call. I somehow anticipated and was on my guard, so when she started to cautiously steer left towards me I was expecting it. \u00a0Fortunately she&#8217;d seen me and stopped moving left. \u00a0 I kept going for a bit, wondering what she would do, and eventually relented and waved her in front of me.<\/p>\n<p>What amused me most was the frantic, angry arm waving from the driver, suggesting that she was asking &#8220;Where was I meant to go?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the unspoken answer was &#8220;Well, you made the call to overtake; where did you think you were going to go?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The lights turned green and she pulled away, and turned left from the middle lane without indicating.<\/p>\n<h3>The Randomly Shouting Pedestrian Crosser<\/h3>\n<p>The second incident happened on Saturday. The weather was glorious and we had a walk planned with some friends just south of here. I&#8217;d been looking forward to cycling out to meet them, doing the walk, and then cycling home &#8211; which is exactly what I did.<\/p>\n<p>The way home was speedy as I flew downhill towards Wroughton.\u00a0 In the town centre is a Coop with a fairly obscure junction that includes a pedestrian crossing.<\/p>\n<p>As I approach the green filter light at speed, fully anticipating that I go straight through it, I see two older men at the roadside looking like they want to cross. They&#8217;re still some way off at this point and one has seen me but again my sixth cycling sense picks up that they might cross, despite the\u00a0 &#8220;red man&#8221; facing them and the mad cyclist bearing down on them both telling them that it&#8217;s probably not such idea.<\/p>\n<p>One of them does decide that, well, I&#8217;m on a bike so I can&#8217;t be going that fast and I&#8217;ll probably give way and even if I do hit them it won&#8217;t hurt so much, or whatever people think in such situations, and so I&#8217;ll cross.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately my judgement is better than his and I work out that he&#8217;ll be well across into the other lane before I reach him, so I keep going, holding out that the other guy, who&#8217;s not seen me, will decide NOT to cross.<\/p>\n<p>He doesn&#8217;t and I pass safely, but as I do so I get a rather stern shout of something along the lines of &#8220;where&#8217;s your brakes?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>And well you might ask.\u00a0 My fingers had been on them ready to pull them hard if needed.\u00a0 One might ask whether you really expected me to have to use them when the filter light was clearly in my favour.<\/p>\n<h3>Lessons<\/h3>\n<p>My writing is a bit harsh about the driver and pedestrian, mostly to make a point.\u00a0 I was amused by their comments, verbal or otherwise, as they made little sense to me who had, as far as I could tell, done no wrong.\u00a0 And yet, on reflection, perhaps I was aggressive too?<\/p>\n<p>I think that both situations were simple mis-judgements.\u00a0 Bad calls.\u00a0 Bad luck!\u00a0 But maybe my not giving way&#8230;not slowing down, despite anticipating something potentially dangerous, made them more dangerous than they needed to be. \u00a0In a non-threatening situation I prefer to be gracious, but when threatened, perhaps I&#8217;m too quick to stand my ground.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m reminded that others are usually willing to take a risk with an approaching cyclist.\u00a0 These &#8220;Yes, I can squeeze round before the lights&#8221;, or &#8220;I&#8217;ll make it across before he reaches me&#8221; situations are probably symptomatic of a bigger problem: road users putting themselves first.\u00a0 But then&#8230;isn&#8217;t that what I was doing too?<\/p>\n<p>Is it always better for me to concede to bad driving?\u00a0 Where does &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/21\/controversial-commute-tips-7-stand-firm\/\">standing your ground<\/a>&#8221; turn to &#8220;pushing your luck&#8221;?\u00a0 Perhaps my own safety, and that of those around me, is more important than making a point about the rules of the road?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>[I wrote this post ages ago, but after re-reading it, discussing the incidents with my wife, and mulling it over, I&#8217;ve decided to re-write it slightly.\u00a0 At the time it felt right, but as I thought about it I realised that, sometimes I&#8217;m at fault, sometimes I&#8217;m unsafe, sometimes I&#8217;m an inconsiderate cyclist.<\/p>\n<p>I wonder what you think?<span style=\"color:#3366ff;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">]<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Crossings<\/h2>\n<p>There are some places that I ride where I know that one day someone&#8217;s going to try something daft and plenty of other places that I don&#8217;t often go with equal capacity for daftness.<\/p>\n<p>The last few days have seen a couple of minor incidents made amusing by the responses of the people involved.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>The Gesticulating Roundabout Crosser<\/h3>\n<p>There is one place where I cross a major dual carriageway by using a traffic-lit roundabout. The approach is a single lane which splits in two, and then both lanes splits in two again. I&#8217;m going straight on, so I take the lane one from the left.<\/p>\n<p>It was clear to me that at some point someone would try to overtake, mis-judge it, and end up either bashing me into the left-most lane, or getting stuck too far on the right. \u00a0Fortunately, and amusingly, what happened on Friday was the latter.<\/p>\n<p>A woman pulled out to go around me as the lights turned red. Now, I&#8217;m not certain what the mindset is. Is it &#8220;I&#8217;ll get past before the roundabout&#8221;? Is it &#8220;He&#8217;ll get out of my way&#8221;? Is it a simple or accidental misjudgment of speed, distance, and the timing of the lights? I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<p>Anyhow, she made that call. I somehow anticipated and was on my guard, so when she started to cautiously steer left towards me I was expecting it. \u00a0Fortunately she&#8217;d seen me and stopped moving left. \u00a0 I kept going for a bit, wondering what she would do, and eventually relented and waved her in front of me.<\/p>\n<p>What amused me most was the frantic, angry arm waving from the driver, suggesting that she was asking &#8220;Where was I meant to go?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the unspoken answer was &#8220;Well, you made the call to overtake; where did you think you were going to go?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The lights turned green and she pulled away, and turned left from the middle lane without indicating.<\/p>\n<h3>The Randomly Shouting Pedestrian Crosser<\/h3>\n<p>The second incident happened on Saturday. The weather was glorious and we had a walk planned with some friends just south of here. I&#8217;d been looking forward to cycling out to meet them, doing the walk, and then cycling home &#8211; which is exactly what I did.<\/p>\n<p>The way home was speedy as I flew downhill towards Wroughton.\u00a0 In the town centre is a Coop with a fairly obscure junction that includes a pedestrian crossing.<\/p>\n<p>As I approach the green filter light at speed, fully anticipating that I go straight through it, I see two older men at the roadside looking like they want to cross. They&#8217;re still some way off at this point and one has seen me but again my sixth cycling sense picks up that they might cross, despite the\u00a0 &#8220;red man&#8221; facing them and the mad cyclist bearing down on them both telling them that it&#8217;s probably not such idea.<\/p>\n<p>One of them does decide that, well, I&#8217;m on a bike so I can&#8217;t be going that fast and I&#8217;ll probably give way and even if I do hit them it won&#8217;t hurt so much, or whatever people think in such situations, and so I&#8217;ll cross.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately my judgement is better than his and I work out that he&#8217;ll be well across into the other lane before I reach him, so I keep going, holding out that the other guy, who&#8217;s not seen me, will decide NOT to cross.<\/p>\n<p>He doesn&#8217;t and I pass safely, but as I do so I get a rather stern shout of something along the lines of &#8220;where&#8217;s your brakes?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>And well you might ask.\u00a0 My fingers had been on them ready to pull them hard if needed.\u00a0 One might ask whether you really expected me to have to use them when the filter light was clearly in my favour.<\/p>\n<h3>Lessons<\/h3>\n<p>My writing is a bit harsh about the driver and pedestrian, mostly to make a point.\u00a0 I was amused by their comments, verbal or otherwise, as they made little sense to me who had, as far as I could tell, done no wrong.\u00a0 And yet, on reflection, perhaps I was aggressive too?<\/p>\n<p>I think that both situations were simple mis-judgements.\u00a0 Bad calls.\u00a0 Bad luck!\u00a0 But maybe my not giving way&#8230;not slowing down, despite anticipating something potentially dangerous, made them more dangerous than they needed to be. \u00a0In a non-threatening situation I prefer to be gracious, but when threatened, perhaps I&#8217;m too quick to stand my ground.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m reminded that others are usually willing to take a risk with an approaching cyclist.\u00a0 These &#8220;Yes, I can squeeze round before the lights&#8221;, or &#8220;I&#8217;ll make it across before he reaches me&#8221; situations are probably symptomatic of a bigger problem: road users putting themselves first.\u00a0 But then&#8230;isn&#8217;t that what I was doing too?<\/p>\n<p>Is it always better for me to concede to bad driving?\u00a0 Where does &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/07\/21\/controversial-commute-tips-7-stand-firm\/\">standing your ground<\/a>&#8221; turn to &#8220;pushing your luck&#8221;?\u00a0 Perhaps my own safety, and that of those around me, is more important than making a point about the rules of the road?<\/p>\n",

Lots of famous people and big businesses have signed up, but, despite being a keen-though -ow-key climate change campaigner, I&#8217;ve not yet made that pledge.<\/p>\n<p>Why not?<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Well, I think it&#8217;s a good idea and will spur people on to make positive changes towards sustainability, but it doesn&#8217;t seem well thought out.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I think is missing from the campaign:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Measurement<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t see 10:10 providing a way of measuring your carbon emissions.  Surely this would be key if you&#8217;re committing people to reduce those emissions by 10%.  How will they measure success of this campaign?<\/p>\n<p>Not even the <a title=\"10:10 FAQs\" href=\"http:\/\/www.1010uk.org\/1010\/what_is_1010\/faq\" target=\"_blank\">10:10 FAQ<\/a> is of help here!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Focus<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If I knew my carbon footprint, I&#8217;d then want to know the quickest ways to get them reduced. Knowing whether a certain action will save me 5% or 0.5% would probably be useful in helping me priortise and calculate cost\/benefit ratios of my energy saving efforts.<\/p>\n<p>(Actually, a guy at the Guardian has written <a title=\"The Guardian: How to reduce your carbon emissions by 10%\" href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/environment\/2009\/sep\/01\/how-to-reduce-emissions-10-10\" target=\"_blank\">this useful article<\/a> &#8211; but still nothing directly from 10:10 themselves!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Detail<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a thing. My employer is a big energy consumer.  But, apparently, most of the electricity they buy is nuclear.  Does cutting their energy use count to cutting carbon emissions? Well, no!<\/p>\n<p>Would reducing their energy use be s good thing? Well, yes!<\/p>\n<p>And personally, we buy green energy. What&#8217;s the deal there?<\/p>\n<p>If we do something to improve efficiency of our home, does that count for both me and my wife? Or do we get half of the saving each?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m being slightly picky, but it&#8217;s not entirely clear what I need to do to meet the target.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Freedom<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For some people, 10:10 will get them started, they will enjoy it and be proud of what they achieve, and they will go on to cut more!<\/p>\n<p>Others will find it a burden and feel guilt for not hitting the target.<\/p>\n<p>And others will do 10%, think that&#8217;s their bit done and not do any more.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d rather people believed the message and did things because they wanted to, rather than to hit some arbitrary numerical target.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Completeness<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Cutting carbon emissions is the focus of 10:10 and maybe it&#8217;s good that it has a clear focus. \u00a0But we must do more than cut carbon; we must reduce waste and consumption, and we must build infrastructure that will get us way below 90% of where we are now and allow us to stay there.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sustainability<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Getting thousands of people to cut 10% of their carbon emissions will be great for the planet. But will it instill in people the values of sustainability? Will it create ground level social change? Will it change political will? Will it make businesses environmentally conscious?<\/p>\n<p>Plus, we &#8211; my household &#8211; already do lots to reduce energy use, live sustainably and cut emissions. We don&#8217;t do anything like enough&#8230;we&#8217;re lazy climateers really. But we try already without 10:10.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And we must try harder.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>10:10 sounds great.<\/p>\n<p>Can I honestly urge you to sign up?<\/p>\n<p>No.  Not yet at least.<\/p>\n<p>Can I honestly ask you to consider your consumption of the earth&#8217;s resources, to evaluate what you need and what you want, to think about giving a few things up for the greater good?<\/p>\n<p>Absolutely!  Go for it. Reduce your carbon emissions, energy use, plastic consumption, meat-eating and food waste. Do as much if it as you can. Do it now. And do it regardless of what targets you&#8217;ve signed up to.<\/p>\n<p>If you have signed up then fantastic.  Seriously, you&#8217;ve done a really good, positive thing and I&#8217;m excited about how many people have signed up and what impact that might have.<\/p>\n<p>I may even join myself at some point.  In the meantime I need to get on with consuming less, driving less, fixing my home&#8217;s draughts and making my life more simple and efficient.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>The Guardian and the makers of the film &#8216;Age of Stupid&#8217; have created a new climate change campaign called 10:10 (see <a title=\"10:10 UK Campaign\" href=\"http:\/\/www.1010uk.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.1010uk.org<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>The idea is that you sign up and try to cut your carbon emissions by 10% by the end of 2010. Lots of famous people and big businesses have signed up, but, despite being a keen-though -ow-key climate change campaigner, I&#8217;ve not yet made that pledge.<\/p>\n<p>Why not?<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Well, I think it&#8217;s a good idea and will spur people on to make positive changes towards sustainability, but it doesn&#8217;t seem well thought out.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I think is missing from the campaign:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Measurement<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t see 10:10 providing a way of measuring your carbon emissions.  Surely this would be key if you&#8217;re committing people to reduce those emissions by 10%.  How will they measure success of this campaign?<\/p>\n<p>Not even the <a title=\"10:10 FAQs\" href=\"http:\/\/www.1010uk.org\/1010\/what_is_1010\/faq\" target=\"_blank\">10:10 FAQ<\/a> is of help here!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Focus<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If I knew my carbon footprint, I&#8217;d then want to know the quickest ways to get them reduced. Knowing whether a certain action will save me 5% or 0.5% would probably be useful in helping me priortise and calculate cost\/benefit ratios of my energy saving efforts.<\/p>\n<p>(Actually, a guy at the Guardian has written <a title=\"The Guardian: How to reduce your carbon emissions by 10%\" href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/environment\/2009\/sep\/01\/how-to-reduce-emissions-10-10\" target=\"_blank\">this useful article<\/a> &#8211; but still nothing directly from 10:10 themselves!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Detail<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a thing. My employer is a big energy consumer.  But, apparently, most of the electricity they buy is nuclear.  Does cutting their energy use count to cutting carbon emissions? Well, no!<\/p>\n<p>Would reducing their energy use be s good thing? Well, yes!<\/p>\n<p>And personally, we buy green energy. What&#8217;s the deal there?<\/p>\n<p>If we do something to improve efficiency of our home, does that count for both me and my wife? Or do we get half of the saving each?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m being slightly picky, but it&#8217;s not entirely clear what I need to do to meet the target.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Freedom<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For some people, 10:10 will get them started, they will enjoy it and be proud of what they achieve, and they will go on to cut more!<\/p>\n<p>Others will find it a burden and feel guilt for not hitting the target.<\/p>\n<p>And others will do 10%, think that&#8217;s their bit done and not do any more.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d rather people believed the message and did things because they wanted to, rather than to hit some arbitrary numerical target.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Completeness<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Cutting carbon emissions is the focus of 10:10 and maybe it&#8217;s good that it has a clear focus. \u00a0But we must do more than cut carbon; we must reduce waste and consumption, and we must build infrastructure that will get us way below 90% of where we are now and allow us to stay there.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sustainability<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Getting thousands of people to cut 10% of their carbon emissions will be great for the planet. But will it instill in people the values of sustainability? Will it create ground level social change? Will it change political will? Will it make businesses environmentally conscious?<\/p>\n<p>Plus, we &#8211; my household &#8211; already do lots to reduce energy use, live sustainably and cut emissions. We don&#8217;t do anything like enough&#8230;we&#8217;re lazy climateers really. But we try already without 10:10.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And we must try harder.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>10:10 sounds great.<\/p>\n<p>Can I honestly urge you to sign up?<\/p>\n<p>No.  Not yet at least.<\/p>\n<p>Can I honestly ask you to consider your consumption of the earth&#8217;s resources, to evaluate what you need and what you want, to think about giving a few things up for the greater good?<\/p>\n<p>Absolutely!  Go for it. Reduce your carbon emissions, energy use, plastic consumption, meat-eating and food waste. Do as much if it as you can. Do it now. And do it regardless of what targets you&#8217;ve signed up to.<\/p>\n<p>If you have signed up then fantastic.  Seriously, you&#8217;ve done a really good, positive thing and I&#8217;m excited about how many people have signed up and what impact that might have.<\/p>\n<p>I may even join myself at some point.  In the meantime I need to get on with consuming less, driving less, fixing my home&#8217;s draughts and making my life more simple and efficient.<\/p>\n",

Starting on Friday night with First Great Western (and a fantastically Spanish train manager sounding like a cross between Manuel from Fawlty Towers and the &#8220;Compare the Market&#8221; meercats), and continuing on the fabulously relaxed Eurostar to Paris on Saturday (with a brass band playing as you wait to board&#8230;superb!).<\/p>\n<p>The Paris Metro was a bit of a scrum, but the TGV was a delight.\u00a0 Remind me why we fly again?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Chateau La Bruyere<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The place we stayed was incredible.\u00a0 It was a bit out in the sticks but we had an enormous and unique 16-bedroom place with HUGE dining room and indoor heated swimming pool all to ourselves.\u00a0 It was excellent value for money and, aside from the relatively poorly equipped kitchen, more than met our needs whilst at the same time enthralling us with its charm and character.<\/p>\n<p>I took a quick video tour if you want a speedy look around.<\/p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><param name=\"src\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/v\/fW_owL7-59E&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0\" \/><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" \/><embed type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/v\/fW_owL7-59E&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/embed><\/object><\/p>\n<p><strong>Booking Cars &#8211; Driving Cars<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There was a slight mix up with the hire car booking site (Thanks Opodo!) which had reset the pickup times after doing a search, so there was a little confusion when we turned up 6 hours late to pick up one of our 2 hire cars, but it was all sorted out in the end.<\/p>\n<p>Driving on the continent was fine again other than that odd incident where was passed a guy who was driving with the bonnet up against his windscreen, peering through the gap at the bottom of the bonnet.\u00a0 Man, these continentals really need to get places sometimes!<\/p>\n<p>We got hideously lost trying to get back to Bordeaux Station, and were then charged for fuel one of the cars even though it was full.\u00a0 But we got that refunded.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Food, Language &amp; Culture<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m definitely NOT xenophobic, but I am pretty bad at getting to grips with foreign places and being in unusual places where things work differently and I can&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s going on stresses me out a bit.\u00a0 This holiday was helped by my own fairly-good latent knowledge of French, and the presence of many other good French speakers in the group.\u00a0 Altogether a more enjoyable experience than last years trip to Sicily!<\/p>\n<p><strong>A Fantastic Group<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We were with some brilliant people too.\u00a0 Old friends, new friends, cultured and fun, intelligent and witty, some great cooks, some very creative people, and everyone willing to chip in and contribute to the holiday in all sorts of ways.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll always remember sharing book recommendations, larking around in the pool, the fantastic array of food, the excellent drink (including the discovery of Pineau!),messing around with kindred spirits, the chilled-out-ness of it all, and the joy of being with such good people.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, it was warm, but not too hot, dry, and sunny.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s do it again!<\/p>\n",

But a different and nice kind of busy.<\/p>\n<p>We spent a week in France with good friends, followed by a day at the Christian arts and music festival Greenbelt.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to do my usual multi-part holiday post &#8211; it was too relaxed a holiday and there&#8217;s not so much to say &#8211; but a few experiences and thoughts are given here.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><strong>Trains<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We took the train all the way to Bordeaux! Which was a brilliant experience. Starting on Friday night with First Great Western (and a fantastically Spanish train manager sounding like a cross between Manuel from Fawlty Towers and the &#8220;Compare the Market&#8221; meercats), and continuing on the fabulously relaxed Eurostar to Paris on Saturday (with a brass band playing as you wait to board&#8230;superb!).<\/p>\n<p>The Paris Metro was a bit of a scrum, but the TGV was a delight.\u00a0 Remind me why we fly again?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Chateau La Bruyere<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The place we stayed was incredible.\u00a0 It was a bit out in the sticks but we had an enormous and unique 16-bedroom place with HUGE dining room and indoor heated swimming pool all to ourselves.\u00a0 It was excellent value for money and, aside from the relatively poorly equipped kitchen, more than met our needs whilst at the same time enthralling us with its charm and character.<\/p>\n<p>I took a quick video tour if you want a speedy look around.<\/p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><param name=\"src\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/v\/fW_owL7-59E&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0\" \/><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" \/><embed type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/v\/fW_owL7-59E&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/embed><\/object><\/p>\n<p><strong>Booking Cars &#8211; Driving Cars<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There was a slight mix up with the hire car booking site (Thanks Opodo!) which had reset the pickup times after doing a search, so there was a little confusion when we turned up 6 hours late to pick up one of our 2 hire cars, but it was all sorted out in the end.<\/p>\n<p>Driving on the continent was fine again other than that odd incident where was passed a guy who was driving with the bonnet up against his windscreen, peering through the gap at the bottom of the bonnet.\u00a0 Man, these continentals really need to get places sometimes!<\/p>\n<p>We got hideously lost trying to get back to Bordeaux Station, and were then charged for fuel one of the cars even though it was full.\u00a0 But we got that refunded.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Food, Language &amp; Culture<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m definitely NOT xenophobic, but I am pretty bad at getting to grips with foreign places and being in unusual places where things work differently and I can&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s going on stresses me out a bit.\u00a0 This holiday was helped by my own fairly-good latent knowledge of French, and the presence of many other good French speakers in the group.\u00a0 Altogether a more enjoyable experience than last years trip to Sicily!<\/p>\n<p><strong>A Fantastic Group<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We were with some brilliant people too.\u00a0 Old friends, new friends, cultured and fun, intelligent and witty, some great cooks, some very creative people, and everyone willing to chip in and contribute to the holiday in all sorts of ways.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll always remember sharing book recommendations, larking around in the pool, the fantastic array of food, the excellent drink (including the discovery of Pineau!),messing around with kindred spirits, the chilled-out-ness of it all, and the joy of being with such good people.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, it was warm, but not too hot, dry, and sunny.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s do it again!<\/p>\n",
