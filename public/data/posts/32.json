It&#8217;s an advertising tool, not a communications tool. It doesn&#8217;t work well as a means of staying in touch with people.

It&#8217;s an advertising tool, not a communications tool. It doesn&#8217;t work well as a means of staying in touch with people. And while I don&#8217;t mind advertising being the source of funding for a free tool, I don&#8217;t want my content used in that advertising.<\/p>\n<p>So, I&#8217;ve archived all my Facebook and Instagram data, deleted all my photos (bar a profile pic) and am working out what&#8217;s next. I can&#8217;t leave completely because I admin several groups and pages. But my presence there will be minimal.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll continue to post on Twitter as <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/magicroundabout\">@magicroundabout<\/a> and will use this blog to post photos and longer messages.<\/p>\n<p>I may even follow some folk onto Google+ a bit more.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about then, you don&#8217;t need to worry.

By a dad-to-be. And so I thought I ought to offer a dad&#8217;s perspective on that.<\/p>\n<p>[Please note, if my tone doesn&#8217;t come across, this post is slightly tongue-in-cheek in places &#8211; forgive me in advance for my transgressions]<\/p>\n<p>Why a dad&#8217;s perspective? Well, because you could go searching on the internet for information and advice but &#8211; and I mean this in the nicest possible way &#8211; the cloth nappy forums:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>have lots of stuff about &#8216;pretty&#8217; nappies. And as a man you&#8217;re much more interested in how a nappy performs, lasts, and what sort of fasteners it uses, than what it looks like! If you&#8217;re not sure what I mean by &#8216;pretty&#8217; nappies, <a title=\"Wee Notions\" href=\"http:\/\/weenotions.co.uk\/\">Wee Notions<\/a> has a fine display to browse with more on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Wee-Notions\/159755886094\">their Facebook Page<\/a>. All very lovely, but not the kind of thing a geek dad is interested in. And besides, nappies shouldn&#8217;t be out on display in public often enough for us to be worried about what they look like, right?<\/li>\n<li>use a strange and baffling code in many posts. I mean, I just about understand why my &#8220;OH&#8221; might put my &#8220;DS&#8221; in a &#8220;Bamboozle&#8221;, &#8220;strip&#8221; her &#8220;AIO&#8217;s&#8221;, or get her &#8220;DH&#8221; to order the &#8220;CD&#8217;s&#8221; before her &#8220;LO&#8217;s&#8221; &#8220;EDD&#8221;. But it&#8217;s taken 9 months to get there. To a newbie, it&#8217;s incomprehensible.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>I also think a dad&#8217;s perspective is good because, actually, nappy changing is one thing you can get involved in (especially if mum is breastfeeding) and &#8220;geek out&#8221; about, while getting plenty of opportunity for toilet humour in too.<\/p>\n<h2>The Executive Summary<\/h2>\n<p>The headlines are this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cloth Nappies are great.<\/li>\n<li>The save huge amounts of resources and waste<\/li>\n<li>As long as you get into a good washing routine they&#8217;re little hassle<\/li>\n<li>They need up-front investment, but can save money in the long run &#8211; especially if you have two or more babies<\/li>\n<li>Every nappy brand is different, every baby is different and it&#8217;s kinda pot luck whether or not yours will fit well<\/li>\n<li>We use, and love, our 20 Bum Genius nappies &#8211; they&#8217;re well designed and easy to use<\/li>\n<li>We also use re-usable fleece liners and cotton wipes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Brands and Babies<\/h2>\n<p>We asked around our cloth-nappy-using friends and got two basic bits of advice:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can never be sure if they will fit. Each type of nappy is a different shape and each baby is a different shape. It&#8217;s pot luck if the nappies will fit your baby well or not.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Bum Genius&#8221; seemed the most popular brand and were almost universally acclaimed as an excellent product. I think there were some &#8220;TotsBots&#8221; in use as well, but they were used by less people.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Types<\/h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s an overwhelming array of choices and accompanying terminology. Everything from simple cloth squares to complete, all-in-one nappies that grow with your baby from birth to 18 months of age.<\/p>\n<p>A few hints:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nappies have up to three parts: a waterproof outer, an absorbent pad for soaking up wee wee, and a soft, water-permeable layer that sits next to baby&#8217;s skin, and keeps poo out of the pad.<\/li>\n<li>All in One nappies are just what they say they are.<\/li>\n<li>All in Two nappies, as far as I can tell, are an all-in-one nappy that comes apart for washing, or that you can add &#8220;booster&#8221; pads to to increase absorbency.<\/li>\n<li>Pocket nappies have a waterproof outer and fleecy inner stitched together, and you stuff an absorbent pad into it before use. It comes apart to wash and dry.<\/li>\n<li>Fitted nappies are like an evolution of terry\/cotton square nappies. They&#8217;re just an absorbent piece of fabric, but that&#8217;s been shaped and has built-in fasteners. You&#8217;ll need to use this with a waterproof &#8220;wrap&#8221; or cover over it. These tend to be bulkier, but more absorbent. Good for night-time use when you&#8217;re leaving the nappy on for a long time.<\/li>\n<li>Nappy Wraps, or Covers are the waterproof outer parts. You can use these with fitted nappies, or with traditional cotton squares.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fill-your-pants.com\/nappycomparison.html\">Fill Your Pants guide<\/a> is quite useful and gives pros and cons of different types.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll also need to know about fastenings:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Aplix&#8221; is a form of velcro. This is quicker and easier to do up and is more easily adjustable, but has the disadvantage of sticking to all your washing and wearing out quickly. You may also see traditional velcro fastenings.<\/li>\n<li>Poppers, or snaps, are limited in their range of fastening and possibly trickier to do up, but are more robust and long-lasting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What to Get<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to tell you what to get. But I&#8217;ll tell you what we&#8217;ve got and are very happy with.<\/p>\n<h3>The Nappies<\/h3>\n<p>We have 20 Bum Genius &#8216;pocket&#8217; nappies &#8211; version 4 I think &#8211; with popper fasteners. We started with 15 but it just wasn&#8217;t quite enough and the extra five give us a little more lee-way on washing and drying.<\/p>\n<p>They are &#8216;one-size&#8217; nappies, so they cleverly expand to grow with your child. We didn&#8217;t quite use them from newborn when Isaac was REALLY tiny, but certainly from very early on, and he&#8217;s still on the smaller settings at 9 months.<\/p>\n<p>The nappies are great. Really easy to use. Really durable. And we&#8217;ve had minimal nappy rash and leakage. It&#8217;s hard to compare if we&#8217;ve had more or less nappy rash and leakage than we would have had with disposables because every baby is different. However, when we&#8217;ve used disposables when travelling and on holiday we have definitely had more leaks. This is possibly because we are less practised at fitting them.<\/p>\n<p>We bought a kit from <a title=\"Fill Your Pants\" href=\"http:\/\/fill-your-pants.com\" target=\"_self\">http:\/\/fill-your-pants.com<\/a> that included a bucket, two mesh bags, a dry sack for the change bag, and some other stuff. All of which has been really useful.<\/p>\n<p>We also have four fitted bamboo nappies with boosters that we use overnight (two came with the kit, two were bought subsequently) and two waterproof wraps to keep the wee wees in (one came in the kit, one was bought extra). We got the extra nappies and wraps here because they take a long time to dry and we couldn&#8217;t get just two of them out of the washing\/drying quick enough.<\/p>\n<h3>Wipes<\/h3>\n<p>We also use re-usable wipes. We bought the wipes in a kit from <a title=\"Cheeky Wipes\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cheekywipes.com\" target=\"_self\">http:\/\/www.cheekywipes.com<\/a>. The extra stuff in the kit hasn&#8217;t turned out quite as useful (the small bags for taking wipes on the move are good), but the wipes are great. In fact, we find them better than disposable wipes because they have some texture to them that picks up dirt. We ended up using them on the move, at the dining table, and in the bath, so we bought another 25 as they are so good and so useful. But you could easily make your own from, say, and old towel, and store them in plastic tubs.<\/p>\n<p>I also recently did the maths on washable wipes and, despite seeming expensive to buy, I reckon they&#8217;re a better money saver than nappies. Isaac is nearly a year now and we could easily have used more than a pack of disposable wipes every week, which, at \u00a31+ a week means we&#8217;ve easily saved money already and we&#8217;ll continue to use them for years.<\/p>\n<h3>Liners<\/h3>\n<p>You can use re-usable nappies without liners, but nappy creams can clog them up, and using liners makes handling the contents of a dirty nappy much easier. Liners do, of course, add to the ongoing costs of reusable nappies.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve used a combination of re-usable and disposable liners. We started off with <a title=\"Tots Bots Disposable Nappy Liners - Fill Your Pants\" href=\"http:\/\/www.fill-your-pants.com\/nappy-liners\/tots-bots-nappy-liners.html\" target=\"_self\">Tot Bots disposable liner<\/a>s which came with the nappy kit, but they were a bit rubbish and tended to gather up into a long, thin strip, so they didn&#8217;t catch much mess.<\/p>\n<p>We then tried some <a title=\"Tots Bots Fleece Liners - Fill Your Pants\" href=\"http:\/\/www.fill-your-pants.com\/nappy-liners\/tots-bots-fleece-liners.html\" target=\"_self\">washable micro-fleece liners<\/a>. These are fine if you&#8217;re not dealing with great volumes of poo, but when poo arrives they&#8217;re not so good.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve settled on some <a title=\"Earthlets disposable liners - Amazon\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/dp\/B004UAE8JA\" target=\"_self\">cellulose liners<\/a> that are stiffer, and so better at keeping their width and catching poo. They&#8217;re more expensive, but in fact, if they&#8217;re not pooed in then they can be washed and reused.<\/p>\n<h3>Creams<\/h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ve used a variety of creams and I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s been any that we&#8217;ve not liked. We used Bepanthen in the early days to tackle nappy rash, and have subsequently used <a title=\"Welleda Calendula Nappy Cream - Amazon\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/dp\/B000V3MFUY\" target=\"_self\">Welleda&#8217;s Calendula<\/a> cream successfully too. But our favourite cream &#8211; which was recommended to us because it doesn&#8217;t clog nappies but has become our favourite because it just smells good enough to eat! &#8211; is <a title=\"CJ's BUTTers at Fluff Heaven\" href=\"http:\/\/www.fluffheaven.com\/index.php\/toiletries-1\/cj-s-butters.html\" target=\"_self\">CJ&#8217;s BUTTer<\/a>. It&#8217;s a tad expensive, but the amazing smell makes changing a nappy almost enjoyable.<\/p>\n<h2>Maintenance<\/h2>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to know how to look after your nappies. This is a science of its own, but we&#8217;ve managed to get by with the very basics.<\/p>\n<p>Pretty much everything you need to know about washing has been written by a friend of mine in <a title=\"Everything I Know About Washing Nappies - Learner Mummy\" href=\"http:\/\/learnermummy.wordpress.com\/2011\/11\/25\/everything-i-know-about-washing-cloth-nappies\/\" target=\"_self\">a blog post of her own<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Our own process is to wash on a 40 degree cycle with our machine&#8217;s &#8216;wash plus&#8217; and &#8216;rinse plus&#8217; settings on, followed by an extra rinse and spin. We use a small amount of non-biological powder &#8211; we&#8217;ve used a few different types including Ecover, Fairy and Surcare all with no problems.<\/p>\n<p>We have done the odd 60 degree wash to get rid of smells and hanging them outside in the sun bleaches them back to whiteness, but mostly we&#8217;ve had no problems and we don&#8217;t really do &#8216;strip washing&#8217; as described in the other post. Perhaps our tolerance of smells and discolouration is higher than others?<\/p>\n<h2>Summing Up<\/h2>\n<p>I hope that&#8217;s all been useful information. I suppose the summary is: we love our reusable nappies and, if you can afford the up-front investment, we would recommend them highly&#8230;especially the BumGenius pocket nappies that we use, which are fantastic.<\/p>\n<div>&#8216;One final thing: if you&#8217;re not so happy around the outputs of other people&#8217;s bodily functions, then you might be better with disposables. There is a certain amount of handling the dirties with disposables.

        "title": "Reusable\/Cloth Nappies: A Plain English Guide for Dads and Dads-to-be",
        "content": "<p>OK, OK, I know I <a title=\"Parenthood \u2013 the sum of my knowledge\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2012\/05\/parenthood-the-sum-of-my-knowledge\/\">wrote about NOT offering advice<\/a> to parents, but I&#8217;ve been specifically asked for some information on cloth nappies. By a dad-to-be. And so I thought I ought to offer a dad&#8217;s perspective on that.<\/p>\n<p>[Please note, if my tone doesn&#8217;t come across, this post is slightly tongue-in-cheek in places &#8211; forgive me in advance for my transgressions]<\/p>\n<p>Why a dad&#8217;s perspective? Well, because you could go searching on the internet for information and advice but &#8211; and I mean this in the nicest possible way &#8211; the cloth nappy forums:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>have lots of stuff about &#8216;pretty&#8217; nappies. And as a man you&#8217;re much more interested in how a nappy performs, lasts, and what sort of fasteners it uses, than what it looks like! If you&#8217;re not sure what I mean by &#8216;pretty&#8217; nappies, <a title=\"Wee Notions\" href=\"http:\/\/weenotions.co.uk\/\">Wee Notions<\/a> has a fine display to browse with more on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Wee-Notions\/159755886094\">their Facebook Page<\/a>. All very lovely, but not the kind of thing a geek dad is interested in. And besides, nappies shouldn&#8217;t be out on display in public often enough for us to be worried about what they look like, right?<\/li>\n<li>use a strange and baffling code in many posts. I mean, I just about understand why my &#8220;OH&#8221; might put my &#8220;DS&#8221; in a &#8220;Bamboozle&#8221;, &#8220;strip&#8221; her &#8220;AIO&#8217;s&#8221;, or get her &#8220;DH&#8221; to order the &#8220;CD&#8217;s&#8221; before her &#8220;LO&#8217;s&#8221; &#8220;EDD&#8221;. But it&#8217;s taken 9 months to get there. To a newbie, it&#8217;s incomprehensible.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>I also think a dad&#8217;s perspective is good because, actually, nappy changing is one thing you can get involved in (especially if mum is breastfeeding) and &#8220;geek out&#8221; about, while getting plenty of opportunity for toilet humour in too.<\/p>\n<h2>The Executive Summary<\/h2>\n<p>The headlines are this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cloth Nappies are great.<\/li>\n<li>The save huge amounts of resources and waste<\/li>\n<li>As long as you get into a good washing routine they&#8217;re little hassle<\/li>\n<li>They need up-front investment, but can save money in the long run &#8211; especially if you have two or more babies<\/li>\n<li>Every nappy brand is different, every baby is different and it&#8217;s kinda pot luck whether or not yours will fit well<\/li>\n<li>We use, and love, our 20 Bum Genius nappies &#8211; they&#8217;re well designed and easy to use<\/li>\n<li>We also use re-usable fleece liners and cotton wipes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Brands and Babies<\/h2>\n<p>We asked around our cloth-nappy-using friends and got two basic bits of advice:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can never be sure if they will fit. Each type of nappy is a different shape and each baby is a different shape. It&#8217;s pot luck if the nappies will fit your baby well or not.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Bum Genius&#8221; seemed the most popular brand and were almost universally acclaimed as an excellent product. I think there were some &#8220;TotsBots&#8221; in use as well, but they were used by less people.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Types<\/h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s an overwhelming array of choices and accompanying terminology. Everything from simple cloth squares to complete, all-in-one nappies that grow with your baby from birth to 18 months of age.<\/p>\n<p>A few hints:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nappies have up to three parts: a waterproof outer, an absorbent pad for soaking up wee wee, and a soft, water-permeable layer that sits next to baby&#8217;s skin, and keeps poo out of the pad.<\/li>\n<li>All in One nappies are just what they say they are.<\/li>\n<li>All in Two nappies, as far as I can tell, are an all-in-one nappy that comes apart for washing, or that you can add &#8220;booster&#8221; pads to to increase absorbency.<\/li>\n<li>Pocket nappies have a waterproof outer and fleecy inner stitched together, and you stuff an absorbent pad into it before use. It comes apart to wash and dry.<\/li>\n<li>Fitted nappies are like an evolution of terry\/cotton square nappies. They&#8217;re just an absorbent piece of fabric, but that&#8217;s been shaped and has built-in fasteners. You&#8217;ll need to use this with a waterproof &#8220;wrap&#8221; or cover over it. These tend to be bulkier, but more absorbent. Good for night-time use when you&#8217;re leaving the nappy on for a long time.<\/li>\n<li>Nappy Wraps, or Covers are the waterproof outer parts. You can use these with fitted nappies, or with traditional cotton squares.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fill-your-pants.com\/nappycomparison.html\">Fill Your Pants guide<\/a> is quite useful and gives pros and cons of different types.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll also need to know about fastenings:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Aplix&#8221; is a form of velcro. This is quicker and easier to do up and is more easily adjustable, but has the disadvantage of sticking to all your washing and wearing out quickly. You may also see traditional velcro fastenings.<\/li>\n<li>Poppers, or snaps, are limited in their range of fastening and possibly trickier to do up, but are more robust and long-lasting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What to Get<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to tell you what to get. But I&#8217;ll tell you what we&#8217;ve got and are very happy with.<\/p>\n<h3>The Nappies<\/h3>\n<p>We have 20 Bum Genius &#8216;pocket&#8217; nappies &#8211; version 4 I think &#8211; with popper fasteners. We started with 15 but it just wasn&#8217;t quite enough and the extra five give us a little more lee-way on washing and drying.<\/p>\n<p>They are &#8216;one-size&#8217; nappies, so they cleverly expand to grow with your child. We didn&#8217;t quite use them from newborn when Isaac was REALLY tiny, but certainly from very early on, and he&#8217;s still on the smaller settings at 9 months.<\/p>\n<p>The nappies are great. Really easy to use. Really durable. And we&#8217;ve had minimal nappy rash and leakage. It&#8217;s hard to compare if we&#8217;ve had more or less nappy rash and leakage than we would have had with disposables because every baby is different. However, when we&#8217;ve used disposables when travelling and on holiday we have definitely had more leaks. This is possibly because we are less practised at fitting them.<\/p>\n<p>We bought a kit from <a title=\"Fill Your Pants\" href=\"http:\/\/fill-your-pants.com\" target=\"_self\">http:\/\/fill-your-pants.com<\/a> that included a bucket, two mesh bags, a dry sack for the change bag, and some other stuff. All of which has been really useful.<\/p>\n<p>We also have four fitted bamboo nappies with boosters that we use overnight (two came with the kit, two were bought subsequently) and two waterproof wraps to keep the wee wees in (one came in the kit, one was bought extra). We got the extra nappies and wraps here because they take a long time to dry and we couldn&#8217;t get just two of them out of the washing\/drying quick enough.<\/p>\n<h3>Wipes<\/h3>\n<p>We also use re-usable wipes. We bought the wipes in a kit from <a title=\"Cheeky Wipes\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cheekywipes.com\" target=\"_self\">http:\/\/www.cheekywipes.com<\/a>. The extra stuff in the kit hasn&#8217;t turned out quite as useful (the small bags for taking wipes on the move are good), but the wipes are great. In fact, we find them better than disposable wipes because they have some texture to them that picks up dirt. We ended up using them on the move, at the dining table, and in the bath, so we bought another 25 as they are so good and so useful. But you could easily make your own from, say, and old towel, and store them in plastic tubs.<\/p>\n<p>I also recently did the maths on washable wipes and, despite seeming expensive to buy, I reckon they&#8217;re a better money saver than nappies. Isaac is nearly a year now and we could easily have used more than a pack of disposable wipes every week, which, at \u00a31+ a week means we&#8217;ve easily saved money already and we&#8217;ll continue to use them for years.<\/p>\n<h3>Liners<\/h3>\n<p>You can use re-usable nappies without liners, but nappy creams can clog them up, and using liners makes handling the contents of a dirty nappy much easier. Liners do, of course, add to the ongoing costs of reusable nappies.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve used a combination of re-usable and disposable liners. We started off with <a title=\"Tots Bots Disposable Nappy Liners - Fill Your Pants\" href=\"http:\/\/www.fill-your-pants.com\/nappy-liners\/tots-bots-nappy-liners.html\" target=\"_self\">Tot Bots disposable liner<\/a>s which came with the nappy kit, but they were a bit rubbish and tended to gather up into a long, thin strip, so they didn&#8217;t catch much mess.<\/p>\n<p>We then tried some <a title=\"Tots Bots Fleece Liners - Fill Your Pants\" href=\"http:\/\/www.fill-your-pants.com\/nappy-liners\/tots-bots-fleece-liners.html\" target=\"_self\">washable micro-fleece liners<\/a>. These are fine if you&#8217;re not dealing with great volumes of poo, but when poo arrives they&#8217;re not so good.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve settled on some <a title=\"Earthlets disposable liners - Amazon\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/dp\/B004UAE8JA\" target=\"_self\">cellulose liners<\/a> that are stiffer, and so better at keeping their width and catching poo. They&#8217;re more expensive, but in fact, if they&#8217;re not pooed in then they can be washed and reused.<\/p>\n<h3>Creams<\/h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ve used a variety of creams and I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s been any that we&#8217;ve not liked. We used Bepanthen in the early days to tackle nappy rash, and have subsequently used <a title=\"Welleda Calendula Nappy Cream - Amazon\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/dp\/B000V3MFUY\" target=\"_self\">Welleda&#8217;s Calendula<\/a> cream successfully too. But our favourite cream &#8211; which was recommended to us because it doesn&#8217;t clog nappies but has become our favourite because it just smells good enough to eat! &#8211; is <a title=\"CJ's BUTTers at Fluff Heaven\" href=\"http:\/\/www.fluffheaven.com\/index.php\/toiletries-1\/cj-s-butters.html\" target=\"_self\">CJ&#8217;s BUTTer<\/a>. It&#8217;s a tad expensive, but the amazing smell makes changing a nappy almost enjoyable.<\/p>\n<h2>Maintenance<\/h2>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to know how to look after your nappies. This is a science of its own, but we&#8217;ve managed to get by with the very basics.<\/p>\n<p>Pretty much everything you need to know about washing has been written by a friend of mine in <a title=\"Everything I Know About Washing Nappies - Learner Mummy\" href=\"http:\/\/learnermummy.wordpress.com\/2011\/11\/25\/everything-i-know-about-washing-cloth-nappies\/\" target=\"_self\">a blog post of her own<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Our own process is to wash on a 40 degree cycle with our machine&#8217;s &#8216;wash plus&#8217; and &#8216;rinse plus&#8217; settings on, followed by an extra rinse and spin. We use a small amount of non-biological powder &#8211; we&#8217;ve used a few different types including Ecover, Fairy and Surcare all with no problems.<\/p>\n<p>We have done the odd 60 degree wash to get rid of smells and hanging them outside in the sun bleaches them back to whiteness, but mostly we&#8217;ve had no problems and we don&#8217;t really do &#8216;strip washing&#8217; as described in the other post. Perhaps our tolerance of smells and discolouration is higher than others?<\/p>\n<h2>Summing Up<\/h2>\n<p>I hope that&#8217;s all been useful information. I suppose the summary is: we love our reusable nappies and, if you can afford the up-front investment, we would recommend them highly&#8230;especially the BumGenius pocket nappies that we use, which are fantastic.<\/p>\n<div>&#8216;One final thing: if you&#8217;re not so happy around the outputs of other people&#8217;s bodily functions, then you might be better with disposables. There is a certain amount of handling the dirties with disposables. However:<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>the modern systems minimise this by clever bagging arrangements; and<\/li>\n<li>this is a dad&#8217;s guide, and dads are real men, and real men aren&#8217;t afraid of a bit of baby poo&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div>&#8230;are they?<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Feel free to ask questions or share your own experiences in the comments.<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>A while ago I quit the commercial IT world to work as a freelance web developer. There were many aspect to this decision, but one of the big ones was frustration with the software that I had to use.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to blog about this for ages, then tonight, <a title=\"Elliott Richmond on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elliottrichmond\">Elliott Richmond<\/a> tweeted a link to <a title=\"Open Source vs Proprietary Software - SquareOne MD\" href=\"http:\/\/www.squareonemd.co.uk\/open-source-vs-proprietary-software\/\">a post he&#8217;d written about Open Source vs Proprietary software<\/a>, and I took it as an excuse to get my thoughts down. Those thoughts are collected here in a slightly edited copy of my comment on Elliott&#8217;s post.<\/p>\n<p>Elliott&#8217;s post is more about the topic in the context of website publishing and content management systems. my views are probably more about commercial software in general.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure if this belongs on my personal or work blogs. Lets start with it on the personal and see how it goes:<\/p>\n<p>I left a well paid job in the It department of a telecoms company to take the less-well-paid and less-secure (possibly) freelance developer route.<\/p>\n<p>One of the main things that frustrated me about the big-corporate world was their insistence on using COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) software from big vendors. I was mostly using a product set from a very large, multi-national software supplier. Very much closed-source. And it was a nightmare.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It was expensive: initial licensing costs, ongoing support and maintenance costs, were both huge 6-figure sums.<\/li>\n<li>It was badly supported. Sometimes even getting the support team to acknowledge an issue was difficult. When they did, actually getting to deal with someone like a developer who understood what the product was doing was nigh-on impossible.<\/li>\n<li>It was badly written. Even basic defensive coding techniques were not employed. Things would break with no error, no log file message. I remember one particular Windows-based tool that crashed if you ran it as a different user to the one you installed it as. Shocking. No error message. No log. No test for the error and gracefully exit.<\/li>\n<li>Development\/release cycles were long. Aside from the fact that bug reports and enhancement requests were rarely actioned\/implemented, when they were, they were part of a three-month or six-month release cycle. No quick fixes!<\/li>\n<li>Development was mostly by acquisition. The product life cycle seemed to be: produce product roadmap, see useful features in competitors product, acquire competitor, declare competitors tool\/technology as &#8216;the next big thing&#8217;, scrap old product, goto 10 (if you know what I mean). Features promised on the roadmap (which we inevitably promised on to our clients) never appeared as the future was constantly being re-written.<\/li>\n<li>Products tried to be all things to all men &#8211; ended up doing nothing well.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>As a third-line support engineer trying to provide high-quality, high-value services to large corporate customers with huge wallets, it was incredibly frustrating having my hands tied by these constraints imposed upon me, despite paying exorbitant amounts for the pleasure. Telling a client &#8216;yes, I know it&#8217;s broken, it might be fixed sometime, it might never be fixed&#8217; was simply not acceptable.<\/p>\n<p>With OpenSource I see a bug, I investigate a bug, I fix a bug (note: I already have the fix at this point!), I submit a patch, usually released within weeks. Heck, even support is better. I use a premium forms plugin. I had a problem with something I was doing. It was investigated and fixed &#8211; with an updated, patched version of the plugin, within 48 hours. This in a product I paid a three-figure sum for.<\/p>\n<p>I think the key difference isn&#8217;t openness, documentation, flexibility, or cost. It&#8217;s that people who write OpenSource software give a damn. They care. The make things out of love for their trade.<\/p>\n<p>This is not true of all Open Source software: some people write stuff, release stuff, and then never update it. And I&#8217;m sure my experience of COTS isn&#8217;t universal.<\/p>\n<p>In contrats, COTS suppliers are in a race to the bottom: lower support and development costs, and increased profit. Support and development are just processes that employees follow as they resolve as many tickets as possible within SLA and cross tasks off a todo list. They&#8217;re just pawns in a game designed not to produce good software, but to put cash in shareholder&#8217;s pockets.<\/p>\n<p>Rant over. For me open-source wins.<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Open Source vs Commercial Off-the-Shelf Software",
        "content": "<p>A while ago I quit the commercial IT world to work as a freelance web developer. There were many aspect to this decision, but one of the big ones was frustration with the software that I had to use.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to blog about this for ages, then tonight, <a title=\"Elliott Richmond on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elliottrichmond\">Elliott Richmond<\/a> tweeted a link to <a title=\"Open Source vs Proprietary Software - SquareOne MD\" href=\"http:\/\/www.squareonemd.co.uk\/open-source-vs-proprietary-software\/\">a post he&#8217;d written about Open Source vs Proprietary software<\/a>, and I took it as an excuse to get my thoughts down. Those thoughts are collected here in a slightly edited copy of my comment on Elliott&#8217;s post.<\/p>\n<p>Elliott&#8217;s post is more about the topic in the context of website publishing and content management systems. my views are probably more about commercial software in general.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure if this belongs on my personal or work blogs. Lets start with it on the personal and see how it goes:<\/p>\n<p>I left a well paid job in the It department of a telecoms company to take the less-well-paid and less-secure (possibly) freelance developer route.<\/p>\n<p>One of the main things that frustrated me about the big-corporate world was their insistence on using COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) software from big vendors. I was mostly using a product set from a very large, multi-national software supplier. Very much closed-source. And it was a nightmare.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It was expensive: initial licensing costs, ongoing support and maintenance costs, were both huge 6-figure sums.<\/li>\n<li>It was badly supported. Sometimes even getting the support team to acknowledge an issue was difficult. When they did, actually getting to deal with someone like a developer who understood what the product was doing was nigh-on impossible.<\/li>\n<li>It was badly written. Even basic defensive coding techniques were not employed. Things would break with no error, no log file message. I remember one particular Windows-based tool that crashed if you ran it as a different user to the one you installed it as. Shocking. No error message. No log. No test for the error and gracefully exit.<\/li>\n<li>Development\/release cycles were long. Aside from the fact that bug reports and enhancement requests were rarely actioned\/implemented, when they were, they were part of a three-month or six-month release cycle. No quick fixes!<\/li>\n<li>Development was mostly by acquisition. The product life cycle seemed to be: produce product roadmap, see useful features in competitors product, acquire competitor, declare competitors tool\/technology as &#8216;the next big thing&#8217;, scrap old product, goto 10 (if you know what I mean). Features promised on the roadmap (which we inevitably promised on to our clients) never appeared as the future was constantly being re-written.<\/li>\n<li>Products tried to be all things to all men &#8211; ended up doing nothing well.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>As a third-line support engineer trying to provide high-quality, high-value services to large corporate customers with huge wallets, it was incredibly frustrating having my hands tied by these constraints imposed upon me, despite paying exorbitant amounts for the pleasure. Telling a client &#8216;yes, I know it&#8217;s broken, it might be fixed sometime, it might never be fixed&#8217; was simply not acceptable.<\/p>\n<p>With OpenSource I see a bug, I investigate a bug, I fix a bug (note: I already have the fix at this point!), I submit a patch, usually released within weeks. Heck, even support is better. I use a premium forms plugin. I had a problem with something I was doing. It was investigated and fixed &#8211; with an updated, patched version of the plugin, within 48 hours. This in a product I paid a three-figure sum for.<\/p>\n<p>I think the key difference isn&#8217;t openness, documentation, flexibility, or cost. It&#8217;s that people who write OpenSource software give a damn. They care. The make things out of love for their trade.<\/p>\n<p>This is not true of all Open Source software: some people write stuff, release stuff, and then never update it. And I&#8217;m sure my experience of COTS isn&#8217;t universal.<\/p>\n<p>In contrats, COTS suppliers are in a race to the bottom: lower support and development costs, and increased profit. Support and development are just processes that employees follow as they resolve as many tickets as possible within SLA and cross tasks off a todo list. They&#8217;re just pawns in a game designed not to produce good software, but to put cash in shareholder&#8217;s pockets.<\/p>\n<p>Rant over. For me open-source wins.<\/p>\n",

Shunning both the public nature of blogs and Twitter and the longer messages you can post to your friends and circles using Facebook or Google+ we&#8217;ve developed our own social network which we think you&#8217;ll agree pushes the boundaries of security, openness, and character limits.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Yes, today we are proud to announce the distributed, off-line social network that lets you communicate <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">with people in your own home<\/span> using messages comprised of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">just\u00a0one of each letter<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, contain your excitement, for today we launch<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1314 aligncenter\" title=\"Spongify logo\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/IMG_0206-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"Spongify\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/IMG_0206-300x224.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/IMG_0206-1024x764.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/IMG_0206-150x112.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Free from the technological constraints that apply to services like Twitter, Facebook, and SMS, Spongify lets you send short, non-real-time messages to those sharing your bathroom.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Yes, we hear you, doesn&#8217;t the limit imposed by having just one of each letter restrict what you can say? \u00a0And the answer is a resounding YES! But, rather than see this as a restriction, we see it as Spongify&#8217;s key feature.

Sorry. Time for a post though!<\/p>\n<p>The Wintle household has gotten increasingly grumpy as the effects of small-child-related sleep deprivation have kicked in. We&#8217;re normally pretty peaceful, happy folk, but Isaac really doesn&#8217;t sleep well and it&#8217;s taking its toll.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been grateful to those who have kept me looking on the sunny side. \u00a0In particular I&#8217;ve been enjoying <a title=\"Jennifer Begg - Live Free Range on Twiter\" href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/livefreerange\">Jennifer Begg&#8217;s<\/a> &#8220;Feel Good Friday&#8221; blogs (see &#8220;<a title=\"We Could Be Heros - Live Free Range\" href=\"http:\/\/livefreerange.com\/2012\/06\/14\/we-could-be-heroes\/\">We could be heros<\/a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a title=\"If Nothing We Do Matters - Live Free Range\" href=\"http:\/\/livefreerange.com\/2012\/06\/08\/if-nothing-we-do-matters\/\">If Nothing We Do Matters<\/a>&#8220;). And last night I came across <a title=\"Stuart Witts on Twitter\" href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/stuartwitts\">Stuart Witts<\/a>\u00a0whose\u00a0<a title=\"Stay Happy and Don't Die\" href=\"http:\/\/stayhappyanddontdie.com\">Stay Happy and Don&#8217;t Die<\/a> blog brought a smile to my face yesterday.<\/p>\n<p>I love my Twitters followees, and they constantly challenge me in numerous ways to be a better person. Today, I&#8217;m challenged to be more positive. Again.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright  wp-image-1298\" title=\"Ross in a Woolly Hat\" alt=\"Ross in a Woolly Hat\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small-300x199.jpg\" width=\"210\" height=\"139\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small-150x99.jpg 150w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" \/><\/a>I particularly like Stuarts <a title=\"Only in the leap from the Lion\u2019s head will he prove his worth\u2026 #lovemyhat  - Stay Happy and Don't Die\" href=\"http:\/\/stayhappyanddontdie.com\/?p=756\">#lovemyhat<\/a> project. A somewhat silly, very fun, pleasingly creative and highly positive month of millinery &#8211; like Movember for headgear. (I hope he doesn&#8217;t mind me thinking it was &#8216;somewhat silly&#8217; and I fully appreciate the seriousness of hat wearing &#8211; check out my Twitter profile pic on the right if you don&#8217;t believe me!)<\/p>\n<p>And that got me thinking&#8230;what silly little creative, fun project might I do? What are the fun little things in my life? Those things that are almost-trivial, possibly slightly embarassing, but that always make you &#8211; and others around you &#8211; happy?<\/p>\n<p>I think that play is massively important, not just to children, but to adults too. I&#8217;m reminded of the Museum of Childhood posters that I saw on <a title=\"Don't Forget Your Inner Child - Creative Review\" href=\"http:\/\/www.creativereview.co.uk\/cr-blog\/2008\/december\/dont-forget-your-inner-child\">Creative Review<\/a>, one of which is shown above. I&#8217;m reminded that play is a blessing. It gets you to let your guard down, open up, show the world &#8211; and sometimes yourself &#8211; a side that they wouldn&#8217;t normally see.<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;and this may not be for everyone&#8230;I was wondering if we might share how we play. \u00a0What silly things do you to to cheer yourself up. Are you a grown man that has a Scalextric in the loft? Is there a book, or toy that always makes you smile? Or a guilty-pleasure of a hobby? Perhaps you climb trees?\u00a0Or maybe you just go outside at night and gaze in wonder at the stars?<\/p>\n<p>I have lots of things that I class as play that bring joy. I can juggle (5 balls &#8211; 3 clubs &#8211; 1 devil stick) and do balloon modelling. I used to write really stupid poetry, and memorize the silly poems of others. \u00a0I love kids books &#8211; I have a complete Mr Men collection, but Roald Dahl, Dr Seuss and The Little Prince are favourites too. And I love to sit and play guitar &#8211; I&#8217;m not much good, but it&#8217;s such a great way of winding down and chilling out.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I have other forms of play that I&#8217;ll think of. But that will do for now. Perhaps I should pick up and blog about one of those things some day?<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t expect everyone to let their guard down and post a comment about how they play. But please stop and think&#8230;perhaps, like me, you&#8217;ve forgotten the little, simple things that make you smile. Go find those things and do those things. And I hope that a few might be willing to share too&#8230;what&#8217;s your inner child like? How do you play?<\/p>\n",

Sorry. Time for a post though!<\/p>\n<p>The Wintle household has gotten increasingly grumpy as the effects of small-child-related sleep deprivation have kicked in. We&#8217;re normally pretty peaceful, happy folk, but Isaac really doesn&#8217;t sleep well and it&#8217;s taking its toll.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been grateful to those who have kept me looking on the sunny side. \u00a0In particular I&#8217;ve been enjoying <a title=\"Jennifer Begg - Live Free Range on Twiter\" href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/livefreerange\">Jennifer Begg&#8217;s<\/a> &#8220;Feel Good Friday&#8221; blogs (see &#8220;<a title=\"We Could Be Heros - Live Free Range\" href=\"http:\/\/livefreerange.com\/2012\/06\/14\/we-could-be-heroes\/\">We could be heros<\/a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a title=\"If Nothing We Do Matters - Live Free Range\" href=\"http:\/\/livefreerange.com\/2012\/06\/08\/if-nothing-we-do-matters\/\">If Nothing We Do Matters<\/a>&#8220;). And last night I came across <a title=\"Stuart Witts on Twitter\" href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/stuartwitts\">Stuart Witts<\/a>\u00a0whose\u00a0<a title=\"Stay Happy and Don't Die\" href=\"http:\/\/stayhappyanddontdie.com\">Stay Happy and Don&#8217;t Die<\/a> blog brought a smile to my face yesterday.<\/p>\n<p>I love my Twitters followees, and they constantly challenge me in numerous ways to be a better person. Today, I&#8217;m challenged to be more positive. Again.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright  wp-image-1298\" title=\"Ross in a Woolly Hat\" alt=\"Ross in a Woolly Hat\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small-300x199.jpg\" width=\"210\" height=\"139\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small-150x99.jpg 150w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/DSC_0005-small.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" \/><\/a>I particularly like Stuarts <a title=\"Only in the leap from the Lion\u2019s head will he prove his worth\u2026 #lovemyhat  - Stay Happy and Don't Die\" href=\"http:\/\/stayhappyanddontdie.com\/?p=756\">#lovemyhat<\/a> project. A somewhat silly, very fun, pleasingly creative and highly positive month of millinery &#8211; like Movember for headgear. (I hope he doesn&#8217;t mind me thinking it was &#8216;somewhat silly&#8217; and I fully appreciate the seriousness of hat wearing &#8211; check out my Twitter profile pic on the right if you don&#8217;t believe me!)<\/p>\n<p>And that got me thinking&#8230;what silly little creative, fun project might I do? What are the fun little things in my life? Those things that are almost-trivial, possibly slightly embarassing, but that always make you &#8211; and others around you &#8211; happy?<\/p>\n<p>I think that play is massively important, not just to children, but to adults too. I&#8217;m reminded of the Museum of Childhood posters that I saw on <a title=\"Don't Forget Your Inner Child - Creative Review\" href=\"http:\/\/www.creativereview.co.uk\/cr-blog\/2008\/december\/dont-forget-your-inner-child\">Creative Review<\/a>, one of which is shown above. I&#8217;m reminded that play is a blessing. It gets you to let your guard down, open up, show the world &#8211; and sometimes yourself &#8211; a side that they wouldn&#8217;t normally see.<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;and this may not be for everyone&#8230;I was wondering if we might share how we play. \u00a0What silly things do you to to cheer yourself up. Are you a grown man that has a Scalextric in the loft? Is there a book, or toy that always makes you smile? Or a guilty-pleasure of a hobby? Perhaps you climb trees?\u00a0Or maybe you just go outside at night and gaze in wonder at the stars?<\/p>\n<p>I have lots of things that I class as play that bring joy. I can juggle (5 balls &#8211; 3 clubs &#8211; 1 devil stick) and do balloon modelling. I used to write really stupid poetry, and memorize the silly poems of others. \u00a0I love kids books &#8211; I have a complete Mr Men collection, but Roald Dahl, Dr Seuss and The Little Prince are favourites too. And I love to sit and play guitar &#8211; I&#8217;m not much good, but it&#8217;s such a great way of winding down and chilling out.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I have other forms of play that I&#8217;ll think of. But that will do for now. Perhaps I should pick up and blog about one of those things some day?<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t expect everyone to let their guard down and post a comment about how they play. But please stop and think&#8230;perhaps, like me, you&#8217;ve forgotten the little, simple things that make you smile. Go find those things and do those things. And I hope that a few might be willing to share too&#8230;what&#8217;s your inner child like? How do you play?<\/p>\n",

He proceeded to open his boot and take out a plastic petrol can.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>I had a bit of time so I offered to cycle off and get him some fuel, the nearest petrol station being about 2 miles away.  He asked if I was sure and I said I&#8217;d be much quicker than him and could use the exercise. He passed me some cash and told me to fill the can.<\/p>\n<p>Queuing to buy petrol on a bike was a strange experience, but I got him his fuel and cycled back. I felt good. He felt good.

It&#8217;s funny how, as a newbie parent myself, it&#8217;s so tempting to offer advice. I also had a conversation this week with someone else who was talking about the dilemma of offering this kind of &#8216;help&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>And the longer I am a parent, the more I believe that the best advice is not advice at all, its almost anti-advice.<\/p>\n<p>So I present the sum of my parenting knowledge:<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlearn <strong>everything<\/strong>. Be prepared to change all that you know or have been told<\/li>\n<li>You already know more than everyone else about your baby. People offer advice. Weigh it. Add your own thoughts and experience. And then make your own decision.<\/li>\n<li>Trust your instinct. Again, you know your baby better than anyone else. You&#8217;ll know when something is wrong, and when something is right.<\/li>\n<li>It does get better. Not at any particular point in time. People will say it gets better after 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, or any other specific time in the future. The truth is simply that &#8216;it will get better&#8217;.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s flippin hard work. Seriously. If someone tells you it&#8217;s hard work, think what that might be like and treble it&#8230;at least!<\/li>\n<li>Every baby is different. So you can generally ignore anyone that tells you what their baby was like.<\/li>\n<li>Every parent is different. So you can generally ignore anyone that gives you advice because you&#8217;ll do it your own way anyway.<\/li>\n<li>It is the most amazing thing. Caring for a tiny little person that you made. Introducing them to the world. Introducing the world to them. Staring at their hands thinking &#8216;I wonder what they&#8217;ll do&#8217; and at their feet and thinking &#8216;I wonder where they will walk&#8217;. It&#8217;s just incredible. The potential for life, love, work, joy, hope, kindness and so many other things wrapped up in a little person is overwhelming at times.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Maybe it doesn&#8217;t sound like it, but I&#8217;m actually HUGELY grateful to everyone that&#8217;s offered us help, advice, encouragement and prayer in our first few months with Isaac. But the truth is, we&#8217;ve listened to and, I hope, respected everyone&#8217;s opinions, and we&#8217;re doing things our own way.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m now about to give in to temptation and actually offer one concrete piece of advice myself. It&#8217;s not about feeding, nappies, which buggy to get, or how to get your baby to sleep. No. It&#8217;s this thing that people kept telling me early on which I initially found hard to believe but now hold firm to:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Treasure every moment!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Isaac no longer smells of baby. I miss that.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t need cuddling to sleep as much. I miss that. It used to be so annoying that he&#8217;d only drift off in our arms. Nowadays, I look for times when I can get to hold him for half an hour or so.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t mimic us any more. I miss that. For a few weeks he tried to copy the sounds that we were making. Now he just makes whatever sounds he wants to regardless of what were babbling at him.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t fit in his baby clothes. He&#8217;s in 6-9 months sizes now. He had some nice outfits. We miss that.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t poo as often. Bizarrely&#8230;I miss that! Change time used to mostly be a fun time. Now it&#8217;s infrequent and a chore.<\/p>\n<p>So many things Isaac did, or that we did with him, have already changed or gone. If you have a young baby, (s)he will be different by this time next week. Enjoy what they&#8217;re like now, even if it&#8217;s difficult and stressful, because they won&#8217;t be like it again.<\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s funny how, as a newbie parent myself, it&#8217;s so tempting to offer advice. I also had a conversation this week with someone else who was talking about the dilemma of offering this kind of &#8216;help&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>And the longer I am a parent, the more I believe that the best advice is not advice at all, its almost anti-advice.<\/p>\n<p>So I present the sum of my parenting knowledge:<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlearn <strong>everything<\/strong>. Be prepared to change all that you know or have been told<\/li>\n<li>You already know more than everyone else about your baby. People offer advice. Weigh it. Add your own thoughts and experience. And then make your own decision.<\/li>\n<li>Trust your instinct. Again, you know your baby better than anyone else. You&#8217;ll know when something is wrong, and when something is right.<\/li>\n<li>It does get better. Not at any particular point in time. People will say it gets better after 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, or any other specific time in the future. The truth is simply that &#8216;it will get better&#8217;.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s flippin hard work. Seriously. If someone tells you it&#8217;s hard work, think what that might be like and treble it&#8230;at least!<\/li>\n<li>Every baby is different. So you can generally ignore anyone that tells you what their baby was like.<\/li>\n<li>Every parent is different. So you can generally ignore anyone that gives you advice because you&#8217;ll do it your own way anyway.<\/li>\n<li>It is the most amazing thing. Caring for a tiny little person that you made. Introducing them to the world. Introducing the world to them. Staring at their hands thinking &#8216;I wonder what they&#8217;ll do&#8217; and at their feet and thinking &#8216;I wonder where they will walk&#8217;. It&#8217;s just incredible. The potential for life, love, work, joy, hope, kindness and so many other things wrapped up in a little person is overwhelming at times.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Maybe it doesn&#8217;t sound like it, but I&#8217;m actually HUGELY grateful to everyone that&#8217;s offered us help, advice, encouragement and prayer in our first few months with Isaac. But the truth is, we&#8217;ve listened to and, I hope, respected everyone&#8217;s opinions, and we&#8217;re doing things our own way.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m now about to give in to temptation and actually offer one concrete piece of advice myself. It&#8217;s not about feeding, nappies, which buggy to get, or how to get your baby to sleep. No. It&#8217;s this thing that people kept telling me early on which I initially found hard to believe but now hold firm to:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Treasure every moment!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Isaac no longer smells of baby. I miss that.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t need cuddling to sleep as much. I miss that. It used to be so annoying that he&#8217;d only drift off in our arms. Nowadays, I look for times when I can get to hold him for half an hour or so.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t mimic us any more. I miss that. For a few weeks he tried to copy the sounds that we were making. Now he just makes whatever sounds he wants to regardless of what were babbling at him.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t fit in his baby clothes. He&#8217;s in 6-9 months sizes now. He had some nice outfits. We miss that.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t poo as often. Bizarrely&#8230;I miss that! Change time used to mostly be a fun time. Now it&#8217;s infrequent and a chore.<\/p>\n<p>So many things Isaac did, or that we did with him, have already changed or gone. If you have a young baby, (s)he will be different by this time next week. Enjoy what they&#8217;re like now, even if it&#8217;s difficult and stressful, because they won&#8217;t be like it again.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>So&#8230;after much deliberation, and with a hint of guilt, we put a deposit on a new car today.<\/p>\n<p>It was not a quick or easy decision, but our old car is fast approaching 100&#8217;000 miles, is slowly generating a few faults, and with the arrival of Isaac, is just too small &#8211; once the buggy base is in the back of our current car there&#8217;s not room for much else.  We&#8217;re increasingly making trips to see the in-laws down in Devon, and increasingly wanting to offer lifts to other people, sometimes other families who don&#8217;t have cars, so wanting a new car wasn&#8217;t just about us &#8211; it&#8217;s about family and friends too.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Yes, I&#8217;m into using cycling as transport, but I&#8217;m not totally anti-car. Cars have their place. But they should be viewed as a convenience and a privilege, not as a human right.<\/p>\n<p>So we went looking. I suppose I wanted something between a small car and a people carrier, but wasn&#8217;t sure if any such thing existed. It turns out there&#8217;s a whole world of &#8216;midi-MPV&#8217;s that are just what I was after.<\/p>\n<p>The first one we found was a Toyota Corolla Verso. We were immediately impressed with the space and versatility. Some Internet research showed Toyotas to be reliable and easy to drive, and the Verso to be spoken of very positively &#8211; if with a modicum of disdain for its lack of &#8216;fun&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>The reviews also seemed to imply that the diesel has more like the level of get up and go that a car of this size needs.<\/p>\n<p>We were liked this car from the outset.  And we got a very positive impression from the reviews of this vehicle than we got from the reviews of Peugeots and Renaults we saw when looking for a small car a few years ago.<\/p>\n<p>Aside: My favourite review of the Verso said:<br \/>\n&#8211; What does the car make the neighbours think? : &#8216;That my wife is a childminder&#8217;<br \/>\n&#8211; Why did you buy this car? : &#8216;Because my wife is a childminder&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>We had a choice of three. One we weren&#8217;t interested in as it had some visible trim damage and higher mileage. Which left us with a 2.0 diesel &#8211; the slightly cheaper of the two and the more efficient car, but older and with twice as many miles on the clock. And a 1.8 petrol, 2008 model with 30,000 miles. It&#8217;s less efficient but cheaper to insure.<\/p>\n<p>The diesel sold before we got to make a purchase so we were left with the &#8217;08 petrol.<\/p>\n<p>A quick spin put any fears of it not having enough &#8216;oomph&#8217; to rest.  It&#8217;s quite nippy, at least when empty.<\/p>\n<p>We did some other shopping around too, but it was fruitless. This car was ideal and appeared to be a bargain.<\/p>\n<p>I w shocked that our old Peugeot was only valued for trade-in at \u00a3200. As I said at the time &#8216;it&#8217;s got \u00a3200 worth of tyres on it!&#8217;, but it&#8217;ll be convenient not to have to make the sale privately, and they gave us a bigger valuation in the end.<\/p>\n<p>So, the deal is done. We pick up on Friday, and will officially own a 5+2 sweater family car.  It&#8217;s a bit more than we set out to pay, but the car&#8217;s age and mileage and versatility means it will last us, hopefully, many years.<\/p>\n<p>Have my cyclist credentials been ruined? Have I self-justified this purchase enough? Or is it just amazing what having a baby does to you?<\/p>\n",

We&#8217;re increasingly making trips to see the in-laws down in Devon, and increasingly wanting to offer lifts to other people, sometimes other families who don&#8217;t have cars, so wanting a new car wasn&#8217;t just about us &#8211; it&#8217;s about family and friends too.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Yes, I&#8217;m into using cycling as transport, but I&#8217;m not totally anti-car. Cars have their place. But they should be viewed as a convenience and a privilege, not as a human right.<\/p>\n<p>So we went looking. I suppose I wanted something between a small car and a people carrier, but wasn&#8217;t sure if any such thing existed. It turns out there&#8217;s a whole world of &#8216;midi-MPV&#8217;s that are just what I was after.<\/p>\n<p>The first one we found was a Toyota Corolla Verso. We were immediately impressed with the space and versatility. Some Internet research showed Toyotas to be reliable and easy to drive, and the Verso to be spoken of very positively &#8211; if with a modicum of disdain for its lack of &#8216;fun&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>The reviews also seemed to imply that the diesel has more like the level of get up and go that a car of this size needs.<\/p>\n<p>We were liked this car from the outset.  And we got a very positive impression from the reviews of this vehicle than we got from the reviews of Peugeots and Renaults we saw when looking for a small car a few years ago.<\/p>\n<p>Aside: My favourite review of the Verso said:<br \/>\n&#8211; What does the car make the neighbours think? : &#8216;That my wife is a childminder&#8217;<br \/>\n&#8211; Why did you buy this car? : &#8216;Because my wife is a childminder&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>We had a choice of three. One we weren&#8217;t interested in as it had some visible trim damage and higher mileage. Which left us with a 2.0 diesel &#8211; the slightly cheaper of the two and the more efficient car, but older and with twice as many miles on the clock. And a 1.8 petrol, 2008 model with 30,000 miles. It&#8217;s less efficient but cheaper to insure.<\/p>\n<p>The diesel sold before we got to make a purchase so we were left with the &#8217;08 petrol.<\/p>\n<p>A quick spin put any fears of it not having enough &#8216;oomph&#8217; to rest.  It&#8217;s quite nippy, at least when empty.<\/p>\n<p>We did some other shopping around too, but it was fruitless. This car was ideal and appeared to be a bargain.<\/p>\n<p>I w shocked that our old Peugeot was only valued for trade-in at \u00a3200. As I said at the time &#8216;it&#8217;s got \u00a3200 worth of tyres on it!&#8217;, but it&#8217;ll be convenient not to have to make the sale privately, and they gave us a bigger valuation in the end.<\/p>\n<p>So, the deal is done. We pick up on Friday, and will officially own a 5+2 sweater family car.  It&#8217;s a bit more than we set out to pay, but the car&#8217;s age and mileage and versatility means it will last us, hopefully, many years.<\/p>\n<p>Have my cyclist credentials been ruined? Have I self-justified this purchase enough? Or is it just amazing what having a baby does to you?<\/p>\n",
