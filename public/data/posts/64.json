Partly this is because I wanted to automate the &#8220;Pins&#8221; part of making weeknotes, because it was a right bind to do manually, but also I just dropped the ball.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I love my weeknotes, they&#8217;re useful for me if no one else, and I&#8217;m keen to get going with them again. AND I have hope for a couple of new sections:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>&#8220;<strong>This Week I Learned<\/strong>&#8220;: Some hopefully-hot tip that I picked up this week<\/li><li>&#8220;<strong>Toolbox<\/strong>&#8220;: Highlighting a tool (software or otherwise) that I use in my work or life that may be of interest <\/li><li>&#8220;<strong>The Time Machine<\/strong>&#8220;: Where I&#8217;ll try to resurface old-but-popular content<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I just got back from a week&#8217;s camping in the New Forest with my family, and it&#8217;s all systems go for the last week of the school holidays!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I had two GREAT days of work in there and exciting things are happening &#8211; I even submitted a talk to WordCamp London and will await a response to that nervously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a while, so here&#8217;s some of what I&#8217;ve been working on in the last few months<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>I re-launched this site with a quirky new design and some developer-related easter eggs on the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/\">homepage<\/a>! Yay!<\/li><li>I built <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/sync-pinboard\/\">a WordPress plugin to sync Pinboard bookmarks<\/a> to a WordPress custom post type, and built my first Gutenberg block, all using vanilla JS and CSS with no build tools!<\/li><li>Started re-making <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/\">my business website<\/a> in <a href=\"https:\/\/statamic.com\/\">Statamic<\/a>! Also with vanilla JS and CSS and no build tools.<\/li><li>Finishing off (but not yet putting live) a mysterious Laravel project involving some in-depth API work. I also love that this project has a proper test suite &#8211; it&#8217;s not 100% coverage or TDD or anything, but enough to give me some confidence.<\/li><li>Continued working on a secret project that I&#8217;m VERY excited about that&#8217;s for probably my best client ever.<\/li><li>Finishing off and go-live of the new website for my local history project, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rodbournehistory.org\/\">Rodbourne Community History Group<\/a>. It looks like a simple Divi-builder site but there&#8217;s been a LOT of complicated work migrating content in, using custom post types and custom meta fields, ensuring meta-data is as complete as I can get it (extracting content from old HTML into structured data) and stuff like that.<\/li><li>Began and ended a small website build for <a href=\"https:\/\/separatedchild.org\/\">The Separated Child Foundation<\/a>. This was also a Divi-builder project but the key here has been squeezing as much value as possible out for the client &#8211; who were brilliant! I&#8217;ve been trying to work on bigger projects recently, buy I loved this cause and wanted to use my skills to support the foundation, who are really pleased with the result. <\/li><li>Started work on a re-build of a micro-site for a large charity that I&#8217;ve worked with for years. This is quick-turnaround after a long design phase. Should be done pretty soon.<\/li><li>Helped out a new client with a quick support request which turned out to be a permissions issue. But the kind of thing they needed an expert to diagnose and fix as no-one else could.<\/li><li>Cleaning up a (fortunately simple) <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.nintechnet.com\/unauthenticated-option-changes-in-wordpress-simple-301-redirects-addon-bulk-uploader-plugin\/\">malware attack<\/a> for a client who had a plugin installed with a huge (but limited severity) security hole.<\/li><li>Helping a new client review some at-scale hosting proposals they had for their new site &#8211; this required some quite in-depth hosting and security knowledge and the client were really happy with the result.<\/li><li>LOADS of small support requests and changes for existing clients.<\/li><li>Attended and spoke at WordCamp London (the official video of the talk isn&#8217;t ready yet, but you can see it from the LiveStream <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GcibNG6gUjE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3596\">here<\/a> &#8211; I was SO happy with it) and attended WordCamp Bristol.<\/li><li>Was temporarily a Government Petitions Data expert when the Revoke Article 50 petition went live &#8211; all because I <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/\">track petition data<\/a>!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve written a few blog posts since February<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/03\/a-new-look\/\">A new look: What?

I ditched Adobe Creative Cloud a long time ago now, but occasionally I have to work with designers that use Illustrator or InDesign or send me a PDF or something. I don&#8217;t want to pay for CC just to open these files to get assets and measurements out. And the Serif Suite has been the perfect alternative.

Partly this is because I wanted to automate the &#8220;Pins&#8221; part of making weeknotes, because it was a right bind to do manually, but also I just dropped the ball.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I love my weeknotes, they&#8217;re useful for me if no one else, and I&#8217;m keen to get going with them again. AND I have hope for a couple of new sections:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>&#8220;<strong>This Week I Learned<\/strong>&#8220;: Some hopefully-hot tip that I picked up this week<\/li><li>&#8220;<strong>Toolbox<\/strong>&#8220;: Highlighting a tool (software or otherwise) that I use in my work or life that may be of interest <\/li><li>&#8220;<strong>The Time Machine<\/strong>&#8220;: Where I&#8217;ll try to resurface old-but-popular content<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I just got back from a week&#8217;s camping in the New Forest with my family, and it&#8217;s all systems go for the last week of the school holidays!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I had two GREAT days of work in there and exciting things are happening &#8211; I even submitted a talk to WordCamp London and will await a response to that nervously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a while, so here&#8217;s some of what I&#8217;ve been working on in the last few months<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>I re-launched this site with a quirky new design and some developer-related easter eggs on the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/\">homepage<\/a>! Yay!<\/li><li>I built <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/sync-pinboard\/\">a WordPress plugin to sync Pinboard bookmarks<\/a> to a WordPress custom post type, and built my first Gutenberg block, all using vanilla JS and CSS with no build tools!<\/li><li>Started re-making <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/\">my business website<\/a> in <a href=\"https:\/\/statamic.com\/\">Statamic<\/a>! Also with vanilla JS and CSS and no build tools.<\/li><li>Finishing off (but not yet putting live) a mysterious Laravel project involving some in-depth API work. I also love that this project has a proper test suite &#8211; it&#8217;s not 100% coverage or TDD or anything, but enough to give me some confidence.<\/li><li>Continued working on a secret project that I&#8217;m VERY excited about that&#8217;s for probably my best client ever.<\/li><li>Finishing off and go-live of the new website for my local history project, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rodbournehistory.org\/\">Rodbourne Community History Group<\/a>. It looks like a simple Divi-builder site but there&#8217;s been a LOT of complicated work migrating content in, using custom post types and custom meta fields, ensuring meta-data is as complete as I can get it (extracting content from old HTML into structured data) and stuff like that.<\/li><li>Began and ended a small website build for <a href=\"https:\/\/separatedchild.org\/\">The Separated Child Foundation<\/a>. This was also a Divi-builder project but the key here has been squeezing as much value as possible out for the client &#8211; who were brilliant! I&#8217;ve been trying to work on bigger projects recently, buy I loved this cause and wanted to use my skills to support the foundation, who are really pleased with the result. <\/li><li>Started work on a re-build of a micro-site for a large charity that I&#8217;ve worked with for years. This is quick-turnaround after a long design phase. Should be done pretty soon.<\/li><li>Helped out a new client with a quick support request which turned out to be a permissions issue. But the kind of thing they needed an expert to diagnose and fix as no-one else could.<\/li><li>Cleaning up a (fortunately simple) <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.nintechnet.com\/unauthenticated-option-changes-in-wordpress-simple-301-redirects-addon-bulk-uploader-plugin\/\">malware attack<\/a> for a client who had a plugin installed with a huge (but limited severity) security hole.<\/li><li>Helping a new client review some at-scale hosting proposals they had for their new site &#8211; this required some quite in-depth hosting and security knowledge and the client were really happy with the result.<\/li><li>LOADS of small support requests and changes for existing clients.<\/li><li>Attended and spoke at WordCamp London (the official video of the talk isn&#8217;t ready yet, but you can see it from the LiveStream <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GcibNG6gUjE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3596\">here<\/a> &#8211; I was SO happy with it) and attended WordCamp Bristol.<\/li><li>Was temporarily a Government Petitions Data expert when the Revoke Article 50 petition went live &#8211; all because I <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/\">track petition data<\/a>!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve written a few blog posts since February<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/03\/a-new-look\/\">A new look: What?

I ditched Adobe Creative Cloud a long time ago now, but occasionally I have to work with designers that use Illustrator or InDesign or send me a PDF or something. I don&#8217;t want to pay for CC just to open these files to get assets and measurements out. And the Serif Suite has been the perfect alternative.

But it&#8217;s not true!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And after a two-figure number of years of being married, my wife and I have kinda figured out that we can&#8217;t read each other&#8217;s minds! Who knew?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we realised &#8211; probably actually a long time ago, but it crystallized in its practicality recently &#8211; was that we quite often have expectations of what we will get done in a given day, and that we carry these expectations in our heads, totally unspoken.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I might wake up and think: &#8220;I need to mow the lawn, put petrol in the car, and take all that junk I&#8217;ve been piling up to the tip&#8221;. My wife might wake up and think: &#8220;I need to do that long run or I&#8217;ll never make it round the half marathon, I need to put in a couple of hours work to prep for a workshop and I wish Ross would put that stuff back in the loft&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I, kinda on a whim, suggested we get these things out of our heads and on to paper. So I invented the &#8220;Family Brain&#8221;:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/IMG_9835-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Friday Family Brain on the breakfast table\" class=\"wp-image-8578\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/IMG_9835-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/IMG_9835-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/IMG_9835-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is literally just a piece of paper with a column for each person. You start afresh each day and write down what you think needs to happen that day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve done it you might need to actually talk to each other to prioritise and maybe postpone some things. But the Family Brain facilitates this by getting the stuff out of your head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought this was a ridiculous solution, something proper grown up have been doing for years, or simply don&#8217;t need. But I posted the idea in a Facebook thread about anxiety and brain-overwhelm yesterday and it struck a chord:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>&#8220;omg the family brain sounds amazing!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>&#8220;That family brain idea is genius.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>&#8220;Family brain is brilliant.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>&#8220;Love the family brain idea.  Funnily enough hubby and I have recently instinctively started doing  something similar. I don\u2019t know why we assume we can read each other\u2019s  minds but it\u2019s SO much easier having it on paper!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So I thought I&#8217;d get the idea out of a closed Facebook group and into the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now go&#8230;share what&#8217;s in your head!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Looking around social media, it often looks like everyone else has their life planned down to every last car-refuelling and bathroom-cleaning activity. But it&#8217;s not true!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And after a two-figure number of years of being married, my wife and I have kinda figured out that we can&#8217;t read each other&#8217;s minds! Who knew?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we realised &#8211; probably actually a long time ago, but it crystallized in its practicality recently &#8211; was that we quite often have expectations of what we will get done in a given day, and that we carry these expectations in our heads, totally unspoken.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I might wake up and think: &#8220;I need to mow the lawn, put petrol in the car, and take all that junk I&#8217;ve been piling up to the tip&#8221;. My wife might wake up and think: &#8220;I need to do that long run or I&#8217;ll never make it round the half marathon, I need to put in a couple of hours work to prep for a workshop and I wish Ross would put that stuff back in the loft&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I, kinda on a whim, suggested we get these things out of our heads and on to paper. So I invented the &#8220;Family Brain&#8221;:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/IMG_9835-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Friday Family Brain on the breakfast table\" class=\"wp-image-8578\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/IMG_9835-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/IMG_9835-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/IMG_9835-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is literally just a piece of paper with a column for each person. You start afresh each day and write down what you think needs to happen that day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve done it you might need to actually talk to each other to prioritise and maybe postpone some things. But the Family Brain facilitates this by getting the stuff out of your head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought this was a ridiculous solution, something proper grown up have been doing for years, or simply don&#8217;t need. But I posted the idea in a Facebook thread about anxiety and brain-overwhelm yesterday and it struck a chord:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>&#8220;omg the family brain sounds amazing!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>&#8220;That family brain idea is genius.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>&#8220;Family brain is brilliant.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>&#8220;Love the family brain idea.  Funnily enough hubby and I have recently instinctively started doing  something similar. I don\u2019t know why we assume we can read each other\u2019s  minds but it\u2019s SO much easier having it on paper!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So I thought I&#8217;d get the idea out of a closed Facebook group and into the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now go&#8230;share what&#8217;s in your head!<\/p>\n",

At the start of the long summer holiday I was thinking how this was a LONG time and would really drag, but gosh it&#8217;s flown by. But we&#8217;re about to return to the regular routine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been doing hosting stuff, development stuff, and other stuff. Which is pretty much my life. Side projects are taking a bit of a back seat while I focus on some things that need to be done for students going back to school or university. Things with proper hard deadlines!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve always said I would HATE to be a construction company building schools because the deadlines are so fixed. I&#8217;ve built things like advent calendars and new-year projects. But I tend to avoid projects with super-hard deadlines UNLESS the client seems to show a real understanding of the process involved and possible compromises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Made some big additions to a clever <strong>WordPress<\/strong> thing I&#8217;m making for a client. It&#8217;s a simple-but-effective tool using some simple <strong>JavaScript<\/strong>, <strong>AJAX<\/strong> and <strong>custom tables<\/strong> to link things together. Oh, and there&#8217;s a <strong>custom CSV import<\/strong> too. There was a dilemma about using custom tables or custom post types, but I had to deliver quickly and relatively cheaply so I just had to make a decision and go with it. I think I got it right.<\/li><li>Progressed a <strong>WordPress micro-site build<\/strong> I&#8217;m doing for a big charity, including building my first <strong>ACF-powered Gutenberg block<\/strong>!<\/li><li>Did a bunch of changes to a site I&#8217;m looking after for a smaller charity. This is an interesting one because the theme is quite fixed and they are wanting to make frequent changes to it. The current layout tools aren&#8217;t working, so I&#8217;m hoping to help them break free of the current constraints at some point and make it a bit more flexible.<\/li><li>A new <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/petitions\/269157\"><strong>government petition<\/strong><\/a> went crazy for a while so I became temporary government petitions expert for a short time, because I run <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/269157\"><strong>a service that tracks petition growth<\/strong><\/a>. This one hasn&#8217;t quite blown up like the <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/241584\">article 50 petition<\/a> did.<\/li><li>I recorded an informal &#8220;fireside chat&#8221; with <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/keithdevon\/\">Keith Devon<\/a> that may or may not become an edition of his EXCELLENT <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/\">Pricing WordPress<\/a> podcast. Watch that space (not this one).<\/li><li>The week ended with me <strong>supporting a small community group<\/strong> doing a 10 mile walk\/run. <strong>I was bike marshall<\/strong>, and yes, it was just an excuse to clock up some decent bike miles (and vertical metres too!).

So <strong>I&#8217;ve been thinking for a while about buying a big camping trolley<\/strong>, as we could use it for camping and days out, but also for doing big shopping trips without driving the car to literally-the-end-of-our-street.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a bit of research I found what appeared to be a good balance of value, functionality, capacity, and foldability in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Kampa-Trucker-Trolley\/dp\/B00IF61YHO\">K<strong>ampa Trucker<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a heavy thing of its own, but this is because it&#8217;s a beast of a thing that will take 100kg of stuff.

        "content": "\n<p>Wow &#8211; so school is back this week!! At the start of the long summer holiday I was thinking how this was a LONG time and would really drag, but gosh it&#8217;s flown by. But we&#8217;re about to return to the regular routine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been doing hosting stuff, development stuff, and other stuff. Which is pretty much my life. Side projects are taking a bit of a back seat while I focus on some things that need to be done for students going back to school or university. Things with proper hard deadlines!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve always said I would HATE to be a construction company building schools because the deadlines are so fixed. I&#8217;ve built things like advent calendars and new-year projects. But I tend to avoid projects with super-hard deadlines UNLESS the client seems to show a real understanding of the process involved and possible compromises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Made some big additions to a clever <strong>WordPress<\/strong> thing I&#8217;m making for a client. It&#8217;s a simple-but-effective tool using some simple <strong>JavaScript<\/strong>, <strong>AJAX<\/strong> and <strong>custom tables<\/strong> to link things together. Oh, and there&#8217;s a <strong>custom CSV import<\/strong> too. There was a dilemma about using custom tables or custom post types, but I had to deliver quickly and relatively cheaply so I just had to make a decision and go with it. I think I got it right.<\/li><li>Progressed a <strong>WordPress micro-site build<\/strong> I&#8217;m doing for a big charity, including building my first <strong>ACF-powered Gutenberg block<\/strong>!<\/li><li>Did a bunch of changes to a site I&#8217;m looking after for a smaller charity. This is an interesting one because the theme is quite fixed and they are wanting to make frequent changes to it. The current layout tools aren&#8217;t working, so I&#8217;m hoping to help them break free of the current constraints at some point and make it a bit more flexible.<\/li><li>A new <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/petitions\/269157\"><strong>government petition<\/strong><\/a> went crazy for a while so I became temporary government petitions expert for a short time, because I run <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/269157\"><strong>a service that tracks petition growth<\/strong><\/a>. This one hasn&#8217;t quite blown up like the <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/241584\">article 50 petition<\/a> did.<\/li><li>I recorded an informal &#8220;fireside chat&#8221; with <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/keithdevon\/\">Keith Devon<\/a> that may or may not become an edition of his EXCELLENT <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/\">Pricing WordPress<\/a> podcast. Watch that space (not this one).<\/li><li>The week ended with me <strong>supporting a small community group<\/strong> doing a 10 mile walk\/run. <strong>I was bike marshall<\/strong>, and yes, it was just an excuse to clock up some decent bike miles (and vertical metres too!). But I was handing out Jelly Babies and encouragement and keeping track of everyone as well.

So <strong>I&#8217;ve been thinking for a while about buying a big camping trolley<\/strong>, as we could use it for camping and days out, but also for doing big shopping trips without driving the car to literally-the-end-of-our-street.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a bit of research I found what appeared to be a good balance of value, functionality, capacity, and foldability in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Kampa-Trucker-Trolley\/dp\/B00IF61YHO\">K<strong>ampa Trucker<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a heavy thing of its own, but this is because it&#8217;s a beast of a thing that will take 100kg of stuff. It&#8217;s great. We didn&#8217;t actually take it on our recent camping holiday as it wouldn&#8217;t fit in the car (not sure how to solve that one).

I don&#8217;t follow a lot of it directly, but some of the detail has come to me indirectly. It&#8217;s horrible for all sorts of reasons I won&#8217;t go into here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;I want to point out that this drama is a tiny-but-highly-visible portion of what goes on in tech communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week I got some amazing help from one of the communities I chat with. Free technical help from 4 or 5 people who wanted nothing in return, and when I offered they suggested I gave to charity, which I willingly did this morning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what&#8217;s happening underneath all the drama all the time. In WordPress. In Laravel. In Statamic. In whatever places you hang out there will be good stuff happening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People helping each other and looking out for one another. People teaming up for support. People being friends and virtual co-workers. People busy answering forum questions. People building cool free (as in both beer and speech) stuff that makes our lives easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, we need to tackle what&#8217;s bad in these communities. That&#8217;s SUPER important. But let&#8217;s also elevate, promote, shout about the good stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Promote an <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/BinaryMoon\/wp-toolbelt\/\">open source project<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/timnash.co.uk\/blog\/\">blog<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/worknotes.co.uk\/\">resource<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/\">podcast<\/a>.<\/li><li>Give <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet\/?text=Thank%20you%20%3Cinsert%20persons%20name%20here%3E...%20!%20You're%20awesome%20because%20you%20%3Cinsert%20awesome%20thing%20they%20did%3E!\">thanks online for the help you get<\/a>.<\/li><li>Offer to actually buy a coffee or beer (use <a href=\"https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/\">Ko-fi.com<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/paypal.me\">paypal.me<\/a> if helpful) or give to charity when someone gives you help and saves you time\/money.<\/li><li>Support people who do good work.<\/li><li>Collaborate with your competitors.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s so much good stuff going on.

                "rendered": "\n<p>We had a camping holiday recently &#8211; our first in four years or so. We were blessed with brilliant weather and a great location and we loved the week we had, but, being a thoughtful person, there were a few thoughts I had about the camping experience that I thought I&#8217;d jot down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why don&#8217;t campsites have water boilers?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Seriously. This should be a thing. Campsites have toilets and showers and washing up points. Electrical heaters of various sorts. Some of which made very hot water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I wondered&#8230;why is it that campsites don&#8217;t have those on-demand water boilers? So much gas must be used up boiling water on camping stoves. And we put so much effort into managing our supply of hot water (filling a super-insulated flask with hot water the night before so you don&#8217;t have to wait for your morning cuppa).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d gladly pay a little extra to stay on a campsite that has a boiler I can just walk up to and get boiling water out of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone do this, please?! And make it standard for campsites everywhere!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Campsite life<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I love about campsites is the huge mix of people you get. I find that camping attracts people from a much greater variety of walks of life than hotels and holiday parks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while everyone gets on pretty nicely, there&#8217;s etiquette and both spoken (or write) and unspoken rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do sometimes think it would be good to do a documentary of life on a campsite. An outdoor version of Big Brother with a diary room where people can come in and air their grievances about that thing the people on the pitch next-door did.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or where people get interviewed about why they have come. We met all sorts of interesting people. A woman camping on her own for the first time who was between jobs. An aunt who was taking her nephew and niece camping for the first time, hoping she can be trusted by the parents to do it again. Stuff like that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems everyone has a story and it would be interesting to have it documented.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just not on MY holiday, thank you! ?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Swapping indoor and outdoor time<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As most parents, we have a constant struggle with &#8220;screen time&#8221; with our children. We feel it&#8217;s pretty under control here. We&#8217;ve created some good rules. But seeing how much our kids love being outdoors when camping I wondered&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if we swapped the rule? If we said that they could have as much indoor and screen time as they wanted, but that their outdoor time was limited to an hour a day. Would that make the outdoor time something that they craved?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably not. But maybe an interesting experiment for some time in the future.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>We had a camping holiday recently &#8211; our first in four years or so. We were blessed with brilliant weather and a great location and we loved the week we had, but, being a thoughtful person, there were a few thoughts I had about the camping experience that I thought I&#8217;d jot down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why don&#8217;t campsites have water boilers?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Seriously. This should be a thing. Campsites have toilets and showers and washing up points. Electrical heaters of various sorts. Some of which made very hot water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I wondered&#8230;why is it that campsites don&#8217;t have those on-demand water boilers? So much gas must be used up boiling water on camping stoves. And we put so much effort into managing our supply of hot water (filling a super-insulated flask with hot water the night before so you don&#8217;t have to wait for your morning cuppa).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d gladly pay a little extra to stay on a campsite that has a boiler I can just walk up to and get boiling water out of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone do this, please?! And make it standard for campsites everywhere!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Campsite life<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I love about campsites is the huge mix of people you get. I find that camping attracts people from a much greater variety of walks of life than hotels and holiday parks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while everyone gets on pretty nicely, there&#8217;s etiquette and both spoken (or write) and unspoken rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do sometimes think it would be good to do a documentary of life on a campsite. An outdoor version of Big Brother with a diary room where people can come in and air their grievances about that thing the people on the pitch next-door did.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or where people get interviewed about why they have come. We met all sorts of interesting people. A woman camping on her own for the first time who was between jobs. An aunt who was taking her nephew and niece camping for the first time, hoping she can be trusted by the parents to do it again. Stuff like that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems everyone has a story and it would be interesting to have it documented.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just not on MY holiday, thank you! ?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Swapping indoor and outdoor time<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As most parents, we have a constant struggle with &#8220;screen time&#8221; with our children. We feel it&#8217;s pretty under control here. We&#8217;ve created some good rules. But seeing how much our kids love being outdoors when camping I wondered&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if we swapped the rule? If we said that they could have as much indoor and screen time as they wanted, but that their outdoor time was limited to an hour a day. Would that make the outdoor time something that they craved?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably not. But maybe an interesting experiment for some time in the future.<\/p>\n",

I, unfortunately, have come down with a nasty cold. So I&#8217;m not running at 100% capacity. But it&#8217;s been a good week nonetheless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been continuing to work on a charity microsite re-build that I&#8217;m doing in WordPress with vanilla JS and CSS, and building more ACF Gutenberg blocks. I&#8217;m loving this approach for small projects. It&#8217;s got it&#8217;s problems, but so has any method\/framework. And the simplicity of it is great and, in my opinion, the pros outweigh the cons for small projects like this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>I did a big chunk of maintenance for a site that I look after for a small charity client.<\/li><li>Sorted out some <strong>Google Tag Manager and analytics event issues<\/strong> for a client, and learned a few things along the way<\/li><li>Spent an hour or so <strong>helping a client fix up some old micro sites<\/strong> that had been broken by a compulsory PHP upgrade that their hosting company made months ago. This was one of those things were not-every-WordPress-person would have had the skills to diagnose and fix it as I was <strong>digging around in logs and debugging other people&#8217;s stuff<\/strong>.

Watch that space (not this one).<\/li><li>Over the weekend, from my bed-of-poorliness, I started upgrading some of my side projects&#8217; Laravel versions. The excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/laravelshift.com\/\">Laravel Shift<\/a> service can automate this for you, but my apps are really simple and I wanted to experience the manual approach.

A couple of years back I tried some cheap Bluetooth wireless ear buds. They weren&#8217;t much good. So I tried a second time paying a bit more and found <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Skullcandy-Bluetooth-Wireless-Ear-Earbuds-Black\/dp\/B06XX123SH?psc=1&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&amp;tag=duckduckgo-ffab-uk-21&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B06XX123SH\">some I liked<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I stupidly lost these last week and so went looking for some new earbuds and wondered what was new in the last couple of years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a bit of help from Twitter (thanks everyone!) I decided to try some cheap-ish &#8220;true wireless&#8221; headphones. And I&#8217;m actually mightily impressed. There are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=a30Hnuzgr6s\">many, many models you can buy<\/a> for under \u00a350, but someone recommended some MPOW wireless ones, and so I opted to try the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/dp\/B07SZ8V339?aaxitk=nGwZgKVZXZbdOX8JyKeDyw&amp;pd_rd_i=B07SZ8V339&amp;pf_rd_p=0192e6ab-5959-4731-9929-242726c28327&amp;hsa_cr_id=2992214720002&amp;sb-ci-n=asinImage&amp;sb-ci-v=https%3A%2F%2Fm.media-amazon.com%2Fimages%2FI%2F416BQLNpTbL.jpg&amp;sb-ci-a=B07SZ8V339\">MPOW true-wireless ones<\/a> and&#8230;they&#8217;re a bit big and stupid-looking, but they stay in my ears (surprisingly!) do the job and for \u00a330 I&#8217;m more than happy with them. I&#8217;m REALLY impressed with this technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time Machine<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I go on about this a lot, but discovering I was a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2015\/07\/highly-sensitive\/\">Highly Sensitive<\/a>&#8221; person was quite a revelation to me and our family. I suspect that many people I know have this character trait too (about 20% of people do!) and understanding it may be helpful. So ages ago I did a write up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you ever felt like you experience the world more intensely than others, if you have a high attention to detail and find big events with lots of people tiring, maybe this is you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pins: things I read and remembered<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I bookmarked this week (not much it would seem!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Brought to you with <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/pinboard.in\"><em>pinboard.in<\/em><\/a><em> and my <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/sync-pinboard\/\"><em>Sync Pinboard<\/em><\/a><em> plugin)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-sync-pinboard-pins\"><ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/shariff\/\">Shariff Wrapper \u2013 WordPress plugin | WordPress.org<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>Interesting privacy-aware sharing buttons plugin via @rmccue<\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2019\/08\/bottom-navigation-pattern-mobile-web-pages\/\">Bottom Navigation Pattern On Mobile Web Pages: A Better Alternative?<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>I really like the idea of fixed-bottom navigation on websites.

So I&#8217;m not running at 100% capacity. But it&#8217;s been a good week nonetheless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been continuing to work on a charity microsite re-build that I&#8217;m doing in WordPress with vanilla JS and CSS, and building more ACF Gutenberg blocks. I&#8217;m loving this approach for small projects. It&#8217;s got it&#8217;s problems, but so has any method\/framework. And the simplicity of it is great and, in my opinion, the pros outweigh the cons for small projects like this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>I did a big chunk of maintenance for a site that I look after for a small charity client.<\/li><li>Sorted out some <strong>Google Tag Manager and analytics event issues<\/strong> for a client, and learned a few things along the way<\/li><li>Spent an hour or so <strong>helping a client fix up some old micro sites<\/strong> that had been broken by a compulsory PHP upgrade that their hosting company made months ago. This was one of those things were not-every-WordPress-person would have had the skills to diagnose and fix it as I was <strong>digging around in logs and debugging other people&#8217;s stuff<\/strong>. I like to think I added good value here.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/keithdevon\/\">Keith Devon<\/a> and I worked on editing down our informal &#8220;fireside chat&#8221; that should become an edition of his EXCELLENT <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/\">Pricing WordPress<\/a> podcast this week. Watch that space (not this one).<\/li><li>Over the weekend, from my bed-of-poorliness, I started upgrading some of my side projects&#8217; Laravel versions. The excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/laravelshift.com\/\">Laravel Shift<\/a> service can automate this for you, but my apps are really simple and I wanted to experience the manual approach. A write up will come soon.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/09\/camping-thoughts\/\">Camping thoughts<\/a> &#8211; I wrote some random thoughts on camping holidays I had while we were away over the summer.

There&#8217;s loads of good stuff going on every day in tech communities. Let&#8217;s shout about that some more!

A couple of years back I tried some cheap Bluetooth wireless ear buds. They weren&#8217;t much good. So I tried a second time paying a bit more and found <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Skullcandy-Bluetooth-Wireless-Ear-Earbuds-Black\/dp\/B06XX123SH?psc=1&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&amp;tag=duckduckgo-ffab-uk-21&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B06XX123SH\">some I liked<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I stupidly lost these last week and so went looking for some new earbuds and wondered what was new in the last couple of years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a bit of help from Twitter (thanks everyone!) I decided to try some cheap-ish &#8220;true wireless&#8221; headphones. And I&#8217;m actually mightily impressed. There are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=a30Hnuzgr6s\">many, many models you can buy<\/a> for under \u00a350, but someone recommended some MPOW wireless ones, and so I opted to try the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/dp\/B07SZ8V339?aaxitk=nGwZgKVZXZbdOX8JyKeDyw&amp;pd_rd_i=B07SZ8V339&amp;pf_rd_p=0192e6ab-5959-4731-9929-242726c28327&amp;hsa_cr_id=2992214720002&amp;sb-ci-n=asinImage&amp;sb-ci-v=https%3A%2F%2Fm.media-amazon.com%2Fimages%2FI%2F416BQLNpTbL.jpg&amp;sb-ci-a=B07SZ8V339\">MPOW true-wireless ones<\/a> and&#8230;they&#8217;re a bit big and stupid-looking, but they stay in my ears (surprisingly!) do the job and for \u00a330 I&#8217;m more than happy with them. I&#8217;m REALLY impressed with this technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time Machine<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I go on about this a lot, but discovering I was a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2015\/07\/highly-sensitive\/\">Highly Sensitive<\/a>&#8221; person was quite a revelation to me and our family. I suspect that many people I know have this character trait too (about 20% of people do!) and understanding it may be helpful.

                "rendered": "\n<p>There wasn&#8217;t really a shorter title for this post.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Too long? Didn&#8217;t read?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the quick bit of learning: WordPress runs the <code>wp_enqueue_scripts<\/code> action hook during the execution of <code>wp_head<\/code> and it encourages you to register scripts on this hook. SO if you do something that you want to enqueue scripts correctly, you must do it AFTER <code>wp_head<\/code> runs &#8211; which usually means after <code>wp_header()<\/code> is called in the theme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My use case and problem<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I was working for a client doing some maintenance on a theme that someone else had built. The theme used Advanced Custom Fields, and in some cases shortcodes were used inside ACF WYSIWYG fields.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the shortcodes used needed some styles and\/or scripts to be enqueued to make the shortcode work. But this should be fine right? Executing the shortcode would enqueue the assets. No problem there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, then my theme had some code that was using the ACF field&#8217;s content. It set up some values near the top of the file, grabbing values from the ACF fields using the <code>get_field()<\/code> function, before outputting the template&#8217;s HTML content. Something like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;?php\n$title = get_field('title');\n$content = get_field('content');\n?&gt;\n\n&lt;?php\n  wp_header();\n?&gt;\n\n&lt;main&gt;\n  \/\/ Output the content here\n&lt;\/main&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>But, while the shortcode was definitely running, as I was seeing it&#8217;s output, the scripts that made the shortcode work were not being enqueued.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s going on?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin that gave me the shortcode actually worked correctly:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Scripts were registered correctly using <code>wp_register_script()<\/code> on the <code>wp_enqueue_scripts<\/code> action hook<\/li><li>The callback function that generated the shortcode output was running the <code>wp_enqueue_script()<\/code> function<\/li><li>The scripts were registered to be output in the footer, so enqueuing them during the shortcode output function should be fine<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;because the <code>wp_enqueue_scripts<\/code> action hook fires during <code>wp_header()<\/code> this code was failing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It failed because the shortcode callback was run when I did the <code>get_field()<\/code> call on the WYSIWYG field. The <code>get_field()<\/code> call is before <code>wp_header()<\/code> and therefore before the scripts are registered. So at the point the shortcode call back runs, the script is not registered so it can not be enqueued.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phew. Are you still with me?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The fix<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The fix is simple &#8211; get the content, and therefore run the shortcodes, after <code>wp_header()<\/code> has been called so that the scripts are registered before they are enqueued:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;?php\n  wp_header();\n?&gt;\n\n&lt;?php\n$title = get_field('title');\n$content = get_field('content');\n?&gt;\n\n&lt;main&gt;\n  \/\/ Output the content here\n&lt;\/main&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

        "title": "WordPress: Fixing shortcodes that enqueue JavaScript when used in ACF fields",
        "content": "\n<p>There wasn&#8217;t really a shorter title for this post.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Too long? Didn&#8217;t read?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the quick bit of learning: WordPress runs the <code>wp_enqueue_scripts<\/code> action hook during the execution of <code>wp_head<\/code> and it encourages you to register scripts on this hook. SO if you do something that you want to enqueue scripts correctly, you must do it AFTER <code>wp_head<\/code> runs &#8211; which usually means after <code>wp_header()<\/code> is called in the theme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My use case and problem<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I was working for a client doing some maintenance on a theme that someone else had built. The theme used Advanced Custom Fields, and in some cases shortcodes were used inside ACF WYSIWYG fields.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the shortcodes used needed some styles and\/or scripts to be enqueued to make the shortcode work. But this should be fine right? Executing the shortcode would enqueue the assets. No problem there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, then my theme had some code that was using the ACF field&#8217;s content. It set up some values near the top of the file, grabbing values from the ACF fields using the <code>get_field()<\/code> function, before outputting the template&#8217;s HTML content. Something like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;?php\n$title = get_field('title');\n$content = get_field('content');\n?&gt;\n\n&lt;?php\n  wp_header();\n?&gt;\n\n&lt;main&gt;\n  \/\/ Output the content here\n&lt;\/main&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>But, while the shortcode was definitely running, as I was seeing it&#8217;s output, the scripts that made the shortcode work were not being enqueued.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s going on?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin that gave me the shortcode actually worked correctly:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Scripts were registered correctly using <code>wp_register_script()<\/code> on the <code>wp_enqueue_scripts<\/code> action hook<\/li><li>The callback function that generated the shortcode output was running the <code>wp_enqueue_script()<\/code> function<\/li><li>The scripts were registered to be output in the footer, so enqueuing them during the shortcode output function should be fine<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;because the <code>wp_enqueue_scripts<\/code> action hook fires during <code>wp_header()<\/code> this code was failing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It failed because the shortcode callback was run when I did the <code>get_field()<\/code> call on the WYSIWYG field. The <code>get_field()<\/code> call is before <code>wp_header()<\/code> and therefore before the scripts are registered. So at the point the shortcode call back runs, the script is not registered so it can not be enqueued.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phew. Are you still with me?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The fix<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The fix is simple &#8211; get the content, and therefore run the shortcodes, after <code>wp_header()<\/code> has been called so that the scripts are registered before they are enqueued:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&lt;?php\n  wp_header();\n?&gt;\n\n&lt;?php\n$title = get_field('title');\n$content = get_field('content');\n?&gt;\n\n&lt;main&gt;\n  \/\/ Output the content here\n&lt;\/main&gt;\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",

As one of the main components of SchoolBot is a chatbot, I&#8217;d wondered if I could build a chatbot to explain what SchoolBot does. An hour or so later and I had done just that. The conversation needs to be developed, but it works nicely: https:\/\/schoolbot.co.uk<\/li><li>Related: <strong>I did NOT get involved in school comms<\/strong>! There was NOT <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/giuliavmerlo\/status\/1171084332246716417\">a conversation on Twitter<\/a> about service design and user experience of school stuff that resulted in me trying to DO something to pull people together to make some kind of framework to help schools improve communications with parents.<\/li><li>I signed up for <a href=\"https:\/\/doaction.org\/event\/cheltenham-2019\/\">the Cheltenham do_action charity hackathon<\/a> on 4th October.

We&#8217;re well back into the swing of new-term things now, but last week I was hit by a heavy cold so I have been a bit slow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve mostly been continuing my charity microsite build. There&#8217;s been a few other small bits of support I&#8217;ve been working on. But it&#8217;s mostly build, build, build in HTML\/CSS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the side I&#8217;ve been doing a few interesting things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Made a simple chatbot framework in about 100 lines of vanilla JS<\/strong> &#8211; for ages I&#8217;ve been wanting to work on the &#8220;marketing&#8221; and explanatory side of my SchoolBot Parent Information System. As one of the main components of SchoolBot is a chatbot, I&#8217;d wondered if I could build a chatbot to explain what SchoolBot does. An hour or so later and I had done just that. The conversation needs to be developed, but it works nicely: https:\/\/schoolbot.co.uk<\/li><li>Related: <strong>I did NOT get involved in school comms<\/strong>! There was NOT <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/giuliavmerlo\/status\/1171084332246716417\">a conversation on Twitter<\/a> about service design and user experience of school stuff that resulted in me trying to DO something to pull people together to make some kind of framework to help schools improve communications with parents.<\/li><li>I signed up for <a href=\"https:\/\/doaction.org\/event\/cheltenham-2019\/\">the Cheltenham do_action charity hackathon<\/a> on 4th October. They still need some designers, so sign up if that&#8217;s you and you fancy giving back some work to local charities.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/09\/wordpress-fixing-shortcodes-that-enqueue-javascript-when-used-in-acf-fields\/\">WordPress: Fixing shortcodes that enqueue JavaScript when used in ACF fields<\/a> &#8211; a quick WordPress technical note<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This week I learned<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Blackcurrant Lemsips are WAY nicer than the lemon ones. ?<\/li><li>The <a href=\"http:\/\/focos.me\/\">Focos app for iOS<\/a> takes pictures with no depth information and uses machine learning to add depth information, giving you depth of field\/bokeh type stuff, and the ability to add virtual lighting.

So not the best week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m still working my charity microsite build. I also did two hosting moves and worked on some updates to another client&#8217;s site. Not a hugely exciting week to be honest. But that&#8217;s my bread and butter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>No real posts this week as such, but I was inspired to try and get my <a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/\">Press Ups<\/a> project back up and running a bit, so I set up an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/press_ups\/\">Instagram<\/a> for it and started trying to revive social media around it. There&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/press_ups\/\">Twitter<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pressupswp\/\">Facebook<\/a> too. Deciding to revive what is essentially a video tutorial project when fighting off a heavy cold wasn&#8217;t my best idea ever. But we&#8217;ll see where it goes.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/im-back-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8676\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/im-back-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/im-back-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/im-back-768x768.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/im-back-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/im-back.png 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This week I learned<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.descript.com\/\">Descript<\/a> exists! An amazing audio and video editor that works by transcribing text and letting you edit that text &#8211; as you edit the text, it edits the video\/audio for you. I tried it out. It seems legit and has a free plan. Really incredible tech. Their intro video is AMAZING. (Note: I&#8217;m <strong>not<\/strong> an ambassador or on commission or anything)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Toolbox<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about <a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\">Bear Notes<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I write EVERYTHING down. I&#8217;m data-hoarder. And so I need a good note-taking app. One that lets me write quickly, sync to the cloud, organise and search my notes. I want:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Either cross-platform, or good ability to export should I need to. MacOS and iOS apps with cloud sync are a must.<\/li><li>Tagging &#8211; I prefer this to simple folders.<\/li><li>Search &#8211; fast with relevant results<\/li><li>Markdown editing &#8211; this is my fastest way to write, I want to stay on my keyboard and am willing to learn shortcuts or formatting tags to make this work.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, I do NOT care about:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Publishing or sharing notes. I&#8217;ll use other tools for this.<\/li><li>Fancy user interfaces and text formatting tools<\/li><li>Import from other tools or integration with other services<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For a long time I dabbled with Evernote and SimpleNote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evernote was always WAY to complicated and expensive. I couldn&#8217;t fathom the user interface which got in the way, and folders, tagging and search were somehow confusing. It should have been the bomb and I know some people put their whole lives in it, but it just didn&#8217;t work for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SimpleNote was great &#8211; it did tagging and search brilliantly, let me JUST WRITE NOTES, but its text formatting fell short. I don&#8217;t want too much, but SimpleNote had too little. I could write Markdown in it, but it didn&#8217;t help me to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, about three years ago, <a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\">Bear<\/a> launched. I think I got on board with the Beta, but then was more than happy to pay for a pro subscription. It&#8217;s AMAZING!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Native Markdown editing<\/li><li>Sync across Apple devices<\/li><li>Fast, decent search<\/li><li>Clever tagging and tag indexing<\/li><li>Brilliant apps<\/li><li>A clever formatting toolbar that helps you write Markdown<\/li><li>A whole host of other neat little touches<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The only real downside is that it only really works on Apple&#8217;s platform. There&#8217;s ongoing talk of a web-based version, which would be cool if it happened. I would miss it if I ever ditched my Mac and iPhone though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A super tool. Not for everyone. But perfect for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time Machine<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A while ago I wrote a post that did a critique of a fairly well-known &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Bob Martin post. It took me ages to write and publish it, partly because&#8230;well&#8230;who am I to critique someone as legendary as Uncle Bob? But I felt my background working in safety-critical software engineering game me an alternative view. And I was pretty pleased with how it turned out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-ross-wintle\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"otzaxES8QY\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/not-all-software-development-processes-are-equal\/\">Not all software development processes are equal<\/a><\/blockquote><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Not all software development processes are equal&#8221; &#8212; Ross Wintle\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/not-all-software-development-processes-are-equal\/embed\/#?secret=ak3V8zmJk4#?secret=otzaxES8QY\" data-secret=\"otzaxES8QY\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pins: things I read and remembered<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I bookmarked this week:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Brought to you with <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/pinboard.in\"><em>pinboard.in<\/em><\/a><em> and my <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/sync-pinboard\/\"><em>Sync Pinboard<\/em><\/a><em> plugin)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-sync-pinboard-pins\"><ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/flowxo.com\/\">AI Online Chatbot Software, Live Chat on Websites &#8211; Flow XO<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span><\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rareloop.com\/posts\/is-your-online-payment-workflow-ready-for-sca\/\">s your online payment workflow ready for SCA?<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>Good article on SCA payment changes<\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/learnui.design\/blog\/4-rules-intuitive-ux.html\">4 Rules for Intuitive UX \u2013 Learn UI Design<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>A GREAT article with some fantastic tactical UI\/UX tips.

        "content": "\n<p>Late weeknotes again &#8211; sorry! My heavy cold has been hitting me hard &#8211; struggling to shake it off. So not the best week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m still working my charity microsite build. I also did two hosting moves and worked on some updates to another client&#8217;s site. Not a hugely exciting week to be honest. But that&#8217;s my bread and butter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>No real posts this week as such, but I was inspired to try and get my <a href=\"https:\/\/press-ups.com\/\">Press Ups<\/a> project back up and running a bit, so I set up an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/press_ups\/\">Instagram<\/a> for it and started trying to revive social media around it. There&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/press_ups\/\">Twitter<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pressupswp\/\">Facebook<\/a> too. Deciding to revive what is essentially a video tutorial project when fighting off a heavy cold wasn&#8217;t my best idea ever. But we&#8217;ll see where it goes.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/im-back-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8676\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/im-back-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/im-back-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/im-back-768x768.png 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/im-back-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/im-back.png 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This week I learned<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.descript.com\/\">Descript<\/a> exists! An amazing audio and video editor that works by transcribing text and letting you edit that text &#8211; as you edit the text, it edits the video\/audio for you. I tried it out. It seems legit and has a free plan. Really incredible tech. Their intro video is AMAZING. (Note: I&#8217;m <strong>not<\/strong> an ambassador or on commission or anything)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Toolbox<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about <a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\">Bear Notes<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I write EVERYTHING down. I&#8217;m data-hoarder. And so I need a good note-taking app. One that lets me write quickly, sync to the cloud, organise and search my notes. I want:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Either cross-platform, or good ability to export should I need to. MacOS and iOS apps with cloud sync are a must.<\/li><li>Tagging &#8211; I prefer this to simple folders.<\/li><li>Search &#8211; fast with relevant results<\/li><li>Markdown editing &#8211; this is my fastest way to write, I want to stay on my keyboard and am willing to learn shortcuts or formatting tags to make this work.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, I do NOT care about:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Publishing or sharing notes. I&#8217;ll use other tools for this.<\/li><li>Fancy user interfaces and text formatting tools<\/li><li>Import from other tools or integration with other services<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For a long time I dabbled with Evernote and SimpleNote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evernote was always WAY to complicated and expensive. I couldn&#8217;t fathom the user interface which got in the way, and folders, tagging and search were somehow confusing. It should have been the bomb and I know some people put their whole lives in it, but it just didn&#8217;t work for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SimpleNote was great &#8211; it did tagging and search brilliantly, let me JUST WRITE NOTES, but its text formatting fell short. I don&#8217;t want too much, but SimpleNote had too little. I could write Markdown in it, but it didn&#8217;t help me to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, about three years ago, <a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\">Bear<\/a> launched. I think I got on board with the Beta, but then was more than happy to pay for a pro subscription. It&#8217;s AMAZING!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Native Markdown editing<\/li><li>Sync across Apple devices<\/li><li>Fast, decent search<\/li><li>Clever tagging and tag indexing<\/li><li>Brilliant apps<\/li><li>A clever formatting toolbar that helps you write Markdown<\/li><li>A whole host of other neat little touches<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The only real downside is that it only really works on Apple&#8217;s platform. There&#8217;s ongoing talk of a web-based version, which would be cool if it happened. I would miss it if I ever ditched my Mac and iPhone though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A super tool. Not for everyone. But perfect for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time Machine<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A while ago I wrote a post that did a critique of a fairly well-known &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Bob Martin post. It took me ages to write and publish it, partly because&#8230;well&#8230;who am I to critique someone as legendary as Uncle Bob? But I felt my background working in safety-critical software engineering game me an alternative view. And I was pretty pleased with how it turned out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-ross-wintle\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"otzaxES8QY\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/not-all-software-development-processes-are-equal\/\">Not all software development processes are equal<\/a><\/blockquote><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Not all software development processes are equal&#8221; &#8212; Ross Wintle\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/not-all-software-development-processes-are-equal\/embed\/#?secret=ak3V8zmJk4#?secret=otzaxES8QY\" data-secret=\"otzaxES8QY\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pins: things I read and remembered<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I bookmarked this week:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Brought to you with <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/pinboard.in\"><em>pinboard.in<\/em><\/a><em> and my <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/sync-pinboard\/\"><em>Sync Pinboard<\/em><\/a><em> plugin)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-sync-pinboard-pins\"><ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/flowxo.com\/\">AI Online Chatbot Software, Live Chat on Websites &#8211; Flow XO<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span><\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rareloop.com\/posts\/is-your-online-payment-workflow-ready-for-sca\/\">s your online payment workflow ready for SCA?<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>Good article on SCA payment changes<\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/learnui.design\/blog\/4-rules-intuitive-ux.html\">4 Rules for Intuitive UX \u2013 Learn UI Design<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>A GREAT article with some fantastic tactical UI\/UX tips.

So here we go catching up<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m still working my charity microsite build. I&#8217;ve also been working on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>a small WordPress site build for a local charity project<\/li><li>some modifications to a website that I look after for a national charity<\/li><li>a small database and data-importer that was being built into a WordPress site that I look after &#8211; this had a tight deadline for a launch at a conference<\/li><li>dealing with a client site that got a proper, targetted DDoS attack, and the clean-up and fall-out from that.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I also took part in the one-day do_action charity hack day in Cheltenham last Friday where 4 teams built 4 websites for 4 local charities. HUGE thanks to Elliott Richmond for putting this on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also took part in a productivity challenge last week in <a href=\"https:\/\/amandaappiagyei.com\/\">Amanda Appiagyei<\/a>&#8216;s Facebook community group. I see a lot of coaches marketing their wares and services and I&#8217;ve always liked Amanda&#8217;s unpretentious and genuinely helpful approach that seems to focus on YOU. She&#8217;s very generous with her time and experience too. Her productivity challenge was really helpful for me. If you need business skills, ideas or coaching look her up!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>No real posts this week, but <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/episodes\/a-conversation-with-ross-wintle\">I was on a podcast<\/a>! I was interviewed a while ago by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/keithdevon\">Keith Devon<\/a> for his <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/\">Pricing WP podcast<\/a>. We talked about pricing in the charity sector, my thoughts on his conversations with Jonathan Stark about value-based pricing and some general stuff about how my business work. Hopefully <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/episodes\/a-conversation-with-ross-wintle\">the interview<\/a> is interesting.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This week I learned<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>The government are extending the clamp down on IR35 contracting rules. If you do contract or freelance work you probably need to be aware of this. Some links to follow to find out more:<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.personneltoday.com\/hr\/barclays-and-others-urge-contractors-to-go-paye\/\">https:\/\/www.personneltoday.com\/hr\/barclays-and-others-urge-contractors-to-go-paye\/<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/guidance\/check-employment-status-for-tax\">https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/guidance\/check-employment-status-for-tax<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.itcontracting.com\/ir35-small-company-exemption\/\">https:\/\/www.itcontracting.com\/ir35-small-company-exemption\/<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunch.co.uk\/knowledge\/tax\/what-to-do-if-hmrc-ask-for-proof-of-your-employment-ir35-status\/\">https:\/\/www.crunch.co.uk\/knowledge\/tax\/what-to-do-if-hmrc-ask-for-proof-of-your-employment-ir35-status\/<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Toolbox<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, native MySQL database tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use WordPress and PHP a lot it&#8217;s likely that at some point you&#8217;ve had to modify stuff in a database, and PHPMyAdmin is a tool that is really widely used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But setting up locally &#8211; or setting up your own install of it on a server &#8211; can be a bit of a pain. And I&#8217;ve always struggled to get to grips with the security of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for a while I&#8217;ve been using <a href=\"https:\/\/sequelpro.com\/\">SequelPro<\/a> as a desktop client for managing databases. After using PHPMyAdmin it took a bit of getting used to but I now much prefer using a native Mac app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it seems to have fallen by the wayside a bit. I was getting annoying errors from it and chatter in the dev communities I&#8217;m in is that is has kinda died a death (this may not be true, but it seems to be).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I looked into alternatives as and when found them. Initially <a href=\"https:\/\/tableplus.com\/\">Table Plus<\/a>, which was recommended by Laravel creator Taylor Otwell. Table Plus isn&#8217;t free, but isn&#8217;t expensive either. It connects to a range of different databases, not just MySQL\/MariaDB, which is great, but I found the interface clunky. Annoying tiny things, but enough to drive me mad with frequent use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then discovered <a href=\"https:\/\/www.araelium.com\/querious\">Querious<\/a>, which also isn&#8217;t free, but isn&#8217;t expensive either. It feels more like a souped-up modern version of SequelPro and the interface just felt much more solid to me. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve settled on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SequelPro is in the trashcan. I will miss typing &#8220;pancakes&#8221; into Alfred. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time Machine<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about my work and products and side projects and lately AND about school communications. So here&#8217;s a little write up of my SchoolBot chatbot\/school-CMS\/parent information system project. If you know of a tech-savvy, forward thinking school that might want to try this out do let me know or put me in touch.

        "content": "\n<p>I got really behind with weeknotes because of a triplet of urgent work that came in and overwhelmed me. So here we go catching up<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m still working my charity microsite build. I&#8217;ve also been working on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>a small WordPress site build for a local charity project<\/li><li>some modifications to a website that I look after for a national charity<\/li><li>a small database and data-importer that was being built into a WordPress site that I look after &#8211; this had a tight deadline for a launch at a conference<\/li><li>dealing with a client site that got a proper, targetted DDoS attack, and the clean-up and fall-out from that.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I also took part in the one-day do_action charity hack day in Cheltenham last Friday where 4 teams built 4 websites for 4 local charities. HUGE thanks to Elliott Richmond for putting this on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also took part in a productivity challenge last week in <a href=\"https:\/\/amandaappiagyei.com\/\">Amanda Appiagyei<\/a>&#8216;s Facebook community group. I see a lot of coaches marketing their wares and services and I&#8217;ve always liked Amanda&#8217;s unpretentious and genuinely helpful approach that seems to focus on YOU. She&#8217;s very generous with her time and experience too. Her productivity challenge was really helpful for me. If you need business skills, ideas or coaching look her up!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>No real posts this week, but <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/episodes\/a-conversation-with-ross-wintle\">I was on a podcast<\/a>! I was interviewed a while ago by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/keithdevon\">Keith Devon<\/a> for his <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/\">Pricing WP podcast<\/a>. We talked about pricing in the charity sector, my thoughts on his conversations with Jonathan Stark about value-based pricing and some general stuff about how my business work. Hopefully <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/episodes\/a-conversation-with-ross-wintle\">the interview<\/a> is interesting.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This week I learned<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>The government are extending the clamp down on IR35 contracting rules. If you do contract or freelance work you probably need to be aware of this. Some links to follow to find out more:<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.personneltoday.com\/hr\/barclays-and-others-urge-contractors-to-go-paye\/\">https:\/\/www.personneltoday.com\/hr\/barclays-and-others-urge-contractors-to-go-paye\/<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/guidance\/check-employment-status-for-tax\">https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/guidance\/check-employment-status-for-tax<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.itcontracting.com\/ir35-small-company-exemption\/\">https:\/\/www.itcontracting.com\/ir35-small-company-exemption\/<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunch.co.uk\/knowledge\/tax\/what-to-do-if-hmrc-ask-for-proof-of-your-employment-ir35-status\/\">https:\/\/www.crunch.co.uk\/knowledge\/tax\/what-to-do-if-hmrc-ask-for-proof-of-your-employment-ir35-status\/<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Toolbox<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, native MySQL database tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use WordPress and PHP a lot it&#8217;s likely that at some point you&#8217;ve had to modify stuff in a database, and PHPMyAdmin is a tool that is really widely used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But setting up locally &#8211; or setting up your own install of it on a server &#8211; can be a bit of a pain. And I&#8217;ve always struggled to get to grips with the security of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for a while I&#8217;ve been using <a href=\"https:\/\/sequelpro.com\/\">SequelPro<\/a> as a desktop client for managing databases. After using PHPMyAdmin it took a bit of getting used to but I now much prefer using a native Mac app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it seems to have fallen by the wayside a bit. I was getting annoying errors from it and chatter in the dev communities I&#8217;m in is that is has kinda died a death (this may not be true, but it seems to be).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I looked into alternatives as and when found them. Initially <a href=\"https:\/\/tableplus.com\/\">Table Plus<\/a>, which was recommended by Laravel creator Taylor Otwell. Table Plus isn&#8217;t free, but isn&#8217;t expensive either. It connects to a range of different databases, not just MySQL\/MariaDB, which is great, but I found the interface clunky. Annoying tiny things, but enough to drive me mad with frequent use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then discovered <a href=\"https:\/\/www.araelium.com\/querious\">Querious<\/a>, which also isn&#8217;t free, but isn&#8217;t expensive either. It feels more like a souped-up modern version of SequelPro and the interface just felt much more solid to me. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve settled on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SequelPro is in the trashcan. I will miss typing &#8220;pancakes&#8221; into Alfred. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time Machine<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about my work and products and side projects and lately AND about school communications. So here&#8217;s a little write up of my SchoolBot chatbot\/school-CMS\/parent information system project. If you know of a tech-savvy, forward thinking school that might want to try this out do let me know or put me in touch.
