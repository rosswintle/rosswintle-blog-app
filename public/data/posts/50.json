Here&#8217;s some thoughts I jotted down shortly after the Martyn Joseph and Stewart Henderson gig on March 27th]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had a busy weekend.  A gig on Friday night, up early on Saturday to travel to Aberystwyth for a meeting, an overnight stay in a B&amp;B in the Brecon Beacons, and home in time to lead music at Church on Sunday night.  Not much of a restful weekend.<\/p>\n<p>This post is about the first of those things though: Friday night&#8217;s gig.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been booked in to see Martyn Joseph and Stewart Henderson for months and, as always with a gig, we were excited and expectant as the evening approached.  But what, actually, to expect from a gig that&#8217;s half folk rock music and half poetry?<\/p>\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, Martyn Joseph is a really good folk rock guitarist\/singer\/songwriter.  His shows are always packed with passion and emotion, MJ means what he sings, his fiery spirit punches through in every song and you leave stirred, moved and excited.<\/p>\n<p>But behind a lot of his songs sits the quiet, wise, humble Henderson, who writes some of he lyrics that MJ puts music to.  It&#8217;s a long established partnership that spans decades.  But Henderson is a poet; a man of words and not music or song.<\/p>\n<p>We arrived to a stage with two microphones set up.  Introductions were done by the comp\u00e8re and as the looming Joseph in crisp white t-shirt and jeans leapt up on stage followed by the small, slight, bespectacled Henderson in proper trousers and a neat suit jacket, I don&#8217;t think anyone was quite sure what was about to happen.<\/p>\n<p>But, if I remember rightly, MJ launched into a passionate rendition of \u201cWeight of the World\u201d, but dropping his sung vocals at times for Henderson to read \u2013 intelligently and entertainingly \u2013 the lyrics, in his soft Liverpudlian, while occasionally dancing around the stage in&#8230;delight?&#8230;err&#8230;well I&#8217;m not sure why, but it made us laugh.<\/p>\n<p>What followed was a fascinating evening of poems set to music, prose read with charm and wit, music wrapped around poetry, songs rendered with power and feeling, and entertainment from two inspiring and engaging men, with great sensitivity and wisdom.<\/p>\n<p>At times, I wasn&#8217;t sure what to make of it.  Knowing a lot of the tunes and words, I can barely hold back from song, so having the verses read as prose created a tension for me and I think, overall, I prefer Joseph on his own.<\/p>\n<p>But this is important stuff right?  Henderson is so often the unrecognised talent in the team.  How incredibly right that MJ puts his own rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll talent aside, steps back from the mic, and suppresses his desire to launch into song, in order to give voice to the spirit of his words.<\/p>\n<p>And Henderson is hugely entertaining in his own right. A master of words with a huge vocabulary and gift for crafting them into evocative verse.  He has a talent for public speaking too and when the floor was opened for questions, Henderson did most of the answering (though that my be because more of the questions were directed at him) bring his replies to life with fun anecdotes and dry, spontaneous, northern wit&#8230;even, occasionally, making his stage partner screw his face up in laughter.<\/p>\n<p>I, personally, was reminded of the power of poetry.  I wonder if we can use the spoken word more in our communication, and for me this may be especially relevant in leading people in worship at church.  I also used to write prose myself&#8230;perhaps this is something I should try again.<\/p>\n<p>Folk music is often so much more than the sum of its valuable parts.  This evening demonstrated that.  Poetry and music together partners that have been clearly demonstrated to complement each other so well.<\/p>\n<p>Now where&#8217;s my guitar?  Or, possibly, when my quill and ink?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><em>[Oh, look &#8211; a pre-written blog post.  Here&#8217;s some thoughts I jotted down shortly after the Martyn Joseph and Stewart Henderson gig on March 27th]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had a busy weekend.  A gig on Friday night, up early on Saturday to travel to Aberystwyth for a meeting, an overnight stay in a B&amp;B in the Brecon Beacons, and home in time to lead music at Church on Sunday night.  Not much of a restful weekend.<\/p>\n<p>This post is about the first of those things though: Friday night&#8217;s gig.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been booked in to see Martyn Joseph and Stewart Henderson for months and, as always with a gig, we were excited and expectant as the evening approached.  But what, actually, to expect from a gig that&#8217;s half folk rock music and half poetry?<\/p>\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, Martyn Joseph is a really good folk rock guitarist\/singer\/songwriter.  His shows are always packed with passion and emotion, MJ means what he sings, his fiery spirit punches through in every song and you leave stirred, moved and excited.<\/p>\n<p>But behind a lot of his songs sits the quiet, wise, humble Henderson, who writes some of he lyrics that MJ puts music to.  It&#8217;s a long established partnership that spans decades.  But Henderson is a poet; a man of words and not music or song.<\/p>\n<p>We arrived to a stage with two microphones set up.  Introductions were done by the comp\u00e8re and as the looming Joseph in crisp white t-shirt and jeans leapt up on stage followed by the small, slight, bespectacled Henderson in proper trousers and a neat suit jacket, I don&#8217;t think anyone was quite sure what was about to happen.<\/p>\n<p>But, if I remember rightly, MJ launched into a passionate rendition of \u201cWeight of the World\u201d, but dropping his sung vocals at times for Henderson to read \u2013 intelligently and entertainingly \u2013 the lyrics, in his soft Liverpudlian, while occasionally dancing around the stage in&#8230;delight?&#8230;err&#8230;well I&#8217;m not sure why, but it made us laugh.<\/p>\n<p>What followed was a fascinating evening of poems set to music, prose read with charm and wit, music wrapped around poetry, songs rendered with power and feeling, and entertainment from two inspiring and engaging men, with great sensitivity and wisdom.<\/p>\n<p>At times, I wasn&#8217;t sure what to make of it.  Knowing a lot of the tunes and words, I can barely hold back from song, so having the verses read as prose created a tension for me and I think, overall, I prefer Joseph on his own.<\/p>\n<p>But this is important stuff right?  Henderson is so often the unrecognised talent in the team.  How incredibly right that MJ puts his own rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll talent aside, steps back from the mic, and suppresses his desire to launch into song, in order to give voice to the spirit of his words.<\/p>\n<p>And Henderson is hugely entertaining in his own right. A master of words with a huge vocabulary and gift for crafting them into evocative verse.  He has a talent for public speaking too and when the floor was opened for questions, Henderson did most of the answering (though that my be because more of the questions were directed at him) bring his replies to life with fun anecdotes and dry, spontaneous, northern wit&#8230;even, occasionally, making his stage partner screw his face up in laughter.<\/p>\n<p>I, personally, was reminded of the power of poetry.  I wonder if we can use the spoken word more in our communication, and for me this may be especially relevant in leading people in worship at church.  I also used to write prose myself&#8230;perhaps this is something I should try again.<\/p>\n<p>Folk music is often so much more than the sum of its valuable parts.  This evening demonstrated that.  Poetry and music together partners that have been clearly demonstrated to complement each other so well.<\/p>\n<p>Now where&#8217;s my guitar?  Or, possibly, when my quill and ink?<\/p>\n",

A line where my cycle commute is so ingrained that it feels more natural than driving to and from work.\u00a0 Being in a traffic jam feels truly alien, incrediby frustrating and just generally horrid.<\/p>\n<p>The difference is subtle.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve always known in my head that cycling is better, but today there was something more emotional and heartfelt, something more emotional about driving.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s taken a surprisingly long time to achieve this &#8211; probably mostly because I&#8217;ve avoided rush hour on most occasions I&#8217;ve commuted by car.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I felt liberated from the car.<\/p>\n<p>Now, how to convince others to join me?<\/p>\n",

A line where my cycle commute is so ingrained that it feels more natural than driving to and from work.\u00a0 Being in a traffic jam feels truly alien, incrediby frustrating and just generally horrid.<\/p>\n<p>The difference is subtle.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve always known in my head that cycling is better, but today there was something more emotional and heartfelt, something more emotional about driving.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s taken a surprisingly long time to achieve this &#8211; probably mostly because I&#8217;ve avoided rush hour on most occasions I&#8217;ve commuted by car.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I felt liberated from the car.<\/p>\n<p>Now, how to convince others to join me?<\/p>\n",

it&#8217;s really hard to work out what the features on the map represent.\u00a0 Another Wainwright ticked off though and a good introduction for the weekend.<\/p>\n<h3>Place Fell<\/h3>\n<p>The next day we drove the Kirkstone Pass to Ullswater, parked up between Glenridding and Patterdale and headed up Place Fell.\u00a0 This was more like it &#8211; almost twice as high as Loughrigg and commanding stunning views over towards High Street and back towards the Helvellyn Range to the West.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/place-fell-april-2009.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-710\" title=\"Place Fell April 2009\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/place-fell-april-2009-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/place-fell-april-2009-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/place-fell-april-2009-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/place-fell-april-2009.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a>It was tough going but, again, dry and fine.\u00a0 Pretty pleasant really.\u00a0 At the top The Berry&#8217;s introduced us to the art of Geocaching and we found the summit-top cache on Place Fell after scrabbling around the rocky hilltop for a while.<\/p>\n<p>We descended the north-eastern way, circumventing High Dodd (not my choice!) and managing to find a path down from Sleet Fell to Sandwick village.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/howtown-hotel-scone-april-2009.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-711\" title=\"Howtown Hotel Scone April 2009\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/howtown-hotel-scone-april-2009-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/howtown-hotel-scone-april-2009-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/howtown-hotel-scone-april-2009-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/howtown-hotel-scone-april-2009.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/a>We then took the lakeside path around Hallin Fell to How Town where the How Town hotel awaited.\u00a0 A very bizarre, upper-class place, with old people who looked like permanent residents, drinking afternoon tea in the plush lounge, while we muddy, sweaty walkers were sent round the back to a small hatch serving drinks.\u00a0 Excellent drinks.\u00a0 And excellent scones.\u00a0 All quite reasonably priced and served to us by a waiter on the front lawn in a very posh-looking tea set.\u00a0 All quite silly really, but in a very English way.<\/p>\n<p>After an encounter with a man who was very passionate about the fact that Harvey Maps were far better than the Ordnance Survey ones, we headed to the ferry and sailed back to Glenridding.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/sky-over-ullswater-april-2009.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-712\" title=\"Sky Over Ullswater - April 2009\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/sky-over-ullswater-april-2009-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/sky-over-ullswater-april-2009-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/sky-over-ullswater-april-2009-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/sky-over-ullswater-april-2009.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Probably one of my most favourite walks ever.\u00a0 Fun, great views, variety of terrain, and with tea and a boat trip too.\u00a0 Marvellous!<\/p>\n<h3>Grasmere Geocaching<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/geocaching-april-2009.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-713\" title=\"Geocaching - April 2009\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/geocaching-april-2009-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/geocaching-april-2009-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/geocaching-april-2009-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/geocaching-april-2009.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a>On the Saturday we had a day &#8220;off&#8221;

I have drunk the Copenhagen Kool-aid, for sure.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s definitely a sense of wanting to change the status quo, though; we have car dominance overall in the UK, but within cycling the emphasis in most bike marketing is on MTBs, lycra, lots and lots of *kit*.<\/p>\n<p>I, like quite a few others, would love to see more cycling-as-transportation, for health and traffic congestion reasons. It\u2019s the lack of mainstream emphasis on this that causes us to shout loud, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Keep on cycling, in whatever form <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http:\/\/s.wordpress.com\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnyone who rides a bike is a friend of mine\u201d \u2014 Gary Fisher<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I like what Tim said and I agree wholeheartedly, but it triggered some more thoughts in my brain.<\/p>\n<p>Now, occasionally I like to play devil&#8217;s advocate somewhat.\u00a0 These aren&#8217;t ideas that are fully thought through, or even that I agree with, they are questions to stimulate further discussion.<\/p>\n<p>We live in an age where pretty much everything&#8217;s commercialised; where, rightly or wrongly, &#8220;lots of *kit*&#8221; is the norm.\u00a0 Here&#8217;s some thoughts then:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Isn&#8217;t it <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">good<\/span> that we have lots of cycling kit so that people who are gadget-lovers can get a hook into cycling?\u00a0 Perhaps this is one of the reasons for the boom in mountain biking&#8230;it&#8217;s a chance to acquire more &#8220;cool stuff&#8221;?\u00a0 A mountain bike appears to be a much greater status symbol than a road bike, a commuter, or a tourer, even though it may be less suited to everyday use.\u00a0 Why is that?\u00a0 Because it has more of a gadget factor?<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t we also want identity through our stuff?\u00a0 As I think Karl&#8217;s post pointed out the other day, we tend to see differences rather than similarities.\u00a0 But I also think we strive to be different &#8211; to fit in with a particular class or group.\u00a0 Isn&#8217;t &#8220;a-to-b&#8221; cyclist, or &#8220;chic&#8221; cyclist just another form of cyclist with an associated set of behaviours and paraphernalia? And isn&#8217;t it, again, rightly or wrongly, a group that people are trying to fit themselves into to differentiate themselves from other types of cyclist?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Given that the above might be true, what things would you design\/invent to encourage more use of the bike as a means of transport.\u00a0 What marketing might we do to elevate the status of the everyday city\/commuter bike?\u00a0 How do we get to a state where owning something like a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pashley.co.uk\/\">Pashley<\/a> or, for that matter, any sort of bike with panniers and mudguards, is &#8220;mainstream&#8221; and &#8220;cool&#8221;? (I know we think it is, but do others?)<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the aim is to get people cycling whatever their bike is like and whatever they might have in their wardrobe, but I can&#8217;t help thinking that fashion&#8230;&#8221;kit&#8221;&#8230;&#8221;stuff&#8221; helps us get there.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine a Nike Bike.\u00a0 Or an Apple iBike.\u00a0 Or celebrity-endorsed cycles?\u00a0 Hey, I&#8217;m not a marketer&#8230;you&#8217;re ideas are almost certainly better then mine.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, in short, the bike needs rebranding?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Timmy B posted an excellent comment the other day on my <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/03\/11\/my-kind-of-cycling\/\">&#8220;My kind of Cycling&#8221;<\/a> post (thanks Tim!).\u00a0 To avoid quoting him out of context here&#8217;s the full comment:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>As I said on Karl\u2019s blog: I can put my hands up to being guilty of dismissing the \u201cother\u201d kinds of cyclists (MTBers, lycra-clad speed demons etc.). I have drunk the Copenhagen Kool-aid, for sure.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s definitely a sense of wanting to change the status quo, though; we have car dominance overall in the UK, but within cycling the emphasis in most bike marketing is on MTBs, lycra, lots and lots of *kit*.<\/p>\n<p>I, like quite a few others, would love to see more cycling-as-transportation, for health and traffic congestion reasons. It\u2019s the lack of mainstream emphasis on this that causes us to shout loud, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Keep on cycling, in whatever form <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http:\/\/s.wordpress.com\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnyone who rides a bike is a friend of mine\u201d \u2014 Gary Fisher<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I like what Tim said and I agree wholeheartedly, but it triggered some more thoughts in my brain.<\/p>\n<p>Now, occasionally I like to play devil&#8217;s advocate somewhat.\u00a0 These aren&#8217;t ideas that are fully thought through, or even that I agree with, they are questions to stimulate further discussion.<\/p>\n<p>We live in an age where pretty much everything&#8217;s commercialised; where, rightly or wrongly, &#8220;lots of *kit*&#8221; is the norm.\u00a0 Here&#8217;s some thoughts then:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Isn&#8217;t it <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">good<\/span> that we have lots of cycling kit so that people who are gadget-lovers can get a hook into cycling?\u00a0 Perhaps this is one of the reasons for the boom in mountain biking&#8230;it&#8217;s a chance to acquire more &#8220;cool stuff&#8221;?\u00a0 A mountain bike appears to be a much greater status symbol than a road bike, a commuter, or a tourer, even though it may be less suited to everyday use.\u00a0 Why is that?\u00a0 Because it has more of a gadget factor?<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t we also want identity through our stuff?\u00a0 As I think Karl&#8217;s post pointed out the other day, we tend to see differences rather than similarities.\u00a0 But I also think we strive to be different &#8211; to fit in with a particular class or group.\u00a0 Isn&#8217;t &#8220;a-to-b&#8221; cyclist, or &#8220;chic&#8221; cyclist just another form of cyclist with an associated set of behaviours and paraphernalia? And isn&#8217;t it, again, rightly or wrongly, a group that people are trying to fit themselves into to differentiate themselves from other types of cyclist?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Given that the above might be true, what things would you design\/invent to encourage more use of the bike as a means of transport.\u00a0 What marketing might we do to elevate the status of the everyday city\/commuter bike?\u00a0 How do we get to a state where owning something like a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pashley.co.uk\/\">Pashley<\/a> or, for that matter, any sort of bike with panniers and mudguards, is &#8220;mainstream&#8221; and &#8220;cool&#8221;? (I know we think it is, but do others?)<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the aim is to get people cycling whatever their bike is like and whatever they might have in their wardrobe, but I can&#8217;t help thinking that fashion&#8230;&#8221;kit&#8221;&#8230;&#8221;stuff&#8221; helps us get there.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine a Nike Bike.\u00a0 Or an Apple iBike.\u00a0 Or celebrity-endorsed cycles?\u00a0 Hey, I&#8217;m not a marketer&#8230;you&#8217;re ideas are almost certainly better then mine.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, in short, the bike needs rebranding?<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>Well, if I didn&#8217;t offend any of my cycling\/Twitter buddies with my last post, then maybe this one will do it!<\/p>\n<p>Kidding&#8230;well, possibly. \u00a0I don&#8217;t like being controvertial but there&#8217;s a balance that I want to address. \u00a0My aim is simply to put forward a different &#8211; not better, or worse, just different &#8211; point of view and, I hope, to try to get some of us cyclists united, despite our differences.<\/p>\n<p>You see most of the cyclists I seem to have come across online seem to be of the slow, chic, stylish cycling persuasion. \u00a0They promote cycling as a means of getting from A-to-B and they want to help you do it with the minimum of fuss&#8230;and definitely with the minimum of lycra!<\/p>\n<p>And this is a goal which I fully support. \u00a0People should be able to see cycling as a valid means of transport, and if my own cycle campaigning attempts (when they get underway) \u00a0are ever to be effective, I&#8217;ll need to be seen as someone who can hop on a bike at a moment&#8217;s notice and go somewhere, without any fuss.<\/p>\n<p>I DO cycle in my jeans and jumper (note: I probably don&#8217;t look cool but that&#8217;s more to do with my general lack of dress sense). \u00a0I do have a heavy, upright, hybrid bike with paniers that I can use as a workhorse for transport.<\/p>\n<p>But, I&#8217;m a sports cyclist too. I like to cycle fast. \u00a0I also have a light, sprightly bike with drop bars and low rolling resistance so that I can be efficient. \u00a0I like to get my heart pounding as I pull myself up a steep hill. \u00a0I track my rides, set goals, and go out riding purely for the hell of it.<\/p>\n<p>Darn it, I&#8217;m a lycra lout!<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t see being a sports cyclist and an &#8220;a-to-b&#8221; cyclist as being conflicting or contradictory. \u00a0I think they complement each other well. \u00a0The fitness I gain from being sporty makes getting from a-to-b easier!<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve read some stuff lately that&#8217;s made me feel like I&#8217;m inferior for being a sports cyclist. \u00a0Some of the cycle-chic crowd seem to frown upon light bikes with many gears, but when I got my road bike the acceleration and responsiveness were two of the things I quickly grew to love.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also concerned about the bike fashions being promoted. \u00a0Riding around in your everyday garb is fine&#8230;until it gets dark&#8230;or foggy&#8230;or it rains.<\/p>\n<p>A few years back, I nearly crashed my car into a cyclist, side on, who was traversing a roundabout at night, with no lights, wearing dark clothes. \u00a0Ever since, my primary goal when dressing for cycling isn&#8217;t to look cool, but it&#8217;s to be seen! \u00a0And my secondary goal is to be comfortable.<\/p>\n<p>This is possibly less of a problem on the continent. They don&#8217;t have the English weather to contend with, and their better cycling infrastructure makes it much safer to ride at night.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, I love all the Copenhagen and Amsterdam stuff. \u00a0It&#8217;s brilliant, and it&#8217;s great for showing people what everyday cycling could be like. \u00a0I love that cycling can actually have universal appeal. \u00a0And I will use the valuable resources that are onlinefor showcasing cycling chic because they are incredibly cool.<\/p>\n<p>And I also confess that there are probably road cyclists out there who turn thir noses up at people with big, heavy, practical, cool-looking bikes &#8211; I hope you won&#8217;t count me among them.<\/p>\n<p>But for the sake of appearing united as cyclists, I&#8217;d like to see a little more respect for those of us that like to get a bit of speed and sweat on. \u00a0Sometimes we&#8217;re just trying to get from A-to-B too!<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, even, the roadies and the cycle-chic crowd could get together and gang up on the really silly cyclists&#8230;the mountain bikers!!! \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Well, if I didn&#8217;t offend any of my cycling\/Twitter buddies with my last post, then maybe this one will do it!<\/p>\n<p>Kidding&#8230;well, possibly. \u00a0I don&#8217;t like being controvertial but there&#8217;s a balance that I want to address. \u00a0My aim is simply to put forward a different &#8211; not better, or worse, just different &#8211; point of view and, I hope, to try to get some of us cyclists united, despite our differences.<\/p>\n<p>You see most of the cyclists I seem to have come across online seem to be of the slow, chic, stylish cycling persuasion. \u00a0They promote cycling as a means of getting from A-to-B and they want to help you do it with the minimum of fuss&#8230;and definitely with the minimum of lycra!<\/p>\n<p>And this is a goal which I fully support. \u00a0People should be able to see cycling as a valid means of transport, and if my own cycle campaigning attempts (when they get underway) \u00a0are ever to be effective, I&#8217;ll need to be seen as someone who can hop on a bike at a moment&#8217;s notice and go somewhere, without any fuss.<\/p>\n<p>I DO cycle in my jeans and jumper (note: I probably don&#8217;t look cool but that&#8217;s more to do with my general lack of dress sense). \u00a0I do have a heavy, upright, hybrid bike with paniers that I can use as a workhorse for transport.<\/p>\n<p>But, I&#8217;m a sports cyclist too. I like to cycle fast. \u00a0I also have a light, sprightly bike with drop bars and low rolling resistance so that I can be efficient. \u00a0I like to get my heart pounding as I pull myself up a steep hill. \u00a0I track my rides, set goals, and go out riding purely for the hell of it.<\/p>\n<p>Darn it, I&#8217;m a lycra lout!<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t see being a sports cyclist and an &#8220;a-to-b&#8221; cyclist as being conflicting or contradictory. \u00a0I think they complement each other well. \u00a0The fitness I gain from being sporty makes getting from a-to-b easier!<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve read some stuff lately that&#8217;s made me feel like I&#8217;m inferior for being a sports cyclist. \u00a0Some of the cycle-chic crowd seem to frown upon light bikes with many gears, but when I got my road bike the acceleration and responsiveness were two of the things I quickly grew to love.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also concerned about the bike fashions being promoted. \u00a0Riding around in your everyday garb is fine&#8230;until it gets dark&#8230;or foggy&#8230;or it rains.<\/p>\n<p>A few years back, I nearly crashed my car into a cyclist, side on, who was traversing a roundabout at night, with no lights, wearing dark clothes. \u00a0Ever since, my primary goal when dressing for cycling isn&#8217;t to look cool, but it&#8217;s to be seen! \u00a0And my secondary goal is to be comfortable.<\/p>\n<p>This is possibly less of a problem on the continent. They don&#8217;t have the English weather to contend with, and their better cycling infrastructure makes it much safer to ride at night.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, I love all the Copenhagen and Amsterdam stuff. \u00a0It&#8217;s brilliant, and it&#8217;s great for showing people what everyday cycling could be like. \u00a0I love that cycling can actually have universal appeal. \u00a0And I will use the valuable resources that are onlinefor showcasing cycling chic because they are incredibly cool.<\/p>\n<p>And I also confess that there are probably road cyclists out there who turn thir noses up at people with big, heavy, practical, cool-looking bikes &#8211; I hope you won&#8217;t count me among them.<\/p>\n<p>But for the sake of appearing united as cyclists, I&#8217;d like to see a little more respect for those of us that like to get a bit of speed and sweat on. \u00a0Sometimes we&#8217;re just trying to get from A-to-B too!<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, even, the roadies and the cycle-chic crowd could get together and gang up on the really silly cyclists&#8230;the mountain bikers!!! \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n",

I mean, I only follow about 40 people and that&#8217;s too much. \u00a0Most people seem to have HUNDREDS! \u00a0And it baffles me how you would keep up with such numbers.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this more deeply lately too, and I think there&#8217;s another problem. \u00a0The Social Web, Web 2.0, or whatever you want to call it, is becoming too self-referential. \u00a0What do I mean by that? \u00a0Well, so much stuff that&#8217;s on the web is about&#8230; the web. \u00a0Even I&#8217;m doing it. \u00a0Right now!!<\/p>\n<p>People twitter about Twitter and blog about Blogs. \u00a0I even read blogs that tell me about useful tools for making my web presence more effective, or for being more efficient at doing stuff online. \u00a0Stuff that I wouldn&#8217;t need if I wasn&#8217;t online reading all these blogs&#8230;hmmm.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, sometimes I&#8217;m \u00a0is useful and I&#8217;ve discovered lots of really interesting things through social networking, but I coped without all that stuff before and I have a sense that the web actually makes work for me, and then gives me ways to cope with the extra work.<\/p>\n<p>It feels like the volume of &#8220;real stuff&#8221; being talked about on the internet is decreasing. \u00a0And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s interesting to me.<\/p>\n<p>Does anyone else get this sense at all?<\/p>\n<p>And so to the last few days &#8211; real friends are joining. \u00a0I was going to ask &#8220;Would Twitter with real friends be different?&#8221;, but it seems, I&#8217;m about to find out.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because I have a 9-5, full-time job and Twitter isn&#8217;t a great form of communication for someone like me. \u00a0Perhaps it&#8217;s more suited to self-employed, consultancy types, or people who&#8217;s job it is to work with web-based media. \u00a0I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<p>So, go on, convince me to stay!<\/p>\n",

I mean, I only follow about 40 people and that&#8217;s too much. \u00a0Most people seem to have HUNDREDS! \u00a0And it baffles me how you would keep up with such numbers.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this more deeply lately too, and I think there&#8217;s another problem. \u00a0The Social Web, Web 2.0, or whatever you want to call it, is becoming too self-referential. \u00a0What do I mean by that? \u00a0Well, so much stuff that&#8217;s on the web is about&#8230; the web. \u00a0Even I&#8217;m doing it. \u00a0Right now!!<\/p>\n<p>People twitter about Twitter and blog about Blogs. \u00a0I even read blogs that tell me about useful tools for making my web presence more effective, or for being more efficient at doing stuff online. \u00a0Stuff that I wouldn&#8217;t need if I wasn&#8217;t online reading all these blogs&#8230;hmmm.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, sometimes I&#8217;m \u00a0is useful and I&#8217;ve discovered lots of really interesting things through social networking, but I coped without all that stuff before and I have a sense that the web actually makes work for me, and then gives me ways to cope with the extra work.<\/p>\n<p>It feels like the volume of &#8220;real stuff&#8221; being talked about on the internet is decreasing. \u00a0And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s interesting to me.<\/p>\n<p>Does anyone else get this sense at all?<\/p>\n<p>And so to the last few days &#8211; real friends are joining. \u00a0I was going to ask &#8220;Would Twitter with real friends be different?&#8221;, but it seems, I&#8217;m about to find out.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because I have a 9-5, full-time job and Twitter isn&#8217;t a great form of communication for someone like me. \u00a0Perhaps it&#8217;s more suited to self-employed, consultancy types, or people who&#8217;s job it is to work with web-based media. \u00a0I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<p>So, go on, convince me to stay!<\/p>\n",
