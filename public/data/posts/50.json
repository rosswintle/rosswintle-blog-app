I have drunk the Copenhagen Kool-aid, for sure.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s definitely a sense of wanting to change the status quo, though; we have car dominance overall in the UK, but within cycling the emphasis in most bike marketing is on MTBs, lycra, lots and lots of *kit*.<\/p>\n<p>I, like quite a few others, would love to see more cycling-as-transportation, for health and traffic congestion reasons. It\u2019s the lack of mainstream emphasis on this that causes us to shout loud, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Keep on cycling, in whatever form <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http:\/\/s.wordpress.com\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnyone who rides a bike is a friend of mine\u201d \u2014 Gary Fisher<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I like what Tim said and I agree wholeheartedly, but it triggered some more thoughts in my brain.<\/p>\n<p>Now, occasionally I like to play devil&#8217;s advocate somewhat.\u00a0 These aren&#8217;t ideas that are fully thought through, or even that I agree with, they are questions to stimulate further discussion.<\/p>\n<p>We live in an age where pretty much everything&#8217;s commercialised; where, rightly or wrongly, &#8220;lots of *kit*&#8221; is the norm.\u00a0 Here&#8217;s some thoughts then:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Isn&#8217;t it <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">good<\/span> that we have lots of cycling kit so that people who are gadget-lovers can get a hook into cycling?\u00a0 Perhaps this is one of the reasons for the boom in mountain biking&#8230;it&#8217;s a chance to acquire more &#8220;cool stuff&#8221;?\u00a0 A mountain bike appears to be a much greater status symbol than a road bike, a commuter, or a tourer, even though it may be less suited to everyday use.\u00a0 Why is that?\u00a0 Because it has more of a gadget factor?<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t we also want identity through our stuff?\u00a0 As I think Karl&#8217;s post pointed out the other day, we tend to see differences rather than similarities.\u00a0 But I also think we strive to be different &#8211; to fit in with a particular class or group.\u00a0 Isn&#8217;t &#8220;a-to-b&#8221; cyclist, or &#8220;chic&#8221; cyclist just another form of cyclist with an associated set of behaviours and paraphernalia? And isn&#8217;t it, again, rightly or wrongly, a group that people are trying to fit themselves into to differentiate themselves from other types of cyclist?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Given that the above might be true, what things would you design\/invent to encourage more use of the bike as a means of transport.\u00a0 What marketing might we do to elevate the status of the everyday city\/commuter bike?\u00a0 How do we get to a state where owning something like a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pashley.co.uk\/\">Pashley<\/a> or, for that matter, any sort of bike with panniers and mudguards, is &#8220;mainstream&#8221; and &#8220;cool&#8221;? (I know we think it is, but do others?)<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the aim is to get people cycling whatever their bike is like and whatever they might have in their wardrobe, but I can&#8217;t help thinking that fashion&#8230;&#8221;kit&#8221;&#8230;&#8221;stuff&#8221; helps us get there.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine a Nike Bike.\u00a0 Or an Apple iBike.\u00a0 Or celebrity-endorsed cycles?\u00a0 Hey, I&#8217;m not a marketer&#8230;you&#8217;re ideas are almost certainly better then mine.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, in short, the bike needs rebranding?<\/p>\n",

I have drunk the Copenhagen Kool-aid, for sure.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s definitely a sense of wanting to change the status quo, though; we have car dominance overall in the UK, but within cycling the emphasis in most bike marketing is on MTBs, lycra, lots and lots of *kit*.<\/p>\n<p>I, like quite a few others, would love to see more cycling-as-transportation, for health and traffic congestion reasons. It\u2019s the lack of mainstream emphasis on this that causes us to shout loud, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Keep on cycling, in whatever form <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http:\/\/s.wordpress.com\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnyone who rides a bike is a friend of mine\u201d \u2014 Gary Fisher<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I like what Tim said and I agree wholeheartedly, but it triggered some more thoughts in my brain.<\/p>\n<p>Now, occasionally I like to play devil&#8217;s advocate somewhat.\u00a0 These aren&#8217;t ideas that are fully thought through, or even that I agree with, they are questions to stimulate further discussion.<\/p>\n<p>We live in an age where pretty much everything&#8217;s commercialised; where, rightly or wrongly, &#8220;lots of *kit*&#8221; is the norm.\u00a0 Here&#8217;s some thoughts then:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Isn&#8217;t it <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">good<\/span> that we have lots of cycling kit so that people who are gadget-lovers can get a hook into cycling?\u00a0 Perhaps this is one of the reasons for the boom in mountain biking&#8230;it&#8217;s a chance to acquire more &#8220;cool stuff&#8221;?\u00a0 A mountain bike appears to be a much greater status symbol than a road bike, a commuter, or a tourer, even though it may be less suited to everyday use.\u00a0 Why is that?\u00a0 Because it has more of a gadget factor?<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t we also want identity through our stuff?\u00a0 As I think Karl&#8217;s post pointed out the other day, we tend to see differences rather than similarities.\u00a0 But I also think we strive to be different &#8211; to fit in with a particular class or group.\u00a0 Isn&#8217;t &#8220;a-to-b&#8221; cyclist, or &#8220;chic&#8221; cyclist just another form of cyclist with an associated set of behaviours and paraphernalia? And isn&#8217;t it, again, rightly or wrongly, a group that people are trying to fit themselves into to differentiate themselves from other types of cyclist?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Given that the above might be true, what things would you design\/invent to encourage more use of the bike as a means of transport.\u00a0 What marketing might we do to elevate the status of the everyday city\/commuter bike?\u00a0 How do we get to a state where owning something like a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pashley.co.uk\/\">Pashley<\/a> or, for that matter, any sort of bike with panniers and mudguards, is &#8220;mainstream&#8221; and &#8220;cool&#8221;? (I know we think it is, but do others?)<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the aim is to get people cycling whatever their bike is like and whatever they might have in their wardrobe, but I can&#8217;t help thinking that fashion&#8230;&#8221;kit&#8221;&#8230;&#8221;stuff&#8221; helps us get there.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine a Nike Bike.\u00a0 Or an Apple iBike.\u00a0 Or celebrity-endorsed cycles?\u00a0 Hey, I&#8217;m not a marketer&#8230;you&#8217;re ideas are almost certainly better then mine.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, in short, the bike needs rebranding?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>There&#8217;s been lots of music added to our collection since I last did a &#8220;review&#8221;, but something quite special has happened and it&#8217;s prompted me to write!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been a pretty big fan of American, surf-rockers, Switchfoot, for a while now.\u00a0 Talented songwriting (something I value highly in my music), great music, a variety of styles, and some reflections on politics and faith mixed in for good measure.\u00a0 I&#8217;m not quite as much of a fan as one friend of mine who declared a gig in London &#8220;the most important event of the year&#8221; (or something similar), but they&#8217;re pretty high up my list.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I somehow found out that their frontman, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/jonforeman\">Jon Foreman<\/a>, had somehow found time to do some solo stuff.\u00a0 It seems he made 4 EP&#8217;s, one for each season, and then did a compilation of the best of them called &#8220;Limbs and Branches&#8221;, with a couple of new songs thrown in for good measure.<\/p>\n<p>Now, it&#8217;s not often I put a CD on and immediately declare that &#8220;I like it&#8221;.\u00a0 But this is exactly what happened with L&amp;B.\u00a0 It&#8217;s not even entirely my style &#8211; I like my rock a bit more upbeat.\u00a0 But Foreman&#8217;s solo efforts show why he&#8217;s the frontman of a highly successful band that&#8217;s crossed from the obscurity of Christian rock, into the American Mainstream.<\/p>\n<p>The songs are art; words and ideas crafted into musical poetry.\u00a0 The execution is slick.\u00a0 It&#8217;s well-produced, but not over-produced, retaining a slighly raw edge.\u00a0 There&#8217;s even a guest appearance from Sarah Masen, who adds some handy female depth and variety to Foreman&#8217;s passionate vocals.<\/p>\n<p>Songs are mostly quite downbeat and there&#8217;s tension and drama, but I find that Foreman, unlike other folk rockers, retains more of a hopeful edge.<\/p>\n<p>Christian references are more prominent than with Switchfoot &#8211; the opening track is based on The Lord&#8217;s Prayer.\u00a0 This may put some off.\u00a0 But if you like some mellow, gritty, folk rock storytelling on your shelf, this deserves a look.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and if you ever wanted to buy me a pretty lavish gift, track down Foreman&#8217;s accoustic guitar, amp and any other kit he used to make this record &#8211; the instrument sings something quite beautiful!!!<\/p>\n<p>Hey, I can dream!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>Well, if I didn&#8217;t offend any of my cycling\/Twitter buddies with my last post, then maybe this one will do it!<\/p>\n<p>Kidding&#8230;well, possibly. \u00a0I don&#8217;t like being controvertial but there&#8217;s a balance that I want to address. \u00a0My aim is simply to put forward a different &#8211; not better, or worse, just different &#8211; point of view and, I hope, to try to get some of us cyclists united, despite our differences.<\/p>\n<p>You see most of the cyclists I seem to have come across online seem to be of the slow, chic, stylish cycling persuasion. \u00a0They promote cycling as a means of getting from A-to-B and they want to help you do it with the minimum of fuss&#8230;and definitely with the minimum of lycra!<\/p>\n<p>And this is a goal which I fully support. \u00a0People should be able to see cycling as a valid means of transport, and if my own cycle campaigning attempts (when they get underway) \u00a0are ever to be effective, I&#8217;ll need to be seen as someone who can hop on a bike at a moment&#8217;s notice and go somewhere, without any fuss.<\/p>\n<p>I DO cycle in my jeans and jumper (note: I probably don&#8217;t look cool but that&#8217;s more to do with my general lack of dress sense). \u00a0I do have a heavy, upright, hybrid bike with paniers that I can use as a workhorse for transport.<\/p>\n<p>But, I&#8217;m a sports cyclist too. I like to cycle fast. \u00a0I also have a light, sprightly bike with drop bars and low rolling resistance so that I can be efficient. \u00a0I like to get my heart pounding as I pull myself up a steep hill. \u00a0I track my rides, set goals, and go out riding purely for the hell of it.<\/p>\n<p>Darn it, I&#8217;m a lycra lout!<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t see being a sports cyclist and an &#8220;a-to-b&#8221; cyclist as being conflicting or contradictory. \u00a0I think they complement each other well. \u00a0The fitness I gain from being sporty makes getting from a-to-b easier!<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve read some stuff lately that&#8217;s made me feel like I&#8217;m inferior for being a sports cyclist. \u00a0Some of the cycle-chic crowd seem to frown upon light bikes with many gears, but when I got my road bike the acceleration and responsiveness were two of the things I quickly grew to love.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also concerned about the bike fashions being promoted. \u00a0Riding around in your everyday garb is fine&#8230;until it gets dark&#8230;or foggy&#8230;or it rains.<\/p>\n<p>A few years back, I nearly crashed my car into a cyclist, side on, who was traversing a roundabout at night, with no lights, wearing dark clothes. \u00a0Ever since, my primary goal when dressing for cycling isn&#8217;t to look cool, but it&#8217;s to be seen! \u00a0And my secondary goal is to be comfortable.<\/p>\n<p>This is possibly less of a problem on the continent. They don&#8217;t have the English weather to contend with, and their better cycling infrastructure makes it much safer to ride at night.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, I love all the Copenhagen and Amsterdam stuff. \u00a0It&#8217;s brilliant, and it&#8217;s great for showing people what everyday cycling could be like. \u00a0I love that cycling can actually have universal appeal. \u00a0And I will use the valuable resources that are onlinefor showcasing cycling chic because they are incredibly cool.<\/p>\n<p>And I also confess that there are probably road cyclists out there who turn thir noses up at people with big, heavy, practical, cool-looking bikes &#8211; I hope you won&#8217;t count me among them.<\/p>\n<p>But for the sake of appearing united as cyclists, I&#8217;d like to see a little more respect for those of us that like to get a bit of speed and sweat on. \u00a0Sometimes we&#8217;re just trying to get from A-to-B too!<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, even, the roadies and the cycle-chic crowd could get together and gang up on the really silly cyclists&#8230;the mountain bikers!!! \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n",

I like to cycle fast. \u00a0I also have a light, sprightly bike with drop bars and low rolling resistance so that I can be efficient. \u00a0I like to get my heart pounding as I pull myself up a steep hill. \u00a0I track my rides, set goals, and go out riding purely for the hell of it.<\/p>\n<p>Darn it, I&#8217;m a lycra lout!<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t see being a sports cyclist and an &#8220;a-to-b&#8221; cyclist as being conflicting or contradictory. \u00a0I think they complement each other well. \u00a0The fitness I gain from being sporty makes getting from a-to-b easier!<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve read some stuff lately that&#8217;s made me feel like I&#8217;m inferior for being a sports cyclist. \u00a0Some of the cycle-chic crowd seem to frown upon light bikes with many gears, but when I got my road bike the acceleration and responsiveness were two of the things I quickly grew to love.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also concerned about the bike fashions being promoted. \u00a0Riding around in your everyday garb is fine&#8230;until it gets dark&#8230;or foggy&#8230;or it rains.<\/p>\n<p>A few years back, I nearly crashed my car into a cyclist, side on, who was traversing a roundabout at night, with no lights, wearing dark clothes. \u00a0Ever since, my primary goal when dressing for cycling isn&#8217;t to look cool, but it&#8217;s to be seen! \u00a0And my secondary goal is to be comfortable.<\/p>\n<p>This is possibly less of a problem on the continent. They don&#8217;t have the English weather to contend with, and their better cycling infrastructure makes it much safer to ride at night.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, I love all the Copenhagen and Amsterdam stuff. \u00a0It&#8217;s brilliant, and it&#8217;s great for showing people what everyday cycling could be like. \u00a0I love that cycling can actually have universal appeal. \u00a0And I will use the valuable resources that are onlinefor showcasing cycling chic because they are incredibly cool.<\/p>\n<p>And I also confess that there are probably road cyclists out there who turn thir noses up at people with big, heavy, practical, cool-looking bikes &#8211; I hope you won&#8217;t count me among them.<\/p>\n<p>But for the sake of appearing united as cyclists, I&#8217;d like to see a little more respect for those of us that like to get a bit of speed and sweat on. \u00a0Sometimes we&#8217;re just trying to get from A-to-B too!<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, even, the roadies and the cycle-chic crowd could get together and gang up on the really silly cyclists&#8230;the mountain bikers!!! \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n",

I mean, I only follow about 40 people and that&#8217;s too much. \u00a0Most people seem to have HUNDREDS! \u00a0And it baffles me how you would keep up with such numbers.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this more deeply lately too, and I think there&#8217;s another problem. \u00a0The Social Web, Web 2.0, or whatever you want to call it, is becoming too self-referential. \u00a0What do I mean by that? \u00a0Well, so much stuff that&#8217;s on the web is about&#8230; the web. \u00a0Even I&#8217;m doing it. \u00a0Right now!!<\/p>\n<p>People twitter about Twitter and blog about Blogs. \u00a0I even read blogs that tell me about useful tools for making my web presence more effective, or for being more efficient at doing stuff online. \u00a0Stuff that I wouldn&#8217;t need if I wasn&#8217;t online reading all these blogs&#8230;hmmm.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, sometimes I&#8217;m \u00a0is useful and I&#8217;ve discovered lots of really interesting things through social networking, but I coped without all that stuff before and I have a sense that the web actually makes work for me, and then gives me ways to cope with the extra work.<\/p>\n<p>It feels like the volume of &#8220;real stuff&#8221; being talked about on the internet is decreasing. \u00a0And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s interesting to me.<\/p>\n<p>Does anyone else get this sense at all?<\/p>\n<p>And so to the last few days &#8211; real friends are joining. \u00a0I was going to ask &#8220;Would Twitter with real friends be different?&#8221;, but it seems, I&#8217;m about to find out.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because I have a 9-5, full-time job and Twitter isn&#8217;t a great form of communication for someone like me. \u00a0Perhaps it&#8217;s more suited to self-employed, consultancy types, or people who&#8217;s job it is to work with web-based media. \u00a0I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<p>So, go on, convince me to stay!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I&#8217;ve been contemplating my presence on Twitter for a while and I&#8217;m at quite an odd juncture with it as, all of a sudden, more people that I know in real life are joining. \u00a0 I&#8217;ll try to be brief with my thoughts but I think this will turn into a bit of an essay.<\/p>\n<p>I <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/02\/01\/taking-up-twittering-as-facebook-flops\/\">joined Twitter<\/a> just over a year ago and when I did so my feeling was very much that Facebook had got too complicated and Twitter would represent a simpler way of keeping tabs on my real friends.<\/p>\n<p>But no one else really joined and Facebook remined the de facto way to see what people were up to.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter remained a minor interest at first, but over time my interest grew. \u00a0Factors that contributed to that growth of interest were:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finding more people with common interests (mostly other cyclists).<\/li>\n<li>Use of <a href=\"http:\/\/search.twitter.com\">Twitter&#8217;s search functionality<\/a>, which gives interesting ways of seeing what people are saying about a given topic.<\/li>\n<li>Interesting uses, like when we had lots of snow and people started using Twitter with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hashtags.org\">Hashtags<\/a>\u00a0(like <a href=\"http:\/\/hashtags.org\/tag\/uksnow\">#uksnow<\/a>) and scripts and maps to do interesting things like track the snow in real time&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>&#8230;or when GMail went down and Twitter became a great way to track what was going on with that and who it was affecting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Heck, even my wife claimed that &#8220;Twitter is useful after all&#8221; when I discovered I was following someone who worked for the Cyclists Touring Club (CTC) and who could help put me in touch with the Swindon Cycle Champion. \u00a0Hooray!<\/p>\n<p>Now, I REALLY hope that this doesn&#8217;t offend anyone that I follow (please, debate in the comments below if you think I&#8217;m missing something), but, as time went on, these useful bits and bobs started to make up only a small portion of the stuff I read on Twitter. \u00a0Heck, if I&#8217;m honest, I wouldn&#8217;t follow myself &#8211; I&#8217;m far from interesting.<\/p>\n<p>Please, followees, it&#8217;s not that you&#8217;re boring &#8211; far from it, that&#8217;s why I follow &#8211; but it&#8217;s hard to keep up with you all sometimes, and it&#8217;s becoming my opinion that the value that I get from it isn&#8217;t in proportion to the time I put into it.<\/p>\n<p>Now, there is a part of me that thinks that I&#8217;m doing something wrong. \u00a0Perhaps there&#8217;s a Twitter client out there that will help me get more value? I mean, I only follow about 40 people and that&#8217;s too much. \u00a0Most people seem to have HUNDREDS! \u00a0And it baffles me how you would keep up with such numbers.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this more deeply lately too, and I think there&#8217;s another problem. \u00a0The Social Web, Web 2.0, or whatever you want to call it, is becoming too self-referential. \u00a0What do I mean by that? \u00a0Well, so much stuff that&#8217;s on the web is about&#8230; the web. \u00a0Even I&#8217;m doing it. \u00a0Right now!!<\/p>\n<p>People twitter about Twitter and blog about Blogs. \u00a0I even read blogs that tell me about useful tools for making my web presence more effective, or for being more efficient at doing stuff online. \u00a0Stuff that I wouldn&#8217;t need if I wasn&#8217;t online reading all these blogs&#8230;hmmm.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, sometimes I&#8217;m \u00a0is useful and I&#8217;ve discovered lots of really interesting things through social networking, but I coped without all that stuff before and I have a sense that the web actually makes work for me, and then gives me ways to cope with the extra work.<\/p>\n<p>It feels like the volume of &#8220;real stuff&#8221; being talked about on the internet is decreasing. \u00a0And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s interesting to me.<\/p>\n<p>Does anyone else get this sense at all?<\/p>\n<p>And so to the last few days &#8211; real friends are joining. \u00a0I was going to ask &#8220;Would Twitter with real friends be different?&#8221;, but it seems, I&#8217;m about to find out.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because I have a 9-5, full-time job and Twitter isn&#8217;t a great form of communication for someone like me. \u00a0Perhaps it&#8217;s more suited to self-employed, consultancy types, or people who&#8217;s job it is to work with web-based media. \u00a0I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<p>So, go on, convince me to stay!<\/p>\n",

The outer walls are nowhere near as cold as they were, the draught that used to come rushing down the stairs, through the hallway, and into the lounge has all but gone, and we&#8217;ve been consistently toasty-warm since the work was done &#8211; even when the temperature has dropped!<\/p>\n<p>The only problem was the long wait &#8211; seems Domestic and General Insulation aren&#8217;t that efficient at processing paperwork &#8211; and getting hold of the installations administrators on the phone was impossible!<\/p>\n<p>But despite that we&#8217;re very happy with our newly filled holes &#8211; and we&#8217;re looking forward to the next gas bill too!<\/p>\n",
