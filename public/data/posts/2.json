It has several parts and looks at artificial intelligence from a number of different creative angles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s fascinating stories of how people become convinced of the &#8220;intelligence&#8221; of ChatGPT. There&#8217;s a short story that reverses the roles and tries to see how intelligent machines might question the intelligence of &#8220;meat&#8221;. There&#8217;s an aside about what whales might be up to. And a truly wonderful short documentary about teenagerhood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all wonderful bits of audio, as you would expect from the TAL crew. But the first one tapped into a whole load of things I&#8217;m thinking about these Large Language Model (LLM) AI&#8217;s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, when explaining how LLM&#8217;s work to people, I&#8217;ll say:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just predicting the next word from what it knows. So if I say to you &#8216;The cat sat on the&#8230;&#8217;, you would normally say&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>and the answer comes back:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;Mat&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And&#8230;that works as a REALLY simplified explanation. But it does often leave me wondering: Hang on&#8230; are WE just predicting the next word too?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the podcast, the people interviewed explain how they tried to get ChatGPT to do things that proved &#8211; or disproved &#8211; its &#8220;intelligence&#8221;. To show that it had a deeper understanding of what it was doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One challenge to ChatGPT is to get it to draw something. But it can&#8217;t draw. So they get it to write some code that will draw something. And it draws a unicorn. And then it&#8217;s given code that draws a unicorn without a horn, and is asked to modify the code to add the horn. And it does it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woah!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also ask it how to stack a number of items on top of each other: &#8220;a book, nine eggs, a laptop, a bottle, and a nail&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT 3 can&#8217;t do this. But ChatGPT 4 can:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;place the book flat on the level surface&#8230; Arrange the nine eggs in a 3-by-3 square on top of the book, leaving some space between them. The eggs will form a second layer and distribute the weight evenly. It continues&#8230; Laptop goes on the eggs, then the bottle, then the nail on the bottle cap, pointy end of the nail facing up&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Woah!!!! It&#8230; it &#8220;understands&#8221;!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there&#8217;s a &#8220;theory of mind&#8221; incident. This is where you can understand what another person knows or could be thinking, and it&#8217;s something you can&#8217;t do as a baby. Until you have &#8220;theory of mind&#8221; everyone knows the same things that you know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>John and Mark are in a room with a cat, a box, and a basket. John takes the cat and puts it in the basket. He leaves the room and goes to school. While John&#8217;s away, Mark takes the cat out of the basket and puts it in the box. Mark leaves the room and goes to work. John and Mark come back and enter the room. Where do they [each] think the cat is?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And ChatGPT 4 knows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where I start to have questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one&#8230; it seems to me like the computer should know this. Well, it should be able to complete this, regardless of whether or not it &#8220;knows&#8221; about the people and stuff. So I wouldn&#8217;t say that the computer has theory of mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what, then, prevents humans being able to complete this task correctly as an infant? Why do we NOT have theory of mind at a young age?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a psychologist. Perhaps there is an answer. And I&#8217;m not a philosopher. But this does speak to a part of me that thinks that we are more than just knowledge machines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our thinking and behaviour is often cloudied or muddied or influenced by other things. Tiredness. Hormones. Emotions. Memories can be fallible. Thoughts can both come from nowhere, and be muddled and incomplete for a whole variety of reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you probably can model a brain in terms of a neural network. But there&#8217;s all these other things going on in a person. A lot of which we don&#8217;t even understand let alone have the ability to model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I wondered was are the infants with no theory of mind driven more by their &#8220;lizard brain&#8221;? I&#8217;ve read a lot about how we have the primaeval &#8220;lizard brain&#8221; that controls our deepest instincts like the fight-or-flight instinct; the &#8220;monkey brain&#8221; which controls some higher levels of motivation and emotion, and the &#8220;human brain&#8221; which controls more abstract thought. (This is <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Triune_brain\">kinda considered a myth now<\/a>, but it seems to be a useful simplification.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are infants just more reliant on their instinctive behaviour?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And could we say that the LLM&#8217;s like Chat GPT are just &#8220;pure human brain&#8221; &#8211; logical, abstract thought, but with no emotions or instincts?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many, many years ago now, in my A Level Computing class (education aged 16-18) we debated whether an accurate reconstruction of a human brain from silicon &#8220;neurons&#8221; would be &#8220;intelligent&#8221; or &#8220;alive&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always felt like it wouldn&#8217;t be. That a human has something else going on. A &#8220;soul&#8221; or &#8220;spirit&#8221; that is something more than the sum of its parts. And this was before any helpful encounter with religion or spirituality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still think this with ChatGPT. Sure&#8230; it&#8217;s clever. But is there more to &#8220;intelligence&#8221; than even &#8220;knowing&#8221; or &#8220;understanding&#8221; things? Is ChatGPT clever because it _has_ &#8220;theory of mind&#8221;, or is it stupid because it _lacks_ the instincts that keep a toddler alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really don&#8217;t know. But they were interesting thoughts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do YOU think?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thisamericanlife.org\/803\/\">This episode of This American Life<\/a> is amazing. It has several parts and looks at artificial intelligence from a number of different creative angles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s fascinating stories of how people become convinced of the &#8220;intelligence&#8221; of ChatGPT. There&#8217;s a short story that reverses the roles and tries to see how intelligent machines might question the intelligence of &#8220;meat&#8221;. There&#8217;s an aside about what whales might be up to. And a truly wonderful short documentary about teenagerhood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all wonderful bits of audio, as you would expect from the TAL crew. But the first one tapped into a whole load of things I&#8217;m thinking about these Large Language Model (LLM) AI&#8217;s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, when explaining how LLM&#8217;s work to people, I&#8217;ll say:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just predicting the next word from what it knows. So if I say to you &#8216;The cat sat on the&#8230;&#8217;, you would normally say&#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>and the answer comes back:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;Mat&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And&#8230;that works as a REALLY simplified explanation. But it does often leave me wondering: Hang on&#8230; are WE just predicting the next word too?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the podcast, the people interviewed explain how they tried to get ChatGPT to do things that proved &#8211; or disproved &#8211; its &#8220;intelligence&#8221;. To show that it had a deeper understanding of what it was doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One challenge to ChatGPT is to get it to draw something. But it can&#8217;t draw. So they get it to write some code that will draw something. And it draws a unicorn. And then it&#8217;s given code that draws a unicorn without a horn, and is asked to modify the code to add the horn. And it does it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woah!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also ask it how to stack a number of items on top of each other: &#8220;a book, nine eggs, a laptop, a bottle, and a nail&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ChatGPT 3 can&#8217;t do this. But ChatGPT 4 can:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;place the book flat on the level surface&#8230; Arrange the nine eggs in a 3-by-3 square on top of the book, leaving some space between them. The eggs will form a second layer and distribute the weight evenly. It continues&#8230; Laptop goes on the eggs, then the bottle, then the nail on the bottle cap, pointy end of the nail facing up&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Woah!!!! It&#8230; it &#8220;understands&#8221;!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there&#8217;s a &#8220;theory of mind&#8221; incident. This is where you can understand what another person knows or could be thinking, and it&#8217;s something you can&#8217;t do as a baby. Until you have &#8220;theory of mind&#8221; everyone knows the same things that you know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>John and Mark are in a room with a cat, a box, and a basket. John takes the cat and puts it in the basket. He leaves the room and goes to school. While John&#8217;s away, Mark takes the cat out of the basket and puts it in the box. Mark leaves the room and goes to work. John and Mark come back and enter the room. Where do they [each] think the cat is?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And ChatGPT 4 knows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where I start to have questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one&#8230; it seems to me like the computer should know this. Well, it should be able to complete this, regardless of whether or not it &#8220;knows&#8221; about the people and stuff. So I wouldn&#8217;t say that the computer has theory of mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what, then, prevents humans being able to complete this task correctly as an infant? Why do we NOT have theory of mind at a young age?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a psychologist. Perhaps there is an answer. And I&#8217;m not a philosopher. But this does speak to a part of me that thinks that we are more than just knowledge machines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our thinking and behaviour is often cloudied or muddied or influenced by other things. Tiredness. Hormones. Emotions. Memories can be fallible. Thoughts can both come from nowhere, and be muddled and incomplete for a whole variety of reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you probably can model a brain in terms of a neural network. But there&#8217;s all these other things going on in a person. A lot of which we don&#8217;t even understand let alone have the ability to model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I wondered was are the infants with no theory of mind driven more by their &#8220;lizard brain&#8221;? I&#8217;ve read a lot about how we have the primaeval &#8220;lizard brain&#8221; that controls our deepest instincts like the fight-or-flight instinct; the &#8220;monkey brain&#8221; which controls some higher levels of motivation and emotion, and the &#8220;human brain&#8221; which controls more abstract thought. (This is <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Triune_brain\">kinda considered a myth now<\/a>, but it seems to be a useful simplification.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are infants just more reliant on their instinctive behaviour?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And could we say that the LLM&#8217;s like Chat GPT are just &#8220;pure human brain&#8221; &#8211; logical, abstract thought, but with no emotions or instincts?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many, many years ago now, in my A Level Computing class (education aged 16-18) we debated whether an accurate reconstruction of a human brain from silicon &#8220;neurons&#8221; would be &#8220;intelligent&#8221; or &#8220;alive&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always felt like it wouldn&#8217;t be. That a human has something else going on. A &#8220;soul&#8221; or &#8220;spirit&#8221; that is something more than the sum of its parts. And this was before any helpful encounter with religion or spirituality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still think this with ChatGPT. Sure&#8230; it&#8217;s clever. But is there more to &#8220;intelligence&#8221; than even &#8220;knowing&#8221; or &#8220;understanding&#8221; things? Is ChatGPT clever because it _has_ &#8220;theory of mind&#8221;, or is it stupid because it _lacks_ the instincts that keep a toddler alive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really don&#8217;t know. But they were interesting thoughts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do YOU think?<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;d much rather be working on APIs, databases, command-line tools, algorithms, and so on. But I work full-stack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m tired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of resolving complex, but poorly explained npm dependency issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of debugging multi-layer caching issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of testing and merging dependabot PRs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of trying to learn React and its idiosyncrasies when it&#8217;s a constantly moving target.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of choosing between Next and Astro and npm and yarn and Bun and Deno and webpack and esbuild and Vite and SWC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of wondering where the heck WordPress is going and of logging in to something that&#8217;s changed again and that still feels like it&#8217;s shunned all the UI conventions that I know.

Now it&#8217;s discovering that someone who doesn&#8217;t know what they were doing used a <code>div<\/code> instead of a <code>button<\/code> and fixing it involves half a day of frustratedly poking around files that make no sense and fixing a broken build process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is any other software process better?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I truly believe this is a bad world. Marketing hype has taken over, burdening us with perpetual intellectual and technical debt. Giving the illusion of helping us while actually hindering us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m convinced that there MUST be a LOAD of JS\/web developers who are killing it. Who have sharpened their tools and knowledge to such an extent that this world is one of wonder and awe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I love learning new things. And am willing to do whatever is needed to get the job done. But I&#8217;m just not convinced that the things that the world says I &#8220;should&#8221; learn and use are the right things to learn and use. They may seem better for the short term &#8220;wow factor&#8221;. But they so quickly seem to become problematic, fragile, or obsolete. And yet the world keeps saying that they are the things I should learn and use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t get it. It makes no sense to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m so tired.<\/p>\n",

But I work full-stack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m tired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of resolving complex, but poorly explained npm dependency issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of debugging multi-layer caching issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of testing and merging dependabot PRs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of trying to learn React and its idiosyncrasies when it&#8217;s a constantly moving target.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of choosing between Next and Astro and npm and yarn and Bun and Deno and webpack and esbuild and Vite and SWC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m tired of wondering where the heck WordPress is going and of logging in to something that&#8217;s changed again and that still feels like it&#8217;s shunned all the UI conventions that I know. And of wondering what all the people excited by this see that I don&#8217;t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The web used to be fun and simple and easy to get stuff done with. Now it&#8217;s discovering that someone who doesn&#8217;t know what they were doing used a <code>div<\/code> instead of a <code>button<\/code> and fixing it involves half a day of frustratedly poking around files that make no sense and fixing a broken build process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is any other software process better?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I truly believe this is a bad world. Marketing hype has taken over, burdening us with perpetual intellectual and technical debt. Giving the illusion of helping us while actually hindering us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m convinced that there MUST be a LOAD of JS\/web developers who are killing it. Who have sharpened their tools and knowledge to such an extent that this world is one of wonder and awe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I love learning new things. And am willing to do whatever is needed to get the job done. But I&#8217;m just not convinced that the things that the world says I &#8220;should&#8221; learn and use are the right things to learn and use. They may seem better for the short term &#8220;wow factor&#8221;. But they so quickly seem to become problematic, fragile, or obsolete. And yet the world keeps saying that they are the things I should learn and use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t get it. It makes no sense to me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m so tired.<\/p>\n",

Note that this is UK\/EU specific and excludes and proprietary stuff (e.g. Tesla-specific tech)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Units of power and battery sizes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You will see the following units of power\/energy\/battery capacity:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>kW (kiloWatt)<\/strong> &#8211; This is a measure of the <em>flow<\/em> of power. It is used to describe charging speeds (how fast energy gets into the battery) and motor\/engine power.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>kWh (kiloWattHour)<\/strong> &#8211; This is a measure of energy capacity and is used to describe how big your battery is. 1kWh is the energy used by a 1kW motor for 1 hour.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you have a car with a 100kW engine\/motor and a 50kWh battery you can (in theory) run it at full power for half an hour. Or at half power for a full hour. In practice there are other factors. Check the specs!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A 100kW car will have more power to it than an 80kW car. This usually means it accelerates and drives faster. But it may be less efficient and use up your battery faster.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A higher power charger will fill your battery faster. e.g. a 50kW charger will fill your battery faster than a 7kW charger.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A 7kW charger will fully charge a 35kW battery in _about_ 5 hours (likely to be more &#8211; check the specs)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How big should my battery be?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;range&#8221; of your car is determined by the battery capacity, car efficiency, driving efficiency, and other factors like the temperature. In general I would say:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Less than 30kWh<\/strong> batteries are only good for short urban driving.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>30kwH &#8211; 50kWh<\/strong> batteries are better for longer range, but this is very much dependent on efficiency of the engine and driving style.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>More than 50kWh<\/strong> batteries are needed if you are going to make longer journeys without stopping to charge up.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Charge speeds and modes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">AC vs DC charging<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AC<\/strong> (alternating current &#8211; a type of electricity flow) charging is slower and includes home-based charging both from 3-pin cables and home-installed charge points.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>DC<\/strong> charging (used in &#8220;rapid&#8221; or &#8220;super-fast&#8221; chargers) is much faster and only available at public charge points.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference is useful to know when you&#8217;re understanding charge ports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Charge speeds<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Common charge speeds you will see are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>3kW<\/strong> &#8211; Slow home charging and slow public chargers. Sometimes called &#8220;trickle charging&#8221;. AC charging using a 3-pin or type-2 cable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>7kW<\/strong> &#8211; Faster home charging from an installed charing point. Also slow public chargers. AC charging using a type-2 cable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>22kW<\/strong> &#8211; Medium-speed, AC public charging using a type-2 cable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>50kW<\/strong> &#8211; &#8220;fast&#8221;\/&#8221;rapid&#8221; charging. Usually DC using a CCS or CHAdeMO cable (depending on your car). I believe some AC chargers can get up to this kind of speed too.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>More than 50kW<\/strong> (75kW, 100Kw etc, up to 350 or 400kW) &#8211; you&#8217;ll only see these at public charge points. DC charging using CCS or CHAdeMO cables.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The speeds you can charge at are dependent on your car. I&#8217;d recommend looking for a car that has at least 50kW rapid charing using CCS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Charge ports<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Charge ports\/cables are fairly standard, but there are different types.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2\/3-pin<\/strong> &#8211; These cables are used for AC home charging (make sure your home wiring can cope!). They usually have a 2\/3-pin connector on one end and a type 2 connector to plug into the car.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Type 2<\/strong> (sometimes called &#8220;Mennekes&#8221;)- This is a round connector with 7 pins. Used for AC charging up to around 22kW.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CCS<\/strong> adds extra DC connectors to a Type 2 port to allow &#8220;rapid&#8221; charging at speeds above 22kW.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CHAdeMO<\/strong> &#8211; This is a Japanese standard for &#8220;rapid&#8221; charging. I only saw it on Nissan Leaf&#8217;s and it&#8217;s not available at all charging points.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You will most commonly see Type 2 ports on British\/EU cars as they are mandatory. It&#8217;s recommended to have a CCS port.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Range measurements\/guesstimates<\/h2>\n",

Note that this is UK\/EU specific and excludes and proprietary stuff (e.g. Tesla-specific tech)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Units of power and battery sizes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You will see the following units of power\/energy\/battery capacity:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>kW (kiloWatt)<\/strong> &#8211; This is a measure of the <em>flow<\/em> of power. It is used to describe charging speeds (how fast energy gets into the battery) and motor\/engine power.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>kWh (kiloWattHour)<\/strong> &#8211; This is a measure of energy capacity and is used to describe how big your battery is. 1kWh is the energy used by a 1kW motor for 1 hour.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you have a car with a 100kW engine\/motor and a 50kWh battery you can (in theory) run it at full power for half an hour. Or at half power for a full hour. In practice there are other factors. Check the specs!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A 100kW car will have more power to it than an 80kW car. This usually means it accelerates and drives faster. But it may be less efficient and use up your battery faster.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A higher power charger will fill your battery faster. e.g. a 50kW charger will fill your battery faster than a 7kW charger.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A 7kW charger will fully charge a 35kW battery in _about_ 5 hours (likely to be more &#8211; check the specs)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How big should my battery be?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;range&#8221; of your car is determined by the battery capacity, car efficiency, driving efficiency, and other factors like the temperature. In general I would say:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Less than 30kWh<\/strong> batteries are only good for short urban driving.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>30kwH &#8211; 50kWh<\/strong> batteries are better for longer range, but this is very much dependent on efficiency of the engine and driving style.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>More than 50kWh<\/strong> batteries are needed if you are going to make longer journeys without stopping to charge up.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Charge speeds and modes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">AC vs DC charging<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AC<\/strong> (alternating current &#8211; a type of electricity flow) charging is slower and includes home-based charging both from 3-pin cables and home-installed charge points.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>DC<\/strong> charging (used in &#8220;rapid&#8221; or &#8220;super-fast&#8221; chargers) is much faster and only available at public charge points.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference is useful to know when you&#8217;re understanding charge ports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Charge speeds<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Common charge speeds you will see are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>3kW<\/strong> &#8211; Slow home charging and slow public chargers. Sometimes called &#8220;trickle charging&#8221;. AC charging using a 3-pin or type-2 cable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>7kW<\/strong> &#8211; Faster home charging from an installed charing point. Also slow public chargers. AC charging using a type-2 cable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>22kW<\/strong> &#8211; Medium-speed, AC public charging using a type-2 cable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>50kW<\/strong> &#8211; &#8220;fast&#8221;\/&#8221;rapid&#8221; charging. Usually DC using a CCS or CHAdeMO cable (depending on your car). I believe some AC chargers can get up to this kind of speed too.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>More than 50kW<\/strong> (75kW, 100Kw etc, up to 350 or 400kW) &#8211; you&#8217;ll only see these at public charge points. DC charging using CCS or CHAdeMO cables.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The speeds you can charge at are dependent on your car. I&#8217;d recommend looking for a car that has at least 50kW rapid charing using CCS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Charge ports<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Charge ports\/cables are fairly standard, but there are different types.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2\/3-pin<\/strong> &#8211; These cables are used for AC home charging (make sure your home wiring can cope!). They usually have a 2\/3-pin connector on one end and a type 2 connector to plug into the car.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Type 2<\/strong> (sometimes called &#8220;Mennekes&#8221;)- This is a round connector with 7 pins. Used for AC charging up to around 22kW.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CCS<\/strong> adds extra DC connectors to a Type 2 port to allow &#8220;rapid&#8221; charging at speeds above 22kW.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CHAdeMO<\/strong> &#8211; This is a Japanese standard for &#8220;rapid&#8221; charging. I only saw it on Nissan Leaf&#8217;s and it&#8217;s not available at all charging points.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You will most commonly see Type 2 ports on British\/EU cars as they are mandatory. It&#8217;s recommended to have a CCS port.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Range measurements\/guesstimates<\/h2>\n",

What do I think of it? And what does it mean for my own &#8220;command palette&#8221; product, <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a>?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Short Story<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>I will continue to sell Turbo Admin, but I want you to buy it knowing that parts or all of it could become obsolete in the future. Possibly quite soon!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I won&#8217;t offer discounts at this point. Mostly because Turbo Admin is (in my opinion) ridiculously good value anyway!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>While there is talk of a new admin design, and I&#8217;m sure it will be re-done in React JS, I don&#8217;t see the current admin being phased out any time soon. So Turbo Admin will continue to make the admin more useful.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I will continue to work on Turbo Admin and add new things to it. It&#8217;s a passion project, it has a small community of dedicated users who love it, and I&#8217;m not abandoning it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s changing in core?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two things are changing in WordPress core that might affect Turbo Admin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. A command centre is being added. Probably.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is building what they call a &#8220;command center&#8221; in WordPress. It&#8217;s currently:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>experimental<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>available in <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/gutenberg\/\">the Gutenberg plugin<\/a> (read the testing post linked below for instructions)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>only currently available in the site editor screen<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/core\/2023\/05\/17\/command-center-request-for-feedback\/\">open for testing and feedback<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. A design refresh is coming. Maybe. Sometime.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some <a href=\"https:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/design\/2022\/06\/13\/thinking-through-the-wordpress-admin-experience\/\">early discussions about a design refresh<\/a> for the WordPress Dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given all the use of React components and libraries inside WordPress, I guess I knew this was coming. And a design refresh is long overdue. And much as I hate the idea of it being Reactified, I know that WordPress needs to move on and this is probably the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How will these things affect Turbo Admin?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Adding a command centre will clearly affect Turbo Admin as it will mean that the main function of Turbo Admin is now in WordPress core.<br><br>I&#8217;m hoping that the core command center can be disabled so that if people prefer Turbo Admin they can still use it!<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Re-vamping the dashboard, however, could really affect Turbo Admin more broadly and prevent many of its <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/instructions.html\">features<\/a> from working.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do I feel about all of this?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the one hand, I built Turbo Admin because I wanted something like this in core. And now it&#8217;s coming to core. So &#8220;Yay&#8221;. But also, I&#8217;m sad that Turbo Admin may now have a limited life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230; I recently spent some time working with some code that modified some things in the dashboard and I was reminded how many hooks into it there are, and how deeply people integrate with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can&#8217;t imagine they can write a React-based dashboard that&#8217;s fully backwards compatible with all the things that currently integrate with the dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have to believe that there will, for quite a long time, be a &#8220;classic dashboard&#8221; option. And Turbo Admin will continue to offer a bunch of dashboard improvements as long as that exists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s coming next?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I got distracted by life for a while. But I&#8217;m still implementing some new things in Turbo Admin &#8211; list table navigation improvements, and I really want to bring back my prototyped &#8220;dashboard widget hiding&#8221; feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No promises on timelines, but there will be a new release and it will do new fun things!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/contact-me\/\">Drop me a line<\/a> if you have any questions or thoughts!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>The experimental &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/core\/2023\/05\/17\/command-center-request-for-feedback\/\">command center<\/a>&#8221; is coming to WordPress core. What do I think of it? And what does it mean for my own &#8220;command palette&#8221; product, <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a>?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Short Story<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>I will continue to sell Turbo Admin, but I want you to buy it knowing that parts or all of it could become obsolete in the future. Possibly quite soon!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I won&#8217;t offer discounts at this point. Mostly because Turbo Admin is (in my opinion) ridiculously good value anyway!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>While there is talk of a new admin design, and I&#8217;m sure it will be re-done in React JS, I don&#8217;t see the current admin being phased out any time soon. So Turbo Admin will continue to make the admin more useful.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I will continue to work on Turbo Admin and add new things to it. It&#8217;s a passion project, it has a small community of dedicated users who love it, and I&#8217;m not abandoning it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s changing in core?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two things are changing in WordPress core that might affect Turbo Admin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. A command centre is being added. Probably.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is building what they call a &#8220;command center&#8221; in WordPress. It&#8217;s currently:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>experimental<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>available in <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/gutenberg\/\">the Gutenberg plugin<\/a> (read the testing post linked below for instructions)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>only currently available in the site editor screen<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/core\/2023\/05\/17\/command-center-request-for-feedback\/\">open for testing and feedback<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. A design refresh is coming. Maybe. Sometime.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some <a href=\"https:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/design\/2022\/06\/13\/thinking-through-the-wordpress-admin-experience\/\">early discussions about a design refresh<\/a> for the WordPress Dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given all the use of React components and libraries inside WordPress, I guess I knew this was coming. And a design refresh is long overdue. And much as I hate the idea of it being Reactified, I know that WordPress needs to move on and this is probably the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How will these things affect Turbo Admin?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Adding a command centre will clearly affect Turbo Admin as it will mean that the main function of Turbo Admin is now in WordPress core.<br><br>I&#8217;m hoping that the core command center can be disabled so that if people prefer Turbo Admin they can still use it!<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Re-vamping the dashboard, however, could really affect Turbo Admin more broadly and prevent many of its <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/instructions.html\">features<\/a> from working.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do I feel about all of this?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the one hand, I built Turbo Admin because I wanted something like this in core. And now it&#8217;s coming to core. So &#8220;Yay&#8221;. But also, I&#8217;m sad that Turbo Admin may now have a limited life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230; I recently spent some time working with some code that modified some things in the dashboard and I was reminded how many hooks into it there are, and how deeply people integrate with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can&#8217;t imagine they can write a React-based dashboard that&#8217;s fully backwards compatible with all the things that currently integrate with the dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have to believe that there will, for quite a long time, be a &#8220;classic dashboard&#8221; option. And Turbo Admin will continue to offer a bunch of dashboard improvements as long as that exists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s coming next?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I got distracted by life for a while. But I&#8217;m still implementing some new things in Turbo Admin &#8211; list table navigation improvements, and I really want to bring back my prototyped &#8220;dashboard widget hiding&#8221; feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No promises on timelines, but there will be a new release and it will do new fun things!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/contact-me\/\">Drop me a line<\/a> if you have any questions or thoughts!<\/p>\n",

Again, this is great news because it benefits <em>everyone<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I hate to say &#8220;I told you so&#8221;! \ud83d\ude09<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But you know what? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to take this as huge validation for my work \u2013 turns out I was way ahead of the curve in some of this stuff!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it does present a dilemma: what to do with Turbo Admin!?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How long will it be until these new things exist?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will there still be a need for it after an admin redesign?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should I just open source it now and call it a day?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, I use Turbo Admin daily and would now find the WordPress dashboard pretty confusing without it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It strikes me that so many plugins integrate deeply with the WordPress dashboard that making a new admin that doesn&#8217;t break everything will be a huge task. Especially when the main focus of Phase 3 is collaboration. The redesign seems like a side-quest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this won&#8217;t happen quickly. And my intention is to keep making Turbo Admin better &#8211; for me if not for everyone else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are questions, and I&#8217;ll be figuring these things out in the coming months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With thanks to all who love and support <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a>. It&#8217;s only $35 so it&#8217;s STILL good value if you want some of Gutenberg&#8217;s Phase 3 features in all your WordPress dashboards today!!<\/p>\n",

It just works! (Some of the time).<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been trying really hard not to do this because literally everyone else has. But this is a post about &#8220;AI&#8221; generated content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start with, I&#8217;m skeptical about all the AI hype, which is why I&#8217;m reluctant to use it and post about it. More on this another time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230; Caleb Porzio &#8211; maker of my beloved <a href=\"https:\/\/alpinejs.dev\/\">Alpine.js<\/a> and Wizard number 2 in my personal Laravel community rankings &#8211; posted this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83e\ude84 What if you could write code that doesn&#39;t exist yet and it just&#8230; worked? <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/zfF4cEdRXs\">pic.twitter.com\/zfF4cEdRXs<\/a><\/p>&mdash; Caleb Porzio (@calebporzio) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/calebporzio\/status\/1632766792211877890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 6, 2023<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to watch the video (or if Twitter has, in the meantime, died) Caleb makes a Laravel &#8220;Ai&#8221; helper class that lets him write things like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\necho Ai::beforeFirstDot('caleb.porzio');\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>and it generates the function from the name, stores the function in a file so that it doesn&#8217;t have to be regenerated in future, and runs it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caleb himself notes that &#8220;this is just a random toy I made for fun.&#8221; &#8211; and I get that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for some reason it lodged itself in my brain. And when I finally decided that I wanted to play with the OpenAI API myself, I had the idea: &#8220;What if we did this in WordPress?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A WordPress AI function generator!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A few hours hacking later, and this exists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can type:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nWPAI::add_is_awesome_to_all_these_strings(\n  strings: &#x5B;'WordPress', 'Ross', 'AI']\n);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>and the AI will create me the function and run it:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&#x5B;\n  &quot;WordPress is awesome&quot;,\n  &quot;Ross is awesome&quot;,\n  &quot;AI is awesome&quot;\n]\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>It made this function and added it to a file in a mu-plugin:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction add_is_awesome_to_all_these_strings ( array $strings ) {\n\tforeach ( $strings as &amp;$string ) {\n\t\t$string .= ' is awesome';\n\t}\n\treturn $strings;\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not how I&#8217;d have written that function, but it works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It knows about WordPress. You can write:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nWPAI::get_an_array_of_all_post_types();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And it will return something like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&#x5B;\n  'post' =&gt; &quot;post&quot;,\n  'page' =&gt; &quot;page&quot;,\n  'attachment' =&gt; &quot;attachment&quot;\n]\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Because it created:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction get_an_array_of_all_post_types (  ) {\n\t$post_types = get_post_types(\n      array( 'public' =&gt; true ),\n      'names'\n    );\n\treturn $post_types;\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I mean&#8230; this is pretty impressive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can write WP queries too. I wrote a special generator for that. You can type:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nWPAI::query(\n  '3 latest posts from the news post type that\n   have the metadata test=true and that do not\n   have a meta key called &quot;ignore&quot;'\n);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>and it will run:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nget_posts(&#x5B;\n\t'post_type'=&gt;'news',\n\t'posts_per_page'=&gt;3,\n\t'meta_query'=&gt;&#x5B;\n\t\t&#x5B;\n\t\t\t'key'=&gt;'test',\n\t\t\t'value'=&gt;'true',\n\t\t\t'compare'=&gt;'='\n\t\t],\n\t\t&#x5B;\n\t\t\t'key'=&gt;'ignore',\n\t\t\t'compare'=&gt;'NOT EXISTS'\n\t\t]\n\t]\n]);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>So you can kind-of sorta build a website just by writing what you want. Like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nWPAI::register_recipe_post_type();\nWPAI::register_recipe_type_taxonomy_for_recipe_type();\nWPAI::register_acf_repeater_field_for_ingredients_for_recipe_type();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Does this work? Absolutely it does! With a few glitches here and there (that I think I can fix). Here&#8217;s the three minutes of me building this code:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"WPAI Post Types\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/809333286?h=0cb83f35b7&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Big Buts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This really, totally does work. <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/wpai\">Here&#8217;s the code<\/a>. About 200 lines of PHP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(It&#8217;s currently pretty rough, my &#8220;prompt engineering&#8221; is probably not very good, and it needs a README to tell you how to use it. But that&#8217;s it.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DON&#8217;T DO THIS!!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; I hear you cry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DON&#8217;T DO THIS!!! THIS IS REALLY DANGEROUS AND STUPID!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You run this code ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I take no responsibility for you website being broken beyond repair; your laptop or server being wiped of all files; or ANYTHING that might happen as a result of you using this code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This code tells an AI of dubious trustworthiness to generate more code and then runs the more code on your computer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should not do this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you DO do it, do it on a temporary VPS, or a walled-off temporary site, or an <a href=\"https:\/\/app.instawp.io\/register?ref=pRVI2c79Ne\">instawp.com site<\/a> or something. And you do that &#8211; and I can&#8217;t say this strongly enough &#8211; entirely at your own risk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Some thoughts on all this<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This seems very cool. But it is a fun toy or experiment. Nothing more. Don&#8217;t use this in production.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will we write code like this one day? Maybe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not convinced the AIs are coming for us yet. These are fun toys to play with the large language models and cool tech. People will use them. And they seem helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are at the early stages of having these things around. I suspect they have the power to transform how we do certain kinds of work. They will inevitably impact society &#8211; in my opinion. But we don&#8217;t understand them well enough yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me&#8230; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve now tinkered with generative code AI APIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I find myself in the position of thinking: \u201cI\u2019m not entirely happy with this technology existing, but I\u2019ve played with it, and it\u2019s really fun!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the scary thing is: this is where most people started with crypto and NFT\u2019s. And I didn&#8217;t like where that went AT ALL.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will wait and see.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>WOW! <em>I made a properly &#8220;magic method&#8221; WordPress plugin that allows you to just write a function name, and have that function created for you by an AI. It just works! (Some of the time).<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been trying really hard not to do this because literally everyone else has. But this is a post about &#8220;AI&#8221; generated content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start with, I&#8217;m skeptical about all the AI hype, which is why I&#8217;m reluctant to use it and post about it. More on this another time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230; Caleb Porzio &#8211; maker of my beloved <a href=\"https:\/\/alpinejs.dev\/\">Alpine.js<\/a> and Wizard number 2 in my personal Laravel community rankings &#8211; posted this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83e\ude84 What if you could write code that doesn&#39;t exist yet and it just&#8230; worked? <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/zfF4cEdRXs\">pic.twitter.com\/zfF4cEdRXs<\/a><\/p>&mdash; Caleb Porzio (@calebporzio) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/calebporzio\/status\/1632766792211877890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 6, 2023<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to watch the video (or if Twitter has, in the meantime, died) Caleb makes a Laravel &#8220;Ai&#8221; helper class that lets him write things like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\necho Ai::beforeFirstDot('caleb.porzio');\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>and it generates the function from the name, stores the function in a file so that it doesn&#8217;t have to be regenerated in future, and runs it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caleb himself notes that &#8220;this is just a random toy I made for fun.&#8221; &#8211; and I get that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for some reason it lodged itself in my brain. And when I finally decided that I wanted to play with the OpenAI API myself, I had the idea: &#8220;What if we did this in WordPress?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A WordPress AI function generator!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A few hours hacking later, and this exists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can type:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nWPAI::add_is_awesome_to_all_these_strings(\n  strings: &#x5B;'WordPress', 'Ross', 'AI']\n);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>and the AI will create me the function and run it:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&#x5B;\n  &quot;WordPress is awesome&quot;,\n  &quot;Ross is awesome&quot;,\n  &quot;AI is awesome&quot;\n]\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>It made this function and added it to a file in a mu-plugin:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction add_is_awesome_to_all_these_strings ( array $strings ) {\n\tforeach ( $strings as &amp;$string ) {\n\t\t$string .= ' is awesome';\n\t}\n\treturn $strings;\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not how I&#8217;d have written that function, but it works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It knows about WordPress. You can write:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nWPAI::get_an_array_of_all_post_types();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>And it will return something like:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\n&#x5B;\n  'post' =&gt; &quot;post&quot;,\n  'page' =&gt; &quot;page&quot;,\n  'attachment' =&gt; &quot;attachment&quot;\n]\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Because it created:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nfunction get_an_array_of_all_post_types (  ) {\n\t$post_types = get_post_types(\n      array( 'public' =&gt; true ),\n      'names'\n    );\n\treturn $post_types;\n}\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>I mean&#8230; this is pretty impressive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can write WP queries too. I wrote a special generator for that. You can type:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nWPAI::query(\n  '3 latest posts from the news post type that\n   have the metadata test=true and that do not\n   have a meta key called &quot;ignore&quot;'\n);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>and it will run:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nget_posts(&#x5B;\n\t'post_type'=&gt;'news',\n\t'posts_per_page'=&gt;3,\n\t'meta_query'=&gt;&#x5B;\n\t\t&#x5B;\n\t\t\t'key'=&gt;'test',\n\t\t\t'value'=&gt;'true',\n\t\t\t'compare'=&gt;'='\n\t\t],\n\t\t&#x5B;\n\t\t\t'key'=&gt;'ignore',\n\t\t\t'compare'=&gt;'NOT EXISTS'\n\t\t]\n\t]\n]);\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>So you can kind-of sorta build a website just by writing what you want. Like this:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\nWPAI::register_recipe_post_type();\nWPAI::register_recipe_type_taxonomy_for_recipe_type();\nWPAI::register_acf_repeater_field_for_ingredients_for_recipe_type();\n<\/pre><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Does this work? Absolutely it does! With a few glitches here and there (that I think I can fix). Here&#8217;s the three minutes of me building this code:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"WPAI Post Types\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/809333286?h=0cb83f35b7&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Big Buts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This really, totally does work. <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/wpai\">Here&#8217;s the code<\/a>. About 200 lines of PHP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(It&#8217;s currently pretty rough, my &#8220;prompt engineering&#8221; is probably not very good, and it needs a README to tell you how to use it. But that&#8217;s it.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DON&#8217;T DO THIS!!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; I hear you cry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DON&#8217;T DO THIS!!! THIS IS REALLY DANGEROUS AND STUPID!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You run this code ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I take no responsibility for you website being broken beyond repair; your laptop or server being wiped of all files; or ANYTHING that might happen as a result of you using this code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This code tells an AI of dubious trustworthiness to generate more code and then runs the more code on your computer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should not do this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you DO do it, do it on a temporary VPS, or a walled-off temporary site, or an <a href=\"https:\/\/app.instawp.io\/register?ref=pRVI2c79Ne\">instawp.com site<\/a> or something. And you do that &#8211; and I can&#8217;t say this strongly enough &#8211; entirely at your own risk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Some thoughts on all this<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This seems very cool. But it is a fun toy or experiment. Nothing more. Don&#8217;t use this in production.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will we write code like this one day? Maybe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not convinced the AIs are coming for us yet. These are fun toys to play with the large language models and cool tech. People will use them. And they seem helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are at the early stages of having these things around. I suspect they have the power to transform how we do certain kinds of work. They will inevitably impact society &#8211; in my opinion. But we don&#8217;t understand them well enough yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me&#8230; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve now tinkered with generative code AI APIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I find myself in the position of thinking: \u201cI\u2019m not entirely happy with this technology existing, but I\u2019ve played with it, and it\u2019s really fun!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the scary thing is: this is where most people started with crypto and NFT\u2019s. And I didn&#8217;t like where that went AT ALL.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will wait and see.<\/p>\n",

I made it to 10!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s that\u2026 50 minutes of video. Not bad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, let&#8217;s talk about something that you may, or may not, have noticed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m on a Mac. And if you familiar with Mac&#8217;s you may be asking: &#8220;Where is the dock?&#8221; and &#8220;How is he switching apps without anything showing on the screen?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you aren&#8217;t. And that&#8217;s OK too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do try to use the keyboard as much as possible. Otherwise, the constant reaching for the mouse takes its toll on my arms and wrists. Plus, I find that with a little learning you can be a lot more efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>I hide the dock.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I could then Cmd-Tab to switch apps. That&#8217;s still possible.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>But I learned about &#8220;Hyper Keys&#8221; once. A hyper key is where you map an unused key &#8211; normally caps-lock to some unused modifier key combination &#8211; usually Cmd-Alt-Ctrl-Shift. And then you can &#8220;Hyper-&lt;something>&#8221; and build up a set of new shortcuts. This was cool for a while.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Then I got a StreamDeck and used that to switch apps. That was fun.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>THEN, I found a cheap, simple app called rcmd.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>rcmd kinda maps your right Cmd key to a sort-of hyper key<br>and then allows you to use it for switching applications. rcmd has a simple interface, and tries to work automatically. I&#8217;ve set it for things like<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>rcmd-V opens VS Code<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>rcmd-P opens PHPStorm<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>rcmd-A opens Arc &#8211; a web browser<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>rcmd-C opens Chrome<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>rcmd-I opens iTerm &#8211; my terminal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, after a bit of learning, I can switch around quickly and easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See? I LOVE this way of working!<\/p>\n",

And if you familiar with Mac&#8217;s you may be asking: &#8220;Where is the dock?&#8221; and &#8220;How is he switching apps without anything showing on the screen?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you aren&#8217;t. And that&#8217;s OK too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do try to use the keyboard as much as possible. Otherwise, the constant reaching for the mouse takes its toll on my arms and wrists. Plus, I find that with a little learning you can be a lot more efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>I hide the dock.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I could then Cmd-Tab to switch apps. That&#8217;s still possible.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>But I learned about &#8220;Hyper Keys&#8221; once. A hyper key is where you map an unused key &#8211; normally caps-lock to some unused modifier key combination &#8211; usually Cmd-Alt-Ctrl-Shift. And then you can &#8220;Hyper-&lt;something>&#8221; and build up a set of new shortcuts. This was cool for a while.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Then I got a StreamDeck and used that to switch apps. That was fun.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>THEN, I found a cheap, simple app called rcmd.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>rcmd kinda maps your right Cmd key to a sort-of hyper key<br>and then allows you to use it for switching applications. rcmd has a simple interface, and tries to work automatically. I&#8217;ve set it for things like<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>rcmd-V opens VS Code<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>rcmd-P opens PHPStorm<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>rcmd-A opens Arc &#8211; a web browser<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>rcmd-C opens Chrome<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>rcmd-I opens iTerm &#8211; my terminal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, after a bit of learning, I can switch around quickly and easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See? I LOVE this way of working!<\/p>\n",
