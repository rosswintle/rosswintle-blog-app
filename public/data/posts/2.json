It&#8217;s now Friday and last weekend seems a long time ago.<\/p>\n<p>The doctors can&#8217;t get me an apppointment until the 14th (it was about 2 weeks away when I booked it), so I popped into the NHS drop-in clinic today and the nurse there didn&#8217;t have much to say.<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s very much wait and see at the moment.  I&#8217;m VERY grateful to my boss for the time off and the rest.  But I feel like a bit of a fraud now.  It was all very real on Saturday but now I wonder if there was some overreaction.  Certainly at the time it was very scary being so out of control of my emotions, and I was just physically and mentally and emotionally exhausted in a way I&#8217;ve not been before.  I guess we can only wait and see.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned some things in the meantime, which I&#8217;ll try to write up at some point but for now, I&#8217;m doing OK.<\/p>\n",

A good ride but my knees hurt a bit &#8211; probably beacause I&#8217;ve not been doing my stretches while I&#8217;ve not been cycling to work &#8211; must keep that up even when I&#8217;m not doing a daily ride.<\/p>\n<p>The stretches are mostly for my &#8220;Glutes&#8221; (mostly my gluteus medius) but also for a thing called the IT band (nothing to do with computers) that runs from the bum down the side of the leg.   Forgive my amateur physiology. The glutes pull the band to stop your legs collapsing underneath you.  If the glutes or the band are tight it seems to rub against the knee causing a dull pain.<\/p>\n<p>It also makes me flat footed (called over-pronation).  Just another of my ongoing health things that I keep at bay by doing certain things.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that there are all sorts of other mechanics going on, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the saddle high enough = are my legs bending too much?<\/li>\n<li>Have I got the right balance of cadence (rate of pedalling) and pressure?<\/li>\n<li>Are my feet in the right place on the pedals?  If the feet are twisted that can put additional strain on the knees.<\/li>\n<li>Am I pushing with the right part of the foot?  I think you need to try to spread load across the foot.  As I&#8217;m flat footed I tend to push with the ball of my foot so I need to make a conscious effort to put some pressure on the outside of my foot.  This also balances the quadriceps in the legs &#8211; you use the inner quads to push with the ball of your foot and the outer quads to push with the outside.<\/li>\n<li>Am I pushing with both legs?  The pain is usually in my right leg.  Of course, I&#8217;m right footed so I lead and do more pedalling with my right leg.  I need to balance that too.<\/li>\n<li>Are my knees in the right place? I&#8217;ve read that, ideally, the knee should sit directly above the foot and press straight downwards, rather than having your knees sticking out or squeezing in towards the bike.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As I say, all stuff I&#8217;ve read but it all makes sense and seems to work &#8211; if I do the stretches and try to balance everything and pedal right I can ride strong for ages.<\/p>\n<p>And you thought cycling was simple!?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Went out for a ride by myself this afternoon. Managed 21.24 miles in 1:24:31, averaging 15.0 mph overall.  A good ride but my knees hurt a bit &#8211; probably beacause I&#8217;ve not been doing my stretches while I&#8217;ve not been cycling to work &#8211; must keep that up even when I&#8217;m not doing a daily ride.<\/p>\n<p>The stretches are mostly for my &#8220;Glutes&#8221; (mostly my gluteus medius) but also for a thing called the IT band (nothing to do with computers) that runs from the bum down the side of the leg.   Forgive my amateur physiology. The glutes pull the band to stop your legs collapsing underneath you.  If the glutes or the band are tight it seems to rub against the knee causing a dull pain.<\/p>\n<p>It also makes me flat footed (called over-pronation).  Just another of my ongoing health things that I keep at bay by doing certain things.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that there are all sorts of other mechanics going on, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the saddle high enough = are my legs bending too much?<\/li>\n<li>Have I got the right balance of cadence (rate of pedalling) and pressure?<\/li>\n<li>Are my feet in the right place on the pedals?  If the feet are twisted that can put additional strain on the knees.<\/li>\n<li>Am I pushing with the right part of the foot?  I think you need to try to spread load across the foot.  As I&#8217;m flat footed I tend to push with the ball of my foot so I need to make a conscious effort to put some pressure on the outside of my foot.  This also balances the quadriceps in the legs &#8211; you use the inner quads to push with the ball of your foot and the outer quads to push with the outside.<\/li>\n<li>Am I pushing with both legs?  The pain is usually in my right leg.  Of course, I&#8217;m right footed so I lead and do more pedalling with my right leg.  I need to balance that too.<\/li>\n<li>Are my knees in the right place? I&#8217;ve read that, ideally, the knee should sit directly above the foot and press straight downwards, rather than having your knees sticking out or squeezing in towards the bike.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As I say, all stuff I&#8217;ve read but it all makes sense and seems to work &#8211; if I do the stretches and try to balance everything and pedal right I can ride strong for ages.<\/p>\n<p>And you thought cycling was simple!?<\/p>\n",

Then I noticed that if I ate lunch early, BEFORE I played, I was OK.  So I took to doing that.  I also discovered flapjack then&#8230;if I didn&#8217;t have time to eat lunch before a I went out to play a big slab of oats always did the trick.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Upping the workload<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Then I moved to Swindon and started cycling to work.  Only 4 miles each way but boy, I was hungry as a horse all day!  I started munching cereal bars, which I guess are glorified flapjacks with lots of additives.  They really fill a whole though and don&#8217;t seem to be that unhealthy or&#8230;like some &#8220;energy foods&#8221;&#8230;all that disgusting.  I also have a big bowl of oaty cereal before I go out.  Porridge, frankly, sucks!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Long rides and recovery<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I also notice that after a long ride I really need something to recover.  My body craves various things at that point but basically I just cram as much sugar and water in as I can.  Apple Lucozade is particularly yummy and not too sweet.  Apparently you need to get a mix of carbs, fat and protein.  But hey, I&#8217;m still learning.<\/p>\n<p>Key facts seem to be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>eat little and often<\/li>\n<li>keep carbs up<\/li>\n<li>take good food (oats, bananas, etc) when you&#8217;re out exercising<\/li>\n<li>have regular intake of water<\/li>\n<li>make sure you eat well to recover too<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In this case, you really are what you eat and if you start feeling really hungry because you&#8217;re exercising more do take some advice on it.  Just cramming more won&#8217;t necessarily help.<\/p>\n",

Then I noticed that if I ate lunch early, BEFORE I played, I was OK.  So I took to doing that.  I also discovered flapjack then&#8230;if I didn&#8217;t have time to eat lunch before a I went out to play a big slab of oats always did the trick.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Upping the workload<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Then I moved to Swindon and started cycling to work.  Only 4 miles each way but boy, I was hungry as a horse all day!  I started munching cereal bars, which I guess are glorified flapjacks with lots of additives.  They really fill a whole though and don&#8217;t seem to be that unhealthy or&#8230;like some &#8220;energy foods&#8221;&#8230;all that disgusting.  I also have a big bowl of oaty cereal before I go out.  Porridge, frankly, sucks!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Long rides and recovery<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I also notice that after a long ride I really need something to recover.  My body craves various things at that point but basically I just cram as much sugar and water in as I can.  Apple Lucozade is particularly yummy and not too sweet.  Apparently you need to get a mix of carbs, fat and protein.  But hey, I&#8217;m still learning.<\/p>\n<p>Key facts seem to be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>eat little and often<\/li>\n<li>keep carbs up<\/li>\n<li>take good food (oats, bananas, etc) when you&#8217;re out exercising<\/li>\n<li>have regular intake of water<\/li>\n<li>make sure you eat well to recover too<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In this case, you really are what you eat and if you start feeling really hungry because you&#8217;re exercising more do take some advice on it.  Just cramming more won&#8217;t necessarily help.<\/p>\n",
