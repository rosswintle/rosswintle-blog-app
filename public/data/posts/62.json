Well, not locks, but little sliding latches.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Easy&#8221;, I thought.  Jusy buy &#8217;em, from B&amp;Q, fix one bit to the door and another bit to the frame and Bob&#8217;s your uncle!<\/p>\n<p>Not so!  Did you know that there are two types of simple sliding latch?  I didn&#8217;t!<\/p>\n<p>The first one went on fine.  More fluke than anything.<\/p>\n<p>I got the first bit of the second one on and then suddenly realised that it was not going to work.  I had to go and buy another latch of a slightly different type!<\/p>\n<p>A quick explanation.  It all depends on which side of the door you&#8217;re on.  From one side a door closes agains the frame.  I&#8217;ll call this the &#8220;outside&#8221; of the door.  When the door is closed it sits behind a chunk of wood.  In this case you can use a latch which slides into a hole in the frame.  Like this&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-apzUKeIVI\/AAAAAAAAB4o\/fjxGqWpRaw4\/s1600-h\/IMG_0421.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-apzUKeIVI\/AAAAAAAAB4o\/fjxGqWpRaw4\/s400\/IMG_0421.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>If you&#8217;re on the &#8220;inside&#8221; of the door, the door is flush with the frame &#8211; so you don&#8217;t have the chunk of wood to drill a big hole into.  So you have to have a raised &#8220;hole&#8221; for the latch to fit into.  Like this&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-arYUKeIWI\/AAAAAAAAB4w\/0limCbj1p2k\/s1600-h\/IMG_0417.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-arYUKeIWI\/AAAAAAAAB4w\/0limCbj1p2k\/s400\/IMG_0417.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>It WELL confused me for a while.  It all makes perfect sense now but why didn&#8217;t we think of it before?  How am I supposed to know that there&#8217;s two different sorts of latch.<\/p>\n<p>I believe this is what people call &#8220;trial and error&#8221;.  I sense there may be more of this ahead!<\/p>\n",

Well, not locks, but little sliding latches.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Easy&#8221;, I thought.  Jusy buy &#8217;em, from B&amp;Q, fix one bit to the door and another bit to the frame and Bob&#8217;s your uncle!<\/p>\n<p>Not so!  Did you know that there are two types of simple sliding latch?  I didn&#8217;t!<\/p>\n<p>The first one went on fine.  More fluke than anything.<\/p>\n<p>I got the first bit of the second one on and then suddenly realised that it was not going to work.  I had to go and buy another latch of a slightly different type!<\/p>\n<p>A quick explanation.  It all depends on which side of the door you&#8217;re on.  From one side a door closes agains the frame.  I&#8217;ll call this the &#8220;outside&#8221; of the door.  When the door is closed it sits behind a chunk of wood.  In this case you can use a latch which slides into a hole in the frame.  Like this&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-apzUKeIVI\/AAAAAAAAB4o\/fjxGqWpRaw4\/s1600-h\/IMG_0421.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-apzUKeIVI\/AAAAAAAAB4o\/fjxGqWpRaw4\/s400\/IMG_0421.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>If you&#8217;re on the &#8220;inside&#8221; of the door, the door is flush with the frame &#8211; so you don&#8217;t have the chunk of wood to drill a big hole into.  So you have to have a raised &#8220;hole&#8221; for the latch to fit into.  Like this&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-arYUKeIWI\/AAAAAAAAB4w\/0limCbj1p2k\/s1600-h\/IMG_0417.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/R-arYUKeIWI\/AAAAAAAAB4w\/0limCbj1p2k\/s400\/IMG_0417.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>It WELL confused me for a while.  It all makes perfect sense now but why didn&#8217;t we think of it before?  How am I supposed to know that there&#8217;s two different sorts of latch.<\/p>\n<p>I believe this is what people call &#8220;trial and error&#8221;.  I sense there may be more of this ahead!<\/p>\n",

And here&#8217;s another &#8211; Counting Crows&#8217; &#8220;Mr Jones&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I discovered Counting Crows a bit later than my contemporaries.  Their debut was, I believe, released in the 90&#8217;s but I only found them through Sally&#8217;s record collection a couple of years back.  And they&#8217;re awesome!<\/p>\n<p>A friend of mine who is a very good musician, and who&#8217;s musical opinion I very much respect, has Counting Crows&#8217; &#8220;August and Everything After&#8221; album on his list of top albums of the 90&#8217;s, and I really do agree &#8211; it&#8217;s an album I&#8217;ve listened to again and again and again and never grown bored of.  In fact, I keep finding more and more intricacies to keep me interested.  For example, the song &#8220;Anna Begins&#8221; was usually skipped over at first, but it&#8217;s a true gem that I choose to listen to now.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway &#8211; Mr Jones is a great song.  A poem set to music.  It&#8217;s rousing, thoughtful, interesting, and dynamic.  But it&#8217;s a complicated one.  I HAVE already learned all the words.  I will probably not be able to get them in the right order.  I know that the music contains d-minor&#8217;s &#8211; my least favourite chord.  But it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to learn.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m falling a bit behind again.  This is week 10, so I&#8217;ve skipped 3 songs.  But never mind.  So I really only have until Tuesday to learn this!  Eeek!<\/p>\n",

And here&#8217;s another &#8211; Counting Crows&#8217; &#8220;Mr Jones&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I discovered Counting Crows a bit later than my contemporaries.  Their debut was, I believe, released in the 90&#8217;s but I only found them through Sally&#8217;s record collection a couple of years back.  And they&#8217;re awesome!<\/p>\n<p>A friend of mine who is a very good musician, and who&#8217;s musical opinion I very much respect, has Counting Crows&#8217; &#8220;August and Everything After&#8221; album on his list of top albums of the 90&#8217;s, and I really do agree &#8211; it&#8217;s an album I&#8217;ve listened to again and again and again and never grown bored of.  In fact, I keep finding more and more intricacies to keep me interested.  For example, the song &#8220;Anna Begins&#8221; was usually skipped over at first, but it&#8217;s a true gem that I choose to listen to now.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway &#8211; Mr Jones is a great song.  A poem set to music.  It&#8217;s rousing, thoughtful, interesting, and dynamic.  But it&#8217;s a complicated one.  I HAVE already learned all the words.  I will probably not be able to get them in the right order.  I know that the music contains d-minor&#8217;s &#8211; my least favourite chord.  But it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to learn.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m falling a bit behind again.  This is week 10, so I&#8217;ve skipped 3 songs.  But never mind.  So I really only have until Tuesday to learn this!  Eeek!<\/p>\n",

It has very little going for it.  It contains no more than three guitar chords.  The words are&#8230;well, they make sense but why you&#8217;d write it I don&#8217;t know.  And it&#8217;s just cheesy jangly guitar pop.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, I&#8217;m sure many many people know it, so it&#8217;s on my list.  Its also ridiculously easy to play, I already know the words, and it&#8217;s another one that I&#8217;ve tried to learn before, so it&#8217;s just a case of cementing the chords in my head.

Creeping buttercup apparently.  The queen of weeds in the Wintle garden.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Our Garden<\/span><\/p>\n<p>One big reason for buying the house that we bought was the c. 100ft garden.  For a nearly-town house this is HUGE!  And it&#8217;s nicely split with some lawn, some patio and a vegetable patch.<\/p>\n<p>There are numerous reasons why we think a veg patch is great:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It&#8217;s OH SO ENGLISH!<\/li>\n<li>We believe in buying locally<\/li>\n<li>We&#8217;re trying to be sustainable (might not achieve that this year but hope to in future years!)<\/li>\n<li>We hate supermarket food packaging<\/li>\n<li>Gardening is fun, and a good team-building opportunity<\/li>\n<li>It will help us keep fit<\/li>\n<li>Food will taste better<\/li>\n<li>Eating vegetables will be SO much more satisfying knowing that we&#8217;ve grown them ourselves.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Oh and we&#8217;ve already decided that there&#8217;s no point resisting the fact that we&#8217;re turning into our parents so there&#8217;s not real excuse NOT to get into gardening.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Preparing the Soil<\/p>\n<p><\/span>Now, we bought the house in October and it took us a while to move and unpack and settle, so we&#8217;ve only really just seriously started thinking about the garden and from what we gather, all the weed killing processes (mulching, rotavating, poisoning and so on) start in the autumn and progress over the winter.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Failed Cardboard Mulching and so on&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We DID originally try laying lots of cardboard over the patch.  This would remove the light and air and kill the plants and they would then rot into the ground!  But this has only been a little bit successful.  We didn&#8217;t really have enough cardboard and it kept blowing away &#8211; you need LOTS of BIG boxes and heavy things to hold them down &#8211; fabric pegs are not strong enough.

Creeping buttercup apparently.  The queen of weeds in the Wintle garden.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Our Garden<\/span><\/p>\n<p>One big reason for buying the house that we bought was the c. 100ft garden.  For a nearly-town house this is HUGE!  And it&#8217;s nicely split with some lawn, some patio and a vegetable patch.<\/p>\n<p>There are numerous reasons why we think a veg patch is great:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It&#8217;s OH SO ENGLISH!<\/li>\n<li>We believe in buying locally<\/li>\n<li>We&#8217;re trying to be sustainable (might not achieve that this year but hope to in future years!)<\/li>\n<li>We hate supermarket food packaging<\/li>\n<li>Gardening is fun, and a good team-building opportunity<\/li>\n<li>It will help us keep fit<\/li>\n<li>Food will taste better<\/li>\n<li>Eating vegetables will be SO much more satisfying knowing that we&#8217;ve grown them ourselves.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Oh and we&#8217;ve already decided that there&#8217;s no point resisting the fact that we&#8217;re turning into our parents so there&#8217;s not real excuse NOT to get into gardening.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Preparing the Soil<\/p>\n<p><\/span>Now, we bought the house in October and it took us a while to move and unpack and settle, so we&#8217;ve only really just seriously started thinking about the garden and from what we gather, all the weed killing processes (mulching, rotavating, poisoning and so on) start in the autumn and progress over the winter.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Failed Cardboard Mulching and so on&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We DID originally try laying lots of cardboard over the patch.  This would remove the light and air and kill the plants and they would then rot into the ground!  But this has only been a little bit successful.  We didn&#8217;t really have enough cardboard and it kept blowing away &#8211; you need LOTS of BIG boxes and heavy things to hold them down &#8211; fabric pegs are not strong enough.  This probably works if you have lots of old carpet or something but just cardboard boxes really didn&#8217;t do it<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">.<\/p>\n<p><\/span>The idea with rotavating is very similar &#8211; you chop everything up and over the winter it rots into the ground.  We didn&#8217;t do this.  It would probably have worked better.<\/p>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t try herbicides as we&#8217;re TRYING to be organic and not cover our nice veggies with nasty chemicals.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Digging<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And so we find ourselves in the spring with a garden full of weeds.  The only route&#8230;manual eradication!  Yes, down on our hands and knees pulling up us much as we can, roots and all.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s slow, back breaking work.  But it&#8217;s working.  We&#8217;re adding in some compost to our very-clay&#8217;y (?) soil and it&#8217;s actually looking like something might grow in it!  In fact, I&#8217;m quite encouraged by how much the weeds like the soil!<\/p>\n<p>And our veggies will taste all the better for it!<\/p>\n",

I hadn&#8217;t actually realised &#8211; communication on it has been quiet this year.<\/p>\n<p>However, as part of the week, a film called Black Gold was on the telly.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re all into sustainability and fair trade anyway, we understand that the trade that we do greatly affects the lives of people in the third world, we see the bigger picture of how we in the UK are very rich and yet we exploit the poor people in the developing world, and we&#8217;re compelled by our faith and our conscience to do something about it.  So we probably didn&#8217;t need to see this film.<\/p>\n<p>However, it was a good documentary!  Unlike things like &#8220;Super Size Me&#8221;, &#8220;Farenheit 9\/11&#8221; and &#8220;Bowling for Columbine&#8221;, there is no star of the show.  There is no man on a quest.  The filmmakers show only their interviewees and the subjects merely speak for themselves.  There is a central character &#8211; a man who runs a coffee co-operative.  But even he is really just a subject of the film.  I liked this.  I didn&#8217;t feel someone was desperately trying to prove a point.  There weren&#8217;y awkward questions; there were just truthful answers.<\/p>\n<p>The film outlined well the difficulties of growing coffee, selling it for a good price and making a living as a coffee farmer.  It showed that there are many middlemen in the selling process, who all take their cut of the money.  It demonstrated that the price of coffee is mostly decided by rich businessmen in America and the UK.<\/p>\n<p>And it showed how unfair the standard process of trade really is!<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s some of the figures that I recall.  Ethiopian coffee beans sold for 2 Ethiopian Birr per kilo &#8211; at the time of making the film this was 57 US cents.<\/p>\n<p>A kilo of beans makes 80 cups of coffee.  This equates to 0.71 US cents per cup.<\/p>\n<p>One of the farmers says that selling for 5 Birr instead of 2 would change his life dramatically.  5 Birr is 142.5 US cents per kilo or, given the 80-cups-per-kilo figure, 1.78 US cents per cup.<\/p>\n<p>This means an extra 1.07 US cents, per cup, would dramatically change this guys life.<\/p>\n<p>1 US cent!<\/p>\n<p>Per cup!<\/p>\n<p>And the middle men and Starbucks and Nestle and Tesco and probably even the Fairtrade coffee companies are making millions!<\/p>\n<p>Now, I know that fair trade isn&#8217;t a long term solution to the problems of the developing world.  But for 1 cent per cup of coffee we could transform lives, give people some healthcare, send kids to school.<\/p>\n<p>So what we do? What can I do?  I already buy fair trade so I&#8217;m already helping in some way.  I did have the idea of having a pot by the kettle and putting a coin (of any denomination) in it each time I made a cup of coffee, and giving this money to a development agency.  But I&#8217;m already paying the fair trade premium, so how much will this help.<\/p>\n<p>Better is to get other people to buy fairtrade and push more of the market that way.  Better to campaign for the multinational coffee buyers to set and pay a fair price.  Better to make sure others know that such a small amount of money makes such a big difference!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>It&#8217;s fair trade fortnight!  I hadn&#8217;t actually realised &#8211; communication on it has been quiet this year.<\/p>\n<p>However, as part of the week, a film called Black Gold was on the telly.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re all into sustainability and fair trade anyway, we understand that the trade that we do greatly affects the lives of people in the third world, we see the bigger picture of how we in the UK are very rich and yet we exploit the poor people in the developing world, and we&#8217;re compelled by our faith and our conscience to do something about it.  So we probably didn&#8217;t need to see this film.<\/p>\n<p>However, it was a good documentary!  Unlike things like &#8220;Super Size Me&#8221;, &#8220;Farenheit 9\/11&#8221; and &#8220;Bowling for Columbine&#8221;, there is no star of the show.  There is no man on a quest.  The filmmakers show only their interviewees and the subjects merely speak for themselves.  There is a central character &#8211; a man who runs a coffee co-operative.  But even he is really just a subject of the film.  I liked this.  I didn&#8217;t feel someone was desperately trying to prove a point.  There weren&#8217;y awkward questions; there were just truthful answers.<\/p>\n<p>The film outlined well the difficulties of growing coffee, selling it for a good price and making a living as a coffee farmer.  It showed that there are many middlemen in the selling process, who all take their cut of the money.  It demonstrated that the price of coffee is mostly decided by rich businessmen in America and the UK.<\/p>\n<p>And it showed how unfair the standard process of trade really is!<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s some of the figures that I recall.  Ethiopian coffee beans sold for 2 Ethiopian Birr per kilo &#8211; at the time of making the film this was 57 US cents.<\/p>\n<p>A kilo of beans makes 80 cups of coffee.  This equates to 0.71 US cents per cup.<\/p>\n<p>One of the farmers says that selling for 5 Birr instead of 2 would change his life dramatically.  5 Birr is 142.5 US cents per kilo or, given the 80-cups-per-kilo figure, 1.78 US cents per cup.<\/p>\n<p>This means an extra 1.07 US cents, per cup, would dramatically change this guys life.<\/p>\n<p>1 US cent!<\/p>\n<p>Per cup!<\/p>\n<p>And the middle men and Starbucks and Nestle and Tesco and probably even the Fairtrade coffee companies are making millions!<\/p>\n<p>Now, I know that fair trade isn&#8217;t a long term solution to the problems of the developing world.  But for 1 cent per cup of coffee we could transform lives, give people some healthcare, send kids to school.<\/p>\n<p>So what we do? What can I do?  I already buy fair trade so I&#8217;m already helping in some way.  I did have the idea of having a pot by the kettle and putting a coin (of any denomination) in it each time I made a cup of coffee, and giving this money to a development agency.  But I&#8217;m already paying the fair trade premium, so how much will this help.<\/p>\n<p>Better is to get other people to buy fairtrade and push more of the market that way.  Better to campaign for the multinational coffee buyers to set and pay a fair price.  Better to make sure others know that such a small amount of money makes such a big difference!<\/p>\n",

She&#8217;s not been there long and she mostly just clears up after us and takes the money.  But she&#8217;s not so good at taking the money.  She doesn&#8217;t really know how much things cost (which, to her credit, is not really her fault &#8211; most of us customers don&#8217;t know how much things cost either!), and she doesn&#8217;t seem very good at the money handling bit.<\/p>\n<p>The other day I passed her a ten pound note and she accidentally gave me back the ten pound note AND my change.  She, in effect, paid me to eat at the canteen!<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;ve had reason to relate this story to some of my colleagues recently, and every time people have said &#8220;I hope you kept it&#8221; or &#8220;You didn&#8217;t give it back did you?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Well, of course I did.  I wanted to pay for my lunch.

I don&#8217;t record it to make me appear big, I record it to express my sheer exasperation with other people&#8217;s dishonesty, and the fact that the world EXPECTS dishonesty from me &#8211; it has become the acceptable norm and is actively encouraged and it bothers me&#8230;a lot!<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s this lovely girl at work who works in the canteen.  She&#8217;s not been there long and she mostly just clears up after us and takes the money.  But she&#8217;s not so good at taking the money.  She doesn&#8217;t really know how much things cost (which, to her credit, is not really her fault &#8211; most of us customers don&#8217;t know how much things cost either!), and she doesn&#8217;t seem very good at the money handling bit.<\/p>\n<p>The other day I passed her a ten pound note and she accidentally gave me back the ten pound note AND my change.  She, in effect, paid me to eat at the canteen!<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;ve had reason to relate this story to some of my colleagues recently, and every time people have said &#8220;I hope you kept it&#8221; or &#8220;You didn&#8217;t give it back did you?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Well, of course I did.  I wanted to pay for my lunch.  Bless her, she&#8217;s made a mistake, which I&#8217;ve noticed, and I&#8217;m not gonna have her getting into trouble because the till&#8217;s down at the end of the day because I deliberately accepted more change than I was supposed to get!<\/p>\n<p>Yet, I&#8217;m made to feel belittled and silly for doing the right thing.  People are astonished that I&#8217;m honest.  Why is this?<\/p>\n<p>I remember what the Bible says about this: &#8220;even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed&#8221;.<\/p>\n",

It reminds me of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tragomills.co.uk\/\">Trago Mills<\/a>, in Devon.<\/p>\n<p>It, like Trago&#8217;s, sells everything.  EVERYTHING.  I saw paintings, frames, mirrors, DIY goods, car maintenance kit, bike gear, craft supplies, office stationary, food, lighting, furniture, gardening items, fabric and sewing stuff, outdoor and camping equipment, leisure and sports things.  I think they even sold kitchen sinks!<\/p>\n<p>And yet, despite the millions of items on show, there was very little I wanted.  I mean &#8211; there was actually stuff I needed there but most of it just not quite right, slightly too low quality, too cheap and tacky, or&#8230;something.<\/p>\n<p>Sally and I have occasionally popped to Trago&#8217;s (which is like the range but about 8 times bigger&#8230;I exaggerate not!) when down in Devon and experienced the same thing.  We usually go with a long list of things, and very rarely bring back even half of them.  It just seems like a better idea to buy it somewhere else.<\/p>\n<p>I bought a few things in The Range.  I will probably go back, but more for the wonder and awe of seeing such a vast range of products under one roof, than to actually buy anything of any real value.<\/p>\n",

Did my little run to Cricklade and back in under an hour, which is OK.  It was one of those annoying days where the wind seemed to come from all directions.  I did an out-and-back ride, which should mean I only feel a headwind half the time, but I felt it for the WHOLE ride.  How does that happen?<\/p>\n<p>Last time I did this little jaunt I did my back in, so it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how I feel tomorrow.  Lots of stretching before bed tonight.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Few Nice Things<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m noticing lots of cool things about my bike!  They didn&#8217;t give me a manual you know.  They seem to assume that if you&#8217;re buying a proper road bike then you must know what you&#8217;re doing.  But dual-pivot caliper brakes, Sora gear shifters, and Tiagra rear mechs (d\u00e9railleurs to the rest of us), are, though mostly familiar, a little bit alien in some respects.<\/p>\n<p>One of the nice things about Fuzzy is that he&#8217;s got lots of neat little design features that cheaper bikes don&#8217;t have.  Things that make sense to have.   Here&#8217;s a few:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quick releases.  I know these are standard but I&#8217;m still made happy by the fact that I can whip a wheel off in seconds with no tools.  Genius!<\/li>\n<li>Hex-key bolts&#8230;everywhere.  My sister got me a multi-tool for my birthday last year, but it was pretty useless on the Raleigh as everything was screws and bolts.  But pretty much everything on Fuzzy is held tight by bolts that I can loosen and tighten with hex keys.  Suddenly my multi-tool is all I need!<\/li>\n<li>Gear adjustments on the down tube.  I wanted to adjust my front d\u00e9railleur today and couldn&#8217;t find the screw thing to do it with.  Turns out it&#8217;s on the down tube.  Not REALLY sure why but you can certainly make the adjustment while you&#8217;re riding, which is pretty cool.<\/li>\n<li>Dual-pivot brakes.  Not sure why these are so good, but they&#8217;re pretty solid and seem to give even braking on both sides no matter what you do to them.<\/li>\n<li>Strength.  All the components are tough.  I know this &#8216;cos I fell of and damaged more of me than of the bike!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find plenty more as time goes on.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Photo<\/span><\/p>\n<p>By the way, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve posted it here yet, so here&#8217;s a photo of Fuzzy the Felt &#8211; just to prove that I DO own a nice road bike now:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh4.google.com\/ross.wintle\/R79WS011XfI\/AAAAAAAAB0s\/uATCuL3_jCY\/s800\/IMG_0300.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.google.com\/ross.wintle\/R79WS011XfI\/AAAAAAAAB0s\/uATCuL3_jCY\/s800\/IMG_0300.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>I&#8217;m not so sure about the MTB-style mudguards.  But, annoyingly, there&#8217;s no fixings for proper mudguards on the bike.  I may try out race blades one day.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A-nnoying<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In other bike news, I got a bit fed up with my local bike shop today.  I took the bike in yesterday for its six-week\/hundred mile free service and it came back with the transmission (chain and gears) crunching and grinding.  The brakes have been tightened and they&#8217;ve true&#8217;d up the rear wheel, which was nice of them.  But they&#8217;ve messed up derailleur settings before.  Grrrr.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Rant<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Why?  Why why?  WHY?  Why do people who make roads put 3-foot-wide drain covers about three feet from the edge of the road?  This is exactly the point at which a cyclist riding in &#8220;primary position&#8221; will need to cycle over it.  I&#8217;ve passed many of these today.  Options for a cyclist approaching one are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dive in towards the kerb &#8211; more difficult but safer if you can do it<\/li>\n<li>Dive OUT towards the middle of the road &#8211; easier but more liable to upset motorists and\/or get you knocked off the road entirely<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There must be a better way!<\/p>\n<p>And finally I&#8217;d like to end on&#8230;<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A High Note<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/><\/span><\/span><\/span>I&#8217;m really enjoying cycling again. After a long spell of illness and injury I feel like I&#8217;m back and it&#8217;s great to be in the saddle with the countryside rushing by, wind in my face, heart racing, watching the miles tick by.  I love it.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Ride<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Out on the bike today for a proper (i.e. non-commute) ride.  Did my little run to Cricklade and back in under an hour, which is OK.  It was one of those annoying days where the wind seemed to come from all directions.  I did an out-and-back ride, which should mean I only feel a headwind half the time, but I felt it for the WHOLE ride.  How does that happen?<\/p>\n<p>Last time I did this little jaunt I did my back in, so it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how I feel tomorrow.  Lots of stretching before bed tonight.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Few Nice Things<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m noticing lots of cool things about my bike!  They didn&#8217;t give me a manual you know.  They seem to assume that if you&#8217;re buying a proper road bike then you must know what you&#8217;re doing.  But dual-pivot caliper brakes, Sora gear shifters, and Tiagra rear mechs (d\u00e9railleurs to the rest of us), are, though mostly familiar, a little bit alien in some respects.<\/p>\n<p>One of the nice things about Fuzzy is that he&#8217;s got lots of neat little design features that cheaper bikes don&#8217;t have.  Things that make sense to have.   Here&#8217;s a few:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quick releases.  I know these are standard but I&#8217;m still made happy by the fact that I can whip a wheel off in seconds with no tools.  Genius!<\/li>\n<li>Hex-key bolts&#8230;everywhere.  My sister got me a multi-tool for my birthday last year, but it was pretty useless on the Raleigh as everything was screws and bolts.  But pretty much everything on Fuzzy is held tight by bolts that I can loosen and tighten with hex keys.  Suddenly my multi-tool is all I need!<\/li>\n<li>Gear adjustments on the down tube.  I wanted to adjust my front d\u00e9railleur today and couldn&#8217;t find the screw thing to do it with.  Turns out it&#8217;s on the down tube.  Not REALLY sure why but you can certainly make the adjustment while you&#8217;re riding, which is pretty cool.<\/li>\n<li>Dual-pivot brakes.  Not sure why these are so good, but they&#8217;re pretty solid and seem to give even braking on both sides no matter what you do to them.<\/li>\n<li>Strength.  All the components are tough.  I know this &#8216;cos I fell of and damaged more of me than of the bike!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find plenty more as time goes on.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Photo<\/span><\/p>\n<p>By the way, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve posted it here yet, so here&#8217;s a photo of Fuzzy the Felt &#8211; just to prove that I DO own a nice road bike now:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lh4.google.com\/ross.wintle\/R79WS011XfI\/AAAAAAAAB0s\/uATCuL3_jCY\/s800\/IMG_0300.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.google.com\/ross.wintle\/R79WS011XfI\/AAAAAAAAB0s\/uATCuL3_jCY\/s800\/IMG_0300.JPG\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>I&#8217;m not so sure about the MTB-style mudguards.  But, annoyingly, there&#8217;s no fixings for proper mudguards on the bike.  I may try out race blades one day.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A-nnoying<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In other bike news, I got a bit fed up with my local bike shop today.  I took the bike in yesterday for its six-week\/hundred mile free service and it came back with the transmission (chain and gears) crunching and grinding.  The brakes have been tightened and they&#8217;ve true&#8217;d up the rear wheel, which was nice of them.  But they&#8217;ve messed up derailleur settings before.  Grrrr.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A Rant<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Why?  Why why?  WHY?  Why do people who make roads put 3-foot-wide drain covers about three feet from the edge of the road?  This is exactly the point at which a cyclist riding in &#8220;primary position&#8221; will need to cycle over it.  I&#8217;ve passed many of these today.  Options for a cyclist approaching one are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dive in towards the kerb &#8211; more difficult but safer if you can do it<\/li>\n<li>Dive OUT towards the middle of the road &#8211; easier but more liable to upset motorists and\/or get you knocked off the road entirely<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There must be a better way!<\/p>\n<p>And finally I&#8217;d like to end on&#8230;<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A High Note<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/><\/span><\/span><\/span>I&#8217;m really enjoying cycling again. After a long spell of illness and injury I feel like I&#8217;m back and it&#8217;s great to be in the saddle with the countryside rushing by, wind in my face, heart racing, watching the miles tick by.  I love it.<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><br \/><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n",
