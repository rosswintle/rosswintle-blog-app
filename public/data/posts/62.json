                "rendered": "\n<p><em>Preamble: This will, at times, sound like I&#8217;m trying to sell myself. I&#8217;m not. If I wanted to sell myself I&#8217;d write a post extolling my virtues rather than questioning them. But I can&#8217;t write about finding my place without describing the things that will help determine my place. If it&#8217;s self-indulgent, I&#8217;m sorry. On with the show&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really wanted to some hopes and goals for 2019 down in the form of a pre-emptive\/prophetic retrospective on the year. I.e. what do I want my 2019 review to look like in 12 months time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the truth is, I&#8217;m a bit stuck with some major parts of it. And this post will, I hope, help me collect my thoughts on it and maybe inspire some feedback.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big question really, is: where do I fit in the world of web development?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Between proficiency levels<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that ALL software developers could write this next sentence: I feel pretty stuck in the middle. I&#8217;m clearly a far more experienced software developer than many. But I&#8217;m also clearly a far less experienced developer than many. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a CS degree and a strong background in software engineering and high-end hosting operations. I can mentor other people on coding in various languages; I&#8217;m highly proficient at using code to solve problems; and I&#8217;m pretty advanced at dealing with databases and hosting too. But I also look at other people who have a really deep knowledge of a particular language or framework or something who know far more than I do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m between proficiency levels. And confused about how much I should be an educator helping people up the ladder, and how much I need to humbly accept that I&#8217;ve got a lot to learn and get on with expanding my own knowledge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Between primary areas of technical expertise<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And if there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;m highly proficient in, it&#8217;s WordPress. To continue being highly proficient with WordPress I need to learn to develop with the new block editor, which means more JavaScript and probably React.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, WordPress is between things: I feel like the new editor switches its direction from being a multi-purpose CMS to being a tool that is primarily for publishing and simple site building. Editing and site construction is now front and centre. Post types and fields have taken a back seat. Evolving the database to cater for things like post relationships seems like it&#8217;ll never happen. Gutenberg is an advanced HTML editing tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so as well as being on the Laravel train (which I very much am) I&#8217;m also feeling like I need new CMS options, of which there are so many now it&#8217;s very confusing to know where to start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I also face a more general choice between dragging myself kicking and screaming into more JavaScript and React, and knuckling down into PHP and Laravel and deeper back-end wrangling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Between soft and hard skills<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as being a good software developer, I like to think that I have a good set of soft skills that I enjoy making use of:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Understanding business\/organisational problems<\/li><li>Writing<\/li><li>Bidding and pitching for work<\/li><li>Project management<\/li><li>Speaking and Educating<\/li><li>Administration and running a business<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This also spreads me thin. Should I focus more on just doing the technology? Or do these skills give me a (uncommon?) ability to bridge the gap between less-technical people and technology. Should I be maximising on being that bridge in my projects at the expense of technical focus?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Between project sizes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who has historically wanted to connect smaller organisations with technology that can help them, I&#8217;ve often had multiple small projects on the go, as well as larger, longer term projects for bigger clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is actually quite exhausting and stressful. Smaller projects sometimes need as much communication and project management as larger ones as less tech-savvy clients need more hand-holding through the process. Keeping it all in my head and juggling deadlines and expectations as well as getting the technical work done is quite difficult. And yes, I confess, at times I&#8217;ve not been very good at it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I feel, right now, like I want to ditch all the smaller stuff and find a smaller number of larger projects to work on this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don&#8217;t know how to sell myself on those bigger projects or where that work will come from. Plus, my business focus has always been on the smaller orgs and there&#8217;s something about being in that space that I love. I <em>want<\/em> to help those people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Argh!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Mentor, or be mentored?<\/li><li>Focus on back-end tech, or embrace the move to JavaScript and front-end?<\/li><li>Dig into modern WordPress development, or spread my wings elsewhere?<\/li><li>Double-down on my tech skills, or continue to work with my soft skills in a big way too?<\/li><li>See if I can find some bigger, longer term (and better paid?) projects to ease the mental (and financial?) strain? Or carry on my mission of being a bridge enabling smaller organisations to embrace modern website technology, bearing the load as I go?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where I&#8217;m at. Lots of questions, and potentially lots of risks and opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The difficult beauty of being multi-skilled<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be easy if I was just a back-end or reasonably full-stack dev, coding to a provided spec without considering the consequences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be easy if I was an hip young web dev coding React front ends all over the place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be easy if I was a WordPress implementor churning out small sites to a fixed process with a bit of design skill or possibly working with a designer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m an in-betweeny: I have <em>lots<\/em> of skills and interests; I have a keen desire to do good and right things and care about my craft; I&#8217;m a coder and an educator; I&#8217;m a businessman and a geek; I&#8217;m an open-minded developer who wants to get to grips with new technologie, and also a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.brucelawson.co.uk\/2018\/the-practical-value-of-semantic-html\/\">Dull Old Web Fart<\/a>&#8221; who&#8217;s set in his ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And\u2026I must remind myself, I MUST!\u2026what an amazing thing to be!! What a unique, eclectic, diverse range of skills and experiences! How can I not be happy that I&#8217;m capable of being these bridges, building cool things on the web, helping people use technology to solve problems. What a privilege!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Marketing me<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The difficulty is partly marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People don&#8217;t Google for &#8220;multi-disciplinary geeks&#8221; to help them solve problems. They Google &#8220;web designers in Swindon&#8221; or &#8220;Charity website builders&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People don&#8217;t want a landing page to say &#8220;I&#8217;ll use cool technology to help you solve your business problems&#8221; because it doesn&#8217;t really mean anything. They want to see &#8220;We make fast, beautiful WordPress websites&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I want to embrace &#8220;me&#8221;, how do I communicate that to others &#8211; to non-technical people that want to understand what I do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2019 then?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What does it hold? I really don&#8217;t know. Perhaps you can help me write the prophetic 2019 review this week. Have I missed something obvious? Am I running scared? Do I just need to make some decisions and stick them out for a while?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be my coach: what would you do?!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>Preamble: This will, at times, sound like I&#8217;m trying to sell myself. I&#8217;m not. If I wanted to sell myself I&#8217;d write a post extolling my virtues rather than questioning them. But I can&#8217;t write about finding my place without describing the things that will help determine my place. If it&#8217;s self-indulgent, I&#8217;m sorry. On with the show&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really wanted to some hopes and goals for 2019 down in the form of a pre-emptive\/prophetic retrospective on the year. I.e. what do I want my 2019 review to look like in 12 months time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the truth is, I&#8217;m a bit stuck with some major parts of it. And this post will, I hope, help me collect my thoughts on it and maybe inspire some feedback.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big question really, is: where do I fit in the world of web development?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Between proficiency levels<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that ALL software developers could write this next sentence: I feel pretty stuck in the middle. I&#8217;m clearly a far more experienced software developer than many. But I&#8217;m also clearly a far less experienced developer than many. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a CS degree and a strong background in software engineering and high-end hosting operations. I can mentor other people on coding in various languages; I&#8217;m highly proficient at using code to solve problems; and I&#8217;m pretty advanced at dealing with databases and hosting too. But I also look at other people who have a really deep knowledge of a particular language or framework or something who know far more than I do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m between proficiency levels. And confused about how much I should be an educator helping people up the ladder, and how much I need to humbly accept that I&#8217;ve got a lot to learn and get on with expanding my own knowledge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Between primary areas of technical expertise<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And if there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;m highly proficient in, it&#8217;s WordPress. To continue being highly proficient with WordPress I need to learn to develop with the new block editor, which means more JavaScript and probably React.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, WordPress is between things: I feel like the new editor switches its direction from being a multi-purpose CMS to being a tool that is primarily for publishing and simple site building. Editing and site construction is now front and centre. Post types and fields have taken a back seat. Evolving the database to cater for things like post relationships seems like it&#8217;ll never happen. Gutenberg is an advanced HTML editing tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so as well as being on the Laravel train (which I very much am) I&#8217;m also feeling like I need new CMS options, of which there are so many now it&#8217;s very confusing to know where to start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I also face a more general choice between dragging myself kicking and screaming into more JavaScript and React, and knuckling down into PHP and Laravel and deeper back-end wrangling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Between soft and hard skills<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as being a good software developer, I like to think that I have a good set of soft skills that I enjoy making use of:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Understanding business\/organisational problems<\/li><li>Writing<\/li><li>Bidding and pitching for work<\/li><li>Project management<\/li><li>Speaking and Educating<\/li><li>Administration and running a business<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This also spreads me thin. Should I focus more on just doing the technology? Or do these skills give me a (uncommon?) ability to bridge the gap between less-technical people and technology. Should I be maximising on being that bridge in my projects at the expense of technical focus?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Between project sizes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who has historically wanted to connect smaller organisations with technology that can help them, I&#8217;ve often had multiple small projects on the go, as well as larger, longer term projects for bigger clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is actually quite exhausting and stressful. Smaller projects sometimes need as much communication and project management as larger ones as less tech-savvy clients need more hand-holding through the process. Keeping it all in my head and juggling deadlines and expectations as well as getting the technical work done is quite difficult. And yes, I confess, at times I&#8217;ve not been very good at it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I feel, right now, like I want to ditch all the smaller stuff and find a smaller number of larger projects to work on this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don&#8217;t know how to sell myself on those bigger projects or where that work will come from. Plus, my business focus has always been on the smaller orgs and there&#8217;s something about being in that space that I love. I <em>want<\/em> to help those people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Argh!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Mentor, or be mentored?<\/li><li>Focus on back-end tech, or embrace the move to JavaScript and front-end?<\/li><li>Dig into modern WordPress development, or spread my wings elsewhere?<\/li><li>Double-down on my tech skills, or continue to work with my soft skills in a big way too?<\/li><li>See if I can find some bigger, longer term (and better paid?) projects to ease the mental (and financial?) strain? Or carry on my mission of being a bridge enabling smaller organisations to embrace modern website technology, bearing the load as I go?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where I&#8217;m at. Lots of questions, and potentially lots of risks and opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The difficult beauty of being multi-skilled<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be easy if I was just a back-end or reasonably full-stack dev, coding to a provided spec without considering the consequences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be easy if I was an hip young web dev coding React front ends all over the place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be easy if I was a WordPress implementor churning out small sites to a fixed process with a bit of design skill or possibly working with a designer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m an in-betweeny: I have <em>lots<\/em> of skills and interests; I have a keen desire to do good and right things and care about my craft; I&#8217;m a coder and an educator; I&#8217;m a businessman and a geek; I&#8217;m an open-minded developer who wants to get to grips with new technologie, and also a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.brucelawson.co.uk\/2018\/the-practical-value-of-semantic-html\/\">Dull Old Web Fart<\/a>&#8221; who&#8217;s set in his ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And\u2026I must remind myself, I MUST!\u2026what an amazing thing to be!! What a unique, eclectic, diverse range of skills and experiences! How can I not be happy that I&#8217;m capable of being these bridges, building cool things on the web, helping people use technology to solve problems. What a privilege!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Marketing me<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The difficulty is partly marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People don&#8217;t Google for &#8220;multi-disciplinary geeks&#8221; to help them solve problems. They Google &#8220;web designers in Swindon&#8221; or &#8220;Charity website builders&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People don&#8217;t want a landing page to say &#8220;I&#8217;ll use cool technology to help you solve your business problems&#8221; because it doesn&#8217;t really mean anything. They want to see &#8220;We make fast, beautiful WordPress websites&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I want to embrace &#8220;me&#8221;, how do I communicate that to others &#8211; to non-technical people that want to understand what I do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2019 then?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What does it hold? I really don&#8217;t know. Perhaps you can help me write the prophetic 2019 review this week. Have I missed something obvious? Am I running scared? Do I just need to make some decisions and stick them out for a while?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be my coach: what would you do?!<\/p>\n",

I hope you like it too!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I was shown\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.cleancoder.com\/uncle-bob\/2012\/04\/18\/After-The-Disaster.html\">Uncle Bob&#8217;s 2012 blog post &#8220;After the Disaster&#8221;<\/a>\u00a0a while back &#8211; an interesting piece from a very experienced software developer about how &#8220;If [people] find that [software developers]\u00a0are disciplined, and self regulating, then perhaps they\u2019ll leave us mostly alone. But if they find that we are undisciplined hacks then you know that they\u2019ll impose all manner of horrible regulation upon us.&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>He makes a really good point about how software is encroaching more and more into our daily lives, and that software development <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can be<\/span> undisciplined and therefore potentially dangerous. And he&#8217;s right. \u00a0&#8220;Coding&#8221; has become popular and very easy to learn. But software development &#8211; the broader craft of solving complex problems in maintainable, testable, well-structured, easily-understandable ways &#8211; is harder and needs more discipline than you get by just learning to code.<\/p>\n<p>Software development is a lot more than just coding. Just yesterday, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/Why-is-programming-so-easy#!n=18\">this Quora Q&amp;A thread<\/a> appeared in my inbox titled &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/Why-is-programming-so-easy#!n=18\">Why is programming so easy?<\/a>&#8220;. One of my favourite answers is &#8220;Coding is easy. In fact it is the easiest part of a programming job imo.&#8221; And in my opinion the world&#8217;s ratio of &#8220;software engineers&#8221; to &#8220;coders&#8221; is too low. This needs to change.<\/p>\n<p>So I get and agree with Uncle Bob&#8217;s point. But I feel I need to give some critique of his explanation of it, and the examples that he uses.<\/p>\n<h3>Not all software is equal<\/h3>\n<p>Bob says: &#8220;Is there software in your cell phone&#8230;your watch&#8230;the light switch on the wall&#8230;the light bulbs&#8230;the intercom&#8230;the doorbell&#8230;the thermostat&#8230;your furnace&#8230;your air conditioner&#8230;your refrigerator, dishwasher, washing-machine, drier?&#8221;. And yes, he&#8217;s right. Software is all around us.<\/p>\n<p>But he then seamlessly switches into this: &#8220;How about your car; and all the other cars on the road? How about the traffic signals? Did you ride an elevator today? Get in a plane or a train? How about an escalator? Do you have a pacemaker? An insulin pump?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s start by making it clear that not all software is equal. The first list of things is very different to the second list of things. The probability that something very bad will happen if software in the first list of things goes wrong is pretty low.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, you can concoct scenarios like &#8220;my fridge got too hot and I got food poisoning&#8221; but there are other mitigating factors that prevent that hazard (like the fridge getting too hot) turning into harm (food poisoning). \u00a0We&#8217;ll come back to this.<\/p>\n<p>The probability that something very bad will happen if software in the second list of things goes wrong is pretty high. \u00a0Most of those things move large, heavy chunks of metal around at great velocities, and are then subsequently responsible for stopping them moving too. The others are medical equipment that keeps people alive.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s be clear &#8211; these are different things. A lightbulb and an airplane have very different requirements for the integrity of their software.<\/p>\n<p>Not all software is equal.<\/p>\n<h3>Therefore, not all software processes are equal<\/h3>\n<p>Bob then says this: &#8220;How many times per day do you put your life in the hands of an \u2018if\u2019 statement written by some twenty-two year old at three in the morning, while strung out on vodka and redbull?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And the answer is probably pretty close to &#8220;zero&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I worked in safety critical software for 4 years. I was actually writing and testing safety-critical code when I was twenty-two. And I can tell you that it is definitely NOT the case that a young, junior software developer would be able to commit code to the stable codebase of software for a car, traffic signal, elevator, train, plane, escalator or piece of medical equipment at 2am on a whim.<\/p>\n<p>The software processes for these kind of things involve:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>rigid, formal software specifications<\/li>\n<li>coding using appropriate tools and languages that minimise coding errors and help test that code does what it should and meets the spec<\/li>\n<li>correct levels of testing<\/li>\n<li>code review by peers, senior engineers, and often external third parties<\/li>\n<li>compliance with relevant safety standards<\/li>\n<li>production of safety cases that analyse the potential hazards, risk probabilities, and levels of harm to minimise danger<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>AND&#8230;in addition to all that there will be hardware fail-safes and other physical mechanisms that prevent a problem with software becoming something harmful.<\/p>\n<p>In this context, I&#8217;ve worked on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>static analysis of compiled code at assembler level<\/li>\n<li>review of compiled assembler code against the high-level source code<\/li>\n<li>testing so thorough that I discovered a (already documented but unknown to my team) bug in a microprocessor &#8211; yes, our spec and testing were so good that when the test failed, we turned to the microprocessor manual to see what was up!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.cleancoder.com\/uncle-bob\/2014\/02\/21\/WhereIsTheForeman.html\">another, related post<\/a>, Bob writes: &#8220;Where&#8217;s the guy who makes sure all the errors are checked, and that references can&#8217;t be null, and that variables are thread-safe?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Actually, in these industries, languages with provable properties are used. You can eliminate null references and entire classes of basic coding errors and performance issues. And in the safety-critical world these tools are often mandated.<\/p>\n<p>These processes are expensive. They are used in this context because people&#8217;s lives are clearly at risk. \u00a0Rigid, complicated, expensive processes are not needed for all forms of software. The budget for these projects MUST pay for the appropriate level of engineering, testing and approval.<\/p>\n<p>I currently build websites. In most cases, if my code is wrong, an image is displayed in the wrong place on someone&#8217;s screen. \u00a0Linting, code review, static analysis are helpful. But they can be safely omitted if the budget is not large enough.<\/p>\n<p>Different software needs different software\u00a0processes.<\/p>\n<h3>The Disaster<\/h3>\n<p>Bob then says: &#8220;Some time in the not too distant future, there\u2019s going to be an event. Thousands of people will die. And it will be the fault of some errant piece of code written by some poor schmuck under hellish pressure facing impossible deadlines. Perhaps it will be an airline crash, or a cruise ship sinking. Perhaps it\u2019ll be an explosion at a factory, or a train accident involving toxins. Perhaps it\u2019ll be a simple clerical error at a medical research lab that causes a vial of smallpox or ebola to be improperly disposed of.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Basically, there may well be a disaster as a result of code. But please, an airline crash or a cruise ship sinking or a train accident will not be caused in this way.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Poor schmuck&#8217;s&#8221; are not employed to write code like this. &#8220;Hellish pressure&#8221; is not allowed in this context. &#8220;Impossible deadlines&#8221; exist, but there are protections&#8230; You can not&#8230;you are not allowed to&#8230;ship dangerous code in a safety-critical context like this.<\/p>\n<p>Even if bad software does get in, the number of things that would need to happen between a software failure on a train and spillage of toxins in transit is huge and the probability of each of them is very low. And there are non-digital things\u00a0&#8211; handling measures, hardware precautions, and so on &#8211; that try to prevent software hazards becoming physical harm.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Will they find that developers work at all hours of the day and night, are under hellish pressure and impossible deadlines? Will they find that there are no professional standard, practices, or disciplines. Will they discover that we are all really just a bunch of undisciplined hacks?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Well. Umm. No, Bob. In the industries that you keep suggesting will cause the disaster, you will not find these things.<\/p>\n<h3>We&#8217;re already After the Disaster<\/h3>\n<p>And Bob&#8217;s conclusion: &#8220;The population will scream for protection, and the lawmakers will respond with self-righteous indignation. In their toolkit they\u2019ll have regulations, restrictions, licensing requirements, and certification tests&#8230;if they find that we are undisciplined hacks then you know that they\u2019ll impose all manner of horrible regulation upon us&#8230;.They might tell us what languages to use. They might tell us what process to use&#8230;we\u2019ll work in a government regulated profession.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So, let me introduce you to the Civil Aviation Authority, the Office of Rail Regulation, the Federal Aviation Authority, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Office for Nuclear Regulation.<\/p>\n<p>Is it really thought that development of software in safety-critical applications has no government-backed processes and procedures, legal and regulatory frameworks, restrictions, certification tests?<\/p>\n<p>Is it really thought that these things don&#8217;t exist? And even if they don&#8217;t, wouldn&#8217;t it be a good thing if a regulatory body told us to use a language that could be statically analysed to prove that it had no out-of-array-bounds accesses, undeclared variable uses, type errors, etc, etc. Would this not be a good thing?<\/p>\n<p>These industries are already regulated. And rightly so. \u00a0You can&#8217;t be a lazy indisciplined coder in these places. It&#8217;s not allowed. The &#8220;disaster&#8221; won&#8217;t lead to regulation because the regulation already exists.<\/p>\n<p>So what IS Bob advocating?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If they find that we are disciplined, and self regulating, then perhaps they\u2019ll leave us mostly alone.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a call to arms. We need to self-impose discipline and regulation on ourselves, &#8220;Otherwise we\u2019ll work in a government regulated profession. And then life will be hell.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In contrast to what, I wonder? To working drunk at 2am on code for a lightbulb? \u00a0Well, on one thing we agree! Both ends of this spectrum are bad. We need something in the middle.<\/p>\n<p>We need to stop working when tired, drunk and powered by energy drinks. We need to do testing and code review. We need to use the tools, languages, and processes that make our software better. All of this we should do.<\/p>\n<p>But we should also be pragmatic. Not every application is a fly-by-wire aircraft control system. \u00a0And a good engineer is pragmatic, making trade-offs, assessing risks, defining requirements, building and testing code responsibly.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of applications aren&#8217;t going to cause &#8220;the disaster&#8221;, and not all code needs to be built to prevent it.<\/p>\n<p>So while I strongly disagree with Bob&#8217;s examples and his explanation of and implications of some hypothetical\u00a0disaster, he is right. Our industry is a mess. We need to take ourselves more seriously.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t just ship it, coders. Learn your craft well. Work responsibly. \u00a0Charge properly. Say &#8220;no&#8221;. Ask difficult questions. Don&#8217;t make assumptions.<\/p>\n<p>People might not be dying at the hands of your if statements, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t care.<\/p>\n",

Yet I keep reading it and I&#8217;m really happy with what I&#8217;ve written and the light it brings to the topic. I&#8217;m finally clicking &#8220;Publish&#8221;. I hope you like it too!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I was shown\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.cleancoder.com\/uncle-bob\/2012\/04\/18\/After-The-Disaster.html\">Uncle Bob&#8217;s 2012 blog post &#8220;After the Disaster&#8221;<\/a>\u00a0a while back &#8211; an interesting piece from a very experienced software developer about how &#8220;If [people] find that [software developers]\u00a0are disciplined, and self regulating, then perhaps they\u2019ll leave us mostly alone. But if they find that we are undisciplined hacks then you know that they\u2019ll impose all manner of horrible regulation upon us.&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>He makes a really good point about how software is encroaching more and more into our daily lives, and that software development <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">can be<\/span> undisciplined and therefore potentially dangerous. And he&#8217;s right. \u00a0&#8220;Coding&#8221; has become popular and very easy to learn. But software development &#8211; the broader craft of solving complex problems in maintainable, testable, well-structured, easily-understandable ways &#8211; is harder and needs more discipline than you get by just learning to code.<\/p>\n<p>Software development is a lot more than just coding. Just yesterday, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/Why-is-programming-so-easy#!n=18\">this Quora Q&amp;A thread<\/a> appeared in my inbox titled &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/Why-is-programming-so-easy#!n=18\">Why is programming so easy?<\/a>&#8220;. One of my favourite answers is &#8220;Coding is easy. In fact it is the easiest part of a programming job imo.&#8221; And in my opinion the world&#8217;s ratio of &#8220;software engineers&#8221; to &#8220;coders&#8221; is too low. This needs to change.<\/p>\n<p>So I get and agree with Uncle Bob&#8217;s point. But I feel I need to give some critique of his explanation of it, and the examples that he uses.<\/p>\n<h3>Not all software is equal<\/h3>\n<p>Bob says: &#8220;Is there software in your cell phone&#8230;your watch&#8230;the light switch on the wall&#8230;the light bulbs&#8230;the intercom&#8230;the doorbell&#8230;the thermostat&#8230;your furnace&#8230;your air conditioner&#8230;your refrigerator, dishwasher, washing-machine, drier?&#8221;. And yes, he&#8217;s right. Software is all around us.<\/p>\n<p>But he then seamlessly switches into this: &#8220;How about your car; and all the other cars on the road? How about the traffic signals? Did you ride an elevator today? Get in a plane or a train? How about an escalator? Do you have a pacemaker? An insulin pump?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s start by making it clear that not all software is equal. The first list of things is very different to the second list of things. The probability that something very bad will happen if software in the first list of things goes wrong is pretty low.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, you can concoct scenarios like &#8220;my fridge got too hot and I got food poisoning&#8221; but there are other mitigating factors that prevent that hazard (like the fridge getting too hot) turning into harm (food poisoning). \u00a0We&#8217;ll come back to this.<\/p>\n<p>The probability that something very bad will happen if software in the second list of things goes wrong is pretty high. \u00a0Most of those things move large, heavy chunks of metal around at great velocities, and are then subsequently responsible for stopping them moving too. The others are medical equipment that keeps people alive.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s be clear &#8211; these are different things. A lightbulb and an airplane have very different requirements for the integrity of their software.<\/p>\n<p>Not all software is equal.<\/p>\n<h3>Therefore, not all software processes are equal<\/h3>\n<p>Bob then says this: &#8220;How many times per day do you put your life in the hands of an \u2018if\u2019 statement written by some twenty-two year old at three in the morning, while strung out on vodka and redbull?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And the answer is probably pretty close to &#8220;zero&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I worked in safety critical software for 4 years. I was actually writing and testing safety-critical code when I was twenty-two. And I can tell you that it is definitely NOT the case that a young, junior software developer would be able to commit code to the stable codebase of software for a car, traffic signal, elevator, train, plane, escalator or piece of medical equipment at 2am on a whim.<\/p>\n<p>The software processes for these kind of things involve:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>rigid, formal software specifications<\/li>\n<li>coding using appropriate tools and languages that minimise coding errors and help test that code does what it should and meets the spec<\/li>\n<li>correct levels of testing<\/li>\n<li>code review by peers, senior engineers, and often external third parties<\/li>\n<li>compliance with relevant safety standards<\/li>\n<li>production of safety cases that analyse the potential hazards, risk probabilities, and levels of harm to minimise danger<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>AND&#8230;in addition to all that there will be hardware fail-safes and other physical mechanisms that prevent a problem with software becoming something harmful.<\/p>\n<p>In this context, I&#8217;ve worked on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>static analysis of compiled code at assembler level<\/li>\n<li>review of compiled assembler code against the high-level source code<\/li>\n<li>testing so thorough that I discovered a (already documented but unknown to my team) bug in a microprocessor &#8211; yes, our spec and testing were so good that when the test failed, we turned to the microprocessor manual to see what was up!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.cleancoder.com\/uncle-bob\/2014\/02\/21\/WhereIsTheForeman.html\">another, related post<\/a>, Bob writes: &#8220;Where&#8217;s the guy who makes sure all the errors are checked, and that references can&#8217;t be null, and that variables are thread-safe?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Actually, in these industries, languages with provable properties are used. You can eliminate null references and entire classes of basic coding errors and performance issues. And in the safety-critical world these tools are often mandated.<\/p>\n<p>These processes are expensive. They are used in this context because people&#8217;s lives are clearly at risk. \u00a0Rigid, complicated, expensive processes are not needed for all forms of software. The budget for these projects MUST pay for the appropriate level of engineering, testing and approval.<\/p>\n<p>I currently build websites. In most cases, if my code is wrong, an image is displayed in the wrong place on someone&#8217;s screen. \u00a0Linting, code review, static analysis are helpful. But they can be safely omitted if the budget is not large enough.<\/p>\n<p>Different software needs different software\u00a0processes.<\/p>\n<h3>The Disaster<\/h3>\n<p>Bob then says: &#8220;Some time in the not too distant future, there\u2019s going to be an event. Thousands of people will die. And it will be the fault of some errant piece of code written by some poor schmuck under hellish pressure facing impossible deadlines. Perhaps it will be an airline crash, or a cruise ship sinking. Perhaps it\u2019ll be an explosion at a factory, or a train accident involving toxins. Perhaps it\u2019ll be a simple clerical error at a medical research lab that causes a vial of smallpox or ebola to be improperly disposed of.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Basically, there may well be a disaster as a result of code. But please, an airline crash or a cruise ship sinking or a train accident will not be caused in this way.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Poor schmuck&#8217;s&#8221; are not employed to write code like this. &#8220;Hellish pressure&#8221; is not allowed in this context. &#8220;Impossible deadlines&#8221; exist, but there are protections&#8230; You can not&#8230;you are not allowed to&#8230;ship dangerous code in a safety-critical context like this.<\/p>\n<p>Even if bad software does get in, the number of things that would need to happen between a software failure on a train and spillage of toxins in transit is huge and the probability of each of them is very low. And there are non-digital things\u00a0&#8211; handling measures, hardware precautions, and so on &#8211; that try to prevent software hazards becoming physical harm.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Will they find that developers work at all hours of the day and night, are under hellish pressure and impossible deadlines? Will they find that there are no professional standard, practices, or disciplines. Will they discover that we are all really just a bunch of undisciplined hacks?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Well. Umm. No, Bob. In the industries that you keep suggesting will cause the disaster, you will not find these things.<\/p>\n<h3>We&#8217;re already After the Disaster<\/h3>\n<p>And Bob&#8217;s conclusion: &#8220;The population will scream for protection, and the lawmakers will respond with self-righteous indignation. In their toolkit they\u2019ll have regulations, restrictions, licensing requirements, and certification tests&#8230;if they find that we are undisciplined hacks then you know that they\u2019ll impose all manner of horrible regulation upon us&#8230;.They might tell us what languages to use. They might tell us what process to use&#8230;we\u2019ll work in a government regulated profession.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So, let me introduce you to the Civil Aviation Authority, the Office of Rail Regulation, the Federal Aviation Authority, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Office for Nuclear Regulation.<\/p>\n<p>Is it really thought that development of software in safety-critical applications has no government-backed processes and procedures, legal and regulatory frameworks, restrictions, certification tests?<\/p>\n<p>Is it really thought that these things don&#8217;t exist? And even if they don&#8217;t, wouldn&#8217;t it be a good thing if a regulatory body told us to use a language that could be statically analysed to prove that it had no out-of-array-bounds accesses, undeclared variable uses, type errors, etc, etc. Would this not be a good thing?<\/p>\n<p>These industries are already regulated. And rightly so. \u00a0You can&#8217;t be a lazy indisciplined coder in these places. It&#8217;s not allowed. The &#8220;disaster&#8221; won&#8217;t lead to regulation because the regulation already exists.<\/p>\n<p>So what IS Bob advocating?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If they find that we are disciplined, and self regulating, then perhaps they\u2019ll leave us mostly alone.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a call to arms. We need to self-impose discipline and regulation on ourselves, &#8220;Otherwise we\u2019ll work in a government regulated profession. And then life will be hell.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In contrast to what, I wonder? To working drunk at 2am on code for a lightbulb? \u00a0Well, on one thing we agree! Both ends of this spectrum are bad. We need something in the middle.<\/p>\n<p>We need to stop working when tired, drunk and powered by energy drinks. We need to do testing and code review. We need to use the tools, languages, and processes that make our software better. All of this we should do.<\/p>\n<p>But we should also be pragmatic. Not every application is a fly-by-wire aircraft control system. \u00a0And a good engineer is pragmatic, making trade-offs, assessing risks, defining requirements, building and testing code responsibly.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of applications aren&#8217;t going to cause &#8220;the disaster&#8221;, and not all code needs to be built to prevent it.<\/p>\n<p>So while I strongly disagree with Bob&#8217;s examples and his explanation of and implications of some hypothetical\u00a0disaster, he is right. Our industry is a mess. We need to take ourselves more seriously.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t just ship it, coders. Learn your craft well. Work responsibly. \u00a0Charge properly. Say &#8220;no&#8221;. Ask difficult questions. Don&#8217;t make assumptions.<\/p>\n<p>People might not be dying at the hands of your if statements, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t care.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>Everyone is writing about CSS, and I work with CSS, so I guess I should write about CSS too. Please bear in mind I\u2019ve spent far less time thinking about this than others. But these are my thoughts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, I half-jokingly present you my new convention: SUCSS. But before I tell you what it\u2019s all about let&#8217;s get some context.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS and Me<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m relatively old friends with CSS. I guess I started working in web development for real in 2010. I remember the stupid IE6 margin bugs, and learning the box model. It was hard work, but it was all we had. And once you knew the quirks it was actually powerful to work with. And I&#8217;d argue that it has remained powerful and only gotten MORE powerful over the years. Regardless of where you put it and how you name things, CSS is THE underlying technology for all styling of HTML on the web. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Presentational vs Semantic Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in the day \u201csemantic classes\u201d were all the rage. This was What You Should Do. And the hard line on this appeared to be a push back against people wanting to make \u201cpresentational\u201d classes like \u201cbig-padding\u201d or \u201cfloat-left\u201d or \u201cblue-text\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This kind of stuff, they said, shouldn\u2019t clutter up your markup. The markup describes the structure of the document not its presentation!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Classes should be things like \u201cmain-header\u201d, \u201cwidget-area\u201d, \u201cfooter-credits\u201d. Names that describe what something is, not what it looks like. After all the sidebar could be on the left or the right or at the bottom. You shouldn\u2019t constrain your presentation by what you write in your markup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I always found writing CSS for semantic classes was a bind. Well, not so much writing it, but editing it. Especially other people\u2019s CSS. I remember spending time searching huge CSS files (and later entire directories of SASS files) to try and work out where a class was so that I could tweak the padding on it, only to realise then that this would affect ALL instances of this class and might have unintended knock-on effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wished that I had some kind of permission to add an inline style attribute, or a \u201cbig-padding-top\u201d class to safely tweak just that one instance of this thing in this one place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">BEM, OOCSS, SMACSS and so on<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Various conventions then emerged from some very clever people to try and name your classes and structure your CSS in better ways. These were great. They kept semantics, but allowed you to add contexts and modifiers, inherit properties between classes in an ordered way, and flatten the cascade toprevent styles bleeding from one place to another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clever stuff!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I liked this. But the problem was that anyone involved in the project had to be along for the ride. In an agency this is possible but I\u2019m a freelancer who sometimes works solo and sometimes with other freelancers or agencies, and so I never really fully adopted one of these techniques because each project was different. Yes, they informed the techniques and conventions I used but I found it hard to take them on 100%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Aside: Less and SASS and tooling.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s quickly touch on these. I\u2019m not an early adopter of new things. I\u2019m a cautious semi-early adopter. I picked SASS and was glad I did. I don\u2019t use it in a big way: variables, nesting (not needed so much if you\u2019re full-on BEM), and file includes to break things up all help though. I\u2019m pretty much SASS by default now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the tooling&#8230;THE TOOLING! Yes, it was good. But it came in many forms. And so many people had so many different setups. Again, if you work in one big team and do the same thing everywhere this isn\u2019t so bad. But working in multiple places and often inheriting projects from others made this hard work: what\u2019s the darned build command on THIS project then?!?!? The README.txt became king.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>npm, grunt, gulp, webpack, PostCSS, and so on have not helped in this regard. Yes, tool chains have got way more powerful than they were, but they are also way more complicated!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">And so we come full circle<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So it came to pass that one day I inherited a project that used \u201cTachyons\u201d. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I\u2019m looking at markup with things like <code>class=\"f4 mt3 bt bw1 b\u2014gray br2\"<\/code> and I\u2019m thinking: WHAT?!?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, it turns out, was my first exposure to \u201cfunctional\u201d or \u201c    utility\u201d CSS. This is basically writing styles in the markup, but disguised as CSS classes. Which is, you know, the thing everyone rallied hard against 6 or 7 years ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;whereas everyone can understand <code>style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1.25rem;\"<\/code> etc, Tachyons has its own language that only Tachyons people understand. All, presumably, in the name of saving bytes (a measure which, at this scale, is probably irrelevant).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also&#8230;reading and understanding markup with Tachyons classes in it is horrendous. Just what is this thing? Yes, it\u2019s a large, blue, margin-topped, bottom-bordered THING with white text. But, like, WHAT IS IT?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HTML5 elements can help identify things, of course, as can IDs or components, if that\u2019s your thing. But&#8230;just&#8230;.gah!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I get that you can define your colours and type scales and so on, but I, personally, didn&#8217;t like Tachyons (can you tell?) and it left me along with the project I inherited that used it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Aside: I&#8217;m being somewhat extreme for dramatic effect here. If you use Tachyons and love it then that&#8217;s awesome. If you made Tachyons &#8211; great job, thank you! I, personally didn&#8217;t get on with it at all though and these were my genuine reactions on seeing it.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then Tailwind came on my radar. Tailwind is like Tachyons but seems to be to be substantially more friendly. Mostly its nicer because the class names aren\u2019t all abbreviated beyond readability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people in my industry are raving about it. And I\u2019ve not tried it yet. And one reason is that I\u2019m put off by the very first example in the docs:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"686\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-1024x686.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of TailWind docs showing complicated markup.\" class=\"wp-image-4497\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-1024x686.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-768x514.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-945x633.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-600x402.jpg 600w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender.jpg 1519w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I do NOT want my code to look like that. I don\u2019t mean with a picture of <a href=\"https:\/\/adamwathan.me\/\">Adam Wathan<\/a> above it, of course (He&#8217;s great and has made <a href=\"https:\/\/refactoringui.com\/book\">some<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/course.testdrivenlaravel.com\/\">awesome<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fullstackradio.com\/\">stuff<\/a>, by the way!). But this is the exact opposite end of the scale of all the things that were wrong with semantic classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With semantic classes I could see what all the things were, but not how they were styled. With both Tachyons and Tailwind I can see all the styles, but not what the things are!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the first example you find that collecting styles into components with helpful names is encouraged in Tailwind. And this seems like we\u2019re almost in my CSS heaven: I can write <code>&lt;a href=\"button-link\"&gt;<\/code> and have my semantic class or component that says what the thing is but then also easily tweak it for the context it\u2019s in. Yippee!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, so there\u2019s still some unhelpful abbreviation there, but it\u2019s not that bad once you\u2019ve been introduced to the basics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tailwind is \u201cutility first\u201d. You START by writing with just utilities and extract re-usable components where needed.  And in my head I get that creating things with it should be quick, but I\u2019ve seen videos of people working with it and it\u2019s often painful:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I want to increase this font size a little\n<\/li><li>So I\u2019ll inspect it in dev tools and tweak the size until it\u2019s what I want.\n<\/li><li>Then I take the size I want and look it up in my config file to find the class I need to make it that size\n<\/li><li>Then I\u2019ll add the class to my HTML\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t right! CSS and dev tools work beautifully together, and now we have a naming abstraction and a config layer and..ugh&#8230;it just seems like we\u2019ve made things harder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My other beef with Tailwind is tooling. It introduces PostCSS and JavaScript configuration and&#8230;well&#8230;I just don\u2019t want to have to get to grips with these things to write CSS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS with added awesome!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CSS itself has come a long way. We have variables baked in, and Flexbox in pretty much every browser I work with and Grid support growing quickly.  With a good naming convention you don&#8217;t need nesting so much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All we&#8217;re really lacking is includes. But arguably HTTP2 takes care of the problem of having lots of small regular CSS files, and caching and service workers probably help here too. There&#8217;s probably good arguments for lots of small CSS files loaded as and when you need them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think we will soon reach a point where the tooling isn\u2019t necessary. I see a day where I just write CSS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I still need to organise it on large projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS Heaven<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, in a discussion about exactly these things: CSS, Tailwind and BEM, my Twitter friend Ben posts this (and I note that the whole conversation was interesting and read-worthy):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That\u2019s it.

This is what I want! Semantically-named, re-usable components with utility modifiers!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with modern day CSS variables we can probably do this, can\u2019t we? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Relatively flat CSS&#8230;\n<\/li><li>&#8230;with built in variables&#8230;\n<\/li><li>&#8230;that needs no toolchain to build.\n<\/li><li>We have re-usable components that let us state what our markup IS, not just what it looks like&#8230;\n<\/li><li>&#8230;but we have utility modifiers in the form of classes we can add sparingly to make adjustments to components to make them fit their context&#8230;\n<\/li><li>&#8230;but without cluttering up our markup with ALL the styles.\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben calls this \u201cBEU: Block, element, utility\u201d, which is nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I call it \u201cSUCSS: Sematics + Utility CSS\u201d, not to spite Ben. Just because it\u2019s funnier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said at the start, I&#8217;m no expert. So help me , CSS gurus. Please tell me why this is wrong. Which bit of component + utility + vanilla CSS is bad here? What wouldn&#8217;t work with this approach?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Everyone is writing about CSS, and I work with CSS, so I guess I should write about CSS too. Please bear in mind I\u2019ve spent far less time thinking about this than others. But these are my thoughts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, I half-jokingly present you my new convention: SUCSS. But before I tell you what it\u2019s all about let&#8217;s get some context.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS and Me<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m relatively old friends with CSS. I guess I started working in web development for real in 2010. I remember the stupid IE6 margin bugs, and learning the box model. It was hard work, but it was all we had. And once you knew the quirks it was actually powerful to work with. And I&#8217;d argue that it has remained powerful and only gotten MORE powerful over the years. Regardless of where you put it and how you name things, CSS is THE underlying technology for all styling of HTML on the web. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Presentational vs Semantic Classes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in the day \u201csemantic classes\u201d were all the rage. This was What You Should Do. And the hard line on this appeared to be a push back against people wanting to make \u201cpresentational\u201d classes like \u201cbig-padding\u201d or \u201cfloat-left\u201d or \u201cblue-text\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This kind of stuff, they said, shouldn\u2019t clutter up your markup. The markup describes the structure of the document not its presentation!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Classes should be things like \u201cmain-header\u201d, \u201cwidget-area\u201d, \u201cfooter-credits\u201d. Names that describe what something is, not what it looks like. After all the sidebar could be on the left or the right or at the bottom. You shouldn\u2019t constrain your presentation by what you write in your markup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I always found writing CSS for semantic classes was a bind. Well, not so much writing it, but editing it. Especially other people\u2019s CSS. I remember spending time searching huge CSS files (and later entire directories of SASS files) to try and work out where a class was so that I could tweak the padding on it, only to realise then that this would affect ALL instances of this class and might have unintended knock-on effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wished that I had some kind of permission to add an inline style attribute, or a \u201cbig-padding-top\u201d class to safely tweak just that one instance of this thing in this one place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">BEM, OOCSS, SMACSS and so on<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Various conventions then emerged from some very clever people to try and name your classes and structure your CSS in better ways. These were great. They kept semantics, but allowed you to add contexts and modifiers, inherit properties between classes in an ordered way, and flatten the cascade toprevent styles bleeding from one place to another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clever stuff!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I liked this. But the problem was that anyone involved in the project had to be along for the ride. In an agency this is possible but I\u2019m a freelancer who sometimes works solo and sometimes with other freelancers or agencies, and so I never really fully adopted one of these techniques because each project was different. Yes, they informed the techniques and conventions I used but I found it hard to take them on 100%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Aside: Less and SASS and tooling.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s quickly touch on these. I\u2019m not an early adopter of new things. I\u2019m a cautious semi-early adopter. I picked SASS and was glad I did. I don\u2019t use it in a big way: variables, nesting (not needed so much if you\u2019re full-on BEM), and file includes to break things up all help though. I\u2019m pretty much SASS by default now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the tooling&#8230;THE TOOLING! Yes, it was good. But it came in many forms. And so many people had so many different setups. Again, if you work in one big team and do the same thing everywhere this isn\u2019t so bad. But working in multiple places and often inheriting projects from others made this hard work: what\u2019s the darned build command on THIS project then?!?!? The README.txt became king.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>npm, grunt, gulp, webpack, PostCSS, and so on have not helped in this regard. Yes, tool chains have got way more powerful than they were, but they are also way more complicated!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">And so we come full circle<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So it came to pass that one day I inherited a project that used \u201cTachyons\u201d. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I\u2019m looking at markup with things like <code>class=\"f4 mt3 bt bw1 b\u2014gray br2\"<\/code> and I\u2019m thinking: WHAT?!?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, it turns out, was my first exposure to \u201cfunctional\u201d or \u201c    utility\u201d CSS. This is basically writing styles in the markup, but disguised as CSS classes. Which is, you know, the thing everyone rallied hard against 6 or 7 years ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;whereas everyone can understand <code>style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1.25rem;\"<\/code> etc, Tachyons has its own language that only Tachyons people understand. All, presumably, in the name of saving bytes (a measure which, at this scale, is probably irrelevant).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also&#8230;reading and understanding markup with Tachyons classes in it is horrendous. Just what is this thing? Yes, it\u2019s a large, blue, margin-topped, bottom-bordered THING with white text. But, like, WHAT IS IT?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HTML5 elements can help identify things, of course, as can IDs or components, if that\u2019s your thing. But&#8230;just&#8230;.gah!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I get that you can define your colours and type scales and so on, but I, personally, didn&#8217;t like Tachyons (can you tell?) and it left me along with the project I inherited that used it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Aside: I&#8217;m being somewhat extreme for dramatic effect here. If you use Tachyons and love it then that&#8217;s awesome. If you made Tachyons &#8211; great job, thank you! I, personally didn&#8217;t get on with it at all though and these were my genuine reactions on seeing it.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then Tailwind came on my radar. Tailwind is like Tachyons but seems to be to be substantially more friendly. Mostly its nicer because the class names aren\u2019t all abbreviated beyond readability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people in my industry are raving about it. And I\u2019ve not tried it yet. And one reason is that I\u2019m put off by the very first example in the docs:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"686\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-1024x686.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of TailWind docs showing complicated markup.\" class=\"wp-image-4497\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-1024x686.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-768x514.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-945x633.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender-600x402.jpg 600w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/FullSizeRender.jpg 1519w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I do NOT want my code to look like that. I don\u2019t mean with a picture of <a href=\"https:\/\/adamwathan.me\/\">Adam Wathan<\/a> above it, of course (He&#8217;s great and has made <a href=\"https:\/\/refactoringui.com\/book\">some<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/course.testdrivenlaravel.com\/\">awesome<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fullstackradio.com\/\">stuff<\/a>, by the way!). But this is the exact opposite end of the scale of all the things that were wrong with semantic classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With semantic classes I could see what all the things were, but not how they were styled. With both Tachyons and Tailwind I can see all the styles, but not what the things are!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the first example you find that collecting styles into components with helpful names is encouraged in Tailwind. And this seems like we\u2019re almost in my CSS heaven: I can write <code>&lt;a href=\"button-link\"&gt;<\/code> and have my semantic class or component that says what the thing is but then also easily tweak it for the context it\u2019s in. Yippee!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, so there\u2019s still some unhelpful abbreviation there, but it\u2019s not that bad once you\u2019ve been introduced to the basics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tailwind is \u201cutility first\u201d. You START by writing with just utilities and extract re-usable components where needed.  And in my head I get that creating things with it should be quick, but I\u2019ve seen videos of people working with it and it\u2019s often painful:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I want to increase this font size a little\n<\/li><li>So I\u2019ll inspect it in dev tools and tweak the size until it\u2019s what I want.\n<\/li><li>Then I take the size I want and look it up in my config file to find the class I need to make it that size\n<\/li><li>Then I\u2019ll add the class to my HTML\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t right! CSS and dev tools work beautifully together, and now we have a naming abstraction and a config layer and..ugh&#8230;it just seems like we\u2019ve made things harder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My other beef with Tailwind is tooling. It introduces PostCSS and JavaScript configuration and&#8230;well&#8230;I just don\u2019t want to have to get to grips with these things to write CSS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS with added awesome!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CSS itself has come a long way. We have variables baked in, and Flexbox in pretty much every browser I work with and Grid support growing quickly.  With a good naming convention you don&#8217;t need nesting so much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All we&#8217;re really lacking is includes. But arguably HTTP2 takes care of the problem of having lots of small regular CSS files, and caching and service workers probably help here too. There&#8217;s probably good arguments for lots of small CSS files loaded as and when you need them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think we will soon reach a point where the tooling isn\u2019t necessary. I see a day where I just write CSS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I still need to organise it on large projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSS Heaven<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, in a discussion about exactly these things: CSS, Tailwind and BEM, my Twitter friend Ben posts this (and I note that the whole conversation was interesting and read-worthy):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That\u2019s it. I\u2019m calling it BEU &#8211; block, element, utility!<\/p>&mdash; Ben Furfie (@frontendben) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/frontendben\/status\/1085280423805100032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 15, 2019<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And my mind blows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one has explicitly defined it before, but this is it! This is what I want! Semantically-named, re-usable components with utility modifiers!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with modern day CSS variables we can probably do this, can\u2019t we? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Relatively flat CSS&#8230;\n<\/li><li>&#8230;with built in variables&#8230;\n<\/li><li>&#8230;that needs no toolchain to build.\n<\/li><li>We have re-usable components that let us state what our markup IS, not just what it looks like&#8230;\n<\/li><li>&#8230;but we have utility modifiers in the form of classes we can add sparingly to make adjustments to components to make them fit their context&#8230;\n<\/li><li>&#8230;but without cluttering up our markup with ALL the styles.\n<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben calls this \u201cBEU: Block, element, utility\u201d, which is nice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I call it \u201cSUCSS: Sematics + Utility CSS\u201d, not to spite Ben. Just because it\u2019s funnier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said at the start, I&#8217;m no expert. So help me , CSS gurus. Please tell me why this is wrong. Which bit of component + utility + vanilla CSS is bad here? What wouldn&#8217;t work with this approach?<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "\n<p>In previous jobs, I have worked a fair bit to improve internal communications in work circles &#8211; informally, rather than as part of my specification.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through a combination of hard-won experience and probably <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2015\/07\/highly-sensitive\/\">being a bit sensitive<\/a> to what&#8217;s going on around me and thinking really hard about it, I&#8217;ve gained some useful insight for people wanting to try to help improve communications in their teams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of this advice also applies to building online communities with forums or social media groups too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The key thing to understand is that this problem is not a primarily a technological one, but a cultural\/psychological one.<\/strong> Many people start with &#8220;we need a new app to help us communicate better!&#8221;. But technology abounds, and the real problem is how do you get people to use any tools that you put in place, and keep people USING those tools (whatever they are) without constantly interrupting or annoying them, overloading them, and putting them off using it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some things to think about that come about from looking at the problem in this way:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Will people use a new\/different tool?<\/strong> Or is it easier to just go where they are already at, like in a Facebook group?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chat tools like Slack are great but they get noisy and demanding<\/strong>, encouraging immediacy.  They also focus on the immediate, to the extent that Slack&#8217;s entire business model is based around roping you in with free, real-time communication and then getting you to pay for access to historical conversations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trello is lovely, I like Trello. It works very much like a whiteboard full of post-its that everyone can see.<\/strong> But your team would probably have to be quite active in checking in on it. So <strong>if you are using Trello for comms and collaboration you should maybe have some other channel for prodding people to look at it<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you like Facebook but don&#8217;t want to actually use Facebook then look into Facebook Workplace<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/workplace\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/workplace<\/a> &#8211; it&#8217;s like your organisations own, private Facebook! This is great because most people know how to use Facebook, but you probably don&#8217;t want the whack-a-mole of real-Facebook notifications during the working day. So this keeps it work-only!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don&#8217;t neglect more traditional channels!<\/strong> Email lists\/groups, posters on walls, and instant messages are all effective at reaching out to people. But use these to direct people back to the central tool you use to communicate  and collaborate. A weekly email summing up key points that people need  to know with links back to where they can read more works great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Provide value.<\/strong> People won&#8217;t use a tool if it&#8217;s not up to date, or doesn&#8217;t aid them in their work. Make it useful. Keep information fresh and accurate. And solicit and pay attention to feedback from people to find out how to make the tool more useful for them<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In all cases, this is a people problem and you will need people to help you solve it. <\/strong>So once you have chosen a technology, ensure that you have some kind of community leadership. Maybe recruit others to the cause of better communication and have them as your ambassadors\/champions, so that if someone says &#8220;Where do I tell everyone about this thing?&#8221; or &#8220;Where do I find out about the thing?&#8221; they can get directed to the new communications tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk about the tool in meetings, embed it within the culture of your organisation. Make it THE place to go to communicate. This is key! Nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd and people won&#8217;t use the tool if no one else is using it<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s also, helpful to understand the barriers to communication and communcation styles.<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.andymort.com\/phone-reluctant-introvert\/\">Extroverts and sensitive types may hate using the phone<\/a> or speaking up in a more public forum, so find ways to gently encourage their communication or offer to communicate on their behalf.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding character types and why people behave like they do can be super helpful. Always be skeptical of psychology tests and putting people in boxes, but things like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.16personalities.com\/\">the excellent and mostly free 16 Personalities<\/a> can be helpful in understanding how each other&#8217;s brains work and how that affects communication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting a busy, diverse, distributed, flexi-time mixture of people to communicate is hard work &#8211; but if you can get it to work the benefits are huge! I hope you crack it!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>In previous jobs, I have worked a fair bit to improve internal communications in work circles &#8211; informally, rather than as part of my specification.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through a combination of hard-won experience and probably <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2015\/07\/highly-sensitive\/\">being a bit sensitive<\/a> to what&#8217;s going on around me and thinking really hard about it, I&#8217;ve gained some useful insight for people wanting to try to help improve communications in their teams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of this advice also applies to building online communities with forums or social media groups too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The key thing to understand is that this problem is not a primarily a technological one, but a cultural\/psychological one.<\/strong> Many people start with &#8220;we need a new app to help us communicate better!&#8221;. But technology abounds, and the real problem is how do you get people to use any tools that you put in place, and keep people USING those tools (whatever they are) without constantly interrupting or annoying them, overloading them, and putting them off using it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some things to think about that come about from looking at the problem in this way:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Will people use a new\/different tool?<\/strong> Or is it easier to just go where they are already at, like in a Facebook group?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chat tools like Slack are great but they get noisy and demanding<\/strong>, encouraging immediacy.  They also focus on the immediate, to the extent that Slack&#8217;s entire business model is based around roping you in with free, real-time communication and then getting you to pay for access to historical conversations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trello is lovely, I like Trello. It works very much like a whiteboard full of post-its that everyone can see.<\/strong> But your team would probably have to be quite active in checking in on it. So <strong>if you are using Trello for comms and collaboration you should maybe have some other channel for prodding people to look at it<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you like Facebook but don&#8217;t want to actually use Facebook then look into Facebook Workplace<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/workplace\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/workplace<\/a> &#8211; it&#8217;s like your organisations own, private Facebook! This is great because most people know how to use Facebook, but you probably don&#8217;t want the whack-a-mole of real-Facebook notifications during the working day. So this keeps it work-only!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don&#8217;t neglect more traditional channels!<\/strong> Email lists\/groups, posters on walls, and instant messages are all effective at reaching out to people. But use these to direct people back to the central tool you use to communicate  and collaborate. A weekly email summing up key points that people need  to know with links back to where they can read more works great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Provide value.<\/strong> People won&#8217;t use a tool if it&#8217;s not up to date, or doesn&#8217;t aid them in their work. Make it useful. Keep information fresh and accurate. And solicit and pay attention to feedback from people to find out how to make the tool more useful for them<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In all cases, this is a people problem and you will need people to help you solve it. <\/strong>So once you have chosen a technology, ensure that you have some kind of community leadership. Maybe recruit others to the cause of better communication and have them as your ambassadors\/champions, so that if someone says &#8220;Where do I tell everyone about this thing?&#8221; or &#8220;Where do I find out about the thing?&#8221; they can get directed to the new communications tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk about the tool in meetings, embed it within the culture of your organisation. Make it THE place to go to communicate. This is key! Nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd and people won&#8217;t use the tool if no one else is using it<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s also, helpful to understand the barriers to communication and communcation styles.<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.andymort.com\/phone-reluctant-introvert\/\">Extroverts and sensitive types may hate using the phone<\/a> or speaking up in a more public forum, so find ways to gently encourage their communication or offer to communicate on their behalf.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding character types and why people behave like they do can be super helpful. Always be skeptical of psychology tests and putting people in boxes, but things like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.16personalities.com\/\">the excellent and mostly free 16 Personalities<\/a> can be helpful in understanding how each other&#8217;s brains work and how that affects communication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting a busy, diverse, distributed, flexi-time mixture of people to communicate is hard work &#8211; but if you can get it to work the benefits are huge! I hope you crack it!<\/p>\n",

            },
            "content": {
                "rendered": "\n<p>I heard a thing today which made me realise something about what has happened with WordPress&#8217;s new &#8220;Gutenberg&#8221; editor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been really frustrated that people like me that build websites for others seemed to be a bit left out with both WHAT Gutenberg is and HOW is was delivered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve always known that the new block editor in WordPress is designed to help WordPress compete with website builders like Wix and SquareSpace and Weebly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I had ignored or forgotten was that website builders like those are intended to help people build websites on their own, without small agency owners like me being involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so WordPress, in moving to this model, is actually moving to a space where people like me aren&#8217;t needed. Or at least, to a space where IT APPEARS that people like me aren&#8217;t needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, take the fact that Gutenberg allows someone writing a post or page to change the font size or text colour. People like me are cross about this because we spend time designing sites, and paying attention to details like font sizes and colours that should be consistent across the site. So we&#8217;re frustrated that people will now be able to come along and use text sizes and colours inconsistently and mess up our nice designs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But regular people who want to build a website are probably thinking: &#8220;Woo hoo! I can edit text colour and size, and even change the background colour of a block. I don&#8217;t need to ask my web developer person to do this any more, I can build the site myself!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m not complaining that Gutenberg is taking my work away. That&#8217;s not the point I want to make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also not complaining that Gutenberg is bad. At least, not the IDEA of Gutenberg. I think the idea of a block editor is exactly the right thing. I just think Gutenberg is the WRONG block editor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point I want to make is that making a <em><strong>good<\/strong><\/em> website requires skill, knowledge and experience. The Wix&#8217;s and Weebly&#8217;s give the impression that someone with very little knowledge can, for a few dollars a month, have a beautiful, functional website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to some extent that&#8217;s true. But then I look at the stuff that people make with these tools and it&#8217;s often very poor. And I look at the code that the builder creates, and the speed of the site, and other &#8220;under the bonnet&#8221; technical things, and it turns out that these platforms are really bad at the technology stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg is intended to give this same veneer: you don&#8217;t need someone to help you; you can make a website yourself!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may enable WordPress to compete better with the site builders. To maintain and grow it&#8217;s already-enormous market share. But at what cost?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the cost of annoying many people like me who previously recommended WordPress to people but who are now seriously considering alternatives, or have already jumped ship?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the cost of tricking people into thinking they can build a site by themselves when actually what they need is some help to do it properly?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the cost of raising the bar of what\u2019s needed to develop for WordPress by including React and lots of complicated build processes?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has the project lost its way chasing user numbers rather than focusing on its mission?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A different Gutenberg might have said &#8220;OK, let&#8217;s let Wix and Weebly do their thing, and we&#8217;ll do our thing. They might take some people away from WordPress at first because those tools appear easier. But WE will guide people along a better path.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these thoughts lead me to having a better understanding of why the WordPress governance project has sprung up (best explained here on the <a href=\"https:\/\/wptavern.com\/wpweekly-episode-344-introduction-to-the-wordpress-governance-project\">recent WordPress Weekly podcast<\/a>). Who was making the decisions to chase after these things? Where are the bigger decisions about the direction of the project not documented? Why are some of these processes so opaque?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just opinion, of course. But I do think it was an important realisation to have: WordPress isn\u2019t focussed on agencies and developers right now &#8211; it wants users who can fend for themselves.<\/p>\n",

        "title": "Opinion: WordPress Gutenberg and the responsibility of owning a website",
        "content": "\n<p>I heard a thing today which made me realise something about what has happened with WordPress&#8217;s new &#8220;Gutenberg&#8221; editor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been really frustrated that people like me that build websites for others seemed to be a bit left out with both WHAT Gutenberg is and HOW is was delivered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve always known that the new block editor in WordPress is designed to help WordPress compete with website builders like Wix and SquareSpace and Weebly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I had ignored or forgotten was that website builders like those are intended to help people build websites on their own, without small agency owners like me being involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so WordPress, in moving to this model, is actually moving to a space where people like me aren&#8217;t needed. Or at least, to a space where IT APPEARS that people like me aren&#8217;t needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, take the fact that Gutenberg allows someone writing a post or page to change the font size or text colour. People like me are cross about this because we spend time designing sites, and paying attention to details like font sizes and colours that should be consistent across the site. So we&#8217;re frustrated that people will now be able to come along and use text sizes and colours inconsistently and mess up our nice designs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But regular people who want to build a website are probably thinking: &#8220;Woo hoo! I can edit text colour and size, and even change the background colour of a block. I don&#8217;t need to ask my web developer person to do this any more, I can build the site myself!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m not complaining that Gutenberg is taking my work away. That&#8217;s not the point I want to make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also not complaining that Gutenberg is bad. At least, not the IDEA of Gutenberg. I think the idea of a block editor is exactly the right thing. I just think Gutenberg is the WRONG block editor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point I want to make is that making a <em><strong>good<\/strong><\/em> website requires skill, knowledge and experience. The Wix&#8217;s and Weebly&#8217;s give the impression that someone with very little knowledge can, for a few dollars a month, have a beautiful, functional website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to some extent that&#8217;s true. But then I look at the stuff that people make with these tools and it&#8217;s often very poor. And I look at the code that the builder creates, and the speed of the site, and other &#8220;under the bonnet&#8221; technical things, and it turns out that these platforms are really bad at the technology stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg is intended to give this same veneer: you don&#8217;t need someone to help you; you can make a website yourself!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may enable WordPress to compete better with the site builders. To maintain and grow it&#8217;s already-enormous market share. But at what cost?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the cost of annoying many people like me who previously recommended WordPress to people but who are now seriously considering alternatives, or have already jumped ship?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the cost of tricking people into thinking they can build a site by themselves when actually what they need is some help to do it properly?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the cost of raising the bar of what\u2019s needed to develop for WordPress by including React and lots of complicated build processes?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has the project lost its way chasing user numbers rather than focusing on its mission?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A different Gutenberg might have said &#8220;OK, let&#8217;s let Wix and Weebly do their thing, and we&#8217;ll do our thing. They might take some people away from WordPress at first because those tools appear easier. But WE will guide people along a better path.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these thoughts lead me to having a better understanding of why the WordPress governance project has sprung up (best explained here on the <a href=\"https:\/\/wptavern.com\/wpweekly-episode-344-introduction-to-the-wordpress-governance-project\">recent WordPress Weekly podcast<\/a>). Who was making the decisions to chase after these things? Where are the bigger decisions about the direction of the project not documented? Why are some of these processes so opaque?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just opinion, of course. But I do think it was an important realisation to have: WordPress isn\u2019t focussed on agencies and developers right now &#8211; it wants users who can fend for themselves.<\/p>\n",

We&#8217;re about to start a whole new routine with my youngest starting pre-school and doing more hours there than she was in nursery, my wife taking on an extra half day and me&#8230;am I working more or just moving hours around? I can&#8217;t tell.

It&#8217;s a couple of pages in a WordPress page-builder but has just been hanging around for so long. Smaller projects with no deadline often get put back and back. I&#8217;m going to try and stop taking them on.<\/li><li>More helping my friends at <a href=\"https:\/\/handsup.co.uk\">Hands Up<\/a> with last minute project snags on a custom WordPress build. There&#8217;s been some tricky issues with redirects that have been pretty hard to debug.<\/li><li>Another small, slow-burning project has had some good progress and I met the client this week to talk them through. They&#8217;re really happy with things and we have just a few final tasks to get through before we may be able to &#8220;go live&#8221;! It was wonderful seeing them use what I made and enjoying the benefits the re-work of their old website has brought.<\/li><li>Helping a client fix some SPF records to fix outgoing mail. SPF comes up SO often. I&#8217;m sure many have documented it, but I need to write my own guide.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/improving-internal-communications-its-a-people-problem\/\">Improving internal communications \u2013 it\u2019s a people problem\u2026<\/a>: This was a comment in a Facebook group that was blog-post worthy once tidied up a bit.

Anyway, it&#8217;s crazy, and it starts today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week&#8217;s snow messed things up a little with a school closure on Friday too. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Still reviewing spec&#8217;s and working up a proposal for a new Laravel project. Keen to get going on this one if I can.<\/li><li>Finally got a long-outstanding, but really small project for a friend-of-a-friend live. It&#8217;s a couple of pages in a WordPress page-builder but has just been hanging around for so long. Smaller projects with no deadline often get put back and back. I&#8217;m going to try and stop taking them on.<\/li><li>More helping my friends at <a href=\"https:\/\/handsup.co.uk\">Hands Up<\/a> with last minute project snags on a custom WordPress build. There&#8217;s been some tricky issues with redirects that have been pretty hard to debug.<\/li><li>Another small, slow-burning project has had some good progress and I met the client this week to talk them through. They&#8217;re really happy with things and we have just a few final tasks to get through before we may be able to &#8220;go live&#8221;! It was wonderful seeing them use what I made and enjoying the benefits the re-work of their old website has brought.<\/li><li>Helping a client fix some SPF records to fix outgoing mail. SPF comes up SO often. I&#8217;m sure many have documented it, but I need to write my own guide.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/improving-internal-communications-its-a-people-problem\/\">Improving internal communications \u2013 it\u2019s a people problem\u2026<\/a>: This was a comment in a Facebook group that was blog-post worthy once tidied up a bit.

                "rendered": "\n<p>I&#8217;ve become pretty fed up with using build tools for small web projects. So I&#8217;m attempting to build a WordPress theme with no build tool using only &#8220;vanilla&#8221; CSS and JS. Here&#8217;s some initial thoughts I&#8217;ve had after getting started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are you doing and why?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m attempting to build a new custom theme for my own blog (yes, this one you are reading), and I&#8217;m doing it with no npm, grunt, gulp, parcel.js, or anything. It&#8217;s zero config because there&#8217;s nothing to configure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m starting with the <a href=\"http:\/\/underscores.me\/\">_s<\/a> (&#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/underscores.me\/\">Underscores<\/a>&#8220;) starter theme, just to get me off the starting blocks with something, but with the &#8220;SASSify&#8221; option turned off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m actually basing it on my own fork of Underscores that I&#8217;ve called oiko_s &#8211; this previously had a simple webpack setup added with SASS, Babel transpilation, LiveReload and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But actually, as I mention in <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/my-new-css-framework-sucss\/\">my post about my silly SUCSS idea<\/a>, I&#8217;m wondering if modern CSS and JS that now has good browser support (CSS variables, HTTP2, ES6, etc) allows us to write good, clean front-end code for small projects with no build process at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What have you found so far?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I&#8217;m PROBABLY figuring out why people build frameworks. A few things have come up, even in the very early days of working like this, that make me think it won&#8217;t work. But I also have some optimism that I can make this work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A large, single CSS file is hard to work with<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I should really have seen this coming, but Underscores without SASS has one big CSS file and this is hard to work with.  It has sections and a table of contents, but it feels like it needs to be properly broken down OR that some conventions or editor\/IDE tool is needed to help efficiently navigate it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also considered that HTTP2 (you&#8217;re all using HTTPS and HTTP2, right?) is much more efficient at downloading lots of small files, so maybe I can just break it up into lots of smaller files and use a loop in my PHP to inject them into the HTML? I could even defer loading of non-critical CSS more easily this way. Hmm&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Live-reloaders are nice<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m missing this. I think I can do it using BrowserSync proxying or something that I can run from npm globally, rather than having it local. There will be a way. But I&#8217;m without it for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Internet Explorer<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I would really like to support IE11 if I can. There are polyfills of sorts for some things I will probably use, but without them the site will NOT look right. CSS variables in particular are an issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I find myself wondering if I should but a notice up saying &#8220;You&#8217;re not getting the best experience in IE&#8221; or something. Don&#8217;t people rally against this? Or is this an acceptable kind of notice to display these days, especially if you&#8217;re working WITH modern web standards, not against them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Forging ahead<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I&#8217;ve made a start, and I&#8217;m happy with how it is. There are issues to sort out and things need to be done to improve the workflow. But I&#8217;m happy with the direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch this space for more!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I&#8217;ve become pretty fed up with using build tools for small web projects. So I&#8217;m attempting to build a WordPress theme with no build tool using only &#8220;vanilla&#8221; CSS and JS. Here&#8217;s some initial thoughts I&#8217;ve had after getting started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are you doing and why?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m attempting to build a new custom theme for my own blog (yes, this one you are reading), and I&#8217;m doing it with no npm, grunt, gulp, parcel.js, or anything. It&#8217;s zero config because there&#8217;s nothing to configure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m starting with the <a href=\"http:\/\/underscores.me\/\">_s<\/a> (&#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/underscores.me\/\">Underscores<\/a>&#8220;) starter theme, just to get me off the starting blocks with something, but with the &#8220;SASSify&#8221; option turned off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m actually basing it on my own fork of Underscores that I&#8217;ve called oiko_s &#8211; this previously had a simple webpack setup added with SASS, Babel transpilation, LiveReload and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But actually, as I mention in <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/my-new-css-framework-sucss\/\">my post about my silly SUCSS idea<\/a>, I&#8217;m wondering if modern CSS and JS that now has good browser support (CSS variables, HTTP2, ES6, etc) allows us to write good, clean front-end code for small projects with no build process at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What have you found so far?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I&#8217;m PROBABLY figuring out why people build frameworks. A few things have come up, even in the very early days of working like this, that make me think it won&#8217;t work. But I also have some optimism that I can make this work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A large, single CSS file is hard to work with<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I should really have seen this coming, but Underscores without SASS has one big CSS file and this is hard to work with.  It has sections and a table of contents, but it feels like it needs to be properly broken down OR that some conventions or editor\/IDE tool is needed to help efficiently navigate it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also considered that HTTP2 (you&#8217;re all using HTTPS and HTTP2, right?) is much more efficient at downloading lots of small files, so maybe I can just break it up into lots of smaller files and use a loop in my PHP to inject them into the HTML? I could even defer loading of non-critical CSS more easily this way. Hmm&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Live-reloaders are nice<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m missing this. I think I can do it using BrowserSync proxying or something that I can run from npm globally, rather than having it local. There will be a way. But I&#8217;m without it for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Internet Explorer<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I would really like to support IE11 if I can. There are polyfills of sorts for some things I will probably use, but without them the site will NOT look right. CSS variables in particular are an issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I find myself wondering if I should but a notice up saying &#8220;You&#8217;re not getting the best experience in IE&#8221; or something. Don&#8217;t people rally against this? Or is this an acceptable kind of notice to display these days, especially if you&#8217;re working WITH modern web standards, not against them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Forging ahead<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I&#8217;ve made a start, and I&#8217;m happy with how it is. There are issues to sort out and things need to be done to improve the workflow. But I&#8217;m happy with the direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch this space for more!<\/p>\n",

This site was built by a big design agency using <a href=\"https:\/\/roots.io\/bedrock\/\">Bedrock<\/a> (or some kind of fork of it), which is total overkill for something this size. Bedrock is a composer-based WordPress environment where updates are all manual so someone needs to update it. But the agency then seems to have uploaded this site to a server and left it to get old. Extracting this site from Bedrock to make it easier to manage has been a challenge and this week I learned that WordPress prevents auto-updates if there is a <code>.git<\/code> folder\/directory that makes it look like WordPress is version controlled.

        "content": "\n<p>Well, phew! The snow melted quickly and we got straight into the first week of the new routine. Though it turns out there is no such thing as a &#8220;normal&#8221; week in our family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Work-wise some small projects have been nudged along and I&#8217;ve had interesting conversations about some new ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Specs for the new Laravel project progressed and draft proposal was made. I need to work up the final proposal still but then we should get going quickly, I hope.<\/li><li>There were quite a lot of calls about new things, large and small! There are two projects on the go which are squeezing databases of stuff into WordPress. I had a play with <a href=\"https:\/\/airtable.com\/\">AirTable<\/a> to see if that would fit well but their API &#8211; though clever &#8211; is quite limited.<\/li><li>I spent more time on complicated slug\/URL\/redirect issues &#8211; this was really tricky, but I think we&#8217;ve nailed it now.<\/li><li>I did some work on a small charity&#8217;s site, making some changes for them and trying to work out why WordPress wouldn&#8217;t do automatic security updates. This site was built by a big design agency using <a href=\"https:\/\/roots.io\/bedrock\/\">Bedrock<\/a> (or some kind of fork of it), which is total overkill for something this size. Bedrock is a composer-based WordPress environment where updates are all manual so someone needs to update it. But the agency then seems to have uploaded this site to a server and left it to get old. Extracting this site from Bedrock to make it easier to manage has been a challenge and this week I learned that WordPress prevents auto-updates if there is a <code>.git<\/code> folder\/directory that makes it look like WordPress is version controlled. ARGH!<\/li><li>I had a REALLY interesting call about a REALLY interesting future project that may or may not happen.<\/li><li>I had a stupid idea and this lead me to start some initial work on a new theme for my personal website.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Nothing posted last week.

So here I am catching up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started, finished and nudged along a bunch of small thing this week, and progressed the early stages of some larger things that are coming up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Wednesday I tried out the new co-working space in Swindon called &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theworkshed.co.uk\/\">The Workshed<\/a>&#8221; &#8211; they&#8217;re doing a great three-months-for-the-price-of-one offer that I may take them up on to try it out. Though I found the environment quite visually noisy and distracting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Friday was an ACE day where I actually feel I totally nailed my productivity. Hoping for more of this in the coming weeks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>My new Laravel project is signed off and I&#8217;ll commence work on that next week (w\/c 18th) and really get stuck in in March.<\/li><li>I started and finished a small WordPress plugin development job that involved postcode lookups. Postcodes &#8211; like dates &#8211; are trickier than they seem!<\/li><li>I nudged along a site migration to new hosting that should be simple but involves 6 parties (old IT company, new IT company, new hosting company, ultimate client, intermediary consultant and me!). Migrations &#8211; like dates &#8211; are trickier than they seem!I had a REALLY interesting call about a REALLY interesting future project that may or may not happen.<\/li><li>Started work on an interesting piece of WordPress work that will involve a small amount of front-end work, a hefty amount of back-end work, and some data-import work. The data here is pretty simple &#8211; it&#8217;s two custom post types and a theoretical &#8220;pivot&#8221; table. But I&#8217;m going to have to find the best way to get it into WordPress:<ul><li>ACF meta using repeater fields? (With the issue that repeater fields put numbers in the <code>meta_key<\/code>s which defeats the indexing if I do a wild-carded search and makes queried inefficient)<\/li><li>Standard meta but building my own UI (Thinking about it, this won&#8217;t actually work because there&#8217;s TWO bits of data for each entry&#8230;hmm)<\/li><li>A custom pivot table &#8211; which I hate doing in WordPress. Custom tables are painful and feel out of place. You have to build your own abstractions for them or use packages that are probably overkill for this kind of application.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>I think I&#8217;m going with the custom table option.

        "content": "\n<p>This week note is a bit late. It&#8217;s been half-term this week so I&#8217;ve been working limited hours and haven&#8217;t had time for niceties like journalling! So here I am catching up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started, finished and nudged along a bunch of small thing this week, and progressed the early stages of some larger things that are coming up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Wednesday I tried out the new co-working space in Swindon called &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theworkshed.co.uk\/\">The Workshed<\/a>&#8221; &#8211; they&#8217;re doing a great three-months-for-the-price-of-one offer that I may take them up on to try it out. Though I found the environment quite visually noisy and distracting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Friday was an ACE day where I actually feel I totally nailed my productivity. Hoping for more of this in the coming weeks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>My new Laravel project is signed off and I&#8217;ll commence work on that next week (w\/c 18th) and really get stuck in in March.<\/li><li>I started and finished a small WordPress plugin development job that involved postcode lookups. Postcodes &#8211; like dates &#8211; are trickier than they seem!<\/li><li>I nudged along a site migration to new hosting that should be simple but involves 6 parties (old IT company, new IT company, new hosting company, ultimate client, intermediary consultant and me!). Migrations &#8211; like dates &#8211; are trickier than they seem!I had a REALLY interesting call about a REALLY interesting future project that may or may not happen.<\/li><li>Started work on an interesting piece of WordPress work that will involve a small amount of front-end work, a hefty amount of back-end work, and some data-import work. The data here is pretty simple &#8211; it&#8217;s two custom post types and a theoretical &#8220;pivot&#8221; table. But I&#8217;m going to have to find the best way to get it into WordPress:<ul><li>ACF meta using repeater fields? (With the issue that repeater fields put numbers in the <code>meta_key<\/code>s which defeats the indexing if I do a wild-carded search and makes queried inefficient)<\/li><li>Standard meta but building my own UI (Thinking about it, this won&#8217;t actually work because there&#8217;s TWO bits of data for each entry&#8230;hmm)<\/li><li>A custom pivot table &#8211; which I hate doing in WordPress. Custom tables are painful and feel out of place. You have to build your own abstractions for them or use packages that are probably overkill for this kind of application.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>I think I&#8217;m going with the custom table option. But this actually-very-simple case highlights where WordPress can quite quickly get stuck with even simple tasks beyond simple publishing.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/02\/going-vanilla-initial-thoughts-on-building-a-theme-with-no-build-tools\/\">Going Vanilla &#8211; initial thoughts on building a theme with no build tools<\/a>: I&#8217;m having a go at building my own theme for my personal blog here.

Here&#8217;s my initial thoughts on how it&#8217;s gone!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pins: things I read and remembered<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/laravelcoreadventures.com\/\">Laravel Core Adventures &#8211; Home<\/a> &#8211; Interesting (free!) videos diving into the Laravel core code.<\/li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/wpcomplete.co\/?mc_cid=2118ecdd7d&amp;mc_eid=74be526996\">WPComplete<\/a> &#8211; Good-looking plugin that tracks completed items in courses in WordPress.<\/li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mozdevs\/cssremedy\" target=\"_blank\">cssremedy<\/a> &#8211; A modern take on the CSS reset, but one that sets sensible browser defaults for modern CSS use &#8211; in early development<\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/rachievee.com\/escaping-wordpress-template-functions\/\">Escaping WordPress Template Functions &#8211; To do or not to do?<\/a> &#8211; I asked in a Slack channel this week: &#8220;Do any WordPress functions do escaping for me?
