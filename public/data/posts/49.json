Does he want a high-five?\u00a0 What should I do?<\/p>\n<p>No time to change my mind now&#8230;I&#8217;m going.\u00a0 I&#8217;ll give a cheery &#8220;Thanks mate&#8221; as I go past.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Thanks mate!!!!!!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Hang on.\u00a0 What WAS he doing?\u00a0 I know I&#8217;ll look back.<\/p>\n<p>CRIKEY!!! He&#8217;s just completed a right turn into that field.\u00a0 I could have been run down!!!<\/p>\n<p>Oo-err.<\/p>\n<p>In hindsight, the poor tractor driver did exactly the right thing and gave the clearest possible signal that he could.\u00a0 I simply didn&#8217;t get it.\u00a0 I&#8217;m not used to seeing hand signals from vehicles, and I&#8217;m not used to seeing vehicles turn right where there&#8217;s nowhere to turn into.<\/p>\n<p>Still, I&#8217;m safe, and I&#8217;ve learned something.<\/p>\n<p>Stupid cyclists!!!<\/p>\n",

Does he want a high-five?\u00a0 What should I do?<\/p>\n<p>No time to change my mind now&#8230;I&#8217;m going.\u00a0 I&#8217;ll give a cheery &#8220;Thanks mate&#8221; as I go past.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Thanks mate!!!!!!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Hang on.\u00a0 What WAS he doing?\u00a0 I know I&#8217;ll look back.<\/p>\n<p>CRIKEY!!! He&#8217;s just completed a right turn into that field.\u00a0 I could have been run down!!!<\/p>\n<p>Oo-err.<\/p>\n<p>In hindsight, the poor tractor driver did exactly the right thing and gave the clearest possible signal that he could.\u00a0 I simply didn&#8217;t get it.\u00a0 I&#8217;m not used to seeing hand signals from vehicles, and I&#8217;m not used to seeing vehicles turn right where there&#8217;s nowhere to turn into.<\/p>\n<p>Still, I&#8217;m safe, and I&#8217;ve learned something.<\/p>\n<p>Stupid cyclists!!!<\/p>\n",

Despite being a leftie, if given the choice I think I&#8217;d vote Cameron!<\/p>\n<h3>So who to vote for<\/h3>\n<p>But, no&#8230;I can&#8217;t bring myself to vote Tory.\u00a0 The expenses stuff has just reinforced that they&#8217;re mostly rich people who don&#8217;t have a clue about the real world.<\/p>\n<p>I probably should vote Labour, but I think the party is in disarray and I can&#8217;t bring myself to do that either.<\/p>\n<p>BNP and UKIP are definite no-go areas.\u00a0 So of the well-known parties I&#8217;m left with Lib Dems and Greens.<\/p>\n<p>Both of which are quite appealing!<\/p>\n<h3>So&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>Of course, I&#8217;m not saying what I decided.\u00a0 I DID vote though, I think it&#8217;s hugely important to be a part of the political process.\u00a0 I shall be making sure my elected representatives do represent me too by writing and expressing my views.<\/p>\n<p>And I shall be praying.\u00a0 Our leaders need any help they can get right now!<\/p>\n",

Despite being a leftie, if given the choice I think I&#8217;d vote Cameron!<\/p>\n<h3>So who to vote for<\/h3>\n<p>But, no&#8230;I can&#8217;t bring myself to vote Tory.\u00a0 The expenses stuff has just reinforced that they&#8217;re mostly rich people who don&#8217;t have a clue about the real world.<\/p>\n<p>I probably should vote Labour, but I think the party is in disarray and I can&#8217;t bring myself to do that either.<\/p>\n<p>BNP and UKIP are definite no-go areas.\u00a0 So of the well-known parties I&#8217;m left with Lib Dems and Greens.<\/p>\n<p>Both of which are quite appealing!<\/p>\n<h3>So&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>Of course, I&#8217;m not saying what I decided.\u00a0 I DID vote though, I think it&#8217;s hugely important to be a part of the political process.\u00a0 I shall be making sure my elected representatives do represent me too by writing and expressing my views.<\/p>\n<p>And I shall be praying.\u00a0 Our leaders need any help they can get right now!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>It&#8217;s with some trepidation that I approach writing an article about my church mens&#8217; walking weekend.\u00a0 There are so many traps to fall into.\u00a0 Worn out cliches about men in caves and male bonding.\u00a0 Stereotypes of football-loving and beer-swigging blokes.\u00a0 And the risk of appearing sexist as I try to explain my way around the differences between men and women.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve decided to avoid trying to answer the question I&#8217;ve been asked so many times&#8230;&#8221;Why is it men only?&#8221;\u00a0 Let&#8217;s just start with the fact that, once a year, the men, and only the men, of our church are invited to head off together for a weekend of walking, eating and socialising.<\/p>\n<p>And, despite loving the outdoors, I&#8217;ve managed to miss this event for as long as I&#8217;ve been at the church.\u00a0 So, as soon as I learned the date of this years weekend I was booked on, and nothing was going to stop me.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Day 1<\/h3>\n<p>The early start came at the end of a long week but I was up and out of the door and looking forward to arriving in Devon for our first trek.<\/p>\n<p>We convened at the services on the way for a much needed coffee and some introductions before proceeding to Shipley Bridge for a days walking on Dartmoor.\u00a0 The walk started with a picturesque rise up a pretty valley with a sparkling, bubbling stream and we quickly lost the two budding photographers in the group.<\/p>\n<p>They soon caught us up again but their hobby was just one example of what was great about the weekend; though us men do have a lot in common, there was great diversity in the group.\u00a0 I spoke to chemists, martial arts instructors, magistrates, accountants, and several ordained ministers (all, bizarrely called David) and what a wealth of interests, wit and wisdom.\u00a0 It was great to get introduced to some friends of friends who had come along and to get to know better some people from USBC.\u00a0 There was rarely a dull moment.<\/p>\n<p>The highlight of the day was surely Tim&#8217;s lunchtime &#8220;dive&#8221; to retrieve a camera lens filter from the bottom of the river.\u00a0 Quite how it got there and why someone with a longer arm didn&#8217;t help out I don&#8217;t recall.<\/p>\n<p>After about 8 miles or so we were back at the cars and a short drive took us to the beautiful town of Salcombe.\u00a0 The Youth Hostel we were staying in was up a windy road in a building shared with a National Trust property.\u00a0 It was a great location with excellent views and I promptly chose a bed with a sea view.<\/p>\n<p>Now you might think that this sounds like an out-of-the-way, remote, beautiful location and that with all the peace and quiet, sea air, and a hard day&#8217;s walking behind us, we&#8217;d have a great night&#8217;s sleep.\u00a0 But noooooo.\u00a0 It soon became apparent that some of the party were in training for the 2012 Olympic snoring team.\u00a0 Rumour has it that I even took my duvet and de-camped to a sofa in the hostel&#8217;s lounge &#8211; much to the surprise of some children who wanted to watch the TV early the next morning.<\/p>\n<h3>Day 2<\/h3>\n<p>We awoke to glorious sunshine over the south Devon coast.\u00a0 The YHA put on a plentiful breakfast and did a good trade in ear plugs.\u00a0 We congregated with our rucksacks and began day 2.<\/p>\n<p>The walk was west along the south-west coast path to Hope (this is the name of the town, in case you were wondering) and then back, inland through Malborough, to Salcombe.<\/p>\n<p>I confess that I don&#8217;t remember much of the walk.\u00a0 The weather was glorious, the scenery spectacular, the conversation interesting, and racing the youngest of the group uphill extremely exhausting.\u00a0 Mental note: don&#8217;t try that again.\u00a0 Another mental note &#8211; don&#8217;t ever enter a competition with Steve&#8230;he&#8217;s a blatant cheat!<\/p>\n<p>We stopped for lunch in Hope Bay, a few popped to the pub briefly, and some others got lost and needed rounding up.<\/p>\n<p>The walk back wasn&#8217;t quite so interesting, though we saw lots of sheep and I got to hear what an abomination bungalows are.\u00a0 We were all quite glad to get back to the hostel for a cup of coffee.<\/p>\n<p>It was at around this point that someone started talking about 4-dimensional objects and I got dragged into giving a science lesson convering some of the trickier aspects of physics.\u00a0 An experience that has stuck with me.\u00a0 (Note to men: You all know about the theory of relativity now, so I&#8217;ll be preparing next years lesson on quantum physics!)<\/p>\n<p>Dinner was reasonable.\u00a0 After Buttermere YHA, my hopes for the hostel were a little high and probably not quite met.\u00a0 The evening ended with quizes, and games and I learned to play &#8220;Bucket King&#8221;&#8230;ask Tim if you REALLY want to know.<\/p>\n<p>The second night&#8217;s sleep was much better &#8211; I reckon most didn&#8217;t have the energy for snoring!<\/p>\n<h3>Day 3<\/h3>\n<p>Mixing it up a little, Sunday&#8217;s trip was across Salcome Estuary on a small ferry.\u00a0 The walking was slightly less energetic, and we explored the sandy beach and watched small dinghy&#8217;s racing.<\/p>\n<p>We gathered on a small grassy mound and were led in some devotions, songs, prayers and a simple service of communion.\u00a0 I confess that I was slightly self-concious, but it was good to be praising God in the open air on such a glorious day.<\/p>\n<p>We walked, east this time, round the coastal path and had lunch on a beautiful bay where some even unexpectedly indulged in a little swim.\u00a0 I&#8217;m hoping that someone brings a bigger towel next year, for the sake of anyone who was looking on!<\/p>\n<p>I was sad to leave that cove and start the final part of our expedition, but the weekened was drawing to a close.<\/p>\n<p>The walk back seemed long and slow, but we eventually arrived back at the cars.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d had a thoroughly enjoyable weekend with some great people, making new friends, and exploring the beautiful south coast of England.\u00a0 I was tired but refreshed.\u00a0 And already looking forward to next year&#8217;s trip!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>It&#8217;s with some trepidation that I approach writing an article about my church mens&#8217; walking weekend.\u00a0 There are so many traps to fall into.\u00a0 Worn out cliches about men in caves and male bonding.\u00a0 Stereotypes of football-loving and beer-swigging blokes.\u00a0 And the risk of appearing sexist as I try to explain my way around the differences between men and women.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve decided to avoid trying to answer the question I&#8217;ve been asked so many times&#8230;&#8221;Why is it men only?&#8221;\u00a0 Let&#8217;s just start with the fact that, once a year, the men, and only the men, of our church are invited to head off together for a weekend of walking, eating and socialising.<\/p>\n<p>And, despite loving the outdoors, I&#8217;ve managed to miss this event for as long as I&#8217;ve been at the church.\u00a0 So, as soon as I learned the date of this years weekend I was booked on, and nothing was going to stop me.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Day 1<\/h3>\n<p>The early start came at the end of a long week but I was up and out of the door and looking forward to arriving in Devon for our first trek.<\/p>\n<p>We convened at the services on the way for a much needed coffee and some introductions before proceeding to Shipley Bridge for a days walking on Dartmoor.\u00a0 The walk started with a picturesque rise up a pretty valley with a sparkling, bubbling stream and we quickly lost the two budding photographers in the group.<\/p>\n<p>They soon caught us up again but their hobby was just one example of what was great about the weekend; though us men do have a lot in common, there was great diversity in the group.\u00a0 I spoke to chemists, martial arts instructors, magistrates, accountants, and several ordained ministers (all, bizarrely called David) and what a wealth of interests, wit and wisdom.\u00a0 It was great to get introduced to some friends of friends who had come along and to get to know better some people from USBC.\u00a0 There was rarely a dull moment.<\/p>\n<p>The highlight of the day was surely Tim&#8217;s lunchtime &#8220;dive&#8221; to retrieve a camera lens filter from the bottom of the river.\u00a0 Quite how it got there and why someone with a longer arm didn&#8217;t help out I don&#8217;t recall.<\/p>\n<p>After about 8 miles or so we were back at the cars and a short drive took us to the beautiful town of Salcombe.\u00a0 The Youth Hostel we were staying in was up a windy road in a building shared with a National Trust property.\u00a0 It was a great location with excellent views and I promptly chose a bed with a sea view.<\/p>\n<p>Now you might think that this sounds like an out-of-the-way, remote, beautiful location and that with all the peace and quiet, sea air, and a hard day&#8217;s walking behind us, we&#8217;d have a great night&#8217;s sleep.\u00a0 But noooooo.\u00a0 It soon became apparent that some of the party were in training for the 2012 Olympic snoring team.\u00a0 Rumour has it that I even took my duvet and de-camped to a sofa in the hostel&#8217;s lounge &#8211; much to the surprise of some children who wanted to watch the TV early the next morning.<\/p>\n<h3>Day 2<\/h3>\n<p>We awoke to glorious sunshine over the south Devon coast.\u00a0 The YHA put on a plentiful breakfast and did a good trade in ear plugs.\u00a0 We congregated with our rucksacks and began day 2.<\/p>\n<p>The walk was west along the south-west coast path to Hope (this is the name of the town, in case you were wondering) and then back, inland through Malborough, to Salcombe.<\/p>\n<p>I confess that I don&#8217;t remember much of the walk.\u00a0 The weather was glorious, the scenery spectacular, the conversation interesting, and racing the youngest of the group uphill extremely exhausting.\u00a0 Mental note: don&#8217;t try that again.\u00a0 Another mental note &#8211; don&#8217;t ever enter a competition with Steve&#8230;he&#8217;s a blatant cheat!<\/p>\n<p>We stopped for lunch in Hope Bay, a few popped to the pub briefly, and some others got lost and needed rounding up.<\/p>\n<p>The walk back wasn&#8217;t quite so interesting, though we saw lots of sheep and I got to hear what an abomination bungalows are.\u00a0 We were all quite glad to get back to the hostel for a cup of coffee.<\/p>\n<p>It was at around this point that someone started talking about 4-dimensional objects and I got dragged into giving a science lesson convering some of the trickier aspects of physics.\u00a0 An experience that has stuck with me.\u00a0 (Note to men: You all know about the theory of relativity now, so I&#8217;ll be preparing next years lesson on quantum physics!)<\/p>\n<p>Dinner was reasonable.\u00a0 After Buttermere YHA, my hopes for the hostel were a little high and probably not quite met.\u00a0 The evening ended with quizes, and games and I learned to play &#8220;Bucket King&#8221;&#8230;ask Tim if you REALLY want to know.<\/p>\n<p>The second night&#8217;s sleep was much better &#8211; I reckon most didn&#8217;t have the energy for snoring!<\/p>\n<h3>Day 3<\/h3>\n<p>Mixing it up a little, Sunday&#8217;s trip was across Salcome Estuary on a small ferry.\u00a0 The walking was slightly less energetic, and we explored the sandy beach and watched small dinghy&#8217;s racing.<\/p>\n<p>We gathered on a small grassy mound and were led in some devotions, songs, prayers and a simple service of communion.\u00a0 I confess that I was slightly self-concious, but it was good to be praising God in the open air on such a glorious day.<\/p>\n<p>We walked, east this time, round the coastal path and had lunch on a beautiful bay where some even unexpectedly indulged in a little swim.\u00a0 I&#8217;m hoping that someone brings a bigger towel next year, for the sake of anyone who was looking on!<\/p>\n<p>I was sad to leave that cove and start the final part of our expedition, but the weekened was drawing to a close.<\/p>\n<p>The walk back seemed long and slow, but we eventually arrived back at the cars.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d had a thoroughly enjoyable weekend with some great people, making new friends, and exploring the beautiful south coast of England.\u00a0 I was tired but refreshed.\u00a0 And already looking forward to next year&#8217;s trip!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>[If this gets picked up in the feed, sorry!\u00a0 This was the last post in the series and it never properly got finished.\u00a0 Better late than never.]<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve said a bit about what Twitter is and how it can be used.\u00a0 This final post acknowledges that, thought Twitter is very useful for certain things (and not very useful for a lot of other things), that occasional usefulness can come at a price&#8230;the world can follow you and see what you are saying\/thinking\/doing.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the guidelines that I stick to when thinking about how I use Twitter.<\/p>\n<h3>Openness<\/h3>\n<p>I guess the key here is that the world is watching, and you shouldn&#8217;t say anything that you wouldn&#8217;t mind being seen by anyone, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a friend or relative;<\/li>\n<li>a colleague or employer (or a former or potential employer);<\/li>\n<li>the press!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Most of the interesting people I follow talk about a specialist subject like cycling in an impersonal way.\u00a0 Either that or they share fairly trivial stuff about their lives.<\/p>\n<p>If it really comes to it you can &#8220;go private&#8221; (so you need to authorise people to follow you), and don&#8217;t forget there&#8217;s a delete button if you Tweet something you probably shouldn&#8217;t have.<\/p>\n<h3>Real names and searches<\/h3>\n<p>Remember that your username and tweets can be picked up by searches and other tools too!\u00a0 Do you want people Googling your name to find you on Twitter and subsequently everything you&#8217;ve ever Tweeted?<\/p>\n<p>I, personally, am slightly enigmatic in my online presence, choosing not to reveal my real name.\u00a0 Perhaps you&#8217;re happy with everything public, but you should at least think if that&#8217;s actually the case.<\/p>\n<h3>Followers<\/h3>\n<p>Some people think that follower numbers are the key.\u00a0 The more followers you have the more popular you are.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t buy this at all and would MUCH rather go for quality over quantity.\u00a0 But if you may be wanting to promote yourself or an organisation, in which case quantity is good!<\/p>\n<p>Even if your Tweets are public, Twitter will email you when you get a new follower and this is quite handy if you&#8217;re managing your followers.<\/p>\n<p>And managing followers can be important.\u00a0 Like email, Twitter is subject to &#8220;spam&#8221; or junk messages and followers and there are people you may want to &#8220;block&#8221; from following you.\u00a0 This is easily done with the click of a button.<\/p>\n<p>Spam was a real problem in Twitter&#8217;s early days, but it&#8217;s more under control now.\u00a0 That&#8217;s not to say that it still doesn&#8217;t exist and can be annoying.<\/p>\n<h3>Closing thoughts<\/h3>\n<p>Some people deride Twitter for being a waste of time and full of irrelevant nonsense.\u00a0 I can understand that people think this but I think it&#8217;s unfair of them to dismiss it so easily.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve found it to be quite useful in sharing information both from my locality and with common interests.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve found good tyre suppliers, made useful links with charitable organisations, been inspired by fellow cyclists and Christians, and I use it to keep up to date with a few friends too.<\/p>\n<p>I find it simpler and easier to use than Facebook, and, in some respects, more fun.<\/p>\n<p>But you do have to work at it somewhat.<\/p>\n<p>There are dangers to being public (which, remember, is not compulsory), but with a little wisdom Twitter can be useful and fun.<\/p>\n<p>As a final note, this post contained some wisdom &#8211; there is plenty more out there and some of it will conflict.\u00a0 They key thing is to work out what you want to achieve using Twitter and use it as a tool for that.<\/p>\n<p>See you online!<\/p>\n",

Some of the best tools use Adobe&#8217;s Air technology which sounds scary but isn&#8217;t and is worth installing.<\/p>\n<h3>Tweetdeck<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Tweetdeck\" href=\"http:\/\/www.tweetdeck.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Tweetdeck<\/a> is a pretty comprehensive Adobe Air tool that has many unique features.\u00a0 It allows you to create groups to split your &#8220;follows&#8221; up.\u00a0 It&#8217;s great if you follow lots of others and need to organise their messages.\u00a0 You can include searches and visit user profiles from the tool too.\u00a0 But, possibly one if the best things about it, is it now allows you to keep up with Facebook statuses too!<\/p>\n<p>Downsides?\u00a0 It takes up a lot of your screen and so is quite intrusive, and I didn&#8217;t find it particularly intuitive &#8211; and I couldn&#8217;t find a user guide!!<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>Tweetdeck has quickly grown and now contains lots of extra stuff.\u00a0 It can show you Facebook and Linked-In updates and pulls all that information together into a single application, which is quite neat.\u00a0 The problem with this is that Tweetdeck is growing as an application.\u00a0 It&#8217;s slower and still, in my opinion, a bit clunky.\u00a0 It doesn&#8217;t always get things right!\u00a0 Oh, and there&#8217;s an iPhone\/iPod Touch app too!<\/p>\n<h3>Twitterfox<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Twitterfox\" href=\"http:\/\/twitterfox.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitterfox<\/a> is a plug in for the Firefox Web Browser that sits in the corner and notifies you of messages being posted by those you follow.\u00a0 It&#8217;s pretty simple and much less intrusive and sits really nicely alongside your web browsing.<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>Twitterfox is now called &#8220;Echofon&#8221; and has a pretty neat and free iPhone\/iPod Touch application too.\u00a0 Worth checking out.<\/p>\n<h3>Twhirl<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Thwirl\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twhirl.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twhirl<\/a>, like Tweetdeck, is based on Adobe Air.\u00a0 It&#8217;s pretty and colourful and easy to set up and use.\u00a0 Simpler and more intuitive than Tweetdeck, but less powerful.\u00a0 A good tool for a new Twitterer.<\/p>\n<h3>TwitterGadget<\/h3>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t use Firefox but DO use iGoogle and want something integrated into your browser, then you can include the <a title=\"TwitterGadget\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twittergadget.com\" target=\"_blank\">TwitterGadget<\/a> on your iGoogle homepage.\u00a0 There are alternatives but this is the best I&#8217;ve found and it works pretty well.\u00a0 Though it&#8217;ll never be as good as a desktop application.<\/p>\n<h3>Twittai<\/h3>\n<p>At one point I wondered if there was a better way to do mobile Twitter than through a mini browser (You can go to http:\/\/m.twitter.com\/ if you have mobile internet), and I found <a title=\"Twittai\" href=\"http:\/\/twittai.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twittai<\/a>, which, as long as your phone has Java, and most do these days, does a splendid job.\u00a0 It&#8217;s disappeared from the Fan Wiki, but seems to still be available at its own website.<\/p>\n<p>There are LOADS more tools and I&#8217;ve not had anywhere near enough time to play with more than a few of them, but hopefully these tools are of some use to some of you.<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>My use of Twittai has dwindled as I&#8217;ve discovered <a title=\"Snaptu\" href=\"http:\/\/www.snaptu.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Snaptu<\/a>.\u00a0 Snaptu is a Java app that you can run on your mobile that has little plugins for things like Facebook, Twitter and reading news and sports results.\u00a0 It&#8217;s surprisingly good!<\/p>\n",

Some of the best tools use Adobe&#8217;s Air technology which sounds scary but isn&#8217;t and is worth installing.<\/p>\n<h3>Tweetdeck<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Tweetdeck\" href=\"http:\/\/www.tweetdeck.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Tweetdeck<\/a> is a pretty comprehensive Adobe Air tool that has many unique features.\u00a0 It allows you to create groups to split your &#8220;follows&#8221; up.\u00a0 It&#8217;s great if you follow lots of others and need to organise their messages.\u00a0 You can include searches and visit user profiles from the tool too.\u00a0 But, possibly one if the best things about it, is it now allows you to keep up with Facebook statuses too!<\/p>\n<p>Downsides?\u00a0 It takes up a lot of your screen and so is quite intrusive, and I didn&#8217;t find it particularly intuitive &#8211; and I couldn&#8217;t find a user guide!!<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>Tweetdeck has quickly grown and now contains lots of extra stuff.\u00a0 It can show you Facebook and Linked-In updates and pulls all that information together into a single application, which is quite neat.\u00a0 The problem with this is that Tweetdeck is growing as an application.\u00a0 It&#8217;s slower and still, in my opinion, a bit clunky.\u00a0 It doesn&#8217;t always get things right!\u00a0 Oh, and there&#8217;s an iPhone\/iPod Touch app too!<\/p>\n<h3>Twitterfox<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Twitterfox\" href=\"http:\/\/twitterfox.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitterfox<\/a> is a plug in for the Firefox Web Browser that sits in the corner and notifies you of messages being posted by those you follow.\u00a0 It&#8217;s pretty simple and much less intrusive and sits really nicely alongside your web browsing.<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>Twitterfox is now called &#8220;Echofon&#8221; and has a pretty neat and free iPhone\/iPod Touch application too.\u00a0 Worth checking out.<\/p>\n<h3>Twhirl<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Thwirl\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twhirl.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twhirl<\/a>, like Tweetdeck, is based on Adobe Air.\u00a0 It&#8217;s pretty and colourful and easy to set up and use.\u00a0 Simpler and more intuitive than Tweetdeck, but less powerful.\u00a0 A good tool for a new Twitterer.<\/p>\n<h3>TwitterGadget<\/h3>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t use Firefox but DO use iGoogle and want something integrated into your browser, then you can include the <a title=\"TwitterGadget\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twittergadget.com\" target=\"_blank\">TwitterGadget<\/a> on your iGoogle homepage.\u00a0 There are alternatives but this is the best I&#8217;ve found and it works pretty well.\u00a0 Though it&#8217;ll never be as good as a desktop application.<\/p>\n<h3>Twittai<\/h3>\n<p>At one point I wondered if there was a better way to do mobile Twitter than through a mini browser (You can go to http:\/\/m.twitter.com\/ if you have mobile internet), and I found <a title=\"Twittai\" href=\"http:\/\/twittai.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twittai<\/a>, which, as long as your phone has Java, and most do these days, does a splendid job.\u00a0 It&#8217;s disappeared from the Fan Wiki, but seems to still be available at its own website.<\/p>\n<p>There are LOADS more tools and I&#8217;ve not had anywhere near enough time to play with more than a few of them, but hopefully these tools are of some use to some of you.<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>My use of Twittai has dwindled as I&#8217;ve discovered <a title=\"Snaptu\" href=\"http:\/\/www.snaptu.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Snaptu<\/a>.\u00a0 Snaptu is a Java app that you can run on your mobile that has little plugins for things like Facebook, Twitter and reading news and sports results.\u00a0 It&#8217;s surprisingly good!<\/p>\n",

Definitely buses.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway.<\/p>\n<p>Follow my revelation about rush hour last week, I decided that this week, when carrying my precious laptop between work and home, I would do something I&#8217;ve been meaning to for ages and get the bus.<\/p>\n<p>Buses, to me, seem to be one of those thing that have an inner circle.\u00a0 They&#8217;re like a cult.\u00a0 If you don&#8217;t understand them then you feel left out and like you&#8217;ll never be a part.\u00a0 (Probably a lot like cycling, and church!) And it took me some amount of overcoming my fears to find myself at a bus stop, awaiting the number 8, 54 or 55.<\/p>\n<p>You have to know the routes, and the fares.\u00a0 You have to have the right change.\u00a0 And, most importantly, you have to know when to get off.<\/p>\n<p>But, actually, it wasn&#8217;t all that bad at all.\u00a0 It helped that the drivers were much more helpful than in London (I should point out that I LIKE the bus system in London!!), happily advising on which fare to buy.\u00a0 And it helped that I&#8217;ve come to know West Swindon quite well &#8211; though why the buses take such a circuitous route I&#8217;ll never know.<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t get stuck in traffic, I got to sit and read a book and chill out for 20 mins.\u00a0 It was probably a bit slower than cycling and driving, and there&#8217;s the unknown wait time to be included, but I enjoyed that.\u00a0 I abanodoned myself to the fact that I was at the mercy of the system and actually had a good time.<\/p>\n<p>And, you know what, I&#8217;ll do it again!\u00a0 I have joined the cult of bus!<\/p>\n<p>P.S. I&#8217;m almost a bus spotter in Swindon.\u00a0 I think it&#8217;s quite cute that Thamesdown Transport name all their buses things like &#8220;Sultan&#8221;, &#8220;Lightning&#8221;, &#8220;St Agatha&#8221;, and Hercules (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thamesdown-transport.co.uk\/latest\/scripts\/fleet_pub.asp\">list here<\/a>, if you&#8217;re really interested), and I should probably be keeping a list of those that I have seen&#8230;BUT, I should point out, I most definitely am not!<\/p>\n",

Definitely buses.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway.<\/p>\n<p>Follow my revelation about rush hour last week, I decided that this week, when carrying my precious laptop between work and home, I would do something I&#8217;ve been meaning to for ages and get the bus.<\/p>\n<p>Buses, to me, seem to be one of those thing that have an inner circle.\u00a0 They&#8217;re like a cult.\u00a0 If you don&#8217;t understand them then you feel left out and like you&#8217;ll never be a part.\u00a0 (Probably a lot like cycling, and church!) And it took me some amount of overcoming my fears to find myself at a bus stop, awaiting the number 8, 54 or 55.<\/p>\n<p>You have to know the routes, and the fares.\u00a0 You have to have the right change.\u00a0 And, most importantly, you have to know when to get off.<\/p>\n<p>But, actually, it wasn&#8217;t all that bad at all.\u00a0 It helped that the drivers were much more helpful than in London (I should point out that I LIKE the bus system in London!!), happily advising on which fare to buy.\u00a0 And it helped that I&#8217;ve come to know West Swindon quite well &#8211; though why the buses take such a circuitous route I&#8217;ll never know.<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t get stuck in traffic, I got to sit and read a book and chill out for 20 mins.\u00a0 It was probably a bit slower than cycling and driving, and there&#8217;s the unknown wait time to be included, but I enjoyed that.\u00a0 I abanodoned myself to the fact that I was at the mercy of the system and actually had a good time.<\/p>\n<p>And, you know what, I&#8217;ll do it again!\u00a0 I have joined the cult of bus!<\/p>\n<p>P.S. I&#8217;m almost a bus spotter in Swindon.\u00a0 I think it&#8217;s quite cute that Thamesdown Transport name all their buses things like &#8220;Sultan&#8221;, &#8220;Lightning&#8221;, &#8220;St Agatha&#8221;, and Hercules (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thamesdown-transport.co.uk\/latest\/scripts\/fleet_pub.asp\">list here<\/a>, if you&#8217;re really interested), and I should probably be keeping a list of those that I have seen&#8230;BUT, I should point out, I most definitely am not!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>Welcome back. Part 2 of my Twitter introduction\/reference.\u00a0 Hey, this is as much for my benefit as yours!<\/p>\n<p>Today, different types of message.<\/p>\n<p>Status updates are all well and good, but sometimes you want to reply to something someone said, or pass it on to others.\u00a0 There are conventions that allow you to do this.\u00a0 Some result in special processing of your message by Twitter&#8217;s servers, others are just style or accepted convention.<\/p>\n<h3>@ Replies<\/h3>\n<p>Pronounced &#8220;at replies&#8221;, these allow you to send replies to a message posted by another user.\u00a0 The format of an @ reply is:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@username Message<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@magicroundabout Hey, thanks for the tips!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>These are specially processed by Twitter and you can see which &#8220;Tweet&#8221; (message) the reply was sent in reply to.\u00a0 Plus, if someone you&#8217;re not following @ replies you, you will see the message in your timeline &#8211; on your homepage.\u00a0 There is also a special section on the Twitter homepage that allows you to see all replies directed at you.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, Twitter started processing messages as @ replies even if the @username wasn&#8217;t at the start of the message.<\/p>\n<h3>Direct messaging<\/h3>\n<p>@ replies are, in essence, public. There are rules (that I won&#8217;t go into here) about who&#8217;s @replies you see in your timeline.\u00a0 But if someone else looks at your profile, they will see the @replies that you have posted.<\/p>\n<p>Direct messaging allows you send a message to someone privately and is done by writing a message in the format:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>d username Message<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>d magicroundabout Ah, so no one else can see this eh?!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Direct messages are filtered into a separate &#8220;Direct Messages&#8221; inbox on the Twitter homepage, and there&#8217;s a neat little screen for sending &#8220;directs&#8221; to others on the Twitter site too.<\/p>\n<h3>Re-tweeting<\/h3>\n<p>Re-tweeting is a convention used when someone has said something that you want to repeat, with credit to the original sender.\u00a0 A re-tweet is denoted by the letters RT and the username of the originator.\u00a0 A typical message would be:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>RT @myfriend Hey, send everyone this cool link: http:\/\/url.com\/<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Re-tweets are not, to my knowledge, processed any differently to normal messages &#8211; other than the fact that they are also an @reply to the originator.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, re-tweeting, in general, annoys me.\u00a0 If I want to hear what @yourfriend has to say, then I&#8217;m probably following them.\u00a0 Plus, if I am already following them and you RT them, then I get the same message twice.<\/p>\n<p>Occasional re-tweeting is OK, but it&#8217;s got a bit out of hand.<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>Twitter has now rolled out an official Re-tweet feature.\u00a0 This seems to have reduced some of the noise by doing retweets more intelligently.\u00a0 The details of how this works are over on the <a title=\"Twitter Blog: Project Retweet\" href=\"http:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2009\/08\/project-retweet-phase-one.html\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Hashtags<\/h3>\n<p>Hashtags are a convention that&#8217;s not processed by Twitter, but IS processed by a separate website at http:\/\/hashtags.org\/.<\/p>\n<p>Hashtags allow you to include your messages along with other messages about a similar topic.\u00a0 A hashtag basically says &#8220;This message is about&#8230;.&lt;topic&gt;&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>A hashtag is a word, with no spaces, preceeded by a hash (#) character, and can appear anywhere in your message.<\/p>\n<p>A good example of this was in February when we had lots of snow in the UK and it caused lots of disruption.\u00a0 People used &#8220;#uksnow&#8221;\u00a0 to state that their message was about the UK snow. e.g.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Snow&#8217;s about 8 inches deep here in Swindon #uksnow<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>or<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Got stuck in the #uksnow this morning.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Why would you want to do this?\u00a0 Well, the hashtags website mentioned above tracks hashtags and shows lists of messages that contain a particular tag, &#8220;trends&#8221; (what people are talking about a lot right now) and statistics about tags.<\/p>\n<p>The <a title=\"Twitter search\" href=\"http:\/\/search.twitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter search<\/a> function (which I&#8217;ll cover another time) also does trending and allows you to seach for messages with a particular tag?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Where to tags come from?&#8221;, I hear you ask.\u00a0 Well, anyone! Just make one up, start using it, or pick up an existing one and use that.<\/p>\n<p>Note that, apart from direct messages, you can combine as many of these things as you like.\u00a0 You could, for example, write:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>RT @yourfriend Hey, pass this on #coolretweets<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>How any old user is supposed to work out these things I&#8217;m not sure.\u00a0 Probably people say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@magicroundabout What&#8217;s all these # things flying around?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>and I reply<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@friend Ah, that&#8217;ll be #hashtags then: http:\/\/hashtags.org\/<\/p><\/blockquote>\n",

        "content": "<p>Welcome back. Part 2 of my Twitter introduction\/reference.\u00a0 Hey, this is as much for my benefit as yours!<\/p>\n<p>Today, different types of message.<\/p>\n<p>Status updates are all well and good, but sometimes you want to reply to something someone said, or pass it on to others.\u00a0 There are conventions that allow you to do this.\u00a0 Some result in special processing of your message by Twitter&#8217;s servers, others are just style or accepted convention.<\/p>\n<h3>@ Replies<\/h3>\n<p>Pronounced &#8220;at replies&#8221;, these allow you to send replies to a message posted by another user.\u00a0 The format of an @ reply is:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@username Message<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@magicroundabout Hey, thanks for the tips!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>These are specially processed by Twitter and you can see which &#8220;Tweet&#8221; (message) the reply was sent in reply to.\u00a0 Plus, if someone you&#8217;re not following @ replies you, you will see the message in your timeline &#8211; on your homepage.\u00a0 There is also a special section on the Twitter homepage that allows you to see all replies directed at you.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, Twitter started processing messages as @ replies even if the @username wasn&#8217;t at the start of the message.<\/p>\n<h3>Direct messaging<\/h3>\n<p>@ replies are, in essence, public. There are rules (that I won&#8217;t go into here) about who&#8217;s @replies you see in your timeline.\u00a0 But if someone else looks at your profile, they will see the @replies that you have posted.<\/p>\n<p>Direct messaging allows you send a message to someone privately and is done by writing a message in the format:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>d username Message<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>d magicroundabout Ah, so no one else can see this eh?!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Direct messages are filtered into a separate &#8220;Direct Messages&#8221; inbox on the Twitter homepage, and there&#8217;s a neat little screen for sending &#8220;directs&#8221; to others on the Twitter site too.<\/p>\n<h3>Re-tweeting<\/h3>\n<p>Re-tweeting is a convention used when someone has said something that you want to repeat, with credit to the original sender.\u00a0 A re-tweet is denoted by the letters RT and the username of the originator.\u00a0 A typical message would be:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>RT @myfriend Hey, send everyone this cool link: http:\/\/url.com\/<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Re-tweets are not, to my knowledge, processed any differently to normal messages &#8211; other than the fact that they are also an @reply to the originator.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, re-tweeting, in general, annoys me.\u00a0 If I want to hear what @yourfriend has to say, then I&#8217;m probably following them.\u00a0 Plus, if I am already following them and you RT them, then I get the same message twice.<\/p>\n<p>Occasional re-tweeting is OK, but it&#8217;s got a bit out of hand.<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>Twitter has now rolled out an official Re-tweet feature.\u00a0 This seems to have reduced some of the noise by doing retweets more intelligently.\u00a0 The details of how this works are over on the <a title=\"Twitter Blog: Project Retweet\" href=\"http:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2009\/08\/project-retweet-phase-one.html\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Hashtags<\/h3>\n<p>Hashtags are a convention that&#8217;s not processed by Twitter, but IS processed by a separate website at http:\/\/hashtags.org\/.<\/p>\n<p>Hashtags allow you to include your messages along with other messages about a similar topic.\u00a0 A hashtag basically says &#8220;This message is about&#8230;.&lt;topic&gt;&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>A hashtag is a word, with no spaces, preceeded by a hash (#) character, and can appear anywhere in your message.<\/p>\n<p>A good example of this was in February when we had lots of snow in the UK and it caused lots of disruption.\u00a0 People used &#8220;#uksnow&#8221;\u00a0 to state that their message was about the UK snow. e.g.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Snow&#8217;s about 8 inches deep here in Swindon #uksnow<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>or<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Got stuck in the #uksnow this morning.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Why would you want to do this?\u00a0 Well, the hashtags website mentioned above tracks hashtags and shows lists of messages that contain a particular tag, &#8220;trends&#8221; (what people are talking about a lot right now) and statistics about tags.<\/p>\n<p>The <a title=\"Twitter search\" href=\"http:\/\/search.twitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter search<\/a> function (which I&#8217;ll cover another time) also does trending and allows you to seach for messages with a particular tag?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Where to tags come from?&#8221;, I hear you ask.\u00a0 Well, anyone! Just make one up, start using it, or pick up an existing one and use that.<\/p>\n<p>Note that, apart from direct messages, you can combine as many of these things as you like.\u00a0 You could, for example, write:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>RT @yourfriend Hey, pass this on #coolretweets<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>How any old user is supposed to work out these things I&#8217;m not sure.\u00a0 Probably people say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@magicroundabout What&#8217;s all these # things flying around?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>and I reply<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@friend Ah, that&#8217;ll be #hashtags then: http:\/\/hashtags.org\/<\/p><\/blockquote>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>It wasn&#8217;t long since I was <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/03\/11\/contemplating-my-existence\/\">wondering whether or not to stick around on Twitter<\/a>.  I&#8217;m still mulling over the purposes, uses, and usefulness of Twitter, the instant short-messaging system that is capturing more and more of the media&#8217;s attention and is growing rapidly.<\/p>\n<p>So, if my last post might have put people off, this one, and the next few, are intended to encourage people who&#8217;ve joined Twitter, or are thinking of joining, and who are wondering what it&#8217;s all about.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t be the first to post tips on how to use Twitter, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.pbworks.com\/\">Twitter Fan Wiki<\/a> is a much better resource than I&#8217;ll ever be able to produce.<\/p>\n<p>But my aim is to have some bite-size posts here that I can refer people to when they say &#8220;what&#8217;s this all about then&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So, Twitter.  Instant short messaging? Micro blogging?  Search engine?  Cultural phenomenon?  Waste of time?  What is it?<\/p>\n<p>I imagine many more of you use Facebook and you&#8217;re probably aware of the concept of status updates.  Short notes that describe what you&#8217;re doing, thinking or feeling.<\/p>\n<p>For me, status updates (and photos) are the two most useful parts of Facebook.  They are simple hooks into what people are up to that enable a conversation to start.  I&#8217;m more in touch with what my friends are doing now because of such things.<\/p>\n<p>And there is an element of art in status updates too.  There is a skill in crafting short, clever, interesting messages.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter is, in effect, the status updates from Facebook, with everything else stripped out.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s a key difference: Twitter is (mostly) public. Anyone can see your updates. With Facebook only your friends can see your updates.<\/p>\n<p>There is a concept of &#8220;Following&#8221;. Updates from people who you follow appear in your &#8220;Timeline&#8221; (on your homepage).\u00a0 Equally, you can be followed and your updates will appear or be sent to your followers. However, unlike Facebook, you can follow anyone and anyone can follow you.\u00a0 You don&#8217;t need to be mutual friends.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter does allow you to lock down so that your updates are protected, but you miss out on a lot by doing this.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;open&#8221; nature means that people can come and scour the messages flying around and process them in useful and interesting ways.\u00a0 I&#8217;ll deal with some of these in a future post, but as a pretty example, take a look at <a title=\"Twistori\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twistori.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twistori<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It is this ability to process the messages that gives Twitter its power.\u00a0 And its this power that I&#8217;ll be exploring in subsequent posts.<\/p>\n<p>However, in my opinion, Twitter&#8217;s extensions have taken over slightly and people use it for more than just status updates and this has made it more impersonal and less valuable to me as a person.<\/p>\n<p>The other problem with the cultural phenomenon of Twitter is that it&#8217;s turned into a words and numbers game.\u00a0 Can I get hundreds of followers? Can I get my chosen topic mentioned to much that it&#8217;s classified as a trend.<\/p>\n<p>Such things have diluted the useful posts with many meaningless ones.<\/p>\n<p>I think Twitter IS still a useful tool, if you don&#8217;t get caught up in the numbers game, keep your followings managable, and mostly follow real people that share interests with you.\u00a0 That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m still there!<\/p>\n<p>Stick with me for a few days and hopefully you&#8217;ll see why.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>It wasn&#8217;t long since I was <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/03\/11\/contemplating-my-existence\/\">wondering whether or not to stick around on Twitter<\/a>.  I&#8217;m still mulling over the purposes, uses, and usefulness of Twitter, the instant short-messaging system that is capturing more and more of the media&#8217;s attention and is growing rapidly.<\/p>\n<p>So, if my last post might have put people off, this one, and the next few, are intended to encourage people who&#8217;ve joined Twitter, or are thinking of joining, and who are wondering what it&#8217;s all about.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t be the first to post tips on how to use Twitter, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.pbworks.com\/\">Twitter Fan Wiki<\/a> is a much better resource than I&#8217;ll ever be able to produce.<\/p>\n<p>But my aim is to have some bite-size posts here that I can refer people to when they say &#8220;what&#8217;s this all about then&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So, Twitter.  Instant short messaging? Micro blogging?  Search engine?  Cultural phenomenon?  Waste of time?  What is it?<\/p>\n<p>I imagine many more of you use Facebook and you&#8217;re probably aware of the concept of status updates.  Short notes that describe what you&#8217;re doing, thinking or feeling.<\/p>\n<p>For me, status updates (and photos) are the two most useful parts of Facebook.  They are simple hooks into what people are up to that enable a conversation to start.  I&#8217;m more in touch with what my friends are doing now because of such things.<\/p>\n<p>And there is an element of art in status updates too.  There is a skill in crafting short, clever, interesting messages.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter is, in effect, the status updates from Facebook, with everything else stripped out.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s a key difference: Twitter is (mostly) public. Anyone can see your updates. With Facebook only your friends can see your updates.<\/p>\n<p>There is a concept of &#8220;Following&#8221;. Updates from people who you follow appear in your &#8220;Timeline&#8221; (on your homepage).\u00a0 Equally, you can be followed and your updates will appear or be sent to your followers. However, unlike Facebook, you can follow anyone and anyone can follow you.\u00a0 You don&#8217;t need to be mutual friends.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter does allow you to lock down so that your updates are protected, but you miss out on a lot by doing this.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;open&#8221; nature means that people can come and scour the messages flying around and process them in useful and interesting ways.\u00a0 I&#8217;ll deal with some of these in a future post, but as a pretty example, take a look at <a title=\"Twistori\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twistori.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twistori<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It is this ability to process the messages that gives Twitter its power.\u00a0 And its this power that I&#8217;ll be exploring in subsequent posts.<\/p>\n<p>However, in my opinion, Twitter&#8217;s extensions have taken over slightly and people use it for more than just status updates and this has made it more impersonal and less valuable to me as a person.<\/p>\n<p>The other problem with the cultural phenomenon of Twitter is that it&#8217;s turned into a words and numbers game.\u00a0 Can I get hundreds of followers? Can I get my chosen topic mentioned to much that it&#8217;s classified as a trend.<\/p>\n<p>Such things have diluted the useful posts with many meaningless ones.<\/p>\n<p>I think Twitter IS still a useful tool, if you don&#8217;t get caught up in the numbers game, keep your followings managable, and mostly follow real people that share interests with you.\u00a0 That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m still there!<\/p>\n<p>Stick with me for a few days and hopefully you&#8217;ll see why.<\/p>\n",
