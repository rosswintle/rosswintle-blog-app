        "content": "<p><em>[I&#8217;m finally trying to complete my &#8220;Twitter Basics&#8221; series (try looking for <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/tag\/twitter\/\">posts with the tag &#8220;twitter&#8221;<\/a>)by posting a couple of backdated posts&#8230;in fact, the world has moved on so quickly that some of this series is already out of date&#8230;never mind]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I mentioned before, in the introduction, that one of the things that makes Twitter powerful\/useful is that there is lots of public information.\u00a0 If you say something, that something is out there on the &#8216;net.\u00a0 That can be a scary thought, but the availability of all this information can be quite handy.\u00a0 &#8220;Tweets&#8221; can be processed by other tools in order to produce information about what&#8217;s going on in the world&#8230;right now!<\/p>\n<h3>Twitter Search<\/h3>\n<p>This is the obvious place to start and I have already mentioned it.\u00a0 It&#8217;s now incorporated into the main Twitter Web Page, but is also available separately at <a title=\"Twitter Search\" href=\"http:\/\/search.twitter.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/search.twitter.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here you can search the whole world&#8217;s public Tweets to find out what people are saying about a topic.\u00a0 You can also use advanced searches to find:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>messages to or from or about a particular user (not including direct messages, which are private);<\/li>\n<li>messages from near where you are;<\/li>\n<li>messages from specified dates;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The search site (and the Twitter home page) also list current &#8220;trends&#8221; &#8211; these are topics or hashtags that have been used the most recently.\u00a0 For example, when Michael Jackson died, he quickly made it into the trends list.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes Trends can be a bit silly and\/or self-referential.\u00a0 For example, if I see &#8220;purple pigeons&#8221; on the trends list and decide to set my status to &#8220;Why is purple pigeons trending?&#8221;, then I will contribute to the worldwide &#8220;purple pigeons&#8221; discussion and continue the trend.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s weird.<\/p>\n<h3>Hashtags<\/h3>\n<p>Again, these have already been mentioned here.\u00a0 Hashtags can be tracked at <a title=\"Hashtags\" href=\"http:\/\/www.hashtags.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.hashtags.org\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>You can track a particular tag by going straight to <span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">http:\/\/www.hashtags.org\/tag\/&lt;tagname&gt;<\/span> (replace &lt;tagname&gt; with whatever tag you&#8217;re interested in)<\/p>\n<p>Hashtags shows you more than just the tagged Tweets, as Twitter search does.<\/p>\n<h3>Friends<\/h3>\n<p>The most useful tool I had come across for seeing my Friends\/Followers was TweetWheel, but it seems to have gone.\u00a0 A similar tool called <a title=\"FriendWheel\" href=\"http:\/\/thomas-fletcher.com\/friendwheel\/twitter\" target=\"_blank\">FriendWheel<\/a> now seems to exist though.\u00a0 Give that a go!<\/p>\n<h3>Trends<\/h3>\n<p>There are lots of Trend visualisation tools.\u00a0 Try:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"TwitterFall\" href=\"http:\/\/twitterfall.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">TwitterFall<\/a> &#8211; a cascade of Tweets matching a search or Trend in real time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Statistics<\/h3>\n<p>There are various sites that give Twitter user statistics:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"TweetStats\" href=\"http:\/\/tweetstats.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">TweetStats<\/a> shows stats on a per-user basis<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Pretty<\/h3>\n<p>My favourite pretty-but-pointless tool is <a title=\"Twistori\" href=\"http:\/\/twistori.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twistori<\/a>, a colourful, scrolling list of what people love, hate, think, believe, feel and wish.\u00a0 I could sit and stare at it for hours.<\/p>\n<h3>MORE&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>This is really just a tiny set of the web-based tools that are around to manipulate the information in Twitter &#8211; they are the ones that I&#8217;ve found most useful as a fairly basic-level Twitterer.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to dig around and see what else is out there then head over the the<a title=\"Twitter Fan Wiki - Web Apps\" href=\"http:\/\/twitter.pbworks.com\/WebApps\" target=\"_blank\"> list of web applications on the Twitter Fan Wiki<\/a>, or to <a title=\"TwitDom\" href=\"http:\/\/twitdom.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">TwitDom<\/a>.twitt<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>A couple of days&#8217; delay, but here&#8217;s part three.<\/p>\n<p>Today we find that you don&#8217;t have to use Twitter&#8217;s web site to use Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike Facebook, the makers of Twitter have allowed you to connect using other tools, and given others the ability to develop programs with which you can interact with Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>And people, in quite large numbers, have stepped up to the plate and developed lots of tools for using Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>The <a title=\"Twitter Fan Wiki\" href=\"http:\/\/twitter.pbworks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Fan Wiki<\/a> that I mentioned the other day lists many of them, but here&#8217;s a selection that I&#8217;ve used.\u00a0 Note that I&#8217;m not a Mac or iPhone user and there are plenty of tools for those gadgets. Some of the best tools use Adobe&#8217;s Air technology which sounds scary but isn&#8217;t and is worth installing.<\/p>\n<h3>Tweetdeck<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Tweetdeck\" href=\"http:\/\/www.tweetdeck.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Tweetdeck<\/a> is a pretty comprehensive Adobe Air tool that has many unique features.\u00a0 It allows you to create groups to split your &#8220;follows&#8221; up.\u00a0 It&#8217;s great if you follow lots of others and need to organise their messages.\u00a0 You can include searches and visit user profiles from the tool too.\u00a0 But, possibly one if the best things about it, is it now allows you to keep up with Facebook statuses too!<\/p>\n<p>Downsides?\u00a0 It takes up a lot of your screen and so is quite intrusive, and I didn&#8217;t find it particularly intuitive &#8211; and I couldn&#8217;t find a user guide!!<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>Tweetdeck has quickly grown and now contains lots of extra stuff.\u00a0 It can show you Facebook and Linked-In updates and pulls all that information together into a single application, which is quite neat.\u00a0 The problem with this is that Tweetdeck is growing as an application.\u00a0 It&#8217;s slower and still, in my opinion, a bit clunky.\u00a0 It doesn&#8217;t always get things right!\u00a0 Oh, and there&#8217;s an iPhone\/iPod Touch app too!<\/p>\n<h3>Twitterfox<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Twitterfox\" href=\"http:\/\/twitterfox.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitterfox<\/a> is a plug in for the Firefox Web Browser that sits in the corner and notifies you of messages being posted by those you follow.\u00a0 It&#8217;s pretty simple and much less intrusive and sits really nicely alongside your web browsing.<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>Twitterfox is now called &#8220;Echofon&#8221; and has a pretty neat and free iPhone\/iPod Touch application too.\u00a0 Worth checking out.<\/p>\n<h3>Twhirl<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Thwirl\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twhirl.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twhirl<\/a>, like Tweetdeck, is based on Adobe Air.\u00a0 It&#8217;s pretty and colourful and easy to set up and use.\u00a0 Simpler and more intuitive than Tweetdeck, but less powerful.\u00a0 A good tool for a new Twitterer.<\/p>\n<h3>TwitterGadget<\/h3>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t use Firefox but DO use iGoogle and want something integrated into your browser, then you can include the <a title=\"TwitterGadget\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twittergadget.com\" target=\"_blank\">TwitterGadget<\/a> on your iGoogle homepage.\u00a0 There are alternatives but this is the best I&#8217;ve found and it works pretty well.\u00a0 Though it&#8217;ll never be as good as a desktop application.<\/p>\n<h3>Twittai<\/h3>\n<p>At one point I wondered if there was a better way to do mobile Twitter than through a mini browser (You can go to http:\/\/m.twitter.com\/ if you have mobile internet), and I found <a title=\"Twittai\" href=\"http:\/\/twittai.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twittai<\/a>, which, as long as your phone has Java, and most do these days, does a splendid job.\u00a0 It&#8217;s disappeared from the Fan Wiki, but seems to still be available at its own website.<\/p>\n<p>There are LOADS more tools and I&#8217;ve not had anywhere near enough time to play with more than a few of them, but hopefully these tools are of some use to some of you.<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>My use of Twittai has dwindled as I&#8217;ve discovered <a title=\"Snaptu\" href=\"http:\/\/www.snaptu.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Snaptu<\/a>.\u00a0 Snaptu is a Java app that you can run on your mobile that has little plugins for things like Facebook, Twitter and reading news and sports results.\u00a0 It&#8217;s surprisingly good!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>A couple of days&#8217; delay, but here&#8217;s part three.<\/p>\n<p>Today we find that you don&#8217;t have to use Twitter&#8217;s web site to use Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike Facebook, the makers of Twitter have allowed you to connect using other tools, and given others the ability to develop programs with which you can interact with Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>And people, in quite large numbers, have stepped up to the plate and developed lots of tools for using Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>The <a title=\"Twitter Fan Wiki\" href=\"http:\/\/twitter.pbworks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Fan Wiki<\/a> that I mentioned the other day lists many of them, but here&#8217;s a selection that I&#8217;ve used.\u00a0 Note that I&#8217;m not a Mac or iPhone user and there are plenty of tools for those gadgets. Some of the best tools use Adobe&#8217;s Air technology which sounds scary but isn&#8217;t and is worth installing.<\/p>\n<h3>Tweetdeck<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Tweetdeck\" href=\"http:\/\/www.tweetdeck.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Tweetdeck<\/a> is a pretty comprehensive Adobe Air tool that has many unique features.\u00a0 It allows you to create groups to split your &#8220;follows&#8221; up.\u00a0 It&#8217;s great if you follow lots of others and need to organise their messages.\u00a0 You can include searches and visit user profiles from the tool too.\u00a0 But, possibly one if the best things about it, is it now allows you to keep up with Facebook statuses too!<\/p>\n<p>Downsides?\u00a0 It takes up a lot of your screen and so is quite intrusive, and I didn&#8217;t find it particularly intuitive &#8211; and I couldn&#8217;t find a user guide!!<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>Tweetdeck has quickly grown and now contains lots of extra stuff.\u00a0 It can show you Facebook and Linked-In updates and pulls all that information together into a single application, which is quite neat.\u00a0 The problem with this is that Tweetdeck is growing as an application.\u00a0 It&#8217;s slower and still, in my opinion, a bit clunky.\u00a0 It doesn&#8217;t always get things right!\u00a0 Oh, and there&#8217;s an iPhone\/iPod Touch app too!<\/p>\n<h3>Twitterfox<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Twitterfox\" href=\"http:\/\/twitterfox.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitterfox<\/a> is a plug in for the Firefox Web Browser that sits in the corner and notifies you of messages being posted by those you follow.\u00a0 It&#8217;s pretty simple and much less intrusive and sits really nicely alongside your web browsing.<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>Twitterfox is now called &#8220;Echofon&#8221; and has a pretty neat and free iPhone\/iPod Touch application too.\u00a0 Worth checking out.<\/p>\n<h3>Twhirl<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Thwirl\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twhirl.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twhirl<\/a>, like Tweetdeck, is based on Adobe Air.\u00a0 It&#8217;s pretty and colourful and easy to set up and use.\u00a0 Simpler and more intuitive than Tweetdeck, but less powerful.\u00a0 A good tool for a new Twitterer.<\/p>\n<h3>TwitterGadget<\/h3>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t use Firefox but DO use iGoogle and want something integrated into your browser, then you can include the <a title=\"TwitterGadget\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twittergadget.com\" target=\"_blank\">TwitterGadget<\/a> on your iGoogle homepage.\u00a0 There are alternatives but this is the best I&#8217;ve found and it works pretty well.\u00a0 Though it&#8217;ll never be as good as a desktop application.<\/p>\n<h3>Twittai<\/h3>\n<p>At one point I wondered if there was a better way to do mobile Twitter than through a mini browser (You can go to http:\/\/m.twitter.com\/ if you have mobile internet), and I found <a title=\"Twittai\" href=\"http:\/\/twittai.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twittai<\/a>, which, as long as your phone has Java, and most do these days, does a splendid job.\u00a0 It&#8217;s disappeared from the Fan Wiki, but seems to still be available at its own website.<\/p>\n<p>There are LOADS more tools and I&#8217;ve not had anywhere near enough time to play with more than a few of them, but hopefully these tools are of some use to some of you.<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>My use of Twittai has dwindled as I&#8217;ve discovered <a title=\"Snaptu\" href=\"http:\/\/www.snaptu.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Snaptu<\/a>.\u00a0 Snaptu is a Java app that you can run on your mobile that has little plugins for things like Facebook, Twitter and reading news and sports results.\u00a0 It&#8217;s surprisingly good!<\/p>\n",

And it took me some amount of overcoming my fears to find myself at a bus stop, awaiting the number 8, 54 or 55.<\/p>\n<p>You have to know the routes, and the fares.\u00a0 You have to have the right change.\u00a0 And, most importantly, you have to know when to get off.<\/p>\n<p>But, actually, it wasn&#8217;t all that bad at all.\u00a0 It helped that the drivers were much more helpful than in London (I should point out that I LIKE the bus system in London!!), happily advising on which fare to buy.\u00a0 And it helped that I&#8217;ve come to know West Swindon quite well &#8211; though why the buses take such a circuitous route I&#8217;ll never know.<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t get stuck in traffic, I got to sit and read a book and chill out for 20 mins.\u00a0 It was probably a bit slower than cycling and driving, and there&#8217;s the unknown wait time to be included, but I enjoyed that.\u00a0 I abanodoned myself to the fact that I was at the mercy of the system and actually had a good time.<\/p>\n<p>And, you know what, I&#8217;ll do it again!\u00a0 I have joined the cult of bus!<\/p>\n<p>P.S. I&#8217;m almost a bus spotter in Swindon.\u00a0 I think it&#8217;s quite cute that Thamesdown Transport name all their buses things like &#8220;Sultan&#8221;, &#8220;Lightning&#8221;, &#8220;St Agatha&#8221;, and Hercules (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thamesdown-transport.co.uk\/latest\/scripts\/fleet_pub.asp\">list here<\/a>, if you&#8217;re really interested), and I should probably be keeping a list of those that I have seen&#8230;BUT, I should point out, I most definitely am not!<\/p>\n",

And it took me some amount of overcoming my fears to find myself at a bus stop, awaiting the number 8, 54 or 55.<\/p>\n<p>You have to know the routes, and the fares.\u00a0 You have to have the right change.\u00a0 And, most importantly, you have to know when to get off.<\/p>\n<p>But, actually, it wasn&#8217;t all that bad at all.\u00a0 It helped that the drivers were much more helpful than in London (I should point out that I LIKE the bus system in London!!), happily advising on which fare to buy.\u00a0 And it helped that I&#8217;ve come to know West Swindon quite well &#8211; though why the buses take such a circuitous route I&#8217;ll never know.<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t get stuck in traffic, I got to sit and read a book and chill out for 20 mins.\u00a0 It was probably a bit slower than cycling and driving, and there&#8217;s the unknown wait time to be included, but I enjoyed that.\u00a0 I abanodoned myself to the fact that I was at the mercy of the system and actually had a good time.<\/p>\n<p>And, you know what, I&#8217;ll do it again!\u00a0 I have joined the cult of bus!<\/p>\n<p>P.S. I&#8217;m almost a bus spotter in Swindon.\u00a0 I think it&#8217;s quite cute that Thamesdown Transport name all their buses things like &#8220;Sultan&#8221;, &#8220;Lightning&#8221;, &#8220;St Agatha&#8221;, and Hercules (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thamesdown-transport.co.uk\/latest\/scripts\/fleet_pub.asp\">list here<\/a>, if you&#8217;re really interested), and I should probably be keeping a list of those that I have seen&#8230;BUT, I should point out, I most definitely am not!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>Welcome back. Part 2 of my Twitter introduction\/reference.\u00a0 Hey, this is as much for my benefit as yours!<\/p>\n<p>Today, different types of message.<\/p>\n<p>Status updates are all well and good, but sometimes you want to reply to something someone said, or pass it on to others.\u00a0 There are conventions that allow you to do this.\u00a0 Some result in special processing of your message by Twitter&#8217;s servers, others are just style or accepted convention.<\/p>\n<h3>@ Replies<\/h3>\n<p>Pronounced &#8220;at replies&#8221;, these allow you to send replies to a message posted by another user.\u00a0 The format of an @ reply is:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@username Message<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@magicroundabout Hey, thanks for the tips!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>These are specially processed by Twitter and you can see which &#8220;Tweet&#8221; (message) the reply was sent in reply to.\u00a0 Plus, if someone you&#8217;re not following @ replies you, you will see the message in your timeline &#8211; on your homepage.\u00a0 There is also a special section on the Twitter homepage that allows you to see all replies directed at you.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, Twitter started processing messages as @ replies even if the @username wasn&#8217;t at the start of the message.<\/p>\n<h3>Direct messaging<\/h3>\n<p>@ replies are, in essence, public. There are rules (that I won&#8217;t go into here) about who&#8217;s @replies you see in your timeline.\u00a0 But if someone else looks at your profile, they will see the @replies that you have posted.<\/p>\n<p>Direct messaging allows you send a message to someone privately and is done by writing a message in the format:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>d username Message<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>d magicroundabout Ah, so no one else can see this eh?!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Direct messages are filtered into a separate &#8220;Direct Messages&#8221; inbox on the Twitter homepage, and there&#8217;s a neat little screen for sending &#8220;directs&#8221; to others on the Twitter site too.<\/p>\n<h3>Re-tweeting<\/h3>\n<p>Re-tweeting is a convention used when someone has said something that you want to repeat, with credit to the original sender.\u00a0 A re-tweet is denoted by the letters RT and the username of the originator.\u00a0 A typical message would be:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>RT @myfriend Hey, send everyone this cool link: http:\/\/url.com\/<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Re-tweets are not, to my knowledge, processed any differently to normal messages &#8211; other than the fact that they are also an @reply to the originator.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, re-tweeting, in general, annoys me.\u00a0 If I want to hear what @yourfriend has to say, then I&#8217;m probably following them.\u00a0 Plus, if I am already following them and you RT them, then I get the same message twice.<\/p>\n<p>Occasional re-tweeting is OK, but it&#8217;s got a bit out of hand.<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>Twitter has now rolled out an official Re-tweet feature.\u00a0 This seems to have reduced some of the noise by doing retweets more intelligently.\u00a0 The details of how this works are over on the <a title=\"Twitter Blog: Project Retweet\" href=\"http:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2009\/08\/project-retweet-phase-one.html\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Hashtags<\/h3>\n<p>Hashtags are a convention that&#8217;s not processed by Twitter, but IS processed by a separate website at http:\/\/hashtags.org\/.<\/p>\n<p>Hashtags allow you to include your messages along with other messages about a similar topic.\u00a0 A hashtag basically says &#8220;This message is about&#8230;.&lt;topic&gt;&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>A hashtag is a word, with no spaces, preceeded by a hash (#) character, and can appear anywhere in your message.<\/p>\n<p>A good example of this was in February when we had lots of snow in the UK and it caused lots of disruption.\u00a0 People used &#8220;#uksnow&#8221;\u00a0 to state that their message was about the UK snow. e.g.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Snow&#8217;s about 8 inches deep here in Swindon #uksnow<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>or<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Got stuck in the #uksnow this morning.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Why would you want to do this?\u00a0 Well, the hashtags website mentioned above tracks hashtags and shows lists of messages that contain a particular tag, &#8220;trends&#8221; (what people are talking about a lot right now) and statistics about tags.<\/p>\n<p>The <a title=\"Twitter search\" href=\"http:\/\/search.twitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter search<\/a> function (which I&#8217;ll cover another time) also does trending and allows you to seach for messages with a particular tag?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Where to tags come from?&#8221;, I hear you ask.\u00a0 Well, anyone! Just make one up, start using it, or pick up an existing one and use that.<\/p>\n<p>Note that, apart from direct messages, you can combine as many of these things as you like.\u00a0 You could, for example, write:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>RT @yourfriend Hey, pass this on #coolretweets<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>How any old user is supposed to work out these things I&#8217;m not sure.\u00a0 Probably people say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@magicroundabout What&#8217;s all these # things flying around?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>and I reply<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@friend Ah, that&#8217;ll be #hashtags then: http:\/\/hashtags.org\/<\/p><\/blockquote>\n",

        "content": "<p>Welcome back. Part 2 of my Twitter introduction\/reference.\u00a0 Hey, this is as much for my benefit as yours!<\/p>\n<p>Today, different types of message.<\/p>\n<p>Status updates are all well and good, but sometimes you want to reply to something someone said, or pass it on to others.\u00a0 There are conventions that allow you to do this.\u00a0 Some result in special processing of your message by Twitter&#8217;s servers, others are just style or accepted convention.<\/p>\n<h3>@ Replies<\/h3>\n<p>Pronounced &#8220;at replies&#8221;, these allow you to send replies to a message posted by another user.\u00a0 The format of an @ reply is:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@username Message<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@magicroundabout Hey, thanks for the tips!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>These are specially processed by Twitter and you can see which &#8220;Tweet&#8221; (message) the reply was sent in reply to.\u00a0 Plus, if someone you&#8217;re not following @ replies you, you will see the message in your timeline &#8211; on your homepage.\u00a0 There is also a special section on the Twitter homepage that allows you to see all replies directed at you.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, Twitter started processing messages as @ replies even if the @username wasn&#8217;t at the start of the message.<\/p>\n<h3>Direct messaging<\/h3>\n<p>@ replies are, in essence, public. There are rules (that I won&#8217;t go into here) about who&#8217;s @replies you see in your timeline.\u00a0 But if someone else looks at your profile, they will see the @replies that you have posted.<\/p>\n<p>Direct messaging allows you send a message to someone privately and is done by writing a message in the format:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>d username Message<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>e.g.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>d magicroundabout Ah, so no one else can see this eh?!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Direct messages are filtered into a separate &#8220;Direct Messages&#8221; inbox on the Twitter homepage, and there&#8217;s a neat little screen for sending &#8220;directs&#8221; to others on the Twitter site too.<\/p>\n<h3>Re-tweeting<\/h3>\n<p>Re-tweeting is a convention used when someone has said something that you want to repeat, with credit to the original sender.\u00a0 A re-tweet is denoted by the letters RT and the username of the originator.\u00a0 A typical message would be:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>RT @myfriend Hey, send everyone this cool link: http:\/\/url.com\/<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Re-tweets are not, to my knowledge, processed any differently to normal messages &#8211; other than the fact that they are also an @reply to the originator.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, re-tweeting, in general, annoys me.\u00a0 If I want to hear what @yourfriend has to say, then I&#8217;m probably following them.\u00a0 Plus, if I am already following them and you RT them, then I get the same message twice.<\/p>\n<p>Occasional re-tweeting is OK, but it&#8217;s got a bit out of hand.<\/p>\n<p>[Update November &#8217;09]<\/p>\n<p>Twitter has now rolled out an official Re-tweet feature.\u00a0 This seems to have reduced some of the noise by doing retweets more intelligently.\u00a0 The details of how this works are over on the <a title=\"Twitter Blog: Project Retweet\" href=\"http:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2009\/08\/project-retweet-phase-one.html\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Hashtags<\/h3>\n<p>Hashtags are a convention that&#8217;s not processed by Twitter, but IS processed by a separate website at http:\/\/hashtags.org\/.<\/p>\n<p>Hashtags allow you to include your messages along with other messages about a similar topic.\u00a0 A hashtag basically says &#8220;This message is about&#8230;.&lt;topic&gt;&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>A hashtag is a word, with no spaces, preceeded by a hash (#) character, and can appear anywhere in your message.<\/p>\n<p>A good example of this was in February when we had lots of snow in the UK and it caused lots of disruption.\u00a0 People used &#8220;#uksnow&#8221;\u00a0 to state that their message was about the UK snow. e.g.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Snow&#8217;s about 8 inches deep here in Swindon #uksnow<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>or<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Got stuck in the #uksnow this morning.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Why would you want to do this?\u00a0 Well, the hashtags website mentioned above tracks hashtags and shows lists of messages that contain a particular tag, &#8220;trends&#8221; (what people are talking about a lot right now) and statistics about tags.<\/p>\n<p>The <a title=\"Twitter search\" href=\"http:\/\/search.twitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter search<\/a> function (which I&#8217;ll cover another time) also does trending and allows you to seach for messages with a particular tag?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Where to tags come from?&#8221;, I hear you ask.\u00a0 Well, anyone! Just make one up, start using it, or pick up an existing one and use that.<\/p>\n<p>Note that, apart from direct messages, you can combine as many of these things as you like.\u00a0 You could, for example, write:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>RT @yourfriend Hey, pass this on #coolretweets<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>How any old user is supposed to work out these things I&#8217;m not sure.\u00a0 Probably people say:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@magicroundabout What&#8217;s all these # things flying around?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>and I reply<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@friend Ah, that&#8217;ll be #hashtags then: http:\/\/hashtags.org\/<\/p><\/blockquote>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>It wasn&#8217;t long since I was <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/03\/11\/contemplating-my-existence\/\">wondering whether or not to stick around on Twitter<\/a>.  I&#8217;m still mulling over the purposes, uses, and usefulness of Twitter, the instant short-messaging system that is capturing more and more of the media&#8217;s attention and is growing rapidly.<\/p>\n<p>So, if my last post might have put people off, this one, and the next few, are intended to encourage people who&#8217;ve joined Twitter, or are thinking of joining, and who are wondering what it&#8217;s all about.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t be the first to post tips on how to use Twitter, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.pbworks.com\/\">Twitter Fan Wiki<\/a> is a much better resource than I&#8217;ll ever be able to produce.<\/p>\n<p>But my aim is to have some bite-size posts here that I can refer people to when they say &#8220;what&#8217;s this all about then&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So, Twitter.  Instant short messaging? Micro blogging?  Search engine?  Cultural phenomenon?  Waste of time?  What is it?<\/p>\n<p>I imagine many more of you use Facebook and you&#8217;re probably aware of the concept of status updates.  Short notes that describe what you&#8217;re doing, thinking or feeling.<\/p>\n<p>For me, status updates (and photos) are the two most useful parts of Facebook.  They are simple hooks into what people are up to that enable a conversation to start.  I&#8217;m more in touch with what my friends are doing now because of such things.<\/p>\n<p>And there is an element of art in status updates too.  There is a skill in crafting short, clever, interesting messages.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter is, in effect, the status updates from Facebook, with everything else stripped out.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s a key difference: Twitter is (mostly) public. Anyone can see your updates. With Facebook only your friends can see your updates.<\/p>\n<p>There is a concept of &#8220;Following&#8221;. Updates from people who you follow appear in your &#8220;Timeline&#8221; (on your homepage).\u00a0 Equally, you can be followed and your updates will appear or be sent to your followers. However, unlike Facebook, you can follow anyone and anyone can follow you.\u00a0 You don&#8217;t need to be mutual friends.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter does allow you to lock down so that your updates are protected, but you miss out on a lot by doing this.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;open&#8221; nature means that people can come and scour the messages flying around and process them in useful and interesting ways.\u00a0 I&#8217;ll deal with some of these in a future post, but as a pretty example, take a look at <a title=\"Twistori\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twistori.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twistori<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It is this ability to process the messages that gives Twitter its power.\u00a0 And its this power that I&#8217;ll be exploring in subsequent posts.<\/p>\n<p>However, in my opinion, Twitter&#8217;s extensions have taken over slightly and people use it for more than just status updates and this has made it more impersonal and less valuable to me as a person.<\/p>\n<p>The other problem with the cultural phenomenon of Twitter is that it&#8217;s turned into a words and numbers game.\u00a0 Can I get hundreds of followers? Can I get my chosen topic mentioned to much that it&#8217;s classified as a trend.<\/p>\n<p>Such things have diluted the useful posts with many meaningless ones.<\/p>\n<p>I think Twitter IS still a useful tool, if you don&#8217;t get caught up in the numbers game, keep your followings managable, and mostly follow real people that share interests with you.\u00a0 That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m still there!<\/p>\n<p>Stick with me for a few days and hopefully you&#8217;ll see why.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>It wasn&#8217;t long since I was <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/03\/11\/contemplating-my-existence\/\">wondering whether or not to stick around on Twitter<\/a>.  I&#8217;m still mulling over the purposes, uses, and usefulness of Twitter, the instant short-messaging system that is capturing more and more of the media&#8217;s attention and is growing rapidly.<\/p>\n<p>So, if my last post might have put people off, this one, and the next few, are intended to encourage people who&#8217;ve joined Twitter, or are thinking of joining, and who are wondering what it&#8217;s all about.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t be the first to post tips on how to use Twitter, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.pbworks.com\/\">Twitter Fan Wiki<\/a> is a much better resource than I&#8217;ll ever be able to produce.<\/p>\n<p>But my aim is to have some bite-size posts here that I can refer people to when they say &#8220;what&#8217;s this all about then&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So, Twitter.  Instant short messaging? Micro blogging?  Search engine?  Cultural phenomenon?  Waste of time?  What is it?<\/p>\n<p>I imagine many more of you use Facebook and you&#8217;re probably aware of the concept of status updates.  Short notes that describe what you&#8217;re doing, thinking or feeling.<\/p>\n<p>For me, status updates (and photos) are the two most useful parts of Facebook.  They are simple hooks into what people are up to that enable a conversation to start.  I&#8217;m more in touch with what my friends are doing now because of such things.<\/p>\n<p>And there is an element of art in status updates too.  There is a skill in crafting short, clever, interesting messages.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter is, in effect, the status updates from Facebook, with everything else stripped out.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s a key difference: Twitter is (mostly) public. Anyone can see your updates. With Facebook only your friends can see your updates.<\/p>\n<p>There is a concept of &#8220;Following&#8221;. Updates from people who you follow appear in your &#8220;Timeline&#8221; (on your homepage).\u00a0 Equally, you can be followed and your updates will appear or be sent to your followers. However, unlike Facebook, you can follow anyone and anyone can follow you.\u00a0 You don&#8217;t need to be mutual friends.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter does allow you to lock down so that your updates are protected, but you miss out on a lot by doing this.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;open&#8221; nature means that people can come and scour the messages flying around and process them in useful and interesting ways.\u00a0 I&#8217;ll deal with some of these in a future post, but as a pretty example, take a look at <a title=\"Twistori\" href=\"http:\/\/www.twistori.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twistori<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It is this ability to process the messages that gives Twitter its power.\u00a0 And its this power that I&#8217;ll be exploring in subsequent posts.<\/p>\n<p>However, in my opinion, Twitter&#8217;s extensions have taken over slightly and people use it for more than just status updates and this has made it more impersonal and less valuable to me as a person.<\/p>\n<p>The other problem with the cultural phenomenon of Twitter is that it&#8217;s turned into a words and numbers game.\u00a0 Can I get hundreds of followers? Can I get my chosen topic mentioned to much that it&#8217;s classified as a trend.<\/p>\n<p>Such things have diluted the useful posts with many meaningless ones.<\/p>\n<p>I think Twitter IS still a useful tool, if you don&#8217;t get caught up in the numbers game, keep your followings managable, and mostly follow real people that share interests with you.\u00a0 That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m still there!<\/p>\n<p>Stick with me for a few days and hopefully you&#8217;ll see why.<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p><em>[Oh, look &#8211; a pre-written blog post.  Here&#8217;s some thoughts I jotted down shortly after the Martyn Joseph and Stewart Henderson gig on March 27th]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had a busy weekend.  A gig on Friday night, up early on Saturday to travel to Aberystwyth for a meeting, an overnight stay in a B&amp;B in the Brecon Beacons, and home in time to lead music at Church on Sunday night.  Not much of a restful weekend.<\/p>\n<p>This post is about the first of those things though: Friday night&#8217;s gig.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been booked in to see Martyn Joseph and Stewart Henderson for months and, as always with a gig, we were excited and expectant as the evening approached.  But what, actually, to expect from a gig that&#8217;s half folk rock music and half poetry?<\/p>\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, Martyn Joseph is a really good folk rock guitarist\/singer\/songwriter.  His shows are always packed with passion and emotion, MJ means what he sings, his fiery spirit punches through in every song and you leave stirred, moved and excited.<\/p>\n<p>But behind a lot of his songs sits the quiet, wise, humble Henderson, who writes some of he lyrics that MJ puts music to.  It&#8217;s a long established partnership that spans decades.  But Henderson is a poet; a man of words and not music or song.<\/p>\n<p>We arrived to a stage with two microphones set up.  Introductions were done by the comp\u00e8re and as the looming Joseph in crisp white t-shirt and jeans leapt up on stage followed by the small, slight, bespectacled Henderson in proper trousers and a neat suit jacket, I don&#8217;t think anyone was quite sure what was about to happen.<\/p>\n<p>But, if I remember rightly, MJ launched into a passionate rendition of \u201cWeight of the World\u201d, but dropping his sung vocals at times for Henderson to read \u2013 intelligently and entertainingly \u2013 the lyrics, in his soft Liverpudlian, while occasionally dancing around the stage in&#8230;delight?&#8230;err&#8230;well I&#8217;m not sure why, but it made us laugh.<\/p>\n<p>What followed was a fascinating evening of poems set to music, prose read with charm and wit, music wrapped around poetry, songs rendered with power and feeling, and entertainment from two inspiring and engaging men, with great sensitivity and wisdom.<\/p>\n<p>At times, I wasn&#8217;t sure what to make of it.  Knowing a lot of the tunes and words, I can barely hold back from song, so having the verses read as prose created a tension for me and I think, overall, I prefer Joseph on his own.<\/p>\n<p>But this is important stuff right?  Henderson is so often the unrecognised talent in the team.  How incredibly right that MJ puts his own rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll talent aside, steps back from the mic, and suppresses his desire to launch into song, in order to give voice to the spirit of his words.<\/p>\n<p>And Henderson is hugely entertaining in his own right. A master of words with a huge vocabulary and gift for crafting them into evocative verse.  He has a talent for public speaking too and when the floor was opened for questions, Henderson did most of the answering (though that my be because more of the questions were directed at him) bring his replies to life with fun anecdotes and dry, spontaneous, northern wit&#8230;even, occasionally, making his stage partner screw his face up in laughter.<\/p>\n<p>I, personally, was reminded of the power of poetry.  I wonder if we can use the spoken word more in our communication, and for me this may be especially relevant in leading people in worship at church.  I also used to write prose myself&#8230;perhaps this is something I should try again.<\/p>\n<p>Folk music is often so much more than the sum of its valuable parts.  This evening demonstrated that.  Poetry and music together partners that have been clearly demonstrated to complement each other so well.<\/p>\n<p>Now where&#8217;s my guitar?  Or, possibly, when my quill and ink?<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><em>[Oh, look &#8211; a pre-written blog post.  Here&#8217;s some thoughts I jotted down shortly after the Martyn Joseph and Stewart Henderson gig on March 27th]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had a busy weekend.  A gig on Friday night, up early on Saturday to travel to Aberystwyth for a meeting, an overnight stay in a B&amp;B in the Brecon Beacons, and home in time to lead music at Church on Sunday night.  Not much of a restful weekend.<\/p>\n<p>This post is about the first of those things though: Friday night&#8217;s gig.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been booked in to see Martyn Joseph and Stewart Henderson for months and, as always with a gig, we were excited and expectant as the evening approached.  But what, actually, to expect from a gig that&#8217;s half folk rock music and half poetry?<\/p>\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, Martyn Joseph is a really good folk rock guitarist\/singer\/songwriter.  His shows are always packed with passion and emotion, MJ means what he sings, his fiery spirit punches through in every song and you leave stirred, moved and excited.<\/p>\n<p>But behind a lot of his songs sits the quiet, wise, humble Henderson, who writes some of he lyrics that MJ puts music to.  It&#8217;s a long established partnership that spans decades.  But Henderson is a poet; a man of words and not music or song.<\/p>\n<p>We arrived to a stage with two microphones set up.  Introductions were done by the comp\u00e8re and as the looming Joseph in crisp white t-shirt and jeans leapt up on stage followed by the small, slight, bespectacled Henderson in proper trousers and a neat suit jacket, I don&#8217;t think anyone was quite sure what was about to happen.<\/p>\n<p>But, if I remember rightly, MJ launched into a passionate rendition of \u201cWeight of the World\u201d, but dropping his sung vocals at times for Henderson to read \u2013 intelligently and entertainingly \u2013 the lyrics, in his soft Liverpudlian, while occasionally dancing around the stage in&#8230;delight?&#8230;err&#8230;well I&#8217;m not sure why, but it made us laugh.<\/p>\n<p>What followed was a fascinating evening of poems set to music, prose read with charm and wit, music wrapped around poetry, songs rendered with power and feeling, and entertainment from two inspiring and engaging men, with great sensitivity and wisdom.<\/p>\n<p>At times, I wasn&#8217;t sure what to make of it.  Knowing a lot of the tunes and words, I can barely hold back from song, so having the verses read as prose created a tension for me and I think, overall, I prefer Joseph on his own.<\/p>\n<p>But this is important stuff right?  Henderson is so often the unrecognised talent in the team.  How incredibly right that MJ puts his own rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll talent aside, steps back from the mic, and suppresses his desire to launch into song, in order to give voice to the spirit of his words.<\/p>\n<p>And Henderson is hugely entertaining in his own right. A master of words with a huge vocabulary and gift for crafting them into evocative verse.  He has a talent for public speaking too and when the floor was opened for questions, Henderson did most of the answering (though that my be because more of the questions were directed at him) bring his replies to life with fun anecdotes and dry, spontaneous, northern wit&#8230;even, occasionally, making his stage partner screw his face up in laughter.<\/p>\n<p>I, personally, was reminded of the power of poetry.  I wonder if we can use the spoken word more in our communication, and for me this may be especially relevant in leading people in worship at church.  I also used to write prose myself&#8230;perhaps this is something I should try again.<\/p>\n<p>Folk music is often so much more than the sum of its valuable parts.  This evening demonstrated that.  Poetry and music together partners that have been clearly demonstrated to complement each other so well.<\/p>\n<p>Now where&#8217;s my guitar?  Or, possibly, when my quill and ink?<\/p>\n",

A line where my cycle commute is so ingrained that it feels more natural than driving to and from work.\u00a0 Being in a traffic jam feels truly alien, incrediby frustrating and just generally horrid.<\/p>\n<p>The difference is subtle.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve always known in my head that cycling is better, but today there was something more emotional and heartfelt, something more emotional about driving.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s taken a surprisingly long time to achieve this &#8211; probably mostly because I&#8217;ve avoided rush hour on most occasions I&#8217;ve commuted by car.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I felt liberated from the car.<\/p>\n<p>Now, how to convince others to join me?<\/p>\n",

A line where my cycle commute is so ingrained that it feels more natural than driving to and from work.\u00a0 Being in a traffic jam feels truly alien, incrediby frustrating and just generally horrid.<\/p>\n<p>The difference is subtle.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve always known in my head that cycling is better, but today there was something more emotional and heartfelt, something more emotional about driving.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s taken a surprisingly long time to achieve this &#8211; probably mostly because I&#8217;ve avoided rush hour on most occasions I&#8217;ve commuted by car.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I felt liberated from the car.<\/p>\n<p>Now, how to convince others to join me?<\/p>\n",
