And it&#8217;s especially not true in the world of entertainment. We barely have HDTV, I&#8217;m not a big gamer, and we still buy most of our music on CD and we purchase real paper books.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve been making forays into digital entertainment and questioning my own desire to have physical media for everything, and also playing with going &#8216;paperless&#8217;. <\/p>\n<p>This is the first in a mini-series of notes about &#8216;Going Digital&#8217;. Each will cover a separate real world thing (books, music, notes) that I&#8217;ve been going digital with, and will evaluate the tools I tried and how close to fully-digital I&#8217;ve become with that thing.<\/p>\n<p>But before tackling the things&#8230;why has Going Digital been so hard, and what changed?<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Not-So-Digital<\/h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;ve been so slow to embrace digital entertainment media. I mean, I&#8217;ve had an MP3 player for years, I now (somewhat ashamedly) have an iPhone and an iPad. I&#8217;ve been on broadband for years too. I&#8217;m generally not an early adopter of technology, but I certainly get in pre-mainstream.<\/p>\n<p>I guess I&#8217;ve been held back by what-ifs. If all my music and books are digital, it seems easier to lose. I need it backed up, and that backup needs to be safe.<\/p>\n<p>Plus we&#8217;ve had cars with CD players, so CDs have remained important. And we&#8217;ve just not had devices suitable for proper reading on.<\/p>\n<h2>What changed?<\/h2>\n<p>For music, the thing that changed was the cloud. Frustrated with only having a small percentage of my music on my mobile devices, I recently tried out cloud music services to keep all my music in &#8216;the cloud&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>For books it was the iPad, which I decided could actually be a decent eBook reader.<\/p>\n<p>The iPad has also made a &#8216;paperless office&#8217; more feasible, so I&#8217;ve been playing with tools that achieve that, and note-taking tools in particular.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve not found going digital easy, the number of services and apps that you could possibly use is huge and finding the tools that work for you needs trial and error. I can see why people stick with what they know in the form of paper and CD&#8217;s!<\/p>\n<p>I hope the posts that follow help you choose tools without needing to try them out, and help ou on your own journey of Going Digital.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>You might think: &#8216;Ross? Yeah, he&#8217;s a real geek. All the latest gadgets.&#8217; But it&#8217;s not quite true. And it&#8217;s especially not true in the world of entertainment. We barely have HDTV, I&#8217;m not a big gamer, and we still buy most of our music on CD and we purchase real paper books.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve been making forays into digital entertainment and questioning my own desire to have physical media for everything, and also playing with going &#8216;paperless&#8217;. <\/p>\n<p>This is the first in a mini-series of notes about &#8216;Going Digital&#8217;. Each will cover a separate real world thing (books, music, notes) that I&#8217;ve been going digital with, and will evaluate the tools I tried and how close to fully-digital I&#8217;ve become with that thing.<\/p>\n<p>But before tackling the things&#8230;why has Going Digital been so hard, and what changed?<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Not-So-Digital<\/h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;ve been so slow to embrace digital entertainment media. I mean, I&#8217;ve had an MP3 player for years, I now (somewhat ashamedly) have an iPhone and an iPad. I&#8217;ve been on broadband for years too. I&#8217;m generally not an early adopter of technology, but I certainly get in pre-mainstream.<\/p>\n<p>I guess I&#8217;ve been held back by what-ifs. If all my music and books are digital, it seems easier to lose. I need it backed up, and that backup needs to be safe.<\/p>\n<p>Plus we&#8217;ve had cars with CD players, so CDs have remained important. And we&#8217;ve just not had devices suitable for proper reading on.<\/p>\n<h2>What changed?<\/h2>\n<p>For music, the thing that changed was the cloud. Frustrated with only having a small percentage of my music on my mobile devices, I recently tried out cloud music services to keep all my music in &#8216;the cloud&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>For books it was the iPad, which I decided could actually be a decent eBook reader.<\/p>\n<p>The iPad has also made a &#8216;paperless office&#8217; more feasible, so I&#8217;ve been playing with tools that achieve that, and note-taking tools in particular.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve not found going digital easy, the number of services and apps that you could possibly use is huge and finding the tools that work for you needs trial and error. I can see why people stick with what they know in the form of paper and CD&#8217;s!<\/p>\n<p>I hope the posts that follow help you choose tools without needing to try them out, and help ou on your own journey of Going Digital.<\/p>\n",

In theory, with GMail, you can just archive a mail and use search to find it later, but I prefer labelling things so I can search more efficiently. \u00a0And yes, I&#8217;m probably a little obsessive about my labelling too.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Special&#8221; folders, called &#8220;Lists&#8221;, that it creates for things like &#8220;To read&#8221; and &#8220;To buy&#8221;, aren&#8217;t what I would normally use at all and were quite limiting. \u00a0But I wanted to persevere as I saw the benefits.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1628\" alt=\"Mailbox App Swipe\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/IMG_2530-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/IMG_2530-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/IMG_2530-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The little change that I made was this: I created a list of my own called &#8220;To file&#8221;. Anything that was dealt with and just needed labels applied could be put in the &#8220;To file&#8221; list, and I could log on to GMail or use the GMail app to bulk-file all my attended-to emails later in the day, keeping my inbox clear.<\/p>\n<p>Well, you&#8217;ll see from the screenshot that I&#8217;m far from Inbox Zero. But trust me, Mailbox is helping me get that number down and I&#8217;m loving it.<\/p>\n",

In theory, with GMail, you can just archive a mail and use search to find it later, but I prefer labelling things so I can search more efficiently. \u00a0And yes, I&#8217;m probably a little obsessive about my labelling too.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Special&#8221; folders, called &#8220;Lists&#8221;, that it creates for things like &#8220;To read&#8221; and &#8220;To buy&#8221;, aren&#8217;t what I would normally use at all and were quite limiting. \u00a0But I wanted to persevere as I saw the benefits.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1628\" alt=\"Mailbox App Swipe\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/IMG_2530-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/IMG_2530-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/IMG_2530-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The little change that I made was this: I created a list of my own called &#8220;To file&#8221;. Anything that was dealt with and just needed labels applied could be put in the &#8220;To file&#8221; list, and I could log on to GMail or use the GMail app to bulk-file all my attended-to emails later in the day, keeping my inbox clear.<\/p>\n<p>Well, you&#8217;ll see from the screenshot that I&#8217;m far from Inbox Zero. But trust me, Mailbox is helping me get that number down and I&#8217;m loving it.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m very aware of both their failings as a large corporate and of the risks of putting all your data in one place. They&#8217;ve also not been without their failures, and they&#8217;ve been late to the party on a lot of newer developments. But, as a computer scientist and someone who&#8217;s very interested in web and information technology, they&#8217;re a fascinating company to follow.<\/p>\n<p>The kind of things that Google are working on may not always sound amazing, but they are, behind the scenes, doing some really very clever stuff: the knowledge graph and semantic search; conversational and personal search, voice search, &#8216;auto-awesome&#8217; tools for photos, Google now and anticipative information services.<\/p>\n<p>And there&#8217;s the benefit of putting all your data in one place (should you be willing to do so): integration!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fairly well entrenched in the Apple mobile ecosystem now, but what I saw on Wednesday would seriously make me consider adopting Android.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also really impressed with Google&#8217;s bold design trend. I tend not to care about aesthetics too much, but I do really like what they&#8217;re doing design wise. It&#8217;s clean, clear, simple. Unlike their competitors they manage to present large volumes of information in very usable ways. Where Facebook struggle to introduce new features without causing lots of clutter, Google have kept things beautiful and meaningful.<\/p>\n<p>Voice search is particularly impressive and the recognition is vastly superior to Apple&#8217;s &#8216;Siri&#8217; technology.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m really looking forward to what Google develop in the coming years. I feel like they&#8217;re creating some quite revolutionary things that, in years to come, we&#8217;ll wonder how we did without.<\/p>\n",

I&#8217;m very aware of both their failings as a large corporate and of the risks of putting all your data in one place. They&#8217;ve also not been without their failures, and they&#8217;ve been late to the party on a lot of newer developments. But, as a computer scientist and someone who&#8217;s very interested in web and information technology, they&#8217;re a fascinating company to follow.<\/p>\n<p>The kind of things that Google are working on may not always sound amazing, but they are, behind the scenes, doing some really very clever stuff: the knowledge graph and semantic search; conversational and personal search, voice search, &#8216;auto-awesome&#8217; tools for photos, Google now and anticipative information services.<\/p>\n<p>And there&#8217;s the benefit of putting all your data in one place (should you be willing to do so): integration!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fairly well entrenched in the Apple mobile ecosystem now, but what I saw on Wednesday would seriously make me consider adopting Android.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also really impressed with Google&#8217;s bold design trend. I tend not to care about aesthetics too much, but I do really like what they&#8217;re doing design wise. It&#8217;s clean, clear, simple. Unlike their competitors they manage to present large volumes of information in very usable ways. Where Facebook struggle to introduce new features without causing lots of clutter, Google have kept things beautiful and meaningful.<\/p>\n<p>Voice search is particularly impressive and the recognition is vastly superior to Apple&#8217;s &#8216;Siri&#8217; technology.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m really looking forward to what Google develop in the coming years. I feel like they&#8217;re creating some quite revolutionary things that, in years to come, we&#8217;ll wonder how we did without.<\/p>\n",

Is it great staff training? A combination of the two? Or something else; magic perhaps?<\/p>\n<p>In any case, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a lesson to be learnt from how they do it.

Yet it was processed with no loss of efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>It occurred to me that the number of beverage combinations a Starbucks till has to handle is HUGE. Combined with all the promotions and offers, and different payment methods that they have, their tills could rapidly descend into a chaotic mess of soft-buttons. But it doesn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t recall ever being held up at a Starbucks till.<\/p>\n<p>As a software engineer this intrigues me. I wonder what their secret is. Is it very, VERY good user interface design? Is it great staff training? A combination of the two? Or something else; magic perhaps?<\/p>\n<p>In any case, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a lesson to be learnt from how they do it. If you&#8217;ve ever worked in Starbucks and can share their secret, let me know in the comments?<\/p>\n",

Some people have done some really creative things with it and the 6-second limit kinda forces you to be creative. It reminds me of the early days of Twitter where people were really creative with what they could do in 140 chars.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;you can probably tell by the tone of my voice&#8230;I don&#8217;t really get it. The app is really clever in how it lets you record and do animation and so on, but I just haven&#8217;t taken to it. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s that 6 seconds is too short, or if its the looping that means you don&#8217;t get to dwell on the message, or if it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m not a visual person and I simply don&#8217;t &#8216;get it&#8217;. Or some or all three of those.<\/p>\n<p>What I have really taken to is a little app called &#8216;<a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/gb\/app\/takes\/id605815535?mt=8\">Takes<\/a>&#8216;. Takes rolls video while you line up a photo and then, at the point at which you take the photo, it saves a snapshot of video from around the time you took the photo. The app uses information from your smartphone&#8217;s movement sensors to decide how long the video clip should be. The app then lets you select video snippets and stitches them together, with an optional soundtrack, for you.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, the uses are totally different to that of Vine, the still photos it takes aren&#8217;t great, and the pre-loaded soundtracks are cheesey, but for me, Takes is a magic way of making little documentary videos.<\/p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s a little video of some ducks on our decking on holiday to show you what it does, followed by one of our trip to the aquarium (yes, I made the mistake of doing most of this in portrait&#8230;sorry!)<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ErHEbxK79u0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Lbb__9temtY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n",

It reminds me of the early days of Twitter where people were really creative with what they could do in 140 chars.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;you can probably tell by the tone of my voice&#8230;I don&#8217;t really get it. The app is really clever in how it lets you record and do animation and so on, but I just haven&#8217;t taken to it. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s that 6 seconds is too short, or if its the looping that means you don&#8217;t get to dwell on the message, or if it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m not a visual person and I simply don&#8217;t &#8216;get it&#8217;. Or some or all three of those.<\/p>\n<p>What I have really taken to is a little app called &#8216;<a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/gb\/app\/takes\/id605815535?mt=8\">Takes<\/a>&#8216;. Takes rolls video while you line up a photo and then, at the point at which you take the photo, it saves a snapshot of video from around the time you took the photo. The app uses information from your smartphone&#8217;s movement sensors to decide how long the video clip should be. The app then lets you select video snippets and stitches them together, with an optional soundtrack, for you.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, the uses are totally different to that of Vine, the still photos it takes aren&#8217;t great, and the pre-loaded soundtracks are cheesey, but for me, Takes is a magic way of making little documentary videos.<\/p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s a little video of some ducks on our decking on holiday to show you what it does, followed by one of our trip to the aquarium (yes, I made the mistake of doing most of this in portrait&#8230;sorry!)<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ErHEbxK79u0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Lbb__9temtY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n",

I then offered to take him on a guided tour.<\/p>\n<p>What I actually did was go and record a video tour.<\/p>\n<p>Now&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>In this video, I&#8217;m slightly over-egging my reaction to the complexities and absurdities I encounter en-route. I&#8217;m playing the hammed-up cycle campaigner and come across as much grumpier and more confused than I probably really am.<\/p>\n<p>And I willingly acknowledge that this path is incomplete and that it may all make sense once the rest of the Wichelstowe development is created.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;I think that this road and the facilities it has for cyclists is typical of the UK&#8217;s cycle infrastructure in general:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cyclists are forced to stop and start frequently<\/li>\n<li>There&#8217;s no continuity of the journey &#8211; you are directed <strong>around<\/strong> everything else, rather than having your own route <strong>through<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>The signposting is bad<\/li>\n<li>In some places things are over-engineered and highly confusing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This was a brand new road to a brand new housing estate <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wichelstowe.co.uk\/Home\/Media-Centre\/Press-release-archive\/10\">that promised to<\/a> &#8216;set new standards of urban design, sustainability and modal shift in transportation away from the private car.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>It represented an opportunity to do something bold, different, and challenging that would demonstrate real thought for cyclists. Instead it&#8217;s a broken, confused piece of infrastructure that hinders the cyclists progress to such an extent that it&#8217;s quicker and easier just to hop onto the road for most of it.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, when reflecting on the tour, it seemed to me that to make cyclists cross the road, choose to share with buses or pedestrians, and then cross back again is the main cause of all the problems. Simply extending the existing path all the way along the northern side of the road would have been so much simpler.<\/p>\n<p>So here it is&#8230;The Grumpy Cyclists guide to cycling the new Wichelstowe road.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/6tSfWscDicQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n",

I then offered to take him on a guided tour.<\/p>\n<p>What I actually did was go and record a video tour.<\/p>\n<p>Now&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>In this video, I&#8217;m slightly over-egging my reaction to the complexities and absurdities I encounter en-route. I&#8217;m playing the hammed-up cycle campaigner and come across as much grumpier and more confused than I probably really am.<\/p>\n<p>And I willingly acknowledge that this path is incomplete and that it may all make sense once the rest of the Wichelstowe development is created.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;I think that this road and the facilities it has for cyclists is typical of the UK&#8217;s cycle infrastructure in general:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cyclists are forced to stop and start frequently<\/li>\n<li>There&#8217;s no continuity of the journey &#8211; you are directed <strong>around<\/strong> everything else, rather than having your own route <strong>through<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>The signposting is bad<\/li>\n<li>In some places things are over-engineered and highly confusing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This was a brand new road to a brand new housing estate <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wichelstowe.co.uk\/Home\/Media-Centre\/Press-release-archive\/10\">that promised to<\/a> &#8216;set new standards of urban design, sustainability and modal shift in transportation away from the private car.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>It represented an opportunity to do something bold, different, and challenging that would demonstrate real thought for cyclists. Instead it&#8217;s a broken, confused piece of infrastructure that hinders the cyclists progress to such an extent that it&#8217;s quicker and easier just to hop onto the road for most of it.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, when reflecting on the tour, it seemed to me that to make cyclists cross the road, choose to share with buses or pedestrians, and then cross back again is the main cause of all the problems. Simply extending the existing path all the way along the northern side of the road would have been so much simpler.<\/p>\n<p>So here it is&#8230;The Grumpy Cyclists guide to cycling the new Wichelstowe road.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/6tSfWscDicQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n",

It&#8217;s been a while&#8230;again.<\/p>\n<p>This is really an extended Tweet which makes idea blog post material.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve not been cycling much lately. A combination of working from home and not really having any spare time due to running a business and being a dad. But I still love my bike and my cycling and think getting more people cycling would be a great idea for a whole load of reasons.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been following The Times&#8217; &#8216;Cities Fit for Cycling&#8217; campaign and the All Party Parliamentary Cycling Group&#8217;s &#8216;<a href=\"http:\/\/allpartycycling.org\">Get Britain Cycling<\/a>&#8216;<br \/>\nInquiry and the <a href=\"http:\/\/allpartycycling.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/get-britain-cycling_goodwin-report.pdf\">subsequent report<\/a>, published a few days ago.<\/p>\n<p>I confess I&#8217;ve not read the report but the headlines seem to be a recommendation to get 10% of journeys made by bike by 2025 and at least \u00a310 per person per year of the transport budget spent by the government on cycling.<\/p>\n<p>This sounds to me like seriously good stuff. If would ease congestion, make people fitter and healthier leading to a more healthy workforce and less strain on the NHS, reduce road maintenance and building costs, improve road safety for all, reduce carbon emissions, boost bike manufacturing and sales in the UK, and lead to a greater service industry around cycling. So many good things.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thetimes.co.uk\/tto\/public\/cyclesafety\/article3749149.ece\">not just me that thinks so<\/a>.  Lord Sugar, Barclays Bank, Sainsburys, the Confederation of British Industry and a whole load of others think this is a good idea.<\/p>\n<p>The president of the AA said: \u201cImplementation of the Get Britain Cycling recommendations would bring tangible business and economic benefits by reducing congestion, absenteeism, NHS costs and by producing a more creative and active workforce.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses said that more people cycling to work would help &#8220;both the health of the high street as well as the nation&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I simply don&#8217;t see how anyone can argue that the &#8216;reduced congestion, environmental benefits and healthier citizens&#8217; that the APPCG claim as benefits would be good for our nation.  This is the conclusion of an all-party parliamentary inquiry with extensive evidence from over 100 individuals and organisations.<\/p>\n<p>So, whether you walk, cycle, get the bus, or drive to work, school, college, or wherever. Or even if, like me, you simply stagger down the landing in your pyjamas to start your day, can I point you at <a href=\"http:\/\/epetitions.direct.gov.uk\/petitions\/49196\">this petition<\/a> to get the government to pay attention to the recommendations of the report.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Hello blog. It&#8217;s been a while&#8230;again.<\/p>\n<p>This is really an extended Tweet which makes idea blog post material.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve not been cycling much lately. A combination of working from home and not really having any spare time due to running a business and being a dad. But I still love my bike and my cycling and think getting more people cycling would be a great idea for a whole load of reasons.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been following The Times&#8217; &#8216;Cities Fit for Cycling&#8217; campaign and the All Party Parliamentary Cycling Group&#8217;s &#8216;<a href=\"http:\/\/allpartycycling.org\">Get Britain Cycling<\/a>&#8216;<br \/>\nInquiry and the <a href=\"http:\/\/allpartycycling.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/get-britain-cycling_goodwin-report.pdf\">subsequent report<\/a>, published a few days ago.<\/p>\n<p>I confess I&#8217;ve not read the report but the headlines seem to be a recommendation to get 10% of journeys made by bike by 2025 and at least \u00a310 per person per year of the transport budget spent by the government on cycling.<\/p>\n<p>This sounds to me like seriously good stuff. If would ease congestion, make people fitter and healthier leading to a more healthy workforce and less strain on the NHS, reduce road maintenance and building costs, improve road safety for all, reduce carbon emissions, boost bike manufacturing and sales in the UK, and lead to a greater service industry around cycling. So many good things.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thetimes.co.uk\/tto\/public\/cyclesafety\/article3749149.ece\">not just me that thinks so<\/a>.  Lord Sugar, Barclays Bank, Sainsburys, the Confederation of British Industry and a whole load of others think this is a good idea.<\/p>\n<p>The president of the AA said: \u201cImplementation of the Get Britain Cycling recommendations would bring tangible business and economic benefits by reducing congestion, absenteeism, NHS costs and by producing a more creative and active workforce.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses said that more people cycling to work would help &#8220;both the health of the high street as well as the nation&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I simply don&#8217;t see how anyone can argue that the &#8216;reduced congestion, environmental benefits and healthier citizens&#8217; that the APPCG claim as benefits would be good for our nation.  This is the conclusion of an all-party parliamentary inquiry with extensive evidence from over 100 individuals and organisations.<\/p>\n<p>So, whether you walk, cycle, get the bus, or drive to work, school, college, or wherever. Or even if, like me, you simply stagger down the landing in your pyjamas to start your day, can I point you at <a href=\"http:\/\/epetitions.direct.gov.uk\/petitions\/49196\">this petition<\/a> to get the government to pay attention to the recommendations of the report.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you.<\/p>\n",
