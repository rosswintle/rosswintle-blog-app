Plus, I&#8217;ve been preaching about media being important in social media strategy and SEO, so I ought to practice too.<\/p>\n<p>I looked at BlipFoto for a photo journal but it has content rules that I don&#8217;t get on with (my photos with borders got taken down&#8230;no <a title=\"Hipstamatic\" href=\"http:\/\/hipstamatic.com\/\">Hipstamatic<\/a>?!), so I&#8217;m going to self host here.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t expect me to post every day. Do expect me to cheat, with the aforementioned Hipstamatic, and the newly discovered <a title=\"Noir App\" href=\"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/gb\/app\/noir-photo\/id429484353?mt=8\">Noir<\/a>\u00a0bringing my amateur shots to life. \u00a0Don&#8217;t hesitate to comment.

Plus, I&#8217;ve been preaching about media being important in social media strategy and SEO, so I ought to practice too.<\/p>\n<p>I looked at BlipFoto for a photo journal but it has content rules that I don&#8217;t get on with (my photos with borders got taken down&#8230;no <a title=\"Hipstamatic\" href=\"http:\/\/hipstamatic.com\/\">Hipstamatic<\/a>?!), so I&#8217;m going to self host here.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t expect me to post every day. Do expect me to cheat, with the aforementioned Hipstamatic, and the newly discovered <a title=\"Noir App\" href=\"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/gb\/app\/noir-photo\/id429484353?mt=8\">Noir<\/a>\u00a0bringing my amateur shots to life. \u00a0Don&#8217;t hesitate to comment. But do be nice and constructive if you can.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

Well, it&#8217;s really public but just not something that I&#8217;ve been writing about on here, despite it being a rather dominant feature of our lives right now.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the complete FAQ:<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you know what it is?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No we don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a boy or a girl. We were hoping for a giraffe because they can look after themselves after about 2 hours, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s likely.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When&#8217;s it due?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>End of November\/Beginning of December<\/p>\n<p><strong>How&#8217;s Sally doing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>She&#8217;s flippin&#8217; unbelievable. I mean, really, my respect for women grows almost daily when I see what she&#8217;s doing and how she&#8217;s coping with it. But she&#8217;s really well, thanks, and we&#8217;ve been massively fortunate in having a very uncomplicated pregnancy so far.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can I feel the bump?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No. Unless you&#8217;re a close friend or family. Or&#8230;well&#8230;maybe if I can poke your stomach in return?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is it kicking yet?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you excited?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes. It&#8217;s a whole mix of emotions though. I&#8217;m under no pretenses about what a hugely life changing thing this is, especially with me working from home and freelancing, the dynamic in the household is going to be quite odd. But we are excited and, I think, growing more so as the arrival approaches.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you want to borrow\/have our baby clothes\/monitor\/changer\/dresser\/re-usable nappies\/car seat\/buggy\/pram\/moses basket\/etc&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, yes! Actually, we have been accumulating baby essentials. People have been very generous and we&#8217;ve managed a large degree of frugality by careful shopping, use of eBay and not being too picky and choosy. This is worthy of a blog post of it&#8217;s own.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How are you doing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s a great question, thanks for asking.  I&#8217;m REALLY good, though not unaffected by the whole thing.  Sympathy eating is definitely an issue (I&#8217;m eating for two too!), and this post began with me wanting to post two videos.  Yes, they&#8217;re cheesy, yes they&#8217;re very clever bits of marketing, but it seems that I&#8217;ve definitely gone all gooey and hormonal myself &#8211; it&#8217;s not just Sally!  We sat and watched these Google Ads the other day and both ended up in a strange state of simultaneous laughter and tears. One can only hope that there&#8217;s LOTS more of both emotions to come!<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R4vkVHijdQk<br \/>\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3-WRn9keARE<\/p>\n",

Well, it&#8217;s really public but just not something that I&#8217;ve been writing about on here, despite it being a rather dominant feature of our lives right now.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the complete FAQ:<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you know what it is?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No we don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a boy or a girl. We were hoping for a giraffe because they can look after themselves after about 2 hours, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s likely.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When&#8217;s it due?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>End of November\/Beginning of December<\/p>\n<p><strong>How&#8217;s Sally doing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>She&#8217;s flippin&#8217; unbelievable. I mean, really, my respect for women grows almost daily when I see what she&#8217;s doing and how she&#8217;s coping with it. But she&#8217;s really well, thanks, and we&#8217;ve been massively fortunate in having a very uncomplicated pregnancy so far.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can I feel the bump?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No. Unless you&#8217;re a close friend or family. Or&#8230;well&#8230;maybe if I can poke your stomach in return?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is it kicking yet?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you excited?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes. It&#8217;s a whole mix of emotions though. I&#8217;m under no pretenses about what a hugely life changing thing this is, especially with me working from home and freelancing, the dynamic in the household is going to be quite odd. But we are excited and, I think, growing more so as the arrival approaches.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you want to borrow\/have our baby clothes\/monitor\/changer\/dresser\/re-usable nappies\/car seat\/buggy\/pram\/moses basket\/etc&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, yes! Actually, we have been accumulating baby essentials. People have been very generous and we&#8217;ve managed a large degree of frugality by careful shopping, use of eBay and not being too picky and choosy. This is worthy of a blog post of it&#8217;s own.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How are you doing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s a great question, thanks for asking.  I&#8217;m REALLY good, though not unaffected by the whole thing.  Sympathy eating is definitely an issue (I&#8217;m eating for two too!), and this post began with me wanting to post two videos.  Yes, they&#8217;re cheesy, yes they&#8217;re very clever bits of marketing, but it seems that I&#8217;ve definitely gone all gooey and hormonal myself &#8211; it&#8217;s not just Sally!  We sat and watched these Google Ads the other day and both ended up in a strange state of simultaneous laughter and tears. One can only hope that there&#8217;s LOTS more of both emotions to come!<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R4vkVHijdQk<br \/>\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3-WRn9keARE<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>So following on from the <a title=\"The West Swindon Forum\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2011\/09\/the-west-swindon-forum\/\">West Swindon Forum Posts<\/a>, I&#8217;d like to get down to the real business of why I was there: The Local Sustainable Transport Fund Projects.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Local Sustainable Transport Fund<\/h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know ALL the in&#8217;s and out&#8217;s, but following the &#8216;Bonfire of the Quangos&#8217; and various other Government wranglings, the powers that be decided to create a &#8220;Local Sustainable Transport Fund&#8221; &#8211; \u00a3560 million allocated to local authorities using a grant scheme based on the principle of &#8220;Creating Growth, Cutting Carbon&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Details of the fund and application process are on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www2.dft.gov.uk\/pgr\/regional\/transportfund\/\">Department for Transport&#8217;s website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the purpose of the fund from <a href=\"http:\/\/www2.dft.gov.uk\/pgr\/regional\/transportfund\/pdf\/guidance.pdf\">the guidance document<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The purpose of the Fund is to enable the delivery by local transport authorities of sustainable transport solutions that support economic growth while reducing carbon. These solutions will be geared to supporting jobs and business through effectively tackling the problems of congestion, improving the reliability and predictability of journey times, enabling economic investment, revitalising town centres and enhancing access to employment. They should at the same time bring about changing patterns of travel behaviour and greater use of more sustainable transport modes and so deliver a reduction in carbon and other harmful emissions. The Fund also provides the opportunity to take\u00a0an integrated approach to meeting local challenges and to delivering additional wider social, environmental, health and safety benefits for local communities.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>All sounds good, and Swindon has won nearly \u00a34.5 million in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/ts\/ts-sustainable\/ts-sustainable-employer\/Pages\/ts-sustainable-employers-swift.aspx\">its bid<\/a>, which is amazing! Though, the transport planning guy seemed amused at my excitement and told me we pretty much won it &#8220;just by following the rules of the grant application process&#8221;. \u00a0Along with \u00a31.6 million match funding we&#8217;ve got a total of just over \u00a36 million for our local projects.<\/p>\n<p>This is a good thing, right?!<\/p>\n<h2>What We&#8217;ll Do<\/h2>\n<p>As far as I understood it (and I may have got this wrong, and no, I don&#8217;t have time to read <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/ts\/ts-sustainable\/ts-sustainable-employer\/Pages\/ts-sustainable-employers-swift.aspx\">the full proposal<\/a>), there are four things being done:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Personal Travel Planning for over 11,000 residents explaining to them alternative travel possibilities.<\/li>\n<li>Minor infrastructure improvements for the town centre&#8217;s largest employers (such as lockers, cycle racks)<\/li>\n<li>Improvements to the cycle and pedestrian routes between West Swindon and the Town Centre<\/li>\n<li>Improvements to the &#8220;permeability&#8221; of the town centre &#8211; i.e. making it easier to get into and through the town centre<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is a plan right?<\/p>\n<h2>\u00a0Questions<\/h2>\n<p>Actually, I think this is definitely half a plan, and I&#8217;m not so sure about the other half.<\/p>\n<p>Let me be clear though, I&#8217;m really glad we&#8217;ve won this money, and I know some of the people at the council who will spend it and they&#8217;re really good people who are very hard working and really, genuinely trying to improve things. \u00a0And I hope to be able to help and contribute my own experiences of cycling between town and West Swindon, and my own ideas for improvement.<\/p>\n<p>I had two questions last night:<\/p>\n<h3>Why work with large employers?<\/h3>\n<p>I get that working with large employers is probably an easy and efficient way to target lots of people at once. But in my experience, large employers already have significant budgets for occupation health, facilities and employee benefits. \u00a0They can easily pay for a few lockers and bike racks themselves.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the smaller employers that need help and funding to allow their employees to make better travel choices.<\/p>\n<p>The response was that it&#8217;s harder to target many smaller employers. Yet they&#8217;re going to do personal travel planning for 11,000 residents?!<\/p>\n<p>I would like to see the council encouraging large employers to invest their own money in helping employees make sustainable travel choices, and then use the grant funding, through things like the local chamber of commerce, to help smaller employers who can&#8217;t afford simple improvements.<\/p>\n<h3>What about maintenance<\/h3>\n<p>I suppose this question can really be summed up in a statement that I got a minor cheer for: &#8220;There&#8217;s no point doing personal travel planning for 11,000 people if the infrastructure you&#8217;d like them to use is unsafe, unusable or impassable for 3 or 4 months of the year.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is a slight exaggeration, but you can read about my experiences of maintenance of cycle and pedestrian paths <a title=\"True Grit\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2010\/11\/true-grit\/\">here<\/a>\u00a0and <a title=\"Snow and Cycle Paths\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/03\/snow-and-cycle-paths\/\">here<\/a>. Many of the cycle and pedestrian paths and not gritted in snowy\/icy conditions, and in Autumn are often covered with slippery layers of leaf mulch. \u00a0While our roads are gritted up to the max and cleared and well maintained all year round, maintenance of cycle and pedestrian facilities is an after-thought. \u00a0They&#8217;ll do something if you ring up and complain, but it&#8217;s not proactive and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a plan for dealing with it.<\/p>\n<p>So my question was &#8220;Will any of the money be used for maintenance?&#8221; and the response was basically no, the cash is for capital investment in on-off expenditure items. But they are looking at improving the infrastructure to make these things better. \u00a0Which I can only assume means installing evergreen trees and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.denverpost.com\/ci_10788068\">automatic de-icing systems<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h2>Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>I do think this the plan is good. But I&#8217;m skeptical about personal travel planning. \u00a0Encouraging people to use alternative facilities is never going to work if the alternative facilities are inconvenient, difficult to use often unsafe. \u00a0I&#8217;d rather see the money used on improving infrastructure: more and better signage, maintenance, more direct routes, cheaper buses, etc.<\/p>\n<p>And the second half of the plan will, hopefully address some of these things. \u00a0Town centre permeability is a REAL issue. \u00a0When you hit the edge of town, be it at Faringdon Road or at the end of Penzance Drive by the Outlet Village, there&#8217;s nowhere for a cyclist to go. No signs for the town centre, no paths, just a very dodgy, busy road where a vehicle overtaking could be the end of you, or a long walk through the pedestrianised Outlet Village.<\/p>\n<p>So, I&#8217;m encouraged, but I still want MORE!!!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>So following on from the <a title=\"The West Swindon Forum\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2011\/09\/the-west-swindon-forum\/\">West Swindon Forum Posts<\/a>, I&#8217;d like to get down to the real business of why I was there: The Local Sustainable Transport Fund Projects.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Local Sustainable Transport Fund<\/h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know ALL the in&#8217;s and out&#8217;s, but following the &#8216;Bonfire of the Quangos&#8217; and various other Government wranglings, the powers that be decided to create a &#8220;Local Sustainable Transport Fund&#8221; &#8211; \u00a3560 million allocated to local authorities using a grant scheme based on the principle of &#8220;Creating Growth, Cutting Carbon&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Details of the fund and application process are on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www2.dft.gov.uk\/pgr\/regional\/transportfund\/\">Department for Transport&#8217;s website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the purpose of the fund from <a href=\"http:\/\/www2.dft.gov.uk\/pgr\/regional\/transportfund\/pdf\/guidance.pdf\">the guidance document<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The purpose of the Fund is to enable the delivery by local transport authorities of sustainable transport solutions that support economic growth while reducing carbon. These solutions will be geared to supporting jobs and business through effectively tackling the problems of congestion, improving the reliability and predictability of journey times, enabling economic investment, revitalising town centres and enhancing access to employment. They should at the same time bring about changing patterns of travel behaviour and greater use of more sustainable transport modes and so deliver a reduction in carbon and other harmful emissions. The Fund also provides the opportunity to take\u00a0an integrated approach to meeting local challenges and to delivering additional wider social, environmental, health and safety benefits for local communities.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>All sounds good, and Swindon has won nearly \u00a34.5 million in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/ts\/ts-sustainable\/ts-sustainable-employer\/Pages\/ts-sustainable-employers-swift.aspx\">its bid<\/a>, which is amazing! Though, the transport planning guy seemed amused at my excitement and told me we pretty much won it &#8220;just by following the rules of the grant application process&#8221;. \u00a0Along with \u00a31.6 million match funding we&#8217;ve got a total of just over \u00a36 million for our local projects.<\/p>\n<p>This is a good thing, right?!<\/p>\n<h2>What We&#8217;ll Do<\/h2>\n<p>As far as I understood it (and I may have got this wrong, and no, I don&#8217;t have time to read <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/ts\/ts-sustainable\/ts-sustainable-employer\/Pages\/ts-sustainable-employers-swift.aspx\">the full proposal<\/a>), there are four things being done:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Personal Travel Planning for over 11,000 residents explaining to them alternative travel possibilities.<\/li>\n<li>Minor infrastructure improvements for the town centre&#8217;s largest employers (such as lockers, cycle racks)<\/li>\n<li>Improvements to the cycle and pedestrian routes between West Swindon and the Town Centre<\/li>\n<li>Improvements to the &#8220;permeability&#8221; of the town centre &#8211; i.e. making it easier to get into and through the town centre<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is a plan right?<\/p>\n<h2>\u00a0Questions<\/h2>\n<p>Actually, I think this is definitely half a plan, and I&#8217;m not so sure about the other half.<\/p>\n<p>Let me be clear though, I&#8217;m really glad we&#8217;ve won this money, and I know some of the people at the council who will spend it and they&#8217;re really good people who are very hard working and really, genuinely trying to improve things. \u00a0And I hope to be able to help and contribute my own experiences of cycling between town and West Swindon, and my own ideas for improvement.<\/p>\n<p>I had two questions last night:<\/p>\n<h3>Why work with large employers?<\/h3>\n<p>I get that working with large employers is probably an easy and efficient way to target lots of people at once. But in my experience, large employers already have significant budgets for occupation health, facilities and employee benefits. \u00a0They can easily pay for a few lockers and bike racks themselves.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the smaller employers that need help and funding to allow their employees to make better travel choices.<\/p>\n<p>The response was that it&#8217;s harder to target many smaller employers. Yet they&#8217;re going to do personal travel planning for 11,000 residents?!<\/p>\n<p>I would like to see the council encouraging large employers to invest their own money in helping employees make sustainable travel choices, and then use the grant funding, through things like the local chamber of commerce, to help smaller employers who can&#8217;t afford simple improvements.<\/p>\n<h3>What about maintenance<\/h3>\n<p>I suppose this question can really be summed up in a statement that I got a minor cheer for: &#8220;There&#8217;s no point doing personal travel planning for 11,000 people if the infrastructure you&#8217;d like them to use is unsafe, unusable or impassable for 3 or 4 months of the year.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is a slight exaggeration, but you can read about my experiences of maintenance of cycle and pedestrian paths <a title=\"True Grit\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2010\/11\/true-grit\/\">here<\/a>\u00a0and <a title=\"Snow and Cycle Paths\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/03\/snow-and-cycle-paths\/\">here<\/a>. Many of the cycle and pedestrian paths and not gritted in snowy\/icy conditions, and in Autumn are often covered with slippery layers of leaf mulch. \u00a0While our roads are gritted up to the max and cleared and well maintained all year round, maintenance of cycle and pedestrian facilities is an after-thought. \u00a0They&#8217;ll do something if you ring up and complain, but it&#8217;s not proactive and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a plan for dealing with it.<\/p>\n<p>So my question was &#8220;Will any of the money be used for maintenance?&#8221; and the response was basically no, the cash is for capital investment in on-off expenditure items. But they are looking at improving the infrastructure to make these things better. \u00a0Which I can only assume means installing evergreen trees and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.denverpost.com\/ci_10788068\">automatic de-icing systems<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h2>Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>I do think this the plan is good. But I&#8217;m skeptical about personal travel planning. \u00a0Encouraging people to use alternative facilities is never going to work if the alternative facilities are inconvenient, difficult to use often unsafe. \u00a0I&#8217;d rather see the money used on improving infrastructure: more and better signage, maintenance, more direct routes, cheaper buses, etc.<\/p>\n<p>And the second half of the plan will, hopefully address some of these things. \u00a0Town centre permeability is a REAL issue. \u00a0When you hit the edge of town, be it at Faringdon Road or at the end of Penzance Drive by the Outlet Village, there&#8217;s nowhere for a cyclist to go. No signs for the town centre, no paths, just a very dodgy, busy road where a vehicle overtaking could be the end of you, or a long walk through the pedestrianised Outlet Village.<\/p>\n<p>So, I&#8217;m encouraged, but I still want MORE!!!<\/p>\n",

To be fair, if this was my ward&#8217;s community forum, I&#8217;d be raising the issue of pavement parking outside my house and of parking on Rodbourne Road between Linslade Street and Redcliffe Street.<\/p>\n<p>But I also felt that the forum was hugely important and that&#8217;s why I stuck it out. \u00a0That the councillors take a long evening out to invite people to air their views should be valued and some of the presentations are on hugely important topics, like the potential change from Council-owned council housing to a housing association. \u00a0I left with lots of useful information!<\/p>\n<p>I was also left a little disappointed. Not with the councillors, or the people who attended the meeting, but about local politics in general. \u00a0I guess I was the second youngest person in the room and, as I said before, I seemed to be one of the few people who didn&#8217;t seem to be a regular.<\/p>\n<p>I would love to see more younger people engage with this forum and find out what their councillors do, and what they can do for us.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll certainly be finding out if there&#8217;s a similar forum in my ward, and popping along if I can. \u00a0And I&#8217;ll be encouraging others to as well. Local politics isn&#8217;t massively exciting &#8211; I wonder how we can make it more interesting for people? &#8211; but it is important. \u00a0Get involved if you can!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Despite being from Western Ward, I &#8220;gatecrashed&#8221; the West Swindon Forum last night. \u00a0Here&#8217;s some thoughts on it.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>What is the West Swindon Forum<\/h2>\n<p>The West Swindon Forum seems to be a bi-monthly (that is, every-other-monthly) meeting between West Swindon residents, councillors and other interested\/interesting parties. \u00a0Residents can share and discuss local issues, and get updates on important changes in their local area and across the borough.<\/p>\n<p>It was well run, being chaired by Councillor Mary Martin and moving relatively quickly between issues. \u00a0I&#8217;ve certainly been in more boring and chaotic business meetings, so to have one full of members of the public moving so smoothly was pleasantly surprising.<\/p>\n<p>It was also well attended. \u00a0Well, actually, I say that, but while numbers were high I would say that the demographic was quite narrow and that the forum appeared to be full of people whom the councillors and other panel members knew quite well anyway.<\/p>\n<h2>Why I Went<\/h2>\n<p>I went along because I&#8217;d had a couple of invitations from various places to hear a man from the transport planning department talk about Swindon&#8217;s successful bid to the <a title=\"Local Sustainable Transport Fund\" href=\"http:\/\/www2.dft.gov.uk\/pgr\/regional\/transportfund\/\">Local Sustainable Transport Fund<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To keep things brief I&#8217;ll talk about the sustainable transport in a separate post.<\/p>\n<p>I confess that I went with slight trepidation, not sure what the format would be, how many would be there, and whether it would be interesting or incredibly boring.<\/p>\n<h2>What Did I Think?<\/h2>\n<p>Overall I was pretty impressed and interested. \u00a0Yes, it was a little boring, but that&#8217;s just the nature of the subject matter of raised kerbs, parking issues and street lighting. To be fair, if this was my ward&#8217;s community forum, I&#8217;d be raising the issue of pavement parking outside my house and of parking on Rodbourne Road between Linslade Street and Redcliffe Street.<\/p>\n<p>But I also felt that the forum was hugely important and that&#8217;s why I stuck it out. \u00a0That the councillors take a long evening out to invite people to air their views should be valued and some of the presentations are on hugely important topics, like the potential change from Council-owned council housing to a housing association. \u00a0I left with lots of useful information!<\/p>\n<p>I was also left a little disappointed. Not with the councillors, or the people who attended the meeting, but about local politics in general. \u00a0I guess I was the second youngest person in the room and, as I said before, I seemed to be one of the few people who didn&#8217;t seem to be a regular.<\/p>\n<p>I would love to see more younger people engage with this forum and find out what their councillors do, and what they can do for us.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll certainly be finding out if there&#8217;s a similar forum in my ward, and popping along if I can. \u00a0And I&#8217;ll be encouraging others to as well. Local politics isn&#8217;t massively exciting &#8211; I wonder how we can make it more interesting for people? &#8211; but it is important. \u00a0Get involved if you can!<\/p>\n",

                "rendered": "<p>I had a little jolly to London on Monday and, for once, I found myself with enough time to try out a Boris Bike. \u00a0I&#8217;m sure a thousand and one people have written about Boris Bike experiences, but I think I have some useful insight after my first go on London&#8217;s newest mode of public transport, so I&#8217;m going to share anyway.<\/p>\n<h2><!--more-->First &#8211; Find your Bikes<\/h2>\n<p>I travelled to London by train, arriving at Paddington with plenty of time to cycle to my destination in East London. I&#8217;d used the excellent <a title=\"Cycle Streets Journey Planner\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclestreets.net\/journey\/\">Cycle Streets Journey Planner<\/a> to work out how long it should take.<\/p>\n<p>But Paddington, it turns out, doesn&#8217;t have bike docking stations. \u00a0At least not in\/on the edge of the station.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately I had a few other relevant apps on my iPhone and I not only found out that the docking stations were a short walk away, but also that they had no free bikes.<\/p>\n<p>Time, by this point, was ticking on, so I bailed out of cycling and hopped on the tube.<\/p>\n<p>With time to spare at the other end, I noted that the docking station at Old Street was right outside the station! Though, I note, it wasn&#8217;t signed from inside the station.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 1<\/strong>: Find out where the docking stations are, if you don&#8217;t know already, before you travel.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 2<\/strong>: If you can, use apps to check availability before walking to the dock &#8211; it could save you time.<\/p>\n<h2>Signing Up<\/h2>\n<p>I left enough time on the way home too. MORE time, in fact, than on the way out. So I had another go for the return trip.<\/p>\n<p>Signing up was easy. It cost \u00a31 for a 24 hour pass. \u00a0The only stupid thing was the 34 pages of terms and conditions I was expected to read before taking my first bike.<\/p>\n<h2>Getting a Bike: What they don&#8217;t (seem to) tell you<\/h2>\n<p>Having got my day pass, I checked out my first bike. Or, at least, I tried to. \u00a0The machine printed me a code which I had to type into the little keypad on an individual bicycle&#8217;s docking station. I did this, the light went green and I pulled the bike.<\/p>\n<p>And I pulled the bike.<\/p>\n<p>And I couldn&#8217;t get the bike out.<\/p>\n<p>Guessing that I had limited &#8220;green light&#8221; time, I looked for stickers on the bike and docking station telling me what to do. \u00a0Nothing.<\/p>\n<p>The light went red again.<\/p>\n<p>I tried the code again, to no avail. And then went back to the terminal to get another code. \u00a0But it wouldn&#8217;t give me one.<\/p>\n<p>A quick call to the helpdesk got a nice man talking me through the process. \u00a0The existing code had to time out (10 minutes) and then I could get another code. \u00a0Put this in get the green light and then &#8220;lift the saddle and pull the bike&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 3<\/strong>: LIFT THE SADDLE and pull the bike to get it out.<\/p>\n<h2>The Bike<\/h2>\n<p>The bikes are good. I was a bit wobbly at first &#8211; it was definitely not the fast, upright, road racer that I&#8217;m used to. \u00a0But the ride was smooth, it was well geared (3 gears, but that was enough), and comfortable &#8211; even with a laptop in a bag over my shoulder.<\/p>\n<p>My only real issue was, bizarrely, the lack of a top-tube! Turns out that when I stop I&#8217;m used to resting the bike, by its top tube, on my leg. \u00a0Oh, and the weird limiter on the steering which keeps the turning circle big. When you need to turn around and go back the way you came the limited steering, combined with the weight of the bike, made this quite difficult.<\/p>\n<h2>Finding your Way<\/h2>\n<p>I set off through central London. And I have to say, I LOVED it. Pootling along, taking in the scenery, I felt incredibly free and, astonishingly, pretty safe, despite my lack of helmet and hi-viz. Central London&#8217;s streets are small and crowded and most of the time everyone seemed to be going pretty slowly and paying a lot of attention. I was given plenty of room and didn&#8217;t seem to annoy, or be annoyed by, any drivers.<\/p>\n<p>Navigation, however, was another matter. \u00a0I had a vague idea of where I was going with the wonderful (essential!) <a title=\"Bike Hub iPhone App\" href=\"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/gb\/app\/bike-hub-cycle-journey-planner\/id391782662\">Bike Hub app<\/a>\u00a0for more specific details as and when I need them.<\/p>\n<p>As I set out I was a little disappointed at the lack of signs to places that I knew were kind-of on the way but that was just the start of my problems.<\/p>\n<p>I think, at one point, I ended up in a bus-only bus lane. The buses were remarkably gracious but that was a little hairy for a while. (Must learn to read signs)<\/p>\n<p>What I didn&#8217;t count on was the West-End&#8217;s one-way system. \u00a0Ended up at the junction of Great Russell Street and Bedford Square (<a title=\"Google Maps\" href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=london&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.517549,-0.127158&amp;spn=0.003625,0.010568&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=39.371738,86.572266&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;t=m&amp;z=17\">see map<\/a>) looking at a one way system that seemed to flow south and east, when I wanted to go north and west. ARGH!<\/p>\n<p>I eventually found my way across Tottenham Court Road and somehow ended up on <a title=\"Google Maps: Rathbone Street\" href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=london&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.517549,-0.127158&amp;spn=0.003625,0.010568&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=39.371738,86.572266&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;t=m&amp;z=17\">Rathbone Street<\/a>, which is essentially a big roundabout with the only exit going south to Oxford Street. And I really didn&#8217;t want to go to Oxford Street.<\/p>\n<p>Finally I escaped the maze and found some London Cycle Network signs to Paddington, and was guided by these angelic blue plaques to my destination.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 4<\/strong>: Don&#8217;t assume you can cycle in all bus lanes &#8211; learn and look out for cycle-specific road signs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 5<\/strong>: Plan a route properly and follow it properly. Don&#8217;t rely on a general sense of direction. Don&#8217;t rely on signs. \u00a0And have a map or an app handy to get you out of trouble.<\/p>\n<h2>Coming in to Land<\/h2>\n<p>As I said Paddington&#8217;s docking stations are in the railway station itself, they&#8217;re tucked away on little side streets. It took me a while, and a few looks at my app, to work out where it was.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately there was a space free so I could park the bike, but by this time peak times had kicked in and my train ticket was no longer valid.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 6<\/strong>: Even if you think you&#8217;ve left enough time, leave a little more. Especially if your local knowledge isn&#8217;t so hot.<\/p>\n<h2>The Dangers of the Open Road<\/h2>\n<p>So I had two hours to kill and was enjoying my ride. \u00a0I checked out another bike and headed further west.<\/p>\n<p>Where the narrow, busy streets of central London changed to wider, more open roads where cars want to go quicker and bikes are a minor nuisance. \u00a0Holland Park Road felt a little scary and even the buses were aggressive.<\/p>\n<p>I have heard <a title=\"BBC News: London Cycle Hire Scheme Expands West\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-london-14322923\">rumours of a plan to extend the Boris Bikes to West London<\/a>, but wonder whether I&#8217;d want to cycle around further from the city centre. Shepherd&#8217;s Bush Green anyone?<\/p>\n<h2>Finishing Up<\/h2>\n<p>I (eventually) found the docking station that I knew existed just off Holland Road. My return trip to Paddington was to be on the tube again. \u00a0It had been fun and interesting. I had enjoyed myself and learned a few things too.<\/p>\n<p>Will I do it again? If I&#8217;m not in a hurry then yes, definitely! I think it would be an excellent way to explore London as a tourist. I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d use the bikes to get to a meeting on time.<\/p>\n<p>Boris &#8211; I love your bikes! But cycling in London is still not particularly easy. \u00a0I&#8217;d like more signs and more designated cycle routes. Hiring a bike was pretty straight forward, the bike was good, and I didn&#8217;t feel too unsafe. It was just really hard getting finding my way from A-to-B.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, are these just my experiences? No. I remember that our good friend Sally, aka TownMouse, going to London to try out the cycle hire. <a title=\"Town Mouse: The Streets of London\" href=\"http:\/\/cityexile.wordpress.com\/2010\/10\/26\/the-streets-of-london\/\">Her write up<\/a> contains some amusingly similar anecdotes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>having to talk to the nice man on the help desk and then not being able to get the bike out of the rack (\u2018give it some welly\u2019 the helpdesk man advised)&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>discovering that my memory of London\u2019s geography was rather hazier than I\u2019d hoped&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>my search for a free docking station at my destination had meant not only being late for my lunch date but also over-running the free hire period&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>set off in a wobbly but stately fashion \u2013 it\u2019s actually the only way to ride one&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>most of the traffic (and some of the other bikes) give you a VERY wide berth when they see what you\u2019re riding&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>My legs are aching this morning&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m glad I persisted with my Boris bike and I\u2019d recommend anyone visiting London \u2013 or even living there \u2013 to give it a go.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And while I disagree with just one sentence:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>there have been enough little changes like helpful signs and cut-throughs and counter-flow lanes to mean that a yokel like me could sail along with the straw blowing out of her hair navigating by luck as much as judgement and make it back alive<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I share her top tip!:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Just remember, to get them out of the rack you really do need to give it some welly.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Have you been on the Boris Bikes?

        "title": "A Boris Bike Adventure",
        "content": "<p>I had a little jolly to London on Monday and, for once, I found myself with enough time to try out a Boris Bike. \u00a0I&#8217;m sure a thousand and one people have written about Boris Bike experiences, but I think I have some useful insight after my first go on London&#8217;s newest mode of public transport, so I&#8217;m going to share anyway.<\/p>\n<h2><!--more-->First &#8211; Find your Bikes<\/h2>\n<p>I travelled to London by train, arriving at Paddington with plenty of time to cycle to my destination in East London. I&#8217;d used the excellent <a title=\"Cycle Streets Journey Planner\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclestreets.net\/journey\/\">Cycle Streets Journey Planner<\/a> to work out how long it should take.<\/p>\n<p>But Paddington, it turns out, doesn&#8217;t have bike docking stations. \u00a0At least not in\/on the edge of the station.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately I had a few other relevant apps on my iPhone and I not only found out that the docking stations were a short walk away, but also that they had no free bikes.<\/p>\n<p>Time, by this point, was ticking on, so I bailed out of cycling and hopped on the tube.<\/p>\n<p>With time to spare at the other end, I noted that the docking station at Old Street was right outside the station! Though, I note, it wasn&#8217;t signed from inside the station.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 1<\/strong>: Find out where the docking stations are, if you don&#8217;t know already, before you travel.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 2<\/strong>: If you can, use apps to check availability before walking to the dock &#8211; it could save you time.<\/p>\n<h2>Signing Up<\/h2>\n<p>I left enough time on the way home too. MORE time, in fact, than on the way out. So I had another go for the return trip.<\/p>\n<p>Signing up was easy. It cost \u00a31 for a 24 hour pass. \u00a0The only stupid thing was the 34 pages of terms and conditions I was expected to read before taking my first bike.<\/p>\n<h2>Getting a Bike: What they don&#8217;t (seem to) tell you<\/h2>\n<p>Having got my day pass, I checked out my first bike. Or, at least, I tried to. \u00a0The machine printed me a code which I had to type into the little keypad on an individual bicycle&#8217;s docking station. I did this, the light went green and I pulled the bike.<\/p>\n<p>And I pulled the bike.<\/p>\n<p>And I couldn&#8217;t get the bike out.<\/p>\n<p>Guessing that I had limited &#8220;green light&#8221; time, I looked for stickers on the bike and docking station telling me what to do. \u00a0Nothing.<\/p>\n<p>The light went red again.<\/p>\n<p>I tried the code again, to no avail. And then went back to the terminal to get another code. \u00a0But it wouldn&#8217;t give me one.<\/p>\n<p>A quick call to the helpdesk got a nice man talking me through the process. \u00a0The existing code had to time out (10 minutes) and then I could get another code. \u00a0Put this in get the green light and then &#8220;lift the saddle and pull the bike&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 3<\/strong>: LIFT THE SADDLE and pull the bike to get it out.<\/p>\n<h2>The Bike<\/h2>\n<p>The bikes are good. I was a bit wobbly at first &#8211; it was definitely not the fast, upright, road racer that I&#8217;m used to. \u00a0But the ride was smooth, it was well geared (3 gears, but that was enough), and comfortable &#8211; even with a laptop in a bag over my shoulder.<\/p>\n<p>My only real issue was, bizarrely, the lack of a top-tube! Turns out that when I stop I&#8217;m used to resting the bike, by its top tube, on my leg. \u00a0Oh, and the weird limiter on the steering which keeps the turning circle big. When you need to turn around and go back the way you came the limited steering, combined with the weight of the bike, made this quite difficult.<\/p>\n<h2>Finding your Way<\/h2>\n<p>I set off through central London. And I have to say, I LOVED it. Pootling along, taking in the scenery, I felt incredibly free and, astonishingly, pretty safe, despite my lack of helmet and hi-viz. Central London&#8217;s streets are small and crowded and most of the time everyone seemed to be going pretty slowly and paying a lot of attention. I was given plenty of room and didn&#8217;t seem to annoy, or be annoyed by, any drivers.<\/p>\n<p>Navigation, however, was another matter. \u00a0I had a vague idea of where I was going with the wonderful (essential!) <a title=\"Bike Hub iPhone App\" href=\"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/gb\/app\/bike-hub-cycle-journey-planner\/id391782662\">Bike Hub app<\/a>\u00a0for more specific details as and when I need them.<\/p>\n<p>As I set out I was a little disappointed at the lack of signs to places that I knew were kind-of on the way but that was just the start of my problems.<\/p>\n<p>I think, at one point, I ended up in a bus-only bus lane. The buses were remarkably gracious but that was a little hairy for a while. (Must learn to read signs)<\/p>\n<p>What I didn&#8217;t count on was the West-End&#8217;s one-way system. \u00a0Ended up at the junction of Great Russell Street and Bedford Square (<a title=\"Google Maps\" href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=london&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.517549,-0.127158&amp;spn=0.003625,0.010568&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=39.371738,86.572266&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;t=m&amp;z=17\">see map<\/a>) looking at a one way system that seemed to flow south and east, when I wanted to go north and west. ARGH!<\/p>\n<p>I eventually found my way across Tottenham Court Road and somehow ended up on <a title=\"Google Maps: Rathbone Street\" href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=london&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.517549,-0.127158&amp;spn=0.003625,0.010568&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=39.371738,86.572266&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;t=m&amp;z=17\">Rathbone Street<\/a>, which is essentially a big roundabout with the only exit going south to Oxford Street. And I really didn&#8217;t want to go to Oxford Street.<\/p>\n<p>Finally I escaped the maze and found some London Cycle Network signs to Paddington, and was guided by these angelic blue plaques to my destination.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 4<\/strong>: Don&#8217;t assume you can cycle in all bus lanes &#8211; learn and look out for cycle-specific road signs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 5<\/strong>: Plan a route properly and follow it properly. Don&#8217;t rely on a general sense of direction. Don&#8217;t rely on signs. \u00a0And have a map or an app handy to get you out of trouble.<\/p>\n<h2>Coming in to Land<\/h2>\n<p>As I said Paddington&#8217;s docking stations are in the railway station itself, they&#8217;re tucked away on little side streets. It took me a while, and a few looks at my app, to work out where it was.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately there was a space free so I could park the bike, but by this time peak times had kicked in and my train ticket was no longer valid.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Boris Bike Lesson 6<\/strong>: Even if you think you&#8217;ve left enough time, leave a little more. Especially if your local knowledge isn&#8217;t so hot.<\/p>\n<h2>The Dangers of the Open Road<\/h2>\n<p>So I had two hours to kill and was enjoying my ride. \u00a0I checked out another bike and headed further west.<\/p>\n<p>Where the narrow, busy streets of central London changed to wider, more open roads where cars want to go quicker and bikes are a minor nuisance. \u00a0Holland Park Road felt a little scary and even the buses were aggressive.<\/p>\n<p>I have heard <a title=\"BBC News: London Cycle Hire Scheme Expands West\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-london-14322923\">rumours of a plan to extend the Boris Bikes to West London<\/a>, but wonder whether I&#8217;d want to cycle around further from the city centre. Shepherd&#8217;s Bush Green anyone?<\/p>\n<h2>Finishing Up<\/h2>\n<p>I (eventually) found the docking station that I knew existed just off Holland Road. My return trip to Paddington was to be on the tube again. \u00a0It had been fun and interesting. I had enjoyed myself and learned a few things too.<\/p>\n<p>Will I do it again? If I&#8217;m not in a hurry then yes, definitely! I think it would be an excellent way to explore London as a tourist. I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d use the bikes to get to a meeting on time.<\/p>\n<p>Boris &#8211; I love your bikes! But cycling in London is still not particularly easy. \u00a0I&#8217;d like more signs and more designated cycle routes. Hiring a bike was pretty straight forward, the bike was good, and I didn&#8217;t feel too unsafe. It was just really hard getting finding my way from A-to-B.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, are these just my experiences? No. I remember that our good friend Sally, aka TownMouse, going to London to try out the cycle hire. <a title=\"Town Mouse: The Streets of London\" href=\"http:\/\/cityexile.wordpress.com\/2010\/10\/26\/the-streets-of-london\/\">Her write up<\/a> contains some amusingly similar anecdotes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>having to talk to the nice man on the help desk and then not being able to get the bike out of the rack (\u2018give it some welly\u2019 the helpdesk man advised)&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>discovering that my memory of London\u2019s geography was rather hazier than I\u2019d hoped&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>my search for a free docking station at my destination had meant not only being late for my lunch date but also over-running the free hire period&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>set off in a wobbly but stately fashion \u2013 it\u2019s actually the only way to ride one&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>most of the traffic (and some of the other bikes) give you a VERY wide berth when they see what you\u2019re riding&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>My legs are aching this morning&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m glad I persisted with my Boris bike and I\u2019d recommend anyone visiting London \u2013 or even living there \u2013 to give it a go.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And while I disagree with just one sentence:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>there have been enough little changes like helpful signs and cut-throughs and counter-flow lanes to mean that a yokel like me could sail along with the straw blowing out of her hair navigating by luck as much as judgement and make it back alive<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I share her top tip!:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Just remember, to get them out of the rack you really do need to give it some welly.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Have you been on the Boris Bikes? Perhaps you have some tips on navigating central London? Use the comments as always!<\/p>\n",

Says the poem:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Within an hour the gallant band<\/p>\n<p>were charging in on every hand<\/p>\n<p>from Putney, Hackney Downs and Bow<\/p>\n<p>with courage high and hearts a-glow.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Anyway, as I pedalled I put the two ideas together and started recomposing &#8220;Matilda&#8221; in light of 9\/11. \u00a0I got this far&#8230;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Our George he had such thirst for oil<\/p>\n<p>It made his country proud and spoiled<\/p>\n<p>His dad, whose term some years ago<\/p>\n<p>Had kept the price-per-barrel low<\/p>\n<p>Apparently supported him<\/p>\n<p>Their efforts, they changed everything<\/p>\n<p>For once, towards the noon of day<\/p>\n<p>Some terrorists grew tired of play<\/p>\n<p>And finding they were not alone<\/p>\n<p>Went planning terror quite unknown<\/p>\n<p>They hijacked two innocent planes<\/p>\n<p>And took the towers down in flames<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s not quite the tribute to the firemen that I think I set out to produce, but it kinda works.<\/p>\n<p>I think it should end:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>And later, when his troops returned<\/p>\n<p>Our George found all his oil was burned.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Anyone fancy filling in the middle?<\/p>\n",

I wrote this in response:<\/p>\n<p>SO many things wrong with the comments from the police.<\/p>\n<p>First of all I&#8217;m totally with Andy, cyclists should obey the law. There&#8217;s no excuse for illegally cycling on the pavement and scaring pedestrians. BUT&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>We might want to ask WHY cyclists feel a need to do this. Is it because Cricklade Road is narrow and congested, but also a key link in the cycle routes from Stratton into town? Punishing cyclists is all well and good but what&#8217;s being done to make cycling on the roads safer? Are there plans to put an alternative cycle route in? Or to make a decent amount of space on Cricklade Road for cyclists?<\/p>\n<p>We may also want to consider road safety again. The article says there have been no accidents involving bikes. The other day I read this:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In Swindon between summer 2008 and summer 2011, 2,322 cars were in accidents resulting in 10 fatalities and 186 serious injuries.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We might like to consider if it&#8217;s a good use of police time cracking down on the non-existent threat of cyclists and spending some time pulling over some of the shockingly bad motorists who pose a real threat to everyone. People who use mobiles while driving; people who speed; perhaps the guy who overtook me on Croft Road because I&#8217;d slowed down to give a cyclist room.<\/p>\n<p>Finally get get the police to stop putting the burden of road safety on to vulnerable users. It&#8217;s all well and good telling cyclists to wear helmets and hi-viz (which MIGHT protect you somewhat in a collision with a vehicle), but who&#8217;s telling motorists to look out for cyclists, to give cyclists room, to drive carefully in residential areas.<\/p>\n<p>Like so many articles about cycling, this one is ALL backwards, it both blames cyclists for being a threat and tells them that they&#8217;re vulnerable and need to protect themselves using every measure available.<\/p>\n<p>Cycling is a safe, healthy, efficient and clean mode of transport. If you really want safer streets go tackle the real issue of motoring, and make cycling as easy as possible.<\/p>\n",

I wrote this in response:<\/p>\n<p>SO many things wrong with the comments from the police.<\/p>\n<p>First of all I&#8217;m totally with Andy, cyclists should obey the law. There&#8217;s no excuse for illegally cycling on the pavement and scaring pedestrians. BUT&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>We might want to ask WHY cyclists feel a need to do this. Is it because Cricklade Road is narrow and congested, but also a key link in the cycle routes from Stratton into town? Punishing cyclists is all well and good but what&#8217;s being done to make cycling on the roads safer? Are there plans to put an alternative cycle route in? Or to make a decent amount of space on Cricklade Road for cyclists?<\/p>\n<p>We may also want to consider road safety again. The article says there have been no accidents involving bikes. The other day I read this:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In Swindon between summer 2008 and summer 2011, 2,322 cars were in accidents resulting in 10 fatalities and 186 serious injuries.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We might like to consider if it&#8217;s a good use of police time cracking down on the non-existent threat of cyclists and spending some time pulling over some of the shockingly bad motorists who pose a real threat to everyone. People who use mobiles while driving; people who speed; perhaps the guy who overtook me on Croft Road because I&#8217;d slowed down to give a cyclist room.<\/p>\n<p>Finally get get the police to stop putting the burden of road safety on to vulnerable users. It&#8217;s all well and good telling cyclists to wear helmets and hi-viz (which MIGHT protect you somewhat in a collision with a vehicle), but who&#8217;s telling motorists to look out for cyclists, to give cyclists room, to drive carefully in residential areas.<\/p>\n<p>Like so many articles about cycling, this one is ALL backwards, it both blames cyclists for being a threat and tells them that they&#8217;re vulnerable and need to protect themselves using every measure available.<\/p>\n<p>Cycling is a safe, healthy, efficient and clean mode of transport. If you really want safer streets go tackle the real issue of motoring, and make cycling as easy as possible.<\/p>\n",
