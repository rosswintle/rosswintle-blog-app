The sheer number of stations and bikes making it convenient.<\/li>\n<li>The cycling infrastructure?\u00a0 OK, it&#8217;s not Copenhagen or Amsterdam, but there were lots of wide open roads where plenty of space was given to cyclists (often shared with buses), lots of wide, decent and sensible cycle lanes &#8211; not always with priority over other traffic, but far better thought out than most of what I&#8217;ve seen in the UK.<\/li>\n<li>The culture?\u00a0 Maybe it was just because I was on holiday and relaxed, but Paris felt pretty chilled.\u00a0 No one was in a\u00a0 hurry.<\/li>\n<li>The pricing?\u00a0 Once you&#8217;ve paid a small fee to register, the first half-hour on a Velib is free!\u00a0 That&#8217;s probably long enough for most short journeys in Paris, making it a very cheap way to get around.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Or is it, as I suspect, all of the above?<\/p>\n<p>Originally I had some questions though like what do you do when you need to park a Velib at a station that is full, but these all seem to have been thought out.<\/p>\n<p>I was seriously impressed.\u00a0\u00a0 Although, sadly, it seems that Velib hasn&#8217;t been without its problems &#8211; <a title=\"Wikipedia: Velib\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/V%C3%A9lib%27\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia<\/a> reports a high level of theft and vandalism.<\/p>\n<p>London launches <a title=\"TFL: About Cycle Hire\" href=\"http:\/\/www.tfl.gov.uk\/roadusers\/cycling\/12444.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">its cycle hire\/sharing system<\/a> in July with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>400 stations (no more than 300m apart);<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"TFL London Cycle Hire Zone map\" href=\"http:\/\/www.tfl.gov.uk\/assets\/downloads\/Cycling\/cycle-hire-scheme-zone-map.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">coverage<\/a> from Holland Park in the West, to Tower Hamlets in the East, and from Regent&#8217;s Park and Islington in the North down to Lambeth in the South <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-828-6' id='fnref-828-6' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(828)'>6<\/a><\/sup>;<\/li>\n<li>a similar pricing scheme (the first 30 minutes will be free).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Yet I&#8217;m sceptical.

The sheer number of stations and bikes making it convenient.<\/li>\n<li>The cycling infrastructure?\u00a0 OK, it&#8217;s not Copenhagen or Amsterdam, but there were lots of wide open roads where plenty of space was given to cyclists (often shared with buses), lots of wide, decent and sensible cycle lanes &#8211; not always with priority over other traffic, but far better thought out than most of what I&#8217;ve seen in the UK.<\/li>\n<li>The culture?\u00a0 Maybe it was just because I was on holiday and relaxed, but Paris felt pretty chilled.\u00a0 No one was in a\u00a0 hurry.<\/li>\n<li>The pricing?\u00a0 Once you&#8217;ve paid a small fee to register, the first half-hour on a Velib is free!\u00a0 That&#8217;s probably long enough for most short journeys in Paris, making it a very cheap way to get around.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Or is it, as I suspect, all of the above?<\/p>\n<p>Originally I had some questions though like what do you do when you need to park a Velib at a station that is full, but these all seem to have been thought out.<\/p>\n<p>I was seriously impressed.\u00a0\u00a0 Although, sadly, it seems that Velib hasn&#8217;t been without its problems &#8211; <a title=\"Wikipedia: Velib\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/V%C3%A9lib%27\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia<\/a> reports a high level of theft and vandalism.<\/p>\n<p>London launches <a title=\"TFL: About Cycle Hire\" href=\"http:\/\/www.tfl.gov.uk\/roadusers\/cycling\/12444.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">its cycle hire\/sharing system<\/a> in July with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>400 stations (no more than 300m apart);<\/li>\n<li><a title=\"TFL London Cycle Hire Zone map\" href=\"http:\/\/www.tfl.gov.uk\/assets\/downloads\/Cycling\/cycle-hire-scheme-zone-map.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">coverage<\/a> from Holland Park in the West, to Tower Hamlets in the East, and from Regent&#8217;s Park and Islington in the North down to Lambeth in the South <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-828-6' id='fnref-828-6' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(828)'>6<\/a><\/sup>;<\/li>\n<li>a similar pricing scheme (the first 30 minutes will be free).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Yet I&#8217;m sceptical.

Lots of people would LOVE to live that close to where they work so that they could walk or cycle.\u00a0 10- or 30-minutes walk is nothing and would be very good for you, it&#8217;s not an excuse to use a car.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s another reason that he doesn&#8217;t cycle: \u201cI&#8217;ve never actually cycled in London&#8230;I&#8217;d have to take a deep breath. I think you need to know what you are  doing to cycle in London.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Well there you go then Mr Phillips &#8211; you&#8217;re transport secretary and you won&#8217;t cycle because it&#8217;s too dangerous.\u00a0 I think you have identified one of the key problems that you need to sort out.\u00a0 We need to make cycling a safe and viable form of transport for more people &#8211; including government ministers.<\/p>\n<p>Sitting in your nice Jag or Honda, watching cyclists and walkers go by isn&#8217;t going to help, you&#8217;ll need to get out, join them, take up the cause, start taking the environment and safety &#8220;deeply seriously&#8221; and do your bit to help.<\/p>\n<p>The article may well be biased, but it seems that Mr Phillips has a lot of changes to make himself as well as on behalf of the country.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Now, the London Evening Standard is not my favourite newspaper by a long way, and I suspect some element of bias in the writing, but <a title=\"London Evening Standard - Transport Secretary prefers to travel by Jaguar than cycle London's streets\" href=\"http:\/\/www.thisislondon.co.uk\/standard\/article-23838800-my-jags-a-joy-but-cycling-in-london-ive-never-braved-it.do\" target=\"_blank\">this article<\/a>, a brief interview with Phillip Hammond, the new Transport Secretary, caught my attention and is worth comment.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Firstly, I have no problem with anyone owning a nice car or enjoying driving, but to use the fact that &#8220;the car was the greenest in its class&#8221; to justify yourself as &#8220;taking safety and the environment deeply seriously&#8221; is nonsense.\u00a0 The Jaguar XJ comes with either a 3.0 or 5.0 litre engine.\u00a0 If you took the environment &#8220;deeply seriously&#8221; then you&#8217;d make some sacrifices to make your point &#8211; you&#8217;d give up your personal desire to own a nice car and buy something smaller.<\/p>\n<p>Second, the article says that &#8220;he does not seem keen on walking to work, pointing out that his&#8230; ministerial office&#8230;is &#8216;a good 10 minutes hoof&#8217; to Westminster Tube Station&#8221; and that he &#8220;has been picked up by a government driver in a Honda  Civic from home in Pimlico,  a 30-minute walk from his office&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Hang on.\u00a0 He lives a 30-minute walk from his\u00a0 office and it&#8217;s 10 minutes walk from the tube? Lots of people would LOVE to live that close to where they work so that they could walk or cycle.\u00a0 10- or 30-minutes walk is nothing and would be very good for you, it&#8217;s not an excuse to use a car.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s another reason that he doesn&#8217;t cycle: \u201cI&#8217;ve never actually cycled in London&#8230;I&#8217;d have to take a deep breath. I think you need to know what you are  doing to cycle in London.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Well there you go then Mr Phillips &#8211; you&#8217;re transport secretary and you won&#8217;t cycle because it&#8217;s too dangerous.\u00a0 I think you have identified one of the key problems that you need to sort out.\u00a0 We need to make cycling a safe and viable form of transport for more people &#8211; including government ministers.<\/p>\n<p>Sitting in your nice Jag or Honda, watching cyclists and walkers go by isn&#8217;t going to help, you&#8217;ll need to get out, join them, take up the cause, start taking the environment and safety &#8220;deeply seriously&#8221; and do your bit to help.<\/p>\n<p>The article may well be biased, but it seems that Mr Phillips has a lot of changes to make himself as well as on behalf of the country.<\/p>\n",
