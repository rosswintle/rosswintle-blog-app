Good&nbsp;coding principles and practices are becoming more common in web development, but I can&#8217;t help wishing&nbsp;we could take a few steps back and start with tools that help us write better code in the first place.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>WARNING: contains opinions. &nbsp;Some of which may be uninformed.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone involved in software that knows me well will know a couple of things about me:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I have a different approach to web development&nbsp;than a lot of people &#8211; mostly because I have a background in safety critical software, which is written very differently to code for a website.<\/li>\n<li>Despite that background, I&#8217;m pretty pragmatic. Horses are for courses. Tools are just tools.<\/li>\n<li>(Because of that background) l hate JavaScript. Any language that guesses what you want to do seems to me to be unhelpful. PHP is better, but far from perfect.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I mostly write PHP for back end code&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">because<\/span> I&#8217;m pragmatic. It&#8217;s not perfect. It&#8217;s slow. It promotes better discipline than JavaScript. But it&#8217;s also relatively accessible, hugely widespread, easy to deploy.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m always looking to write better PHP. Which is why I&#8217;m currently reading <a href=\"https:\/\/adamwathan.me\/refactoring-to-collections\/\">Adam Wathan&#8217;s Refactoring to Collections<\/a>. A book which tries to apply some declarative&nbsp;programming principles to PHP coding. &nbsp;This, in short, means he&#8217;s come up with some nice ways to write code that says what you more want to get done, and less HOW to get it done.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s great and it&#8217;s already transforming the way that I think.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;and maybe this is addressed in later chapters that I&#8217;ve not read yet&#8230;I can&#8217;t read stuff like this without thinking about simplicity and performance. Here&#8217;s me wanting to do some simple transformations on some arrays, and I need to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>use composer to pull down the package that contains the Collection class;<\/li>\n<li>load an autoloader that loads the dependencies;<\/li>\n<li>probably, in doing so, include a load of code that I&#8217;m never going to run.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And thats before we even write a line of code. Once we have some code written using collections, method chaining, etc, then because I&#8217;m using other people&#8217;s implementations of higher-order functions, I&#8217;m totally removed from how efficient and scalable that code is.<\/p>\n<p>This is a more general problem with declarative programming. It&#8217;s really nice and easy to read, but you don&#8217;t have the implementation detail. So how are you to know if using these collections going to make code that scales?<\/p>\n<p>I find myself thinking &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t collections part of the standard library of PHP?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because, PHP isn&#8217;t a declarative language, it&#8217;s an imperative language. Adding collections to it is a fudge that makes it something that it isn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>So if you really want to do declarative programming nicely, you have two options: use a different language (options limited), or pile layer upon layer of abstraction on top of an existing language to make it something that it isn&#8217;t (options many and varied!).<\/p>\n<p>Which is exactly what we do with JavaScript: all these frameworks and transpilers that we have are really compensating for the fact that vanilla JavaScript is a terribly loose language that needs additional structure and discipline put on top of it to make it something you can work with.<\/p>\n<p>I do lament that the web &#8211; and that I specifically &#8211; ended up with PHP and JavaScript. And I long to learn Elm (yes, complied to JS) or Ruby or Go or Python instead.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m pragmatic too. PHP and JavaScript are the tools I have to work with right now until I learn something new.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I love that coding is so easy and accessible and these open languages have transformed my life for the better. I&#8217;m also really enjoying Refactoring to Collections and it will transform how I code. And I&#8217;m indebted to and hugely respectful of the open source project creators and maintainers and documenters and book writers that make things like <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/illuminate\/support\">illuminate\/support<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/\">Laravel<\/a>, PHP itself, WordPress, Drupal, heck <a href=\"https:\/\/jquery.com\/\">jQuery<\/a> and all the JavaScript libraries and frameworks and&nbsp;stuff that makes so many amazing things possible and easy.<\/p>\n<p>This is just a pedantic, ex-<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SPARK_(programming_language)\">SPARK95<\/a>-coder&#8217;s rant, wishing that we could choose base-level tools and languages that help us write better code in the first place, inspired by <a href=\"https:\/\/jaco.by\/2016\/08\/04\/todays-software-is-terrible\/\">JJJ<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jasonyeojs\/status\/760456348211433472\">guy who (allegedly) couldn&#8217;t deploy an app because Angular had 40,000 files in it<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It can be better. Software really, doesn&#8217;t have to be terrible.<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p><em>TL;DR: We&#8217;re coding for the web all wrong. And it&#8217;s mostly because of the languages we&#8217;re using. We&#8217;re piling hack upon hack upon hack. Good&nbsp;coding principles and practices are becoming more common in web development, but I can&#8217;t help wishing&nbsp;we could take a few steps back and start with tools that help us write better code in the first place.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>WARNING: contains opinions. &nbsp;Some of which may be uninformed.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone involved in software that knows me well will know a couple of things about me:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I have a different approach to web development&nbsp;than a lot of people &#8211; mostly because I have a background in safety critical software, which is written very differently to code for a website.<\/li>\n<li>Despite that background, I&#8217;m pretty pragmatic. Horses are for courses. Tools are just tools.<\/li>\n<li>(Because of that background) l hate JavaScript. Any language that guesses what you want to do seems to me to be unhelpful. PHP is better, but far from perfect.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I mostly write PHP for back end code&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">because<\/span> I&#8217;m pragmatic. It&#8217;s not perfect. It&#8217;s slow. It promotes better discipline than JavaScript. But it&#8217;s also relatively accessible, hugely widespread, easy to deploy.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m always looking to write better PHP. Which is why I&#8217;m currently reading <a href=\"https:\/\/adamwathan.me\/refactoring-to-collections\/\">Adam Wathan&#8217;s Refactoring to Collections<\/a>. A book which tries to apply some declarative&nbsp;programming principles to PHP coding. &nbsp;This, in short, means he&#8217;s come up with some nice ways to write code that says what you more want to get done, and less HOW to get it done.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s great and it&#8217;s already transforming the way that I think.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;and maybe this is addressed in later chapters that I&#8217;ve not read yet&#8230;I can&#8217;t read stuff like this without thinking about simplicity and performance. Here&#8217;s me wanting to do some simple transformations on some arrays, and I need to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>use composer to pull down the package that contains the Collection class;<\/li>\n<li>load an autoloader that loads the dependencies;<\/li>\n<li>probably, in doing so, include a load of code that I&#8217;m never going to run.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And thats before we even write a line of code. Once we have some code written using collections, method chaining, etc, then because I&#8217;m using other people&#8217;s implementations of higher-order functions, I&#8217;m totally removed from how efficient and scalable that code is.<\/p>\n<p>This is a more general problem with declarative programming. It&#8217;s really nice and easy to read, but you don&#8217;t have the implementation detail. So how are you to know if using these collections going to make code that scales?<\/p>\n<p>I find myself thinking &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t collections part of the standard library of PHP?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because, PHP isn&#8217;t a declarative language, it&#8217;s an imperative language. Adding collections to it is a fudge that makes it something that it isn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>So if you really want to do declarative programming nicely, you have two options: use a different language (options limited), or pile layer upon layer of abstraction on top of an existing language to make it something that it isn&#8217;t (options many and varied!).<\/p>\n<p>Which is exactly what we do with JavaScript: all these frameworks and transpilers that we have are really compensating for the fact that vanilla JavaScript is a terribly loose language that needs additional structure and discipline put on top of it to make it something you can work with.<\/p>\n<p>I do lament that the web &#8211; and that I specifically &#8211; ended up with PHP and JavaScript. And I long to learn Elm (yes, complied to JS) or Ruby or Go or Python instead.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m pragmatic too. PHP and JavaScript are the tools I have to work with right now until I learn something new.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I love that coding is so easy and accessible and these open languages have transformed my life for the better. I&#8217;m also really enjoying Refactoring to Collections and it will transform how I code. And I&#8217;m indebted to and hugely respectful of the open source project creators and maintainers and documenters and book writers that make things like <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/illuminate\/support\">illuminate\/support<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/\">Laravel<\/a>, PHP itself, WordPress, Drupal, heck <a href=\"https:\/\/jquery.com\/\">jQuery<\/a> and all the JavaScript libraries and frameworks and&nbsp;stuff that makes so many amazing things possible and easy.<\/p>\n<p>This is just a pedantic, ex-<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SPARK_(programming_language)\">SPARK95<\/a>-coder&#8217;s rant, wishing that we could choose base-level tools and languages that help us write better code in the first place, inspired by <a href=\"https:\/\/jaco.by\/2016\/08\/04\/todays-software-is-terrible\/\">JJJ<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jasonyeojs\/status\/760456348211433472\">guy who (allegedly) couldn&#8217;t deploy an app because Angular had 40,000 files in it<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It can be better.

                "rendered": "<p>Fact: I just switched my cloud storage solution&#8217;s billing from monthly to annual and paid for a year up front. Why? Well, mostly because of the volatile pound.<\/p>\n<p>If you run a non-UK-based subscription service, such as a SAAS or product with software licensing, this could be a good marketing opportunity that could pay for your summer holiday, and here&#8217;s why.<\/p>\n<h3>In? Out? Shake it all about?<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure how widely it&#8217;s known in the rest of the world, but the UK is currently part of a thing called the European Union (EU), which essentially means we share some administration and trade and free-movement agreements with the rest of Europe.<\/p>\n<p>And on June 23rd we&#8217;re having a referendum on our membership of the EU. And <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589\">the polls are showing it to be a Very Close Thing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m no economics expert, but I know that market stability is based very much on understanding what the future will look like politically and economically. And the uncertainty about the EU is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/volatile-pound-underscores-market-jitters-as-brexit-vote-looms-1465326028\">making our currency a little volatile<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, many important and far more knowledgable people than I have said that there is a significant economic risk to leaving: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-36273448\">the governor of the bank of England<\/a>, our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36459451\">prime minister<\/a>, our &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2016\/may\/25\/ifs-brexit-extend-austerity-budget-deficit-eu-referendum\">Institute for Fiscal Studies<\/a>&#8220;, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/news\/politics\/670496\/Angela-Markel-EU-referendum-needless-risk-David-Cameron\">German Chanellor<\/a>, and others.<\/p>\n<p>And if there&#8217;s an economic shock, then our pound will almost certainly fall.<\/p>\n<h3>Give me deals!<\/h3>\n<p>If the pound falls, it become expensive for me to buy things in other currencies.<\/p>\n<p>So I can get some insurance on price by buying things in other currencies now.<\/p>\n<p>So I went annual with my cloud storage to minimise the risk of it becoming more expensive. And as I did so I was thinking &#8220;what other services might I be able to extend for a year at this point?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>And I just wondered if there&#8217;s something in here that&#8217;s helpful for software\/service providers and their customers: offer them a &#8220;Pre-Brexit Price Risk-Reduction renewal&#8221; and allow them to extend their subscriptions for a year before the 23rd June, regardless of their renewal date.<\/p>\n<p>It could get you some cash in the bank\u00a0and some happy customers if you get it right!<\/p>\n",

Out? Shake it all about?<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure how widely it&#8217;s known in the rest of the world, but the UK is currently part of a thing called the European Union (EU), which essentially means we share some administration and trade and free-movement agreements with the rest of Europe.<\/p>\n<p>And on June 23rd we&#8217;re having a referendum on our membership of the EU. And <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589\">the polls are showing it to be a Very Close Thing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m no economics expert, but I know that market stability is based very much on understanding what the future will look like politically and economically. And the uncertainty about the EU is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/volatile-pound-underscores-market-jitters-as-brexit-vote-looms-1465326028\">making our currency a little volatile<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, many important and far more knowledgable people than I have said that there is a significant economic risk to leaving: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-36273448\">the governor of the bank of England<\/a>, our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36459451\">prime minister<\/a>, our &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2016\/may\/25\/ifs-brexit-extend-austerity-budget-deficit-eu-referendum\">Institute for Fiscal Studies<\/a>&#8220;, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/news\/politics\/670496\/Angela-Markel-EU-referendum-needless-risk-David-Cameron\">German Chanellor<\/a>, and others.<\/p>\n<p>And if there&#8217;s an economic shock, then our pound will almost certainly fall.<\/p>\n<h3>Give me deals!<\/h3>\n<p>If the pound falls, it become expensive for me to buy things in other currencies.<\/p>\n<p>So I can get some insurance on price by buying things in other currencies now.<\/p>\n<p>So I went annual with my cloud storage to minimise the risk of it becoming more expensive. And as I did so I was thinking &#8220;what other services might I be able to extend for a year at this point?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>And I just wondered if there&#8217;s something in here that&#8217;s helpful for software\/service providers and their customers: offer them a &#8220;Pre-Brexit Price Risk-Reduction renewal&#8221; and allow them to extend their subscriptions for a year before the 23rd June, regardless of their renewal date.<\/p>\n<p>It could get you some cash in the bank\u00a0and some happy customers if you get it right!<\/p>\n",

And its seeds are cunningly designed &#8211; though I&#8217;m not sure if their purpose is to blow away in the wind, or to be carried and blown around by small children. Both appear to be effective strategies.<\/p>\n",

You might be happier this way.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m not anti-growth, but growth seems to be the measure by which all businesses are judged. However,\u00a0definitions of success can vary.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Startups&#8221; &#8211; defined, by me as companies intending to take on investment, grow fast, and head for exit or acquisition &#8211; seem to get all the news, either by failing tragically, or by &#8211; in very rare cases &#8211; succeeding.<\/p>\n<p>And it bothers me that the many hundreds and thousands of happy and successful lifestyle businesses don&#8217;t get press. Businesses bootstrapped with the founders&#8217; money and time; profitable businesses with no debt; businesses that have happy owners doing something they enjoy and are good at; businesses that make enough money for their owners to have a good living; businesses that pay taxes, and are often ethical and give back to society and local communities.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d love to hear more stories about these kind of businesses and less glorification of &#8220;Startups&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a successful, small scale lifestyle business, tell us what you make or do, and how you work in the comments.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I have post that&#8217;s been brewing for a long time about Startup culture and it&#8217;s a topic I seem to be having more and more conversations about.<\/p>\n<p>Jason Fried &#8211; the founder of Basecamp, the project management software company &#8211; was quoted in the latest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/smashing-newsletter-issue-156\/\">Smashing Magazine newsletter<\/a> summed it up somewhat:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"s1\">With a niche and a good customer base, you can build a successful product, without &#8220;angel&#8221; investors and exponential growth in hiring. Maybe sometimes it&#8217;s not necessary at all.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s2\">We&#8217;ve all seen company owners rushing from one big idea to another, thinking of acquisition meetings and exit strategies too early. Instead, you should create, design, build and nourish the product you love (and stay with it!) \u2014 with or without venture capital. You might be happier this way.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m not anti-growth, but growth seems to be the measure by which all businesses are judged. However,\u00a0definitions of success can vary.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Startups&#8221; &#8211; defined, by me as companies intending to take on investment, grow fast, and head for exit or acquisition &#8211; seem to get all the news, either by failing tragically, or by &#8211; in very rare cases &#8211; succeeding.<\/p>\n<p>And it bothers me that the many hundreds and thousands of happy and successful lifestyle businesses don&#8217;t get press. Businesses bootstrapped with the founders&#8217; money and time; profitable businesses with no debt; businesses that have happy owners doing something they enjoy and are good at; businesses that make enough money for their owners to have a good living; businesses that pay taxes, and are often ethical and give back to society and local communities.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d love to hear more stories about these kind of businesses and less glorification of &#8220;Startups&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a successful, small scale lifestyle business, tell us what you make or do, and how you work in the comments.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",
