Consider this \u201cconstructive feedback\u201d, and I hope you\u2019ll laugh along.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, and welcome to this episode of The Podcast Podcast. The Podcast that tells you about the Podcast about Podcasts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later\n on we\u2019ll tell you about this week\u2019s podcast, but I want to start today \nby telling you all about last weeks podcast which was mostly all about \nlast weeks podcast, but also told you a bit about the week before\u2019s \npodcast, and even, excitingly, gave you a look ahead to this week\u2019s \npodcast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If\n you\u2019ve not already listened then you really should and make sure that \nyou review it on iTunes, share it with all your friends, and subscribe \nin your favourite podcast app so that you never miss and episode.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now\n before I tell you about this week\u2019s podcast we just need to take a \nquick sponsor break but we\u2019ll be back soon with this week\u2019s podcast and \nif you can hold on long enough we may even give a teaser later on of \nwhat in next week\u2019s podcast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll be back after the break.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s sponsor is AudioChimp\u2026.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome\n back to The Podcast Podcast. Before the break we told you what would be\n coming up after the break, which we\u2019ll get to in a minute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s\n episode is actually a listener question. Our listener Chas is an avid \nfollower of The Podcast Podcast and I\u2019d just like to say thank you, \nChas, for listening. The podcast wouldn\u2019t be what it is without our \nlisteners and I\u2019d like to thank each and everyone of them for \nsubscribing and listening and submitting questions. It\u2019s people like \nChas that make The Podcast Podcast worthwhile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So\n Chas submitted a question via The Podcast Podcast website, which is on \npodcastpodcast.not, or you can contact us on Twitter at @podcastpodcast \nwhich you can also do if you have a question. Not all of our episodes \nare listener questions, but they give us something to talk about when \nwe\u2019ve run out of ideas of our own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chas\n actually submitted a question previously on The Podcast Podcast, and if\n you want to hear that then you can look up episode 32 on iTunes or on \nour website at podcastpodcast.lol. It\u2019s truly hard to believe that we\u2019ve\n now been going for 68 episodes and next week we\u2019re expecting to hit \n100,000 downloads which is JUST amazing. I\u2019m so grateful to everyone \nthat listens to the show. It started as just a stupid thing in my spare \ntime, and has now grown into this huge network of podcasts which is just\n incredible. And it\u2019s our goal to provide you with a stack of \ninteresting content week-by-week. So make sure you look up our other \npodcasts too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking\n of interesting content, that\u2019s exactly what Chas\u2019s question is about. \nChas asks \u201cWhy is there not more content on The Podcast Podcast?\u201d. Well,\n Chas, this is a great question, and we\u2019ll answer it after the break \nwhen we\u2019ll come back and actually answer your question and give a teaser\n for next week\u2019s episode.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t go away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week\u2019s second sponsor is Mail Ocean\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome\n back to The Podcast Podcast. Before the break we told you about \nlong-term Podcast Podcast listener Chas\u2019 listener question, and how we \nwere going to answer his question after the last break. So that\u2019s what \nwe\u2019re about to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll remember that Chas\u2019 question was \u201cWhy is there not more content on The Podcast Podcast?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well\n the answer, Chas, is that sponsorship is really important for podcasts \nbecause it pays us to make them. So I\u2019m sure you totally understand the \nneed for that. But as for why we can\u2019t just run an ad, get on with the \ncontent, and then run another ad at the end? Well, I really don\u2019t know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that answers your question Chas and thanks for submitting it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So\n today we\u2019ve looked at what we were going to speak about today, told you\n lots about this podcast, and spent a short time answering a listener \nquestion. In a moment we\u2019re going to tell you about next week\u2019s podcast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But\n first don\u2019t forget that if you, like Chas, have a question for The \nPodcast Podcast then you can submit it through our website at \npodcastpodcast.not, or ask us via Twitter at @podcastpodcast<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next\n week on The Podcast Podcast, we\u2019re going to talk about this week\u2019s \npodcast, next week\u2019s podcast, and maybe even look ahead to the following\n week\u2019s podcast. We\u2019ll even throw in the usual segments where we ask you\n to share our podcast and rate it on iTunes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for listening to The Podcast Podcast, and see you next time!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n",

Here\u2019s a transcript of how not to make a boring piece of audio. With apologies to anyone that makes podcasts\u200a\u2014\u200aI actually admire and respect your work. Consider this \u201cconstructive feedback\u201d, and I hope you\u2019ll laugh along.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, and welcome to this episode of The Podcast Podcast. The Podcast that tells you about the Podcast about Podcasts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later\n on we\u2019ll tell you about this week\u2019s podcast, but I want to start today \nby telling you all about last weeks podcast which was mostly all about \nlast weeks podcast, but also told you a bit about the week before\u2019s \npodcast, and even, excitingly, gave you a look ahead to this week\u2019s \npodcast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If\n you\u2019ve not already listened then you really should and make sure that \nyou review it on iTunes, share it with all your friends, and subscribe \nin your favourite podcast app so that you never miss and episode.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now\n before I tell you about this week\u2019s podcast we just need to take a \nquick sponsor break but we\u2019ll be back soon with this week\u2019s podcast and \nif you can hold on long enough we may even give a teaser later on of \nwhat in next week\u2019s podcast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll be back after the break.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s sponsor is AudioChimp\u2026.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome\n back to The Podcast Podcast. Before the break we told you what would be\n coming up after the break, which we\u2019ll get to in a minute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s\n episode is actually a listener question. Our listener Chas is an avid \nfollower of The Podcast Podcast and I\u2019d just like to say thank you, \nChas, for listening. The podcast wouldn\u2019t be what it is without our \nlisteners and I\u2019d like to thank each and everyone of them for \nsubscribing and listening and submitting questions. It\u2019s people like \nChas that make The Podcast Podcast worthwhile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So\n Chas submitted a question via The Podcast Podcast website, which is on \npodcastpodcast.not, or you can contact us on Twitter at @podcastpodcast \nwhich you can also do if you have a question. Not all of our episodes \nare listener questions, but they give us something to talk about when \nwe\u2019ve run out of ideas of our own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chas\n actually submitted a question previously on The Podcast Podcast, and if\n you want to hear that then you can look up episode 32 on iTunes or on \nour website at podcastpodcast.lol. It\u2019s truly hard to believe that we\u2019ve\n now been going for 68 episodes and next week we\u2019re expecting to hit \n100,000 downloads which is JUST amazing. I\u2019m so grateful to everyone \nthat listens to the show. It started as just a stupid thing in my spare \ntime, and has now grown into this huge network of podcasts which is just\n incredible. And it\u2019s our goal to provide you with a stack of \ninteresting content week-by-week. So make sure you look up our other \npodcasts too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking\n of interesting content, that\u2019s exactly what Chas\u2019s question is about. \nChas asks \u201cWhy is there not more content on The Podcast Podcast?\u201d. Well,\n Chas, this is a great question, and we\u2019ll answer it after the break \nwhen we\u2019ll come back and actually answer your question and give a teaser\n for next week\u2019s episode.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t go away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week\u2019s second sponsor is Mail Ocean\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome\n back to The Podcast Podcast. Before the break we told you about \nlong-term Podcast Podcast listener Chas\u2019 listener question, and how we \nwere going to answer his question after the last break. So that\u2019s what \nwe\u2019re about to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll remember that Chas\u2019 question was \u201cWhy is there not more content on The Podcast Podcast?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well\n the answer, Chas, is that sponsorship is really important for podcasts \nbecause it pays us to make them. So I\u2019m sure you totally understand the \nneed for that. But as for why we can\u2019t just run an ad, get on with the \ncontent, and then run another ad at the end? Well, I really don\u2019t know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that answers your question Chas and thanks for submitting it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So\n today we\u2019ve looked at what we were going to speak about today, told you\n lots about this podcast, and spent a short time answering a listener \nquestion. In a moment we\u2019re going to tell you about next week\u2019s podcast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But\n first don\u2019t forget that if you, like Chas, have a question for The \nPodcast Podcast then you can submit it through our website at \npodcastpodcast.not, or ask us via Twitter at @podcastpodcast<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next\n week on The Podcast Podcast, we\u2019re going to talk about this week\u2019s \npodcast, next week\u2019s podcast, and maybe even look ahead to the following\n week\u2019s podcast. We\u2019ll even throw in the usual segments where we ask you\n to share our podcast and rate it on iTunes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for listening to The Podcast Podcast, and see you next time!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n",

Good&nbsp;coding principles and practices are becoming more common in web development, but I can&#8217;t help wishing&nbsp;we could take a few steps back and start with tools that help us write better code in the first place.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>WARNING: contains opinions. &nbsp;Some of which may be uninformed.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone involved in software that knows me well will know a couple of things about me:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I have a different approach to web development&nbsp;than a lot of people &#8211; mostly because I have a background in safety critical software, which is written very differently to code for a website.<\/li>\n<li>Despite that background, I&#8217;m pretty pragmatic. Horses are for courses. Tools are just tools.<\/li>\n<li>(Because of that background) l hate JavaScript. Any language that guesses what you want to do seems to me to be unhelpful. PHP is better, but far from perfect.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I mostly write PHP for back end code&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">because<\/span> I&#8217;m pragmatic. It&#8217;s not perfect. It&#8217;s slow. It promotes better discipline than JavaScript. But it&#8217;s also relatively accessible, hugely widespread, easy to deploy.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m always looking to write better PHP. Which is why I&#8217;m currently reading <a href=\"https:\/\/adamwathan.me\/refactoring-to-collections\/\">Adam Wathan&#8217;s Refactoring to Collections<\/a>. A book which tries to apply some declarative&nbsp;programming principles to PHP coding. &nbsp;This, in short, means he&#8217;s come up with some nice ways to write code that says what you more want to get done, and less HOW to get it done.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s great and it&#8217;s already transforming the way that I think.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;and maybe this is addressed in later chapters that I&#8217;ve not read yet&#8230;I can&#8217;t read stuff like this without thinking about simplicity and performance. Here&#8217;s me wanting to do some simple transformations on some arrays, and I need to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>use composer to pull down the package that contains the Collection class;<\/li>\n<li>load an autoloader that loads the dependencies;<\/li>\n<li>probably, in doing so, include a load of code that I&#8217;m never going to run.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And thats before we even write a line of code. Once we have some code written using collections, method chaining, etc, then because I&#8217;m using other people&#8217;s implementations of higher-order functions, I&#8217;m totally removed from how efficient and scalable that code is.<\/p>\n<p>This is a more general problem with declarative programming. It&#8217;s really nice and easy to read, but you don&#8217;t have the implementation detail. So how are you to know if using these collections going to make code that scales?<\/p>\n<p>I find myself thinking &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t collections part of the standard library of PHP?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because, PHP isn&#8217;t a declarative language, it&#8217;s an imperative language. Adding collections to it is a fudge that makes it something that it isn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>So if you really want to do declarative programming nicely, you have two options: use a different language (options limited), or pile layer upon layer of abstraction on top of an existing language to make it something that it isn&#8217;t (options many and varied!).<\/p>\n<p>Which is exactly what we do with JavaScript: all these frameworks and transpilers that we have are really compensating for the fact that vanilla JavaScript is a terribly loose language that needs additional structure and discipline put on top of it to make it something you can work with.<\/p>\n<p>I do lament that the web &#8211; and that I specifically &#8211; ended up with PHP and JavaScript. And I long to learn Elm (yes, complied to JS) or Ruby or Go or Python instead.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m pragmatic too. PHP and JavaScript are the tools I have to work with right now until I learn something new.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I love that coding is so easy and accessible and these open languages have transformed my life for the better. I&#8217;m also really enjoying Refactoring to Collections and it will transform how I code. And I&#8217;m indebted to and hugely respectful of the open source project creators and maintainers and documenters and book writers that make things like <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/illuminate\/support\">illuminate\/support<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/\">Laravel<\/a>, PHP itself, WordPress, Drupal, heck <a href=\"https:\/\/jquery.com\/\">jQuery<\/a> and all the JavaScript libraries and frameworks and&nbsp;stuff that makes so many amazing things possible and easy.<\/p>\n<p>This is just a pedantic, ex-<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SPARK_(programming_language)\">SPARK95<\/a>-coder&#8217;s rant, wishing that we could choose base-level tools and languages that help us write better code in the first place, inspired by <a href=\"https:\/\/jaco.by\/2016\/08\/04\/todays-software-is-terrible\/\">JJJ<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jasonyeojs\/status\/760456348211433472\">guy who (allegedly) couldn&#8217;t deploy an app because Angular had 40,000 files in it<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It can be better.

        "content": "<p><em>TL;DR: We&#8217;re coding for the web all wrong. And it&#8217;s mostly because of the languages we&#8217;re using. We&#8217;re piling hack upon hack upon hack. Good&nbsp;coding principles and practices are becoming more common in web development, but I can&#8217;t help wishing&nbsp;we could take a few steps back and start with tools that help us write better code in the first place.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>WARNING: contains opinions. &nbsp;Some of which may be uninformed.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone involved in software that knows me well will know a couple of things about me:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I have a different approach to web development&nbsp;than a lot of people &#8211; mostly because I have a background in safety critical software, which is written very differently to code for a website.<\/li>\n<li>Despite that background, I&#8217;m pretty pragmatic. Horses are for courses. Tools are just tools.<\/li>\n<li>(Because of that background) l hate JavaScript. Any language that guesses what you want to do seems to me to be unhelpful. PHP is better, but far from perfect.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I mostly write PHP for back end code&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">because<\/span> I&#8217;m pragmatic. It&#8217;s not perfect. It&#8217;s slow. It promotes better discipline than JavaScript. But it&#8217;s also relatively accessible, hugely widespread, easy to deploy.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m always looking to write better PHP. Which is why I&#8217;m currently reading <a href=\"https:\/\/adamwathan.me\/refactoring-to-collections\/\">Adam Wathan&#8217;s Refactoring to Collections<\/a>. A book which tries to apply some declarative&nbsp;programming principles to PHP coding. &nbsp;This, in short, means he&#8217;s come up with some nice ways to write code that says what you more want to get done, and less HOW to get it done.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s great and it&#8217;s already transforming the way that I think.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;and maybe this is addressed in later chapters that I&#8217;ve not read yet&#8230;I can&#8217;t read stuff like this without thinking about simplicity and performance. Here&#8217;s me wanting to do some simple transformations on some arrays, and I need to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>use composer to pull down the package that contains the Collection class;<\/li>\n<li>load an autoloader that loads the dependencies;<\/li>\n<li>probably, in doing so, include a load of code that I&#8217;m never going to run.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And thats before we even write a line of code. Once we have some code written using collections, method chaining, etc, then because I&#8217;m using other people&#8217;s implementations of higher-order functions, I&#8217;m totally removed from how efficient and scalable that code is.<\/p>\n<p>This is a more general problem with declarative programming. It&#8217;s really nice and easy to read, but you don&#8217;t have the implementation detail. So how are you to know if using these collections going to make code that scales?<\/p>\n<p>I find myself thinking &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t collections part of the standard library of PHP?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because, PHP isn&#8217;t a declarative language, it&#8217;s an imperative language. Adding collections to it is a fudge that makes it something that it isn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>So if you really want to do declarative programming nicely, you have two options: use a different language (options limited), or pile layer upon layer of abstraction on top of an existing language to make it something that it isn&#8217;t (options many and varied!).<\/p>\n<p>Which is exactly what we do with JavaScript: all these frameworks and transpilers that we have are really compensating for the fact that vanilla JavaScript is a terribly loose language that needs additional structure and discipline put on top of it to make it something you can work with.<\/p>\n<p>I do lament that the web &#8211; and that I specifically &#8211; ended up with PHP and JavaScript. And I long to learn Elm (yes, complied to JS) or Ruby or Go or Python instead.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m pragmatic too. PHP and JavaScript are the tools I have to work with right now until I learn something new.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I love that coding is so easy and accessible and these open languages have transformed my life for the better. I&#8217;m also really enjoying Refactoring to Collections and it will transform how I code. And I&#8217;m indebted to and hugely respectful of the open source project creators and maintainers and documenters and book writers that make things like <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/illuminate\/support\">illuminate\/support<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/\">Laravel<\/a>, PHP itself, WordPress, Drupal, heck <a href=\"https:\/\/jquery.com\/\">jQuery<\/a> and all the JavaScript libraries and frameworks and&nbsp;stuff that makes so many amazing things possible and easy.<\/p>\n<p>This is just a pedantic, ex-<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SPARK_(programming_language)\">SPARK95<\/a>-coder&#8217;s rant, wishing that we could choose base-level tools and languages that help us write better code in the first place, inspired by <a href=\"https:\/\/jaco.by\/2016\/08\/04\/todays-software-is-terrible\/\">JJJ<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jasonyeojs\/status\/760456348211433472\">guy who (allegedly) couldn&#8217;t deploy an app because Angular had 40,000 files in it<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It can be better.

                "rendered": "<p>Fact: I just switched my cloud storage solution&#8217;s billing from monthly to annual and paid for a year up front. Why? Well, mostly because of the volatile pound.<\/p>\n<p>If you run a non-UK-based subscription service, such as a SAAS or product with software licensing, this could be a good marketing opportunity that could pay for your summer holiday, and here&#8217;s why.<\/p>\n<h3>In? Out? Shake it all about?<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure how widely it&#8217;s known in the rest of the world, but the UK is currently part of a thing called the European Union (EU), which essentially means we share some administration and trade and free-movement agreements with the rest of Europe.<\/p>\n<p>And on June 23rd we&#8217;re having a referendum on our membership of the EU. And <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589\">the polls are showing it to be a Very Close Thing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m no economics expert, but I know that market stability is based very much on understanding what the future will look like politically and economically. And the uncertainty about the EU is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/volatile-pound-underscores-market-jitters-as-brexit-vote-looms-1465326028\">making our currency a little volatile<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, many important and far more knowledgable people than I have said that there is a significant economic risk to leaving: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-36273448\">the governor of the bank of England<\/a>, our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36459451\">prime minister<\/a>, our &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2016\/may\/25\/ifs-brexit-extend-austerity-budget-deficit-eu-referendum\">Institute for Fiscal Studies<\/a>&#8220;, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/news\/politics\/670496\/Angela-Markel-EU-referendum-needless-risk-David-Cameron\">German Chanellor<\/a>, and others.<\/p>\n<p>And if there&#8217;s an economic shock, then our pound will almost certainly fall.<\/p>\n<h3>Give me deals!<\/h3>\n<p>If the pound falls, it become expensive for me to buy things in other currencies.<\/p>\n<p>So I can get some insurance on price by buying things in other currencies now.<\/p>\n<p>So I went annual with my cloud storage to minimise the risk of it becoming more expensive. And as I did so I was thinking &#8220;what other services might I be able to extend for a year at this point?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>And I just wondered if there&#8217;s something in here that&#8217;s helpful for software\/service providers and their customers: offer them a &#8220;Pre-Brexit Price Risk-Reduction renewal&#8221; and allow them to extend their subscriptions for a year before the 23rd June, regardless of their renewal date.<\/p>\n<p>It could get you some cash in the bank\u00a0and some happy customers if you get it right!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Fact: I just switched my cloud storage solution&#8217;s billing from monthly to annual and paid for a year up front. Why? Well, mostly because of the volatile pound.<\/p>\n<p>If you run a non-UK-based subscription service, such as a SAAS or product with software licensing, this could be a good marketing opportunity that could pay for your summer holiday, and here&#8217;s why.<\/p>\n<h3>In? Out? Shake it all about?<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure how widely it&#8217;s known in the rest of the world, but the UK is currently part of a thing called the European Union (EU), which essentially means we share some administration and trade and free-movement agreements with the rest of Europe.<\/p>\n<p>And on June 23rd we&#8217;re having a referendum on our membership of the EU. And <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589\">the polls are showing it to be a Very Close Thing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m no economics expert, but I know that market stability is based very much on understanding what the future will look like politically and economically. And the uncertainty about the EU is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/volatile-pound-underscores-market-jitters-as-brexit-vote-looms-1465326028\">making our currency a little volatile<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, many important and far more knowledgable people than I have said that there is a significant economic risk to leaving: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-36273448\">the governor of the bank of England<\/a>, our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36459451\">prime minister<\/a>, our &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2016\/may\/25\/ifs-brexit-extend-austerity-budget-deficit-eu-referendum\">Institute for Fiscal Studies<\/a>&#8220;, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/news\/politics\/670496\/Angela-Markel-EU-referendum-needless-risk-David-Cameron\">German Chanellor<\/a>, and others.<\/p>\n<p>And if there&#8217;s an economic shock, then our pound will almost certainly fall.<\/p>\n<h3>Give me deals!<\/h3>\n<p>If the pound falls, it become expensive for me to buy things in other currencies.<\/p>\n<p>So I can get some insurance on price by buying things in other currencies now.<\/p>\n<p>So I went annual with my cloud storage to minimise the risk of it becoming more expensive. And as I did so I was thinking &#8220;what other services might I be able to extend for a year at this point?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>And I just wondered if there&#8217;s something in here that&#8217;s helpful for software\/service providers and their customers: offer them a &#8220;Pre-Brexit Price Risk-Reduction renewal&#8221; and allow them to extend their subscriptions for a year before the 23rd June, regardless of their renewal date.<\/p>\n<p>It could get you some cash in the bank\u00a0and some happy customers if you get it right!<\/p>\n",

Tiny-but-perfect muscles powered by her extraordinary miniature cardiovascular system, pull thread-like tendons to move the complex arrangement of small bones. It&#8217;s not just a marvel of construction, but a sign of future potential: what will these hands do? What will they make? Who will they hold?<\/p>\n",
