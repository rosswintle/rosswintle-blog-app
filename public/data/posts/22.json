                "rendered": "<p>Fact: I just switched my cloud storage solution&#8217;s billing from monthly to annual and paid for a year up front. Why? Well, mostly because of the volatile pound.<\/p>\n<p>If you run a non-UK-based subscription service, such as a SAAS or product with software licensing, this could be a good marketing opportunity that could pay for your summer holiday, and here&#8217;s why.<\/p>\n<h3>In? Out? Shake it all about?<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure how widely it&#8217;s known in the rest of the world, but the UK is currently part of a thing called the European Union (EU), which essentially means we share some administration and trade and free-movement agreements with the rest of Europe.<\/p>\n<p>And on June 23rd we&#8217;re having a referendum on our membership of the EU. And <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589\">the polls are showing it to be a Very Close Thing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m no economics expert, but I know that market stability is based very much on understanding what the future will look like politically and economically. And the uncertainty about the EU is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/volatile-pound-underscores-market-jitters-as-brexit-vote-looms-1465326028\">making our currency a little volatile<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, many important and far more knowledgable people than I have said that there is a significant economic risk to leaving: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-36273448\">the governor of the bank of England<\/a>, our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36459451\">prime minister<\/a>, our &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2016\/may\/25\/ifs-brexit-extend-austerity-budget-deficit-eu-referendum\">Institute for Fiscal Studies<\/a>&#8220;, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/news\/politics\/670496\/Angela-Markel-EU-referendum-needless-risk-David-Cameron\">German Chanellor<\/a>, and others.<\/p>\n<p>And if there&#8217;s an economic shock, then our pound will almost certainly fall.<\/p>\n<h3>Give me deals!<\/h3>\n<p>If the pound falls, it become expensive for me to buy things in other currencies.<\/p>\n<p>So I can get some insurance on price by buying things in other currencies now.<\/p>\n<p>So I went annual with my cloud storage to minimise the risk of it becoming more expensive. And as I did so I was thinking &#8220;what other services might I be able to extend for a year at this point?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>And I just wondered if there&#8217;s something in here that&#8217;s helpful for software\/service providers and their customers: offer them a &#8220;Pre-Brexit Price Risk-Reduction renewal&#8221; and allow them to extend their subscriptions for a year before the 23rd June, regardless of their renewal date.<\/p>\n<p>It could get you some cash in the bank\u00a0and some happy customers if you get it right!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Fact: I just switched my cloud storage solution&#8217;s billing from monthly to annual and paid for a year up front. Why? Well, mostly because of the volatile pound.<\/p>\n<p>If you run a non-UK-based subscription service, such as a SAAS or product with software licensing, this could be a good marketing opportunity that could pay for your summer holiday, and here&#8217;s why.<\/p>\n<h3>In? Out? Shake it all about?<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure how widely it&#8217;s known in the rest of the world, but the UK is currently part of a thing called the European Union (EU), which essentially means we share some administration and trade and free-movement agreements with the rest of Europe.<\/p>\n<p>And on June 23rd we&#8217;re having a referendum on our membership of the EU. And <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589\">the polls are showing it to be a Very Close Thing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m no economics expert, but I know that market stability is based very much on understanding what the future will look like politically and economically. And the uncertainty about the EU is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/volatile-pound-underscores-market-jitters-as-brexit-vote-looms-1465326028\">making our currency a little volatile<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, many important and far more knowledgable people than I have said that there is a significant economic risk to leaving: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-36273448\">the governor of the bank of England<\/a>, our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36459451\">prime minister<\/a>, our &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/business\/2016\/may\/25\/ifs-brexit-extend-austerity-budget-deficit-eu-referendum\">Institute for Fiscal Studies<\/a>&#8220;, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/news\/politics\/670496\/Angela-Markel-EU-referendum-needless-risk-David-Cameron\">German Chanellor<\/a>, and others.<\/p>\n<p>And if there&#8217;s an economic shock, then our pound will almost certainly fall.<\/p>\n<h3>Give me deals!<\/h3>\n<p>If the pound falls, it become expensive for me to buy things in other currencies.<\/p>\n<p>So I can get some insurance on price by buying things in other currencies now.<\/p>\n<p>So I went annual with my cloud storage to minimise the risk of it becoming more expensive. And as I did so I was thinking &#8220;what other services might I be able to extend for a year at this point?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>And I just wondered if there&#8217;s something in here that&#8217;s helpful for software\/service providers and their customers: offer them a &#8220;Pre-Brexit Price Risk-Reduction renewal&#8221; and allow them to extend their subscriptions for a year before the 23rd June, regardless of their renewal date.<\/p>\n<p>It could get you some cash in the bank\u00a0and some happy customers if you get it right!<\/p>\n",

And I know that it evaporates from the oceans and lakes but&#8230;that&#8217;s a LOT of energy. Clouds. Amazing.<\/p>\n",

Maybe sometimes it&#8217;s not necessary at all.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s2\">We&#8217;ve all seen company owners rushing from one big idea to another, thinking of acquisition meetings and exit strategies too early. Instead, you should create, design, build and nourish the product you love (and stay with it!) \u2014 with or without venture capital. You might be happier this way.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m not anti-growth, but growth seems to be the measure by which all businesses are judged. However,\u00a0definitions of success can vary.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Startups&#8221; &#8211; defined, by me as companies intending to take on investment, grow fast, and head for exit or acquisition &#8211; seem to get all the news, either by failing tragically, or by &#8211; in very rare cases &#8211; succeeding.<\/p>\n<p>And it bothers me that the many hundreds and thousands of happy and successful lifestyle businesses don&#8217;t get press. Businesses bootstrapped with the founders&#8217; money and time; profitable businesses with no debt; businesses that have happy owners doing something they enjoy and are good at; businesses that make enough money for their owners to have a good living; businesses that pay taxes, and are often ethical and give back to society and local communities.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d love to hear more stories about these kind of businesses and less glorification of &#8220;Startups&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a successful, small scale lifestyle business, tell us what you make or do, and how you work in the comments.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>I have post that&#8217;s been brewing for a long time about Startup culture and it&#8217;s a topic I seem to be having more and more conversations about.<\/p>\n<p>Jason Fried &#8211; the founder of Basecamp, the project management software company &#8211; was quoted in the latest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/smashing-newsletter-issue-156\/\">Smashing Magazine newsletter<\/a> summed it up somewhat:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"s1\">With a niche and a good customer base, you can build a successful product, without &#8220;angel&#8221; investors and exponential growth in hiring. Maybe sometimes it&#8217;s not necessary at all.\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s2\">We&#8217;ve all seen company owners rushing from one big idea to another, thinking of acquisition meetings and exit strategies too early. Instead, you should create, design, build and nourish the product you love (and stay with it!) \u2014 with or without venture capital. You might be happier this way.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m not anti-growth, but growth seems to be the measure by which all businesses are judged. However,\u00a0definitions of success can vary.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Startups&#8221; &#8211; defined, by me as companies intending to take on investment, grow fast, and head for exit or acquisition &#8211; seem to get all the news, either by failing tragically, or by &#8211; in very rare cases &#8211; succeeding.<\/p>\n<p>And it bothers me that the many hundreds and thousands of happy and successful lifestyle businesses don&#8217;t get press. Businesses bootstrapped with the founders&#8217; money and time; profitable businesses with no debt; businesses that have happy owners doing something they enjoy and are good at; businesses that make enough money for their owners to have a good living; businesses that pay taxes, and are often ethical and give back to society and local communities.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d love to hear more stories about these kind of businesses and less glorification of &#8220;Startups&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a successful, small scale lifestyle business, tell us what you make or do, and how you work in the comments.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

            },
            "content": {
                "rendered": "<p>My friend\/colleague\/client Huw, has posted <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@huwtyler\/10thingsivelearned-4e36c39af437#.ncbly6484\">10 things he&#8217;s learned recently<\/a> and challenged me to do the same. So here goes. 10 things I&#8217;ve learned recently.<\/p>\n<h3>1. All children really are different<\/h3>\n<p>You hear this a lot as a parent. And as we&#8217;ve had the recent addition of a second baby to our existing family of three, I can confirm that, despite having the same genes to work with, we&#8217;ve turned out two VERY different little Wintles. People say &#8216;ah but you&#8217;re a different parent the second time &#8211; you know what you&#8217;re doing&#8217;. And there is truth in that. The first bit at least. But our two kids are definitely polar opposite characters.<\/p>\n<h3>2. That you can sometimes give yourself a job title<\/h3>\n<p>I came across a guy recently who gave himself a job title that he had invented. I&#8217;ve actually already done this &#8211; my self-assigned job title at my own company Oikos is &#8216;<a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/about\/\">Creator &#8211; Engineer -Advisor<\/a>&#8216;. But as I&#8217;ve become more and more interested in the field of user experience and usability I&#8217;m working out at what point I&#8217;m allowed to call myself a UX&#8217;er of some sort. And then <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dogwonder\">Rich Holman<\/a> turns up and he has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dogwonder.co.uk\/2012\/01\/30\/why-i-am-a-ux-developer\/\">a VERY similar journey to my own, and he&#8217;s called himself a UX developer<\/a>, and I wonder if, actually, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to become and call myself one day.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Halo orbits and that piece of Apollo kit that&#8217;s flying around the solar system<\/h3>\n<p>Random space facts. The other day I came across this animation of an object that came between the earth and the moon several times back in 2002 called <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/J002E3\">J002E3<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/39\/J002e3f_orbit.gif\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This object was originally thought to be an asteroid, but they now think it&#8217;s actually part of one of the rockets that launched the Apollo space missions. Bonkers.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, at about the same time I came across the brilliant <a href=\"https:\/\/www.popchartlab.com\/products\/the-chart-of-cosmic-exploration\">Chart of Cosmic Exploration on Pop Chart Lab<\/a>\u00a0which I hope you can still see. This contains reference to something called ISEE-3 which seems to be in orbit around the sun on the diagram &#8211; at least for some of its life. Anyway, I <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/International_Cometary_Explorer\">looked that up<\/a> and it&#8217;s a thing that was put into what&#8217;s called a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Halo_orbit\">halo orbit<\/a>&#8220;, which is where an object can orbit a thing called a Lagrange point, which is a point in space affected by the gravity of two other bodies. Anyway, you can be in orbit around nothing it would seem. And that&#8217;s cool.<\/p>\n<h3>4. I am a highly sensitive person&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>&#8230;and there&#8217;s a 20-ish% chance that you might be too!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll keep harping on about the &#8220;high sensitivity&#8221; character trait because it&#8217;s been a revelation to my family and I suspect I know people who are highly sensitive (or people know people who are highly sensitive) who could really benefit from hearing about it. \u00a0Stop hanging around here and <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2015\/07\/highly-sensitive\/\">READ THIS<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>5. I AM CREATIVE&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>&#8230;and there&#8217;s a 100% chance that you are too.<\/p>\n<p>I learned this a while ago but it was another revelatory lesson for me. I&#8217;d always associated creativity with arts and crafts. But the realisation that creativity is much broader was a turning point for me. If you make anything &#8211; code, art, food, writing, furniture, electronics, lego, sermons, birthday cards, cakes, plants &#8211; anything, then you are creative. Everyone has made something in their life. Everyone is creative. Everyone has a craft.<\/p>\n<p>The first book of the bible, Genesis, talks about God as creator (I don&#8217;t believe it literally &#8211; it&#8217;s a poem, a metaphor). And it says that God made man in his image &#8211; which I take to mean that we all have, in our being, some likeness to God. And I put that all together and understand it to mean that we are all creators. We all make stuff.<\/p>\n<p>And God said: &#8220;Let there be&#8230;&#8221;. And God saw that it was good.<\/p>\n<p>Go make things. Making things is good!<\/p>\n<h3>6. Anxiety is REALLY common and very real for very many people.<\/h3>\n<p>The more I have exchanges with people about anxiety, the more I feel like anxiety is in all of us. It might be full-blown, debilitating panic attacks. Or it might be way more subtle. But it&#8217;s everywhere and it&#8217;s real and it affects people in their everyday lives greatly.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t share my main anxiety. But I know what it is. I know where it comes from. And I&#8217;m trying to deal with it.<\/p>\n<p>So the next time someone wants to travel by themselves. Or needs a break from a situation. Or doesn&#8217;t call you on the phone. Or doesn&#8217;t want to drive a long distance. Or wants to stand by the exit of a busy room. Or wants to do something odd and seems stressed about it. Give them a break. This might be REALLY hard for them.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Anger is OK<\/h3>\n<p>Blimey &#8211; this is turning into a full-blown therapy session.<\/p>\n<p>I was a pretty placid person until a certain set of things in my life happened which caused me to\u00a0discover that I could actually get quite angry under the right circumstances. I&#8217;ve REALLY struggled with this. I struggled because getting angry felt wrong, and bad. But I&#8217;ve come to accept it. And to accept it I had to acknowledge that anger is actually a part of normal human existence. We shouldn&#8217;t feel bad that we get angry. It&#8217;s just something that happens. It&#8217;s a physiological response to external stimuli that&#8217;s often out of our control.<\/p>\n<p>How one deals with anger is a whole other story &#8211; and one that I won&#8217;t go into here. But anger in itself is OK. That was a HARD lesson to learn.<\/p>\n<h3>8: Our conscious reality is about 0.5 seconds behind actual reality.<\/h3>\n<p>Seriously. Our brains process different senses at different speeds, so we get sound quicker than vision. So why isn&#8217;t the world all out of sync? Well, our brains cleverly assemble our &#8220;reality&#8221; and re-sync everything so that we perceive in-sync. But this means that we&#8217;re constantly living in the past.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you do something like hit a baseball travelling at 90mph? Or clap in time with a group of other people.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/b06zqpcg\">This&#8230;THIS&#8230;is one of the most fascinating pieces of radio that I&#8217;ve ever listened to.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Two more&#8230;?<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s late&#8230;I made it to eight.

People say &#8216;ah but you&#8217;re a different parent the second time &#8211; you know what you&#8217;re doing&#8217;. And there is truth in that. The first bit at least. But our two kids are definitely polar opposite characters.<\/p>\n<h3>2. That you can sometimes give yourself a job title<\/h3>\n<p>I came across a guy recently who gave himself a job title that he had invented. I&#8217;ve actually already done this &#8211; my self-assigned job title at my own company Oikos is &#8216;<a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/about\/\">Creator &#8211; Engineer -Advisor<\/a>&#8216;. But as I&#8217;ve become more and more interested in the field of user experience and usability I&#8217;m working out at what point I&#8217;m allowed to call myself a UX&#8217;er of some sort. And then <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dogwonder\">Rich Holman<\/a> turns up and he has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dogwonder.co.uk\/2012\/01\/30\/why-i-am-a-ux-developer\/\">a VERY similar journey to my own, and he&#8217;s called himself a UX developer<\/a>, and I wonder if, actually, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to become and call myself one day.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Halo orbits and that piece of Apollo kit that&#8217;s flying around the solar system<\/h3>\n<p>Random space facts. The other day I came across this animation of an object that came between the earth and the moon several times back in 2002 called <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/J002E3\">J002E3<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/39\/J002e3f_orbit.gif\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This object was originally thought to be an asteroid, but they now think it&#8217;s actually part of one of the rockets that launched the Apollo space missions. Bonkers.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, at about the same time I came across the brilliant <a href=\"https:\/\/www.popchartlab.com\/products\/the-chart-of-cosmic-exploration\">Chart of Cosmic Exploration on Pop Chart Lab<\/a>\u00a0which I hope you can still see. This contains reference to something called ISEE-3 which seems to be in orbit around the sun on the diagram &#8211; at least for some of its life. Anyway, I <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/International_Cometary_Explorer\">looked that up<\/a> and it&#8217;s a thing that was put into what&#8217;s called a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Halo_orbit\">halo orbit<\/a>&#8220;, which is where an object can orbit a thing called a Lagrange point, which is a point in space affected by the gravity of two other bodies. Anyway, you can be in orbit around nothing it would seem. And that&#8217;s cool.<\/p>\n<h3>4. I am a highly sensitive person&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>&#8230;and there&#8217;s a 20-ish% chance that you might be too!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll keep harping on about the &#8220;high sensitivity&#8221; character trait because it&#8217;s been a revelation to my family and I suspect I know people who are highly sensitive (or people know people who are highly sensitive) who could really benefit from hearing about it. \u00a0Stop hanging around here and <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2015\/07\/highly-sensitive\/\">READ THIS<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>5. I AM CREATIVE&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>&#8230;and there&#8217;s a 100% chance that you are too.<\/p>\n<p>I learned this a while ago but it was another revelatory lesson for me. I&#8217;d always associated creativity with arts and crafts. But the realisation that creativity is much broader was a turning point for me. If you make anything &#8211; code, art, food, writing, furniture, electronics, lego, sermons, birthday cards, cakes, plants &#8211; anything, then you are creative. Everyone has made something in their life. Everyone is creative. Everyone has a craft.<\/p>\n<p>The first book of the bible, Genesis, talks about God as creator (I don&#8217;t believe it literally &#8211; it&#8217;s a poem, a metaphor). And it says that God made man in his image &#8211; which I take to mean that we all have, in our being, some likeness to God. And I put that all together and understand it to mean that we are all creators. We all make stuff.<\/p>\n<p>And God said: &#8220;Let there be&#8230;&#8221;. And God saw that it was good.<\/p>\n<p>Go make things. Making things is good!<\/p>\n<h3>6. Anxiety is REALLY common and very real for very many people.<\/h3>\n<p>The more I have exchanges with people about anxiety, the more I feel like anxiety is in all of us. It might be full-blown, debilitating panic attacks. Or it might be way more subtle. But it&#8217;s everywhere and it&#8217;s real and it affects people in their everyday lives greatly.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t share my main anxiety. But I know what it is. I know where it comes from. And I&#8217;m trying to deal with it.<\/p>\n<p>So the next time someone wants to travel by themselves. Or needs a break from a situation. Or doesn&#8217;t call you on the phone. Or doesn&#8217;t want to drive a long distance. Or wants to stand by the exit of a busy room. Or wants to do something odd and seems stressed about it. Give them a break. This might be REALLY hard for them.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Anger is OK<\/h3>\n<p>Blimey &#8211; this is turning into a full-blown therapy session.<\/p>\n<p>I was a pretty placid person until a certain set of things in my life happened which caused me to\u00a0discover that I could actually get quite angry under the right circumstances. I&#8217;ve REALLY struggled with this. I struggled because getting angry felt wrong, and bad. But I&#8217;ve come to accept it. And to accept it I had to acknowledge that anger is actually a part of normal human existence. We shouldn&#8217;t feel bad that we get angry. It&#8217;s just something that happens. It&#8217;s a physiological response to external stimuli that&#8217;s often out of our control.<\/p>\n<p>How one deals with anger is a whole other story &#8211; and one that I won&#8217;t go into here. But anger in itself is OK. That was a HARD lesson to learn.<\/p>\n<h3>8: Our conscious reality is about 0.5 seconds behind actual reality.<\/h3>\n<p>Seriously. Our brains process different senses at different speeds, so we get sound quicker than vision. So why isn&#8217;t the world all out of sync? Well, our brains cleverly assemble our &#8220;reality&#8221; and re-sync everything so that we perceive in-sync. But this means that we&#8217;re constantly living in the past.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you do something like hit a baseball travelling at 90mph? Or clap in time with a group of other people.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/b06zqpcg\">This&#8230;THIS&#8230;is one of the most fascinating pieces of radio that I&#8217;ve ever listened to.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Two more&#8230;?<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s late&#8230;I made it to eight. I think I&#8217;m done.<\/p>\n<p>What have YOU learned recently?<\/p>\n",

And perhaps you&#8217;ve not heard.<\/p>\n<p>Despite <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2016\/03\/a-new-addition-ada-isabel\/\">the baby being<\/a> on the way, and my relative public-speaking inexperience and a few other things, I stupidly decided to submit a talk proposal to <a href=\"https:\/\/2016.london.wordcamp.org\/\">WordCamp London<\/a> (a large UK WordPress conference). Amazingly, the proposal got accepted! And so I now need to hope that I can scale up the apparent success of a couple of meetup presentations to this enormous stage:<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2263\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2263\" style=\"width: 676px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2263 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/wordcamp-london-2015-stage-rarst-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of WordCamp London 2015 stage by rarst\" width=\"676\" height=\"451\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/wordcamp-london-2015-stage-rarst-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/wordcamp-london-2015-stage-rarst-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/wordcamp-london-2015-stage-rarst-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/wordcamp-london-2015-stage-rarst-945x630.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/wordcamp-london-2015-stage-rarst-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/wordcamp-london-2015-stage-rarst.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2263\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">WordCamp London 2015 stage &#8211; photo by Andrey Savchenko via Flickr<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>While I don&#8217;t want to give too much away, this post is the precursor to another. So I just want to say that I&#8217;m speaking on the topic &#8220;<a class=\"wcpt-session-title\" href=\"https:\/\/2016.london.wordcamp.org\/session\/user-experience-its-for-everyone\/\">User Experience: it\u2019s for everyone<\/a>&#8220;. It&#8217;s a topic that I&#8217;ve realised is close to my heart and I want to share some of my user experience experience (yes, this IS correct) with people, and try to get people to see that this isn&#8217;t a field that&#8217;s the domain of UX experts &#8211; we ALL have a part in the UX process.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be sharing some stories, tips, examples and resources as I go too. I hope it will be fun, interesting, and inspiring. And if it&#8217;s not, it will be a total train wreck. Either way, it&#8217;s entertainment that should be worth the \u00a330 conference ticket fee alone. So <a href=\"https:\/\/2016.london.wordcamp.org\/tickets\/\">GO AND BOOK NOW<\/a> if you&#8217;re into WordPress and fancy a fun, friendly, two day conference complete with food and swag for not-much-money-at-all.<\/p>\n<p>I hope to see you there!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>So, you all know this already, probably, but it&#8217;s still important and also worth writing about. And perhaps you&#8217;ve not heard.<\/p>\n<p>Despite <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2016\/03\/a-new-addition-ada-isabel\/\">the baby being<\/a> on the way, and my relative public-speaking inexperience and a few other things, I stupidly decided to submit a talk proposal to <a href=\"https:\/\/2016.london.wordcamp.org\/\">WordCamp London<\/a> (a large UK WordPress conference). Amazingly, the proposal got accepted! And so I now need to hope that I can scale up the apparent success of a couple of meetup presentations to this enormous stage:<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2263\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2263\" style=\"width: 676px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-2263 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/wordcamp-london-2015-stage-rarst-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of WordCamp London 2015 stage by rarst\" width=\"676\" height=\"451\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/wordcamp-london-2015-stage-rarst-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/wordcamp-london-2015-stage-rarst-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/wordcamp-london-2015-stage-rarst-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/wordcamp-london-2015-stage-rarst-945x630.jpg 945w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/wordcamp-london-2015-stage-rarst-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/wordcamp-london-2015-stage-rarst.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2263\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">WordCamp London 2015 stage &#8211; photo by Andrey Savchenko via Flickr<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>While I don&#8217;t want to give too much away, this post is the precursor to another. So I just want to say that I&#8217;m speaking on the topic &#8220;<a class=\"wcpt-session-title\" href=\"https:\/\/2016.london.wordcamp.org\/session\/user-experience-its-for-everyone\/\">User Experience: it\u2019s for everyone<\/a>&#8220;. It&#8217;s a topic that I&#8217;ve realised is close to my heart and I want to share some of my user experience experience (yes, this IS correct) with people, and try to get people to see that this isn&#8217;t a field that&#8217;s the domain of UX experts &#8211; we ALL have a part in the UX process.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be sharing some stories, tips, examples and resources as I go too. I hope it will be fun, interesting, and inspiring. And if it&#8217;s not, it will be a total train wreck. Either way, it&#8217;s entertainment that should be worth the \u00a330 conference ticket fee alone. So <a href=\"https:\/\/2016.london.wordcamp.org\/tickets\/\">GO AND BOOK NOW<\/a> if you&#8217;re into WordPress and fancy a fun, friendly, two day conference complete with food and swag for not-much-money-at-all.<\/p>\n<p>I hope to see you there!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",
