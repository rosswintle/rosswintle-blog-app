Pidgin (IM client), Firefox (and extensions), Anti-Virus, Adobe Reader and Flash, Windows, iTunes&#8230;it&#8217;s incessant!  And it means that it&#8217;s about half an hour from pushing the on button to being able to do anything useful.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I could disable all the auto-updates.  What I&#8217;d really like is to be able to click a button that says &#8220;update all my software now&#8221; and run all the updates at once at a time that is convenient to me.<\/p>\n<p>The auto-update problem is only made worse by my second annoyance.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Progress Bars<\/p>\n<p><\/span>We did a module in my computer science degree about Human-Computer Interaction.  In it we were told that a progress bar should tell you three things:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>How much work has been done.<\/li>\n<li>How much work is left.<\/li>\n<li>How quickly the work is progressing.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Some status bars used to achieve this.  Actually, the best ones were usually multi-progress bars that showed how far a job involving lots of smaller jobs had got.  One bar showed overall progress and the other showed progress of the smaller sub-tasks.  Linux installs were always pretty good for this sort of thing.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve not seen a progress bar that does any of the above three things for years now.  I see progress bars that do all of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>start again from zero once they reach 100%<\/li>\n<li>advance at unsteady rates<\/li>\n<li>stop for a long time at a certain percentage and then suddenly leap<\/li>\n<li>advance at a steady rate but then the work is not complete when they reach 100%<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And what&#8217;s really bad is that we now take this for granted.  I mean, what if your car&#8217;s petrol gague suddenly dropped from 3\/4 full to 1\/8 full?  Or if your washing machine showed it was on the last rinse when really it was still doing the pre-wash?  Would we accept that?<\/p>\n<p>We should be telling our software installer vendors that this is unacceptable.  I&#8217;ve wasted many hours staring at progress bars that are telling me a job is nearly done when it&#8217;s really far from completion.  I&#8217;ve been late home and I&#8217;ve been late to bed because of such things.  I bet you could do analysis that shows that businesses are losing millions of man-hours while people wait for things to complete in this way.<\/p>\n<p>We need progress on progress bars!  Who will stand and join with me to reclaim our %-complete&#8217;s and make them what they once were?<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

Pidgin (IM client), Firefox (and extensions), Anti-Virus, Adobe Reader and Flash, Windows, iTunes&#8230;it&#8217;s incessant!  And it means that it&#8217;s about half an hour from pushing the on button to being able to do anything useful.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I could disable all the auto-updates.  What I&#8217;d really like is to be able to click a button that says &#8220;update all my software now&#8221; and run all the updates at once at a time that is convenient to me.<\/p>\n<p>The auto-update problem is only made worse by my second annoyance.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Progress Bars<\/p>\n<p><\/span>We did a module in my computer science degree about Human-Computer Interaction.  In it we were told that a progress bar should tell you three things:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>How much work has been done.<\/li>\n<li>How much work is left.<\/li>\n<li>How quickly the work is progressing.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Some status bars used to achieve this.  Actually, the best ones were usually multi-progress bars that showed how far a job involving lots of smaller jobs had got.  One bar showed overall progress and the other showed progress of the smaller sub-tasks.  Linux installs were always pretty good for this sort of thing.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve not seen a progress bar that does any of the above three things for years now.  I see progress bars that do all of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>start again from zero once they reach 100%<\/li>\n<li>advance at unsteady rates<\/li>\n<li>stop for a long time at a certain percentage and then suddenly leap<\/li>\n<li>advance at a steady rate but then the work is not complete when they reach 100%<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And what&#8217;s really bad is that we now take this for granted.  I mean, what if your car&#8217;s petrol gague suddenly dropped from 3\/4 full to 1\/8 full?  Or if your washing machine showed it was on the last rinse when really it was still doing the pre-wash?  Would we accept that?<\/p>\n<p>We should be telling our software installer vendors that this is unacceptable.  I&#8217;ve wasted many hours staring at progress bars that are telling me a job is nearly done when it&#8217;s really far from completion.  I&#8217;ve been late home and I&#8217;ve been late to bed because of such things.  I bet you could do analysis that shows that businesses are losing millions of man-hours while people wait for things to complete in this way.<\/p>\n<p>We need progress on progress bars!  Who will stand and join with me to reclaim our %-complete&#8217;s and make them what they once were?<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",

We don&#8217;t like them because we know them &#8211; we like them because we think they do really good music!<\/p>\n<p>They are on the verge of releasing their second album and have just released a freely downloadable EP.  Take a look over at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/ikomusic\">http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/ikomusic<\/a>.  To get the EP you&#8217;ll have to email    ikoauto@ikomusic.com with your name in the subject line.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Social Web<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Web 2.0, the social web, networking, life streaming&#8230;whatever you choose to call it I&#8217;m quite interested in how people use web-based tools to interact, and I&#8217;ve occasionally posted about this in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Lots of people remain skeptical.  Facebook is popular but anything else seems to raise eyebrows and questions about what the point is and why it&#8217;s so complicated.  My wife is sometimes amongst these.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Good &#8211; Ravelry<\/span><\/p>\n<p>But for some there is this thing called the &#8220;Killer App&#8221;.  The one little website or program that gets you excited because it has a real use.  And some of my female friends (including Sally) have been getting excited about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/\">Ravelry<\/a>.  Ravelry is online social-networking for knitters.  You can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>log what bits of wool you&#8217;ve got;<\/li>\n<li>log what projects you&#8217;re working on and your progress with them &#8211; linking to the bits of wool you&#8217;re using in that project;<\/li>\n<li>register who your contacts\/friends are;<\/li>\n<li>see what your friends are making and what their progress is;<\/li>\n<li>view and download patterns.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And so on.  There are lots of cool things you can do with the information on Ravelry too, such as, if you have some wool, you can look up what other people are making with that type\/make\/colour of wool and use it as inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s brilliant site.  A really good example of how the web can bring like-minded people together to share ideas and inspire and encourage one another.  And the best thing is that it&#8217;s NOT full of techie people and it&#8217;s drawn in people who probably wouldn&#8217;t normally use the web for this sort of interaction.<\/p>\n<p>Well done Ravelry!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Bad &#8211; Amazon.com<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is really an excuse for a website rant.  I&#8217;m making a vague tie-in to the social-web theme by claiming that Amazon&#8217;s expansion into social-networking-type activities is killing it.<\/p>\n<p>Well, actually, maybe it was already dead.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s remind ourselves about Amazon.  It was one of the first big online retailers, selling books, music, DVD&#8217;s and so on to the masses across the world.<\/p>\n<p>It has since expanded to sell all manner of things, not just from its own warehouses but from a large number of other &#8220;marketplace&#8221; retailers.  It has a complex product reviewing system and, wish lists and customized recommendations.<\/p>\n<p>It was brilliant, quick, easy to use, and sold lots of things that you just couldn&#8217;t find elsewhere.  And cheap too!<\/p>\n<p>This is all well and good, but it&#8217;s starting to go a little far and, as a result, Amazon&#8217;s website is now complete information overload!!!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d love to paste screen shots but they&#8217;re technically copyrighted to Amazon, so I won&#8217;t.  I will try to describe.  There are some long lists here&#8230;for which I make no apology.<\/p>\n<p>The homepage tells me about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>delivery (and restrictions on delivery)<\/li>\n<li>VAT rates dropped<\/li>\n<li>link to personalised recommendations<\/li>\n<li>link to what to do if I&#8217;m a new customer<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Your Amazon.co.uk&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Deals of the Week<\/li>\n<li>Gift Certificates<\/li>\n<li>Gifts and Wish lists<\/li>\n<li>Search<\/li>\n<li>MP3 downloads<\/li>\n<li>Clearance shoes<\/li>\n<li>Gift certificates (Again)<\/li>\n<li>What other customers are looking at Right Now<\/li>\n<li>Festive streals<\/li>\n<li>New MP3 store<\/li>\n<li>Gift certificates (in case I didn&#8217;t get it the first two times)<\/li>\n<li>Clothing<\/li>\n<li>Phillips Imageo candles (2 for \u00a335)<\/li>\n<li>and all that before I scroll down at which point I get to see Amazon exclusives, email settings, selling and buying stuff on Amazon, more to explore (do I need any more?), web services for developers, perfect gifts for him, UnderArmour performance apparel, Acer notebooks, best sellers in knitwear, shop kickers shoes, powerballs, health and beauty deals of the week, what customers are wishing for in DVD, a Sky TV advert, find great gifts for all the family, featured stores, where&#8217;s my stuff, delivery and returns, help pages, my recent history and a load of inter-site links.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Phew. Oh, and there&#8217;s a list of different shop areas to browse, like Music, Books, Electronics, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Most of this is not what I want to see at all.  I just want to buy a book and then track the order.<\/p>\n<p>First thing then.  I want to buy a book I&#8217;ve seen called &#8220;Living Africa&#8221;.  A quick search for this is simple (hooray!) and results are shown in a nice clean search results page with little clutter.  This is better.  So I select the item I&#8217;m after.<\/p>\n<p>One thing that bugs me about Amazon&#8217;s marketplace is that it&#8217;s not always clear if Amazon are going to ship you the item themselves  or if it will come from a smaller retailer that hasn&#8217;t yet gained my trust.  A small note informs me that this will be dispatched by Amazon (and it&#8217;s \u00a315 than we saw it in the shops for&#8230;bargain!).  While I&#8217;m hear, I think, I may as well check out the customer reviews, to see if it&#8217;s any good.<\/p>\n<p>And&#8230;AAARGRH!  I then get information overload again!  Customer reviews is now 4 pages down the screen.  Here&#8217;s what else I can see from the product page:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information about the Amazon Prime programme<\/li>\n<li>My shopping basket<\/li>\n<li>2 lots of information on delivery<\/li>\n<li>Wish list, wedding list and tell a friend buttons<\/li>\n<li>More buying choices (new and used from other retailers)&#8230;.twice!<\/li>\n<li>Details of other editions<\/li>\n<li>Details of which promotions this book is a part of<\/li>\n<li>Details of another book that is often bought together with this one<\/li>\n<li>List of other things that people who bought this book also bought<\/li>\n<li>Product details (a page and a half down) including more links to other editions and links to update product details and give feedback on images<\/li>\n<li>Sponsored links<\/li>\n<li>Product Description (now two and a half pages down)<\/li>\n<li>Other Africa-related products<\/li>\n<li>Tags (suggested by others and the ability to add tags)<\/li>\n<li>What customers buy after viewing this item<\/li>\n<li>Customer reviews (yay!)<\/li>\n<li>Customer discussions<\/li>\n<li>Listmania<\/li>\n<li>Look for similar items by category<\/li>\n<li>Look for similar items by subject<\/li>\n<li>Feedback on the details of this product<\/li>\n<li>Links to other Amazon &#8220;stores&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Sky TV advert<\/li>\n<li>Where&#8217;s my stuff, delivery and returns and help pages<\/li>\n<li>Your recent history<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Flip!  All I want to do is buy a book!  Don&#8217;t get me wrong.  Some of this is really useful.  But there&#8217;s just too much on one page.  I went back just now to look at the tags section and couldn&#8217;t find it in the 8-screens full of information.  What good is any nugget of information if it&#8217;s drowned out by a forest of other text, links and graphics?<\/p>\n<p>And why would I want to tag a product in a shop anyway?  It&#8217;s great that Amazon remember things that I&#8217;ve looked at recently so that I can find them again, but why would I want to assign keywords to something in a shop?<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s lots of duplicated information (mostly related products presented in a myriad of ways) and the basic information isn&#8217;t prominent enough.<\/p>\n<p>OK, so I placed an order (which I&#8217;m sure happened without a confirmation screen), and I later want to check the status of it.  I&#8217;ve since logged out and navigated back to the front page.<\/p>\n<p>Now, where&#8217;s the<br \/>\nlogin button.  Go on &#8211; check my list of what&#8217;s on the front page and see if you can see a log in link!  There isn&#8217;t one!  I either have to scroll to the bottom of the page and click &#8220;where&#8217;s my stuff&#8221; or, randomly, click on the text &#8220;personal recommendations&#8221;.  Admittedly, this text is part of the sentence &#8220;Sign in to get personal recommendations&#8221;, but it&#8217;s confused by the fact that the linked text is &#8220;personal recommendations&#8221;, not &#8220;sign in&#8221;.  Where do I sign in if I don&#8217;t want to see personal recommendations?  It&#8217;s like writing:<\/p>\n<p>Sign in to <span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,153);text-decoration:underline;\">get charged by an elephant<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Well, OK, it&#8217;s only <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">slightly<\/span> like that.  You get my point.<\/p>\n<p>Having managed to log in, I find that Amazon have some old credit card details (for cards that have expired) and a load of old addresses that need cleaning out.  Oh, and I can now add a user profile so that I can &#8220;Share information about myself&#8221; and &#8220;Connect with friends and other Amazon customers&#8221;.  Quite why I&#8217;d want to do this I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<p>What I&#8217;m saying is that Amazon&#8217;s site is now plagued by chaotic design, seemingly pointless features and information overload to the extent that I&#8217;m reluctant to use it.<\/p>\n<p>Phew.  That was a long rant.  Sorry.<\/p>\n<p>Christmas is coming.  And for once I think I might be jumping in my car to head to the shops rather than doing everything online.  Maybe a few hours browsing Borders would be nice.  Grab a coffee and get lost in the aisles of books and CD&#8217;s.  Yes, that&#8217;s a plan.<\/p>\n<p>Now if Amazon could deliver me a mellow, fairly-traded milky coffee in the next ten minutes without me having to leave the comfort of my sofa.  THAT would be good!<\/p>\n",

We don&#8217;t like them because we know them &#8211; we like them because we think they do really good music!<\/p>\n<p>They are on the verge of releasing their second album and have just released a freely downloadable EP.  Take a look over at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/ikomusic\">http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/ikomusic<\/a>.  To get the EP you&#8217;ll have to email    ikoauto@ikomusic.com with your name in the subject line.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Social Web<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Web 2.0, the social web, networking, life streaming&#8230;whatever you choose to call it I&#8217;m quite interested in how people use web-based tools to interact, and I&#8217;ve occasionally posted about this in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Lots of people remain skeptical.  Facebook is popular but anything else seems to raise eyebrows and questions about what the point is and why it&#8217;s so complicated.  My wife is sometimes amongst these.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Good &#8211; Ravelry<\/span><\/p>\n<p>But for some there is this thing called the &#8220;Killer App&#8221;.  The one little website or program that gets you excited because it has a real use.  And some of my female friends (including Sally) have been getting excited about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ravelry.com\/\">Ravelry<\/a>.  Ravelry is online social-networking for knitters.  You can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>log what bits of wool you&#8217;ve got;<\/li>\n<li>log what projects you&#8217;re working on and your progress with them &#8211; linking to the bits of wool you&#8217;re using in that project;<\/li>\n<li>register who your contacts\/friends are;<\/li>\n<li>see what your friends are making and what their progress is;<\/li>\n<li>view and download patterns.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And so on.  There are lots of cool things you can do with the information on Ravelry too, such as, if you have some wool, you can look up what other people are making with that type\/make\/colour of wool and use it as inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s brilliant site.  A really good example of how the web can bring like-minded people together to share ideas and inspire and encourage one another.  And the best thing is that it&#8217;s NOT full of techie people and it&#8217;s drawn in people who probably wouldn&#8217;t normally use the web for this sort of interaction.<\/p>\n<p>Well done Ravelry!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Bad &#8211; Amazon.com<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is really an excuse for a website rant.  I&#8217;m making a vague tie-in to the social-web theme by claiming that Amazon&#8217;s expansion into social-networking-type activities is killing it.<\/p>\n<p>Well, actually, maybe it was already dead.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s remind ourselves about Amazon.  It was one of the first big online retailers, selling books, music, DVD&#8217;s and so on to the masses across the world.<\/p>\n<p>It has since expanded to sell all manner of things, not just from its own warehouses but from a large number of other &#8220;marketplace&#8221; retailers.  It has a complex product reviewing system and, wish lists and customized recommendations.<\/p>\n<p>It was brilliant, quick, easy to use, and sold lots of things that you just couldn&#8217;t find elsewhere.  And cheap too!<\/p>\n<p>This is all well and good, but it&#8217;s starting to go a little far and, as a result, Amazon&#8217;s website is now complete information overload!!!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d love to paste screen shots but they&#8217;re technically copyrighted to Amazon, so I won&#8217;t.  I will try to describe.  There are some long lists here&#8230;for which I make no apology.<\/p>\n<p>The homepage tells me about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>delivery (and restrictions on delivery)<\/li>\n<li>VAT rates dropped<\/li>\n<li>link to personalised recommendations<\/li>\n<li>link to what to do if I&#8217;m a new customer<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Your Amazon.co.uk&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Deals of the Week<\/li>\n<li>Gift Certificates<\/li>\n<li>Gifts and Wish lists<\/li>\n<li>Search<\/li>\n<li>MP3 downloads<\/li>\n<li>Clearance shoes<\/li>\n<li>Gift certificates (Again)<\/li>\n<li>What other customers are looking at Right Now<\/li>\n<li>Festive streals<\/li>\n<li>New MP3 store<\/li>\n<li>Gift certificates (in case I didn&#8217;t get it the first two times)<\/li>\n<li>Clothing<\/li>\n<li>Phillips Imageo candles (2 for \u00a335)<\/li>\n<li>and all that before I scroll down at which point I get to see Amazon exclusives, email settings, selling and buying stuff on Amazon, more to explore (do I need any more?), web services for developers, perfect gifts for him, UnderArmour performance apparel, Acer notebooks, best sellers in knitwear, shop kickers shoes, powerballs, health and beauty deals of the week, what customers are wishing for in DVD, a Sky TV advert, find great gifts for all the family, featured stores, where&#8217;s my stuff, delivery and returns, help pages, my recent history and a load of inter-site links.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Phew. Oh, and there&#8217;s a list of different shop areas to browse, like Music, Books, Electronics, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Most of this is not what I want to see at all.  I just want to buy a book and then track the order.<\/p>\n<p>First thing then.  I want to buy a book I&#8217;ve seen called &#8220;Living Africa&#8221;.  A quick search for this is simple (hooray!) and results are shown in a nice clean search results page with little clutter.  This is better.  So I select the item I&#8217;m after.<\/p>\n<p>One thing that bugs me about Amazon&#8217;s marketplace is that it&#8217;s not always clear if Amazon are going to ship you the item themselves  or if it will come from a smaller retailer that hasn&#8217;t yet gained my trust.  A small note informs me that this will be dispatched by Amazon (and it&#8217;s \u00a315 than we saw it in the shops for&#8230;bargain!).  While I&#8217;m hear, I think, I may as well check out the customer reviews, to see if it&#8217;s any good.<\/p>\n<p>And&#8230;AAARGRH!  I then get information overload again!  Customer reviews is now 4 pages down the screen.  Here&#8217;s what else I can see from the product page:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information about the Amazon Prime programme<\/li>\n<li>My shopping basket<\/li>\n<li>2 lots of information on delivery<\/li>\n<li>Wish list, wedding list and tell a friend buttons<\/li>\n<li>More buying choices (new and used from other retailers)&#8230;.twice!<\/li>\n<li>Details of other editions<\/li>\n<li>Details of which promotions this book is a part of<\/li>\n<li>Details of another book that is often bought together with this one<\/li>\n<li>List of other things that people who bought this book also bought<\/li>\n<li>Product details (a page and a half down) including more links to other editions and links to update product details and give feedback on images<\/li>\n<li>Sponsored links<\/li>\n<li>Product Description (now two and a half pages down)<\/li>\n<li>Other Africa-related products<\/li>\n<li>Tags (suggested by others and the ability to add tags)<\/li>\n<li>What customers buy after viewing this item<\/li>\n<li>Customer reviews (yay!)<\/li>\n<li>Customer discussions<\/li>\n<li>Listmania<\/li>\n<li>Look for similar items by category<\/li>\n<li>Look for similar items by subject<\/li>\n<li>Feedback on the details of this product<\/li>\n<li>Links to other Amazon &#8220;stores&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Sky TV advert<\/li>\n<li>Where&#8217;s my stuff, delivery and returns and help pages<\/li>\n<li>Your recent history<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Flip!  All I want to do is buy a book!  Don&#8217;t get me wrong.  Some of this is really useful.  But there&#8217;s just too much on one page.  I went back just now to look at the tags section and couldn&#8217;t find it in the 8-screens full of information.  What good is any nugget of information if it&#8217;s drowned out by a forest of other text, links and graphics?<\/p>\n<p>And why would I want to tag a product in a shop anyway?  It&#8217;s great that Amazon remember things that I&#8217;ve looked at recently so that I can find them again, but why would I want to assign keywords to something in a shop?<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s lots of duplicated information (mostly related products presented in a myriad of ways) and the basic information isn&#8217;t prominent enough.<\/p>\n<p>OK, so I placed an order (which I&#8217;m sure happened without a confirmation screen), and I later want to check the status of it.  I&#8217;ve since logged out and navigated back to the front page.<\/p>\n<p>Now, where&#8217;s the<br \/>\nlogin button.  Go on &#8211; check my list of what&#8217;s on the front page and see if you can see a log in link!  There isn&#8217;t one!  I either have to scroll to the bottom of the page and click &#8220;where&#8217;s my stuff&#8221; or, randomly, click on the text &#8220;personal recommendations&#8221;.  Admittedly, this text is part of the sentence &#8220;Sign in to get personal recommendations&#8221;, but it&#8217;s confused by the fact that the linked text is &#8220;personal recommendations&#8221;, not &#8220;sign in&#8221;.  Where do I sign in if I don&#8217;t want to see personal recommendations?  It&#8217;s like writing:<\/p>\n<p>Sign in to <span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,153);text-decoration:underline;\">get charged by an elephant<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Well, OK, it&#8217;s only <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">slightly<\/span> like that.  You get my point.<\/p>\n<p>Having managed to log in, I find that Amazon have some old credit card details (for cards that have expired) and a load of old addresses that need cleaning out.  Oh, and I can now add a user profile so that I can &#8220;Share information about myself&#8221; and &#8220;Connect with friends and other Amazon customers&#8221;.  Quite why I&#8217;d want to do this I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n<p>What I&#8217;m saying is that Amazon&#8217;s site is now plagued by chaotic design, seemingly pointless features and information overload to the extent that I&#8217;m reluctant to use it.<\/p>\n<p>Phew.  That was a long rant.  Sorry.<\/p>\n<p>Christmas is coming.  And for once I think I might be jumping in my car to head to the shops rather than doing everything online.  Maybe a few hours browsing Borders would be nice.  Grab a coffee and get lost in the aisles of books and CD&#8217;s.  Yes, that&#8217;s a plan.<\/p>\n<p>Now if Amazon could deliver me a mellow, fairly-traded milky coffee in the next ten minutes without me having to leave the comfort of my sofa.  THAT would be good!<\/p>\n",

We&#8217;ll see).<\/li>\n<li>You may need a new login to submit comments.  I&#8217;m reviewing how to play this one.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Apologies for the inconvenience.  A detailed explanation (the long of it) is below.<\/p>\n<p>I actually first started Blogging several years ago &#8211; I was an &#8220;early adopter&#8221; if you like.  I made a few posts and then gave up &#8211; partly out of embarassment.<\/p>\n<p>Last year my writing took off, partly as a form of therapy during a difficult time of life, partly as a way to track and report what was going on with me health wise, and it&#8217;s just bumbled on since then.  Regular readers will know that it&#8217;s mostly notes to self that I hope will be informative\/interesting to others, and I hope that my writing will continue in that form.<\/p>\n<p>And alongside this I&#8217;m a big fan off Google&#8217;s online services. \u00a0I know that some think they&#8217;re evil, but things like GMail and Google Reader are so feature-rich and easy to use&#8230;and growing in features too&#8230;that I&#8217;m hooked.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The one service that, in my opinion, hasn&#8217;t kept up and that suffers from being Google&#8217;s, is Blogger &#8211; the software that publishes this blog. \u00a0Specific niggles would be:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Pages are big and take long to download<\/li>\n<li>Templates are tricky to edit (even for a relative expert like me!)<\/li>\n<li>Photos from URLs are a nightmare to add and integration with Google&#8217;s own Picasaweb and the competitor&#8217;s Flickr is non-existent.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>I&#8217;ve recently started hosting my own, private journal over at WordPress.com and it&#8217;s REALLY impressed me. \u00a0It&#8217;s fast, it uses good, open standards, it&#8217;s got a great dashboard (and an even better one with v2.7 which is awesome!) and it&#8217;s being developed at quite a rate of knots.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>So shifting &#8220;Magic Roundabouts&#8230;&#8221; is a no-brainer for me. \u00a0There&#8217;s a little work to do, but WordPress even imports from Blogger &#8211; comments, users and all.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>There MAY in fact be two shifts. \u00a0I&#8217;m contemplating where to host but want to move quick. \u00a0In all cases, I&#8217;ll keep you posted.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Thanks for reading and for bearing with us during non-essential maintenance.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

I made a few posts and then gave up &#8211; partly out of embarassment.<\/p>\n<p>Last year my writing took off, partly as a form of therapy during a difficult time of life, partly as a way to track and report what was going on with me health wise, and it&#8217;s just bumbled on since then.  Regular readers will know that it&#8217;s mostly notes to self that I hope will be informative\/interesting to others, and I hope that my writing will continue in that form.<\/p>\n<p>And alongside this I&#8217;m a big fan off Google&#8217;s online services. \u00a0I know that some think they&#8217;re evil, but things like GMail and Google Reader are so feature-rich and easy to use&#8230;and growing in features too&#8230;that I&#8217;m hooked.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The one service that, in my opinion, hasn&#8217;t kept up and that suffers from being Google&#8217;s, is Blogger &#8211; the software that publishes this blog. \u00a0Specific niggles would be:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Pages are big and take long to download<\/li>\n<li>Templates are tricky to edit (even for a relative expert like me!)<\/li>\n<li>Photos from URLs are a nightmare to add and integration with Google&#8217;s own Picasaweb and the competitor&#8217;s Flickr is non-existent.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>I&#8217;ve recently started hosting my own, private journal over at WordPress.com and it&#8217;s REALLY impressed me. \u00a0It&#8217;s fast, it uses good, open standards, it&#8217;s got a great dashboard (and an even better one with v2.7 which is awesome!) and it&#8217;s being developed at quite a rate of knots.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>So shifting &#8220;Magic Roundabouts&#8230;&#8221; is a no-brainer for me. \u00a0There&#8217;s a little work to do, but WordPress even imports from Blogger &#8211; comments, users and all.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>There MAY in fact be two shifts. \u00a0I&#8217;m contemplating where to host but want to move quick. \u00a0In all cases, I&#8217;ll keep you posted.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Thanks for reading and for bearing with us during non-essential maintenance.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",

No no no.\u00a0 You&#8217;ve got it ALL wrong.<\/p>\n<p>Oh dear.\u00a0 I&#8217;m sounding a bit &#8220;bah humbug&#8221;&#8230;time to turn the emotion around.<\/p>\n<p>I like Christmas.\u00a0 And I love giving gifts.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve not been very good this year, but I&#8217;m generally pretty good at mentally noting things people like or are interested in so that that can become a gift.\u00a0 And it&#8217;s always fun and exciting watching someone discover a creative and well-thought-out gift.<\/p>\n<p>Giving is a joy.\u00a0 But it&#8217;s not a responsibility as such, and I, personally, would rather not have to wait for birthdays to give people gifts or, worse still, Christmas, when you have to do lots all at once.\u00a0 Spontaneous giving is more even more fun and exciting than scheduled giving!<\/p>\n<p>And, of course, we must not forget that Christmas is really about celebrating the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ.\u00a0 And, much as he received the first Christmas gifts of Gold, Incense and Myrrh, as a symbol of his status and his destiny, he would much rather we gave gifts of love, justice, mercy, and grace.\u00a0 He wouldn&#8217;t have us put up signs saying &#8220;Santa Stop Here&#8221; so that we can get given gifts; he would have us leave our own homes and go and find people who are really in need and give to them.<\/p>\n<p>Happy Christmas one and all.\u00a0 I hope that you are the recipient of many useful, well-thought-out presents.\u00a0 I hope that you gracefully and joyfully receive them.\u00a0 I hope that you enjoy your own giving &#8211; whatever form it may take.\u00a0 And I hope also that you know God&#8217;s gift of peace.<\/p>\n<p>P.S. My favourite version of the real Christmas story is from Luke&#8217;s Gospel.\u00a0\u00a0 <a title=\"The Christmas Story from the Gospel of Luke\" href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Luke1:1-2:20;&amp;version=31;\" target=\"_blank\">Perhaps you&#8217;ll join with me in reading it<\/a>.<\/p>\n",

No no no.\u00a0 You&#8217;ve got it ALL wrong.<\/p>\n<p>Oh dear.\u00a0 I&#8217;m sounding a bit &#8220;bah humbug&#8221;&#8230;time to turn the emotion around.<\/p>\n<p>I like Christmas.\u00a0 And I love giving gifts.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve not been very good this year, but I&#8217;m generally pretty good at mentally noting things people like or are interested in so that that can become a gift.\u00a0 And it&#8217;s always fun and exciting watching someone discover a creative and well-thought-out gift.<\/p>\n<p>Giving is a joy.\u00a0 But it&#8217;s not a responsibility as such, and I, personally, would rather not have to wait for birthdays to give people gifts or, worse still, Christmas, when you have to do lots all at once.\u00a0 Spontaneous giving is more even more fun and exciting than scheduled giving!<\/p>\n<p>And, of course, we must not forget that Christmas is really about celebrating the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ.\u00a0 And, much as he received the first Christmas gifts of Gold, Incense and Myrrh, as a symbol of his status and his destiny, he would much rather we gave gifts of love, justice, mercy, and grace.\u00a0 He wouldn&#8217;t have us put up signs saying &#8220;Santa Stop Here&#8221; so that we can get given gifts; he would have us leave our own homes and go and find people who are really in need and give to them.<\/p>\n<p>Happy Christmas one and all.\u00a0 I hope that you are the recipient of many useful, well-thought-out presents.\u00a0 I hope that you gracefully and joyfully receive them.\u00a0 I hope that you enjoy your own giving &#8211; whatever form it may take.\u00a0 And I hope also that you know God&#8217;s gift of peace.<\/p>\n<p>P.S. My favourite version of the real Christmas story is from Luke&#8217;s Gospel.\u00a0\u00a0 <a title=\"The Christmas Story from the Gospel of Luke\" href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Luke1:1-2:20;&amp;version=31;\" target=\"_blank\">Perhaps you&#8217;ll join with me in reading it<\/a>.<\/p>\n",

x + 1.\u00a0 Simple.\u00a0 So we can now do:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">a =\u00a01\nprint a\nb = add-one ( a )\nprint b<\/pre>\n<p>I hope you can see (I&#8217;m racing ahead) that this will print &#8220;1&#8221; then &#8220;2&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>But you can also write this as what&#8217;s called a procedure.\u00a0 A procedure does some &#8220;stuff&#8221; but doesnt return a value.\u00a0 Like this:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">procedure add-one ( x )\nbegin\n\u00a0 x = x + 1\nend<\/pre>\n<p>So what happens if we do the following with the procedure?:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">a = 1\nprint a\nadd-one ( a )\nprint a<\/pre>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy!&#8221; you may say, &#8220;it prints 1 then 2 again&#8221;.\u00a0 But it&#8217;s not that easy.\u00a0 Sometimes the language will take a &#8220;copy&#8221; of x into the procedure and modify the copy, leaving the original untouched.\u00a0 This is called &#8220;pass-by-value&#8221;.\u00a0 Why would you want to do this?\u00a0 Well, let&#8217;s write a procedure that has someone&#8217;s full name as an input and prints their first name:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">procedure print-first-name ( name )\nbegin\n\u00a0\u00a0remove surname from name\n\u00a0 print name\nend<\/pre>\n<p>In this case we only want &#8220;name&#8221; to change within the procedure or the following would not work:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name = \"Fred Flintstone\"\nprint-first-name ( my-name )\u00a0\nprint-surname ( my-name )<\/pre>\n<p>Here, print-surname would not work because the print-first-name removed the surname from my-name.<\/p>\n<p>Your head probably aches now.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, JavaScript does LOTS of this sort of thing where pass-by-vaue and pass-by-reference really make a difference.<\/p>\n<p>Another complication is that there&#8217;s two ways to create strings that return different types:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name1 = \"Fred Flintstone\";<\/pre>\n<p>and<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name2 =\u00a0new string(\"Fred Flintstone\");<\/pre>\n<p>But these actualy do different things.\u00a0 One creates a string <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">value<\/span> and one creates a string <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">object<\/span>.\u00a0 And we find that:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name1 == my-name2<\/pre>\n<p>is true because the interpreter automatically converts the type but<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name1 === my-name2<\/pre>\n<p>is false because it does type comparison too.<\/p>\n<p>It has a variable called &#8220;this&#8221;, which refers to different things in different contexts.<\/p>\n<p>And it doesn&#8217;t enforce important bits of syntax.\u00a0 You&#8217;re supposed to end statements with a semi-colon, but if you split a statement over a line, then it will add the semi-colon at the line end (if that&#8217;s a valid place to end a statement).<\/p>\n<p>These are all very minor examples of how this is a complex, weakly-typed, language the enforces very little checking on the programmer, makes lots of assumptions about what you mean in your program, and doesn&#8217;t seem to give you ways to enforce the meaning that you want.<\/p>\n<p>All in all, I can see why so many web applications are so liable to not working.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps with a proper JavaScript tutorial, rather than just a cookbook, I might get a better grasp of the language and find some strong typing and better structures.<\/p>\n<p>But for the moment it&#8217;s looking pretty complicated and chaotic!<\/p>\n",

        "content": "<p>Geeky post&#8230;sorry if you get lost.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m still playing with Web Development languages and tools.\u00a0 A few days in Devon with not much to do is a good time to invest in some self-learning and I&#8217;ve been given the O&#8217;Reilly <a href=\"http:\/\/oreilly.com\/catalog\/9780596514082\/\">JavaScript and DHTML Cookbook<\/a> for Christmas too, so I&#8217;m working through that.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty proficient with server-side scripting now, but it had limitatations and performance issues.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve been so impressed by some of the Web 2.0-type sites out there (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.letsfreckle.com\">www.letsfreckle.com<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\">www.twitter.com<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\">www.facebook.com<\/a>) that I feel I really need to get a handle on client-side scripting too.\u00a0 That&#8217;s where JavaScript and DHTML come in.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m really not liking JavaScript.\u00a0 See, I was educated with a quite deep knowledge of programming languages.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve studied both imperative (statement-based) and declarative (logic-based) languages.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve studied compiler construction and language structure and analysis.\u00a0 I understand object-orientation.\u00a0 I know what&#8217;s going on under the hood, and I know the pitfalls of various programming languages styles.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also got a background in safety-critical software engineering.\u00a0 Writing programs where you know what must happen and if that doesn&#8217;t happen then people&#8217;s lives are at risk.\u00a0 I like to know what my programs are doing.<\/p>\n<p>And with JavaScript, most of the time, I don&#8217;t have a clue what&#8217;s going on!\u00a0 The language makes so many guesses on your behalf, allows you to pass objects and functions as data and doesn&#8217;t (appear to) contain notation for distinguishing between passing parameters by value and by reference.<\/p>\n<p>To the uninitiated this will mean nothing&#8230;let&#8217;s take an example.\u00a0 Lets say we want to write a little computer program called &#8220;add-one&#8221;.\u00a0 This program has one input, a number, and one output, which will be the number plus one.<\/p>\n<p>The preferred way to do this is to write what&#8217;s called a &#8220;function&#8221;.\u00a0 A function is a little program which gives you back a value.\u00a0 Like this:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">function add-one ( x )\nbegin\n\u00a0 return x + 1\nend<\/pre>\n<p>Here, x is the input and we &#8220;return&#8221; x + 1.\u00a0 Simple.\u00a0 So we can now do:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">a =\u00a01\nprint a\nb = add-one ( a )\nprint b<\/pre>\n<p>I hope you can see (I&#8217;m racing ahead) that this will print &#8220;1&#8221; then &#8220;2&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>But you can also write this as what&#8217;s called a procedure.\u00a0 A procedure does some &#8220;stuff&#8221; but doesnt return a value.\u00a0 Like this:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">procedure add-one ( x )\nbegin\n\u00a0 x = x + 1\nend<\/pre>\n<p>So what happens if we do the following with the procedure?:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">a = 1\nprint a\nadd-one ( a )\nprint a<\/pre>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy!&#8221; you may say, &#8220;it prints 1 then 2 again&#8221;.\u00a0 But it&#8217;s not that easy.\u00a0 Sometimes the language will take a &#8220;copy&#8221; of x into the procedure and modify the copy, leaving the original untouched.\u00a0 This is called &#8220;pass-by-value&#8221;.\u00a0 Why would you want to do this?\u00a0 Well, let&#8217;s write a procedure that has someone&#8217;s full name as an input and prints their first name:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">procedure print-first-name ( name )\nbegin\n\u00a0\u00a0remove surname from name\n\u00a0 print name\nend<\/pre>\n<p>In this case we only want &#8220;name&#8221; to change within the procedure or the following would not work:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name = \"Fred Flintstone\"\nprint-first-name ( my-name )\u00a0\nprint-surname ( my-name )<\/pre>\n<p>Here, print-surname would not work because the print-first-name removed the surname from my-name.<\/p>\n<p>Your head probably aches now.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, JavaScript does LOTS of this sort of thing where pass-by-vaue and pass-by-reference really make a difference.<\/p>\n<p>Another complication is that there&#8217;s two ways to create strings that return different types:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name1 = \"Fred Flintstone\";<\/pre>\n<p>and<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name2 =\u00a0new string(\"Fred Flintstone\");<\/pre>\n<p>But these actualy do different things.\u00a0 One creates a string <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">value<\/span> and one creates a string <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">object<\/span>.\u00a0 And we find that:<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name1 == my-name2<\/pre>\n<p>is true because the interpreter automatically converts the type but<\/p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:30px;\">my-name1 === my-name2<\/pre>\n<p>is false because it does type comparison too.<\/p>\n<p>It has a variable called &#8220;this&#8221;, which refers to different things in different contexts.<\/p>\n<p>And it doesn&#8217;t enforce important bits of syntax.\u00a0 You&#8217;re supposed to end statements with a semi-colon, but if you split a statement over a line, then it will add the semi-colon at the line end (if that&#8217;s a valid place to end a statement).<\/p>\n<p>These are all very minor examples of how this is a complex, weakly-typed, language the enforces very little checking on the programmer, makes lots of assumptions about what you mean in your program, and doesn&#8217;t seem to give you ways to enforce the meaning that you want.<\/p>\n<p>All in all, I can see why so many web applications are so liable to not working.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps with a proper JavaScript tutorial, rather than just a cookbook, I might get a better grasp of the language and find some strong typing and better structures.<\/p>\n<p>But for the moment it&#8217;s looking pretty complicated and chaotic!<\/p>\n",
