Sorry. Time for a post though!</p>
<p>The Wintle household has gotten increasingly grumpy as the effects of small-child-related sleep deprivation have kicked in. We&#8217;re normally pretty peaceful, happy folk, but Isaac really doesn&#8217;t sleep well and it&#8217;s taking its toll.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve been grateful to those who have kept me looking on the sunny side.  In particular I&#8217;ve been enjoying <a title="Jennifer Begg - Live Free Range on Twiter" href="http://twitter.com/livefreerange">Jennifer Begg&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Feel Good Friday&#8221; blogs (see &#8220;<a title="We Could Be Heros - Live Free Range" href="http://livefreerange.com/2012/06/14/we-could-be-heroes/">We could be heros</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a title="If Nothing We Do Matters - Live Free Range" href="http://livefreerange.com/2012/06/08/if-nothing-we-do-matters/">If Nothing We Do Matters</a>&#8220;). And last night I came across <a title="Stuart Witts on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/stuartwitts">Stuart Witts</a> whose <a title="Stay Happy and Don't Die" href="http://stayhappyanddontdie.com">Stay Happy and Don&#8217;t Die</a> blog brought a smile to my face yesterday.</p>
<p>I love my Twitters followees, and they constantly challenge me in numerous ways to be a better person. Today, I&#8217;m challenged to be more positive. Again.</p>
<p><a href="https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0005-small.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright  wp-image-1298" title="Ross in a Woolly Hat" alt="Ross in a Woolly Hat" src="https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0005-small-300x199.jpg" width="210" height="139" srcset="https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0005-small-300x199.jpg 300w, https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0005-small-150x99.jpg 150w, https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DSC_0005-small.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></a>I particularly like Stuarts <a title="Only in the leap from the Lion’s head will he prove his worth… #lovemyhat  - Stay Happy and Don't Die" href="http://stayhappyanddontdie.com/?p=756">#lovemyhat</a> project. A somewhat silly, very fun, pleasingly creative and highly positive month of millinery &#8211; like Movember for headgear. (I hope he doesn&#8217;t mind me thinking it was &#8216;somewhat silly&#8217; and I fully appreciate the seriousness of hat wearing &#8211; check out my Twitter profile pic on the right if you don&#8217;t believe me!)</p>
<p>And that got me thinking&#8230;what silly little creative, fun project might I do? What are the fun little things in my life? Those things that are almost-trivial, possibly slightly embarassing, but that always make you &#8211; and others around you &#8211; happy?</p>
<p>I think that play is massively important, not just to children, but to adults too. I&#8217;m reminded of the Museum of Childhood posters that I saw on <a title="Don't Forget Your Inner Child - Creative Review" href="http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2008/december/dont-forget-your-inner-child">Creative Review</a>, one of which is shown above. I&#8217;m reminded that play is a blessing. It gets you to let your guard down, open up, show the world &#8211; and sometimes yourself &#8211; a side that they wouldn&#8217;t normally see.</p>
<p>So&#8230;and this may not be for everyone&#8230;I was wondering if we might share how we play.  What silly things do you to to cheer yourself up. Are you a grown man that has a Scalextric in the loft? Is there a book, or toy that always makes you smile? Or a guilty-pleasure of a hobby? Perhaps you climb trees? Or maybe you just go outside at night and gaze in wonder at the stars?</p>
<p>I have lots of things that I class as play that bring joy. I can juggle (5 balls &#8211; 3 clubs &#8211; 1 devil stick) and do balloon modelling. I used to write really stupid poetry, and memorize the silly poems of others.  I love kids books &#8211; I have a complete Mr Men collection, but Roald Dahl, Dr Seuss and The Little Prince are favourites too. And I love to sit and play guitar &#8211; I&#8217;m not much good, but it&#8217;s such a great way of winding down and chilling out.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure I have other forms of play that I&#8217;ll think of. But that will do for now. Perhaps I should pick up and blog about one of those things some day?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t expect everyone to let their guard down and post a comment about how they play. But please stop and think&#8230;perhaps, like me, you&#8217;ve forgotten the little, simple things that make you smile. Go find those things and do those things. And I hope that a few might be willing to share too&#8230;what&#8217;s your inner child like? How do you play?</p>
