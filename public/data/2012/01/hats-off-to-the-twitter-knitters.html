<p>I had a message from a friend of mine. Let&#8217;s call her Amy (names changed for privacy). Amy has a friend not-called Bea and Bea has a 4-year-old daughter, Charlie.  Charlie has recently been diagnosed with Leukaemia.  Charlie has just started chemotherapy and her hair has started to fall out.</p>
<p>Amy knows that my wonderful wife, Sally, is a dab hand with a pair of knitting needles. So Amy asked if Sally could knit a hat for Charlie.</p>
<p>But Sally is mum to our 8-week-old son, and barely has time to make a cup of tea, let alone knit.  It&#8217;s very much life-one-handed here at the moment!</p>
<p>So, I put a call out on Twitter.  I have a few creative followers and was pretty sure someone would be up to the challenge.</p>
<p>The response was amazing! I mean, I know things have gone way more viral, but I had a mass of re-tweets, new followers, and, of course, offers of hand-knitted hats.  The first within about two minutes from the generous and creative Jennifer Begg (<a href="http://twitter.com/livefreerange">@livefreerange</a>).</p>
<p>The internet is AMAZING!</p>
