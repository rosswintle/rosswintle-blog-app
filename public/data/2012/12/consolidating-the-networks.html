<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Consolidating the Networks</h1></header><main><p>So it seems like the fuss about Instagram&#8217;s Terms and Conditions was <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/18/3780158/instagrams-new-terms-of-service-what-they-really-mean">over-hyped</a>. It always seemed that way. But it has pushed me over a tipping point anyway.</p>
<p>Yesterday and today have seen me starting to process of deleting data from Facebook and Instagram, and seriously considering what other social networking accounts I have.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>This is as much a personal and philosophical choice as it is one based on any given service&#8217;s legalese and, over time, I&#8217;ll try and explain in detail why.</p>
<p>In short, Facebook just doesn&#8217;t work for me. It&#8217;s an advertising tool, not a communications tool. It doesn&#8217;t work well as a means of staying in touch with people. And while I don&#8217;t mind advertising being the source of funding for a free tool, I don&#8217;t want my content used in that advertising.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ve archived all my Facebook and Instagram data, deleted all my photos (bar a profile pic) and am working out what&#8217;s next. I can&#8217;t leave completely because I admin several groups and pages. But my presence there will be minimal.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll continue to post on Twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/magicroundabout">@magicroundabout</a> and will use this blog to post photos and longer messages.</p>
<p>I may even follow some folk onto Google+ a bit more.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about then, you don&#8217;t need to worry. But if you&#8217;re interested, feel free to ask.</p>
