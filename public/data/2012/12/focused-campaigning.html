<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Focused campaigning</h1></header><main><p>As someone who both cares about issues of poverty and justice, and who works in the charity sector &#8211; and in particular, the campaigning sector &#8211; I am on quite a lot of campaigning email lists.</p>
<p>And it feels like lately the number of ’email your MP’ campaigns has increased.  I don&#8217;t feel like I can take all of the actions I get, and so I end up ignoring most of them, and probably missing something that I consider really important.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve been thinking about making my own campaigning more focused: choosing one or two causes or charities, and making sure that I&#8217;m signed up and take action for those causes.  But&#8230;which ones to choose?</p>
<p>I was reading the latest issue of Tearfund&#8217;s newsletter, &#8216;Tear Times’ over Christmas, and an article on the issue of hunger really caught my eye.</p>
<p>Hunger affects one in every seven people on the planet. 925 million people go to bed hungry tonight. It&#8217;s a massive issue that causes so much pain and suffering.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also constantly troubled by the issue of water and sanitation.</p>
<p>Food and water are two things that I totally take for granted. I have vastly more than I need of both, and I can&#8217;t imagine what life is like without them.</p>
<p>The causes of hunger include climate change, corruption, and greed.</p>
<p>The impact of hunger, water and sanitation reaches into issues of health, education, crime, street children and general poverty.</p>
<p>So to fix it, we need to tackle lots of other things. But fixing it helps improve lots of other things too.</p>
<p>However, I also think it&#8217;s a fixable issue. With better trade and distribution, and with training, tools and technologies, we can feed everyone on the planet.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have stats and facts for all of those things, but that all seems pretty obvious to me.</p>
<p>Yes, there are things wrong in our country: with energy and transport policy, with the tax system, with corporate greed, with banking, with privatisation.</p>
<p>There are big global problems too: trade issues, climate change, debt, war, and so on.</p>
<p>But these things just don&#8217;t seem important when you consider that there are people who don&#8217;t have food to eat or water to drink.</p>
<p>From what I read, Tearfund and a group of other charities are putting together some new campaigning around hunger for 2013.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to focus my campaigning there. I&#8217;m going to write to my MP about hunger. I&#8217;m going to send whatever postcards or letters I get to whatever people in power seem important on the issue.</p>
<p>I will pray, I will give, I will read and I will share.</p>
<p>Perhaps you&#8217;ll join me?</p>
<p>The plans for 2013 don&#8217;t seem to be firm yet, but <a href=”http://www.tearfund.org/en/get_involved/campaign/hunger/”>here&#8217;s an action you can start with</a>.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m going to focus my support on Tearfund. As a Christian, I support the foundations and basis of their work and I like that its a charity I can connect with at a spiritual as well as practical level.  I know them well and I&#8217;m privileged to do some bits of  </p>
<p>work for them. I think their approach to aid and development is effective and sustainable. I believe in what they&#8217;re doing and I trust them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t care for or support other charities or campaigns. I just think that my campaigning energy is better if its focused rather than diluted.  Of course I&#8217;ll stay up to date with other organisations and campaigns, but hunger and water will be my focus, and Tearfund will be my charity if choice.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to a great year of focused campaigning!  I&#8217;ll try and keep you updated.</p>
