<p>This little, low-res video is from a trip to the Tate Modern when an installation called &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth_(artwork)">Shibboleth</a>&#8216; was on.</p>
<p>I just liked the way that people moved around the hall examining the huge crack in the floor. It&#8217;s often the case with turbine hall installations that the people&#8217;s reactions are part of the art. Perhaps I captured some of that?</p>
