<p>Last week I was out cycling and I saw a guy pull up at the side of a dual carriageway and get out of his car. I stopped and asked if he was OK. He&#8217;d run out of fuel. He proceeded to open his boot and take out a plastic petrol can.</p>

<p>I had a bit of time so I offered to cycle off and get him some fuel, the nearest petrol station being about 2 miles away.  He asked if I was sure and I said I&#8217;d be much quicker than him and could use the exercise. He passed me some cash and told me to fill the can.</p>
<p>Queuing to buy petrol on a bike was a strange experience, but I got him his fuel and cycled back. I felt good. He felt good. And I&#8217;m sure a few people in the petrol queue got a smile out of it too. We don&#8217;t need to be the guy in the picture at the top. Much as cyclists dislike them sometimes, we can be drivers&#8217; friends and it will help bring peace and understanding to our roads.</p>
