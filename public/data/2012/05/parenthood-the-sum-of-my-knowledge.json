It&#8217;s funny how, as a newbie parent myself, it&#8217;s so tempting to offer advice. I also had a conversation this week with someone else who was talking about the dilemma of offering this kind of &#8216;help&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>And the longer I am a parent, the more I believe that the best advice is not advice at all, its almost anti-advice.<\/p>\n<p>So I present the sum of my parenting knowledge:<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlearn <strong>everything<\/strong>. Be prepared to change all that you know or have been told<\/li>\n<li>You already know more than everyone else about your baby. People offer advice. Weigh it. Add your own thoughts and experience. And then make your own decision.<\/li>\n<li>Trust your instinct. Again, you know your baby better than anyone else. You&#8217;ll know when something is wrong, and when something is right.<\/li>\n<li>It does get better. Not at any particular point in time. People will say it gets better after 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, or any other specific time in the future. The truth is simply that &#8216;it will get better&#8217;.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s flippin hard work. Seriously. If someone tells you it&#8217;s hard work, think what that might be like and treble it&#8230;at least!<\/li>\n<li>Every baby is different. So you can generally ignore anyone that tells you what their baby was like.<\/li>\n<li>Every parent is different. So you can generally ignore anyone that gives you advice because you&#8217;ll do it your own way anyway.<\/li>\n<li>It is the most amazing thing. Caring for a tiny little person that you made. Introducing them to the world. Introducing the world to them. Staring at their hands thinking &#8216;I wonder what they&#8217;ll do&#8217; and at their feet and thinking &#8216;I wonder where they will walk&#8217;. It&#8217;s just incredible. The potential for life, love, work, joy, hope, kindness and so many other things wrapped up in a little person is overwhelming at times.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Maybe it doesn&#8217;t sound like it, but I&#8217;m actually HUGELY grateful to everyone that&#8217;s offered us help, advice, encouragement and prayer in our first few months with Isaac. But the truth is, we&#8217;ve listened to and, I hope, respected everyone&#8217;s opinions, and we&#8217;re doing things our own way.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m now about to give in to temptation and actually offer one concrete piece of advice myself. It&#8217;s not about feeding, nappies, which buggy to get, or how to get your baby to sleep. No. It&#8217;s this thing that people kept telling me early on which I initially found hard to believe but now hold firm to:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Treasure every moment!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Isaac no longer smells of baby. I miss that.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t need cuddling to sleep as much. I miss that. It used to be so annoying that he&#8217;d only drift off in our arms. Nowadays, I look for times when I can get to hold him for half an hour or so.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t mimic us any more. I miss that. For a few weeks he tried to copy the sounds that we were making. Now he just makes whatever sounds he wants to regardless of what were babbling at him.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t fit in his baby clothes. He&#8217;s in 6-9 months sizes now. He had some nice outfits. We miss that.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac doesn&#8217;t poo as often. Bizarrely&#8230;I miss that! Change time used to mostly be a fun time. Now it&#8217;s infrequent and a chore.<\/p>\n<p>So many things Isaac did, or that we did with him, have already changed or gone. If you have a young baby, (s)he will be different by this time next week. Enjoy what they&#8217;re like now, even if it&#8217;s difficult and stressful, because they won&#8217;t be like it again.<\/p>\n",
