<p><em>What do we make of a deepfake &#8220;interview&#8221; with a text-based AI trained on the words of a real person?</em></p>



<p>This caught my attention today. Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook won&#8217;t be interviewed by The Guardian, so they:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>built a Zuckerbot &#8230; trained on three years of interviews, speeches, blogposts and testimony from the <a href="https://www.zuckerbergfiles.org/">Zuckerberg Files</a>  â€“ more than 200,000 words of Zuckerverbiage in all. Guardian and  Observer journalists then provided the questions, and [the company that made the bot] used the  Zuckerbot to produce the answers.</p></blockquote>

<p>My first thought was &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s clever and fun&#8221;, (and the Zuckerbot&#8217;s answers are mostly clearly nonsensical) but my second thought quickly overrode it: &#8220;Hang on, this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake">deepfake</a>, but with words. Is this ethical?&#8221;</p>



<p>There has been a lot of robust debate about the ethics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake">deepfakes</a>. They can do some amazing stuff with images and video now. I don&#8217;t have links to hand.</p>



<p>But text as a medium often kinda slips under the radar.</p>



<p>I very rarely share photos of my kids on social media because I want to protect their privacy. But I have talked about them a lot, and this is ALSO an invasion of their privacy. Somehow it feels less so, but it could be MORE so. </p>



<p>Writing about their character and behaviour could be more damaging to them in future than just a picture of them walking in the woods or riding their bike for the first time.</p>



<p>So, words are important. And I wonder if fake words are harder to spot.</p>



<p>I recently heard about the wonderous new AI that produced a convincing news story about Unicorns: listen to <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-eliza-effect/">the 99 Percent Invisible podcast about The Eliza Effect</a> from about 33:10 &#8211; I mean, listen to it all because it&#8217;s excellent, but from 33:10 is relevant. They discuss and critique how AI could so quickly churn out fake words, articles, and even fake interviews!</p>



<p>Perhaps they already are?</p>



<p>Perhaps THIS is being written by AI, and not a human?</p>



<p>How would you tell?</p>
