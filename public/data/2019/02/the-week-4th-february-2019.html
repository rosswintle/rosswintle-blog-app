<p>Blimey, what a week! We&#8217;re about to start a whole new routine with my youngest starting pre-school and doing more hours there than she was in nursery, my wife taking on an extra half day and me&#8230;am I working more or just moving hours around? I can&#8217;t tell. Anyway, it&#8217;s crazy, and it starts today.</p>



<p>Last week&#8217;s snow messed things up a little with a school closure on Friday too. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Still reviewing spec&#8217;s and working up a proposal for a new Laravel project. Keen to get going on this one if I can.</li><li>Finally got a long-outstanding, but really small project for a friend-of-a-friend live. It&#8217;s a couple of pages in a WordPress page-builder but has just been hanging around for so long. Smaller projects with no deadline often get put back and back. I&#8217;m going to try and stop taking them on.</li><li>More helping my friends at <a href="https://handsup.co.uk">Hands Up</a> with last minute project snags on a custom WordPress build. There&#8217;s been some tricky issues with redirects that have been pretty hard to debug.</li><li>Another small, slow-burning project has had some good progress and I met the client this week to talk them through. They&#8217;re really happy with things and we have just a few final tasks to get through before we may be able to &#8220;go live&#8221;! It was wonderful seeing them use what I made and enjoying the benefits the re-work of their old website has brought.</li><li>Helping a client fix some SPF records to fix outgoing mail. SPF comes up SO often. I&#8217;m sure many have documented it, but I need to write my own guide.</li></ul>
