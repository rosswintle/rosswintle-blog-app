<p>Last week was half term holidays, made all the more interesting by my car&#8217;s drive-shaft breaking! Eeek!</p>



<p>But I had two GREAT days of work in there and exciting things are happening &#8211; I even submitted a talk to WordCamp London and will await a response to that nervously.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to</h2>



<ul><li>Starting off the new Laravel project.</li><li>I nudged along a site migration to new hosting that should be simple but involves 6 parties (old IT company, new IT company, new hosting company, ultimate client, intermediary consultant and me!). Migrations &#8211; like dates &#8211; are trickier than they seem!I had a REALLY interesting call about a REALLY interesting future project that may or may not happen.</li><li>Pretty much completed a small piece of WordPress work that involves some custom data. If you read last week&#8217;s week note then you may be interested to know that I went with custom pivot tables and I&#8217;m really happy with the result. But I&#8217;ve had to do custom file uploads, which are a pain (MIME types are just a weird kludge!), and some tables on the front end which I still need to style for mobile somehow, but it&#8217;s all coming together nicely.</li><li>Did a &#8220;quick 10 minute job&#8221; for a client&#8230;just inserted some code on a page&#8230;you know the sort of thing! (90 minutes later&#8230;) ?</li></ul>

I&#8217;d wanted something like this for a talk I may or may not be doing, but it&#8217;s quite expensive!</li></ul>



<p>Have a great week!</p>
