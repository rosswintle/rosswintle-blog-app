We&#8217;re about to start a whole new routine with my youngest starting pre-school and doing more hours there than she was in nursery, my wife taking on an extra half day and me&#8230;am I working more or just moving hours around? I can&#8217;t tell. Anyway, it&#8217;s crazy, and it starts today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week&#8217;s snow messed things up a little with a school closure on Friday too. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Still reviewing spec&#8217;s and working up a proposal for a new Laravel project. Keen to get going on this one if I can.<\/li><li>Finally got a long-outstanding, but really small project for a friend-of-a-friend live. It&#8217;s a couple of pages in a WordPress page-builder but has just been hanging around for so long. Smaller projects with no deadline often get put back and back. I&#8217;m going to try and stop taking them on.<\/li><li>More helping my friends at <a href=\"https:\/\/handsup.co.uk\">Hands Up<\/a> with last minute project snags on a custom WordPress build. There&#8217;s been some tricky issues with redirects that have been pretty hard to debug.<\/li><li>Another small, slow-burning project has had some good progress and I met the client this week to talk them through. They&#8217;re really happy with things and we have just a few final tasks to get through before we may be able to &#8220;go live&#8221;! It was wonderful seeing them use what I made and enjoying the benefits the re-work of their old website has brought.<\/li><li>Helping a client fix some SPF records to fix outgoing mail. SPF comes up SO often. I&#8217;m sure many have documented it, but I need to write my own guide.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/improving-internal-communications-its-a-people-problem\/\">Improving internal communications \u2013 it\u2019s a people problem\u2026<\/a>: This was a comment in a Facebook group that was blog-post worthy once tidied up a bit.
