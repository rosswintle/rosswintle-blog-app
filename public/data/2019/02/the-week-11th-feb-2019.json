Though it turns out there is no such thing as a &#8220;normal&#8221; week in our family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Work-wise some small projects have been nudged along and I&#8217;ve had interesting conversations about some new ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Specs for the new Laravel project progressed and draft proposal was made. I need to work up the final proposal still but then we should get going quickly, I hope.<\/li><li>There were quite a lot of calls about new things, large and small! There are two projects on the go which are squeezing databases of stuff into WordPress. I had a play with <a href=\"https:\/\/airtable.com\/\">AirTable<\/a> to see if that would fit well but their API &#8211; though clever &#8211; is quite limited.<\/li><li>I spent more time on complicated slug\/URL\/redirect issues &#8211; this was really tricky, but I think we&#8217;ve nailed it now.<\/li><li>I did some work on a small charity&#8217;s site, making some changes for them and trying to work out why WordPress wouldn&#8217;t do automatic security updates. This site was built by a big design agency using <a href=\"https:\/\/roots.io\/bedrock\/\">Bedrock<\/a> (or some kind of fork of it), which is total overkill for something this size. Bedrock is a composer-based WordPress environment where updates are all manual so someone needs to update it. But the agency then seems to have uploaded this site to a server and left it to get old. Extracting this site from Bedrock to make it easier to manage has been a challenge and this week I learned that WordPress prevents auto-updates if there is a <code>.git<\/code> folder\/directory that makes it look like WordPress is version controlled. ARGH!<\/li><li>I had a REALLY interesting call about a REALLY interesting future project that may or may not happen.<\/li><li>I had a stupid idea and this lead me to start some initial work on a new theme for my personal website.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Nothing posted last week. But here&#8217;s an old post about the character trait of High Sensitivity that might be illuminating for some: &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2015\/07\/highly-sensitive\/\">Highly Sensitive<\/a>&#8220;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pins: things I read and remembered<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/dannyvankooten.com\/from-go-back-to-php-again\/\">Moving from Go to PHP again<\/a> &#8211; Danny moved from Laravel to Go, but has now gone back to PHP in the form of Symfony.
