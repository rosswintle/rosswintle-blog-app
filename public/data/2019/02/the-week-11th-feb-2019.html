<p>Well, phew! The snow melted quickly and we got straight into the first week of the new routine. Though it turns out there is no such thing as a &#8220;normal&#8221; week in our family.</p>



<p>Work-wise some small projects have been nudged along and I&#8217;ve had interesting conversations about some new ones.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Specs for the new Laravel project progressed and draft proposal was made. I need to work up the final proposal still but then we should get going quickly, I hope.</li><li>There were quite a lot of calls about new things, large and small! There are two projects on the go which are squeezing databases of stuff into WordPress. I had a play with <a href="https://airtable.com/">AirTable</a> to see if that would fit well but their API &#8211; though clever &#8211; is quite limited.</li><li>I spent more time on complicated slug/URL/redirect issues &#8211; this was really tricky, but I think we&#8217;ve nailed it now.</li><li>I did some work on a small charity&#8217;s site, making some changes for them and trying to work out why WordPress wouldn&#8217;t do automatic security updates. This site was built by a big design agency using <a href="https://roots.io/bedrock/">Bedrock</a> (or some kind of fork of it), which is total overkill for something this size. Bedrock is a composer-based WordPress environment where updates are all manual so someone needs to update it. But the agency then seems to have uploaded this site to a server and left it to get old. Extracting this site from Bedrock to make it easier to manage has been a challenge and this week I learned that WordPress prevents auto-updates if there is a <code>.git</code> folder/directory that makes it look like WordPress is version controlled. ARGH!</li><li>I had a REALLY interesting call about a REALLY interesting future project that may or may not happen.</li><li>I had a stupid idea and this lead me to start some initial work on a new theme for my personal website.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Posts: things I made</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Nothing posted last week. But here&#8217;s an old post about the character trait of High Sensitivity that might be illuminating for some: &#8220;<a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2015/07/highly-sensitive/">Highly Sensitive</a>&#8220;</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pins: things I read and remembered</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><a href="https://dannyvankooten.com/from-go-back-to-php-again/">Moving from Go to PHP again</a> &#8211; Danny moved from Laravel to Go, but has now gone back to PHP in the form of Symfony.
