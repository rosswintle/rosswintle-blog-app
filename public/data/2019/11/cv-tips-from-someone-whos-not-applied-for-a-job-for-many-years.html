<p>Someone recently asked me for CV advice. When this happens I usually get passed a dull, monotonous document.</p>



<p>Now, I&#8217;ve not had to be recruited or do recruitment for years. So I may not have valid advice, but here&#8217;s a couple of simple things that I think most people can to do make their CV better.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Use structure</h2>



<p>Headings, font sizes, and formatting for emphasis can all break up a monotonous document. Use a bigger text size for the important stuff to catch people&#8217;s attention. But don&#8217;t go overboard.</p>



<p>Use bullet points and even columns to give it some structure and group information together.</p>



<p>Maybe even add a photo or other image, or just inject some colour?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don&#8217;t be passive.</h2>



<p>Claim what you&#8217;ve done!</p>



<p>Not: &#8220;Contributed to&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;Developed&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;Worked with&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>But: &#8220;*I* contributed to&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;*I* developed&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;*I* worked with&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a simple change, but it brings the document alive.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Use your skills to bring it alive.</h2>



<p>You&#8217;re a designer? DESIGN IT! Add some custom illustration, or something.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re a web developer? Make a web version of it (have a print version too &#8211; HR may need it!) Add JS sprinkles.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re a professional crafter? Send your CV in cross-stitch! (OK, maybe not, but you get the idea).</p>



<p>Get creative! BUT&#8230; not TOO creative. You want to stand out, but this remains a professional summary of your work. There&#8217;s a balance to be found.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">An example: My CV</h2>



<p>As I say, my CV is ancient. But I tried to make it personal, stand out, easy to read, and not just a monotonous list of things I have done.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m NOT looking for a job, but see what you think: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://t.co/Y8vTKTll9E?amp=1" target="_blank">https://rosswintle.uk/cv/cv.html</a></p>



<p>CV Tools &#8211; they may help</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure that there are a ton of templates that you can download and make use of that are better than just creating your own from scratch.</p>



<p>But there are also, nowadays, online services that help you write a nice-looking CV, such as <a href="https://enhancv.com/">Enhancv</a>. These cost though, so if you can afford it, go for your life. Otherwise, perhaps they will serve as inspiration for your own &#8220;design&#8221;.</p>
