I was really going to get going with Press Ups again, but that\u2019s fallen by the wayside because of illness and having to prioritise paid work. But I also wonder how much of that me procrastinating because my brain thinks I\u2019ve already done it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Save you announcements for when you are DONE!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How much of my work is tied to my self worth?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/pca.st\/episode\/d29cbe2e-9f3b-4362-927d-0cc94d0d6b2f\">Episode 50 of Paul Jarvis and Kaleigh Moor\u2019s Creative Class podcast<\/a> was good too &#8211; they talked about mental health, and it was really valuable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think a lot of freelancers could learn from the paragraph:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>How much of my work is tied to my self worth? It\u2019s normal to want validation, but don\u2019t have yourself on it entirely.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What if there isn\u2019t a path?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same episode, Paul talked about being asked for long term goals and how sometimes &#8211; especially when he\u2019s struggling &#8211; he isn\u2019t focussed on the long term goals he\u2019s focussed on doing what he has to do today, in the moment. Sometimes he knows what he has to do in the present, right now, and the focus is on doing that and not worrying about the bigger goals and the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve had some difficult weeks of late, and this idea that \u201cdoing the stuff of today is enough\u201d has really helped me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know there are some bigger goals, and they are good, but they also seem unattainable at times. So sometimes, doing what I have to do today is enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve been ill. My kids have been ill and I\u2019ve had to look after them. It\u2019s been a month of not getting much done. But I\u2019ve had to accept that. I\u2019ve had to accept that I didn\u2019t walk much along The Path today, but what I did today was enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What have you learned?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m grateful for all the podcasts and videos and articles. There is a lot of good knowledge being passed around in the world. These things have helped me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder what has helped you lately? Leave your own wisdom learned in the comments.<\/p>\n",
