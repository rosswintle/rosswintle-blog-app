<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">All the Brexit/Revoke Article 50 government petition resources</h1></header><main>
<p><strong>Update August 2019</strong>: Another <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/269157">petition about proroguing/suspending parliament</a> has been taking off and got 1,000,000 signatures in a day! So I&#8217;ve updated this list with some resources related to that as well.</p>



<p>Note that many of the tools listed here have a 6-digit petition ID in the URL, so if you change that from 241584 to 269157 you&#8217;ll get the equivalent analysis/data for the proroguing petition. Happy petitioning!</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>A couple of years back I was intrigued by the seemingly-very-uniform growth of <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/archived/petitions/131215">a large and fast-growing government petition</a>. The government&#8217;s <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/">petitions site</a> gives you <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/archived/petitions/131215.json">the data</a> in a quite usable form (called JSON) but it&#8217;s only an instantaneous snapshot of values. It doesn&#8217;t record the history of the petition&#8217;s growth.</p>



<p>So I built <a href="https://petition-track.uk/">a little tool</a> to collect the number of signatures every 5 minutes and store it so I could <a href="https://petition-track.uk/check-petition/131215">plot charts of growth</a>.</p>



<p>Now&#8230;you may have noticed that <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/241584">a little petition</a> has gone a bit &#8220;viral&#8221; in the last couple of days! So I kinda turn, temporarily, into petition data geek.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s not just me that is <a href="https://petition-track.uk/check-petition/241584">tracking it</a>. Various other people are doing interesting things with the data. So here&#8217;s a little list of Revoke Article 50 petition resources. If you want to add yours then <a href="https://twitter.com/magicroundabout">drop me a line</a>.</p>
