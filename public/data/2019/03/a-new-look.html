<p>If you&#8217;re a regular visitor you&#8217;ll notice things look VERY different around here today. If you&#8217;re not then you&#8217;re probably thinking WOAH!?!?! WHAT IS THIS?!</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been working on a little re-brand of my personal blog site. Here&#8217;s the low down on it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What have you done?</h3>



<p>Well, quite. I actually have no idea if this is a great idea or a terrible one. But I&#8217;ve removed the long-standing &#8220;Which Way Now&#8221; branding and made the whole thing much more &#8220;me&#8221;.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve implemented a new theme that I&#8217;ve created from scratch. I&#8217;ve 100% embraced the fact that I&#8217;m not a designer and removed pretty much all the images (apart from those in posts) and added a geeky, mono-spaced font look that&#8217;s hopefully appealing to my core audience. And the <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/">homepage</a> has a fun section for those-who-know to try out with plenty of Easter eggs to find</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve also tried to embrace modern web technologies &#8211; more about this in the &#8220;How?&#8221; section, below.</p>



<p>I still need to re-work a lot of out of date pages and do a bit more work on presenting content and adding what I want in the navigation/sidebar. The structure is/will be somewhat inspired by <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2019/02/17/organizing-this-blog-into-categories/">Julia Evans&#8217;s ideas</a> about categorising her blog.</p>



<p>Other inspiration is from:</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why have you done this?</h3>



<p>I think my audience has changed &#8211; it&#8217;s more technical people now and less general folk.</p>



<p>I think the things I write and the reasons I write have changed &#8211; it&#8217;s less of a life journal and more of a set of technical articles and stuff about technology and work.</p>



<p>This will sounds horribly vain, I know &#8211; when I started working freelance I set up <a href="https://oikos.digital/">Oikos</a> as my business, but I was never sure if it would be more important to promote the business or to promote myself. Over the last few years it&#8217;s become evident that my personal &#8220;brand&#8221; is more important to my work, so I&#8217;m really focussing in on that with this change.</p>



<p>I wanted to show that I could build my own theme for my own site, gain greater control over the structure of it, learn some new things, try some new things, and tinker with technology.</p>



<p>As I said, I&#8217;m not a designer and I always had a sense that my personal site didn&#8217;t need to be image-heavy; why load a bunch of impersonal stock images or off-the-shelf icons that actually say nothing about me? So I&#8217;ve gone all in on the geeky coding theme and it&#8217;s super fast and light-weight as a result, with fun things for my core audience to play with.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How did you make it?</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s built with:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>WordPress</li><li>Plain CSS (including flexbox)</li><li>A little plain vanilla, framework-free JavaScript (ES6 to be precise, might struggle on IE11)</li><li>My <a href="https://github.com/rosswintle/oiko_s/tree/SUCSS">own super-simple starter theme</a> based on <a href="http://underscores.me/">_s</a> (&#8220;<a href="http://underscores.me/">underscores</a>&#8220;) &#8211; I&#8217;m working on a branch that removes the SASS and Webkit build process</li><li>ZERO build process</li><li>ZERO cookie-based analytics or social media tracking codes &#8211; I use my own <a href="https://blog.kownter.com/">Kownter</a> (still early work in progress) for anonymised, private analytics</li><li>100% system font stacks &#8211; I ship you NO font files. I&#8217;m actually not entirely happy with the system mono-spaced fonts, I wanted something more Courier&#8217;y really</li></ul>



<p>This has been years in the thinking, but not actually that long in the making. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed doing it and I&#8217;m pleased with the result&#8230;I think?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s still not quite finished, and I&#8217;m totally up for feedback. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s easy enough to read, so if you think the idea of the design is terrible then do tell me.</p>



<p>Finally, all good websites have a quote from my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/smp303">Simon Pollard</a>, so here&#8217;s the obligatory hat tip to him:</p>
