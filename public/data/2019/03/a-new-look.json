        "rendered": "\n<p>If you&#8217;re a regular visitor you&#8217;ll notice things look VERY different around here today. If you&#8217;re not then you&#8217;re probably thinking WOAH!?!?! WHAT IS THIS?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been working on a little re-brand of my personal blog site. Here&#8217;s the low down on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What have you done?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, quite. I actually have no idea if this is a great idea or a terrible one. But I&#8217;ve removed the long-standing &#8220;Which Way Now&#8221; branding and made the whole thing much more &#8220;me&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve implemented a new theme that I&#8217;ve created from scratch. I&#8217;ve 100% embraced the fact that I&#8217;m not a designer and removed pretty much all the images (apart from those in posts) and added a geeky, mono-spaced font look that&#8217;s hopefully appealing to my core audience. And the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/\">homepage<\/a> has a fun section for those-who-know to try out with plenty of Easter eggs to find<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also tried to embrace modern web technologies &#8211; more about this in the &#8220;How?&#8221; section, below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still need to re-work a lot of out of date pages and do a bit more work on presenting content and adding what I want in the navigation\/sidebar. The structure is\/will be somewhat inspired by <a href=\"http:\/\/jvns.ca\/blog\/2019\/02\/17\/organizing-this-blog-into-categories\/\">Julia Evans&#8217;s ideas<\/a> about categorising her blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other inspiration is from:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/changelog.com\/\">Changelog.com<\/a><\/li><li>My friend <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/keiron\">@keiron&#8217;s<\/a> &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.geekeryasaservice.co.uk\/\">Geekery as a Service<\/a>&#8220;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why have you done this?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I think my audience has changed &#8211; it&#8217;s more technical people now and less general folk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the things I write and the reasons I write have changed &#8211; it&#8217;s less of a life journal and more of a set of technical articles and stuff about technology and work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will sounds horribly vain, I know &#8211; when I started working freelance I set up <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/\">Oikos<\/a> as my business, but I was never sure if it would be more important to promote the business or to promote myself. Over the last few years it&#8217;s become evident that my personal &#8220;brand&#8221; is more important to my work, so I&#8217;m really focussing in on that with this change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to show that I could build my own theme for my own site, gain greater control over the structure of it, learn some new things, try some new things, and tinker with technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I said, I&#8217;m not a designer and I always had a sense that my personal site didn&#8217;t need to be image-heavy; why load a bunch of impersonal stock images or off-the-shelf icons that actually say nothing about me? So I&#8217;ve gone all in on the geeky coding theme and it&#8217;s super fast and light-weight as a result, with fun things for my core audience to play with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How did you make it?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s built with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>WordPress<\/li><li>Plain CSS (including flexbox)<\/li><li>A little plain vanilla, framework-free JavaScript (ES6 to be precise, might struggle on IE11)<\/li><li>My <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/oiko_s\/tree\/SUCSS\">own super-simple starter theme<\/a> based on <a href=\"http:\/\/underscores.me\/\">_s<\/a> (&#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/underscores.me\/\">underscores<\/a>&#8220;) &#8211; I&#8217;m working on a branch that removes the SASS and Webkit build process<\/li><li>ZERO build process<\/li><li>ZERO cookie-based analytics or social media tracking codes &#8211; I use my own <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/\">Kownter<\/a> (still early work in progress) for anonymised, private analytics<\/li><li>100% system font stacks &#8211; I ship you NO font files. I&#8217;m actually not entirely happy with the system mono-spaced fonts, I wanted something more Courier&#8217;y really<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been years in the thinking, but not actually that long in the making. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed doing it and I&#8217;m pleased with the result&#8230;I think?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s still not quite finished, and I&#8217;m totally up for feedback. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s easy enough to read, so if you think the idea of the design is terrible then do tell me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, all good websites have a quote from my friend <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/smp303\">Simon Pollard<\/a>, so here&#8217;s the obligatory hat tip to him:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>It is missing a quote from me &#8211; all good sites have a quote from me<\/p><cite>Simon Pollard<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n",
