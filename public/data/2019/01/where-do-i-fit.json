        "rendered": "\n<p><em>Preamble: This will, at times, sound like I&#8217;m trying to sell myself. I&#8217;m not. If I wanted to sell myself I&#8217;d write a post extolling my virtues rather than questioning them. But I can&#8217;t write about finding my place without describing the things that will help determine my place. If it&#8217;s self-indulgent, I&#8217;m sorry. On with the show&#8230;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really wanted to some hopes and goals for 2019 down in the form of a pre-emptive\/prophetic retrospective on the year. I.e. what do I want my 2019 review to look like in 12 months time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the truth is, I&#8217;m a bit stuck with some major parts of it. And this post will, I hope, help me collect my thoughts on it and maybe inspire some feedback.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big question really, is: where do I fit in the world of web development?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Between proficiency levels<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that ALL software developers could write this next sentence: I feel pretty stuck in the middle. I&#8217;m clearly a far more experienced software developer than many. But I&#8217;m also clearly a far less experienced developer than many. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a CS degree and a strong background in software engineering and high-end hosting operations. I can mentor other people on coding in various languages; I&#8217;m highly proficient at using code to solve problems; and I&#8217;m pretty advanced at dealing with databases and hosting too. But I also look at other people who have a really deep knowledge of a particular language or framework or something who know far more than I do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m between proficiency levels. And confused about how much I should be an educator helping people up the ladder, and how much I need to humbly accept that I&#8217;ve got a lot to learn and get on with expanding my own knowledge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Between primary areas of technical expertise<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And if there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;m highly proficient in, it&#8217;s WordPress. To continue being highly proficient with WordPress I need to learn to develop with the new block editor, which means more JavaScript and probably React.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, WordPress is between things: I feel like the new editor switches its direction from being a multi-purpose CMS to being a tool that is primarily for publishing and simple site building. Editing and site construction is now front and centre. Post types and fields have taken a back seat. Evolving the database to cater for things like post relationships seems like it&#8217;ll never happen. Gutenberg is an advanced HTML editing tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so as well as being on the Laravel train (which I very much am) I&#8217;m also feeling like I need new CMS options, of which there are so many now it&#8217;s very confusing to know where to start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I also face a more general choice between dragging myself kicking and screaming into more JavaScript and React, and knuckling down into PHP and Laravel and deeper back-end wrangling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Between soft and hard skills<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as being a good software developer, I like to think that I have a good set of soft skills that I enjoy making use of:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Understanding business\/organisational problems<\/li><li>Writing<\/li><li>Bidding and pitching for work<\/li><li>Project management<\/li><li>Speaking and Educating<\/li><li>Administration and running a business<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This also spreads me thin. Should I focus more on just doing the technology? Or do these skills give me a (uncommon?) ability to bridge the gap between less-technical people and technology. Should I be maximising on being that bridge in my projects at the expense of technical focus?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Between project sizes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who has historically wanted to connect smaller organisations with technology that can help them, I&#8217;ve often had multiple small projects on the go, as well as larger, longer term projects for bigger clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is actually quite exhausting and stressful. Smaller projects sometimes need as much communication and project management as larger ones as less tech-savvy clients need more hand-holding through the process. Keeping it all in my head and juggling deadlines and expectations as well as getting the technical work done is quite difficult. And yes, I confess, at times I&#8217;ve not been very good at it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I feel, right now, like I want to ditch all the smaller stuff and find a smaller number of larger projects to work on this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don&#8217;t know how to sell myself on those bigger projects or where that work will come from. Plus, my business focus has always been on the smaller orgs and there&#8217;s something about being in that space that I love. I <em>want<\/em> to help those people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Argh!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Mentor, or be mentored?<\/li><li>Focus on back-end tech, or embrace the move to JavaScript and front-end?<\/li><li>Dig into modern WordPress development, or spread my wings elsewhere?<\/li><li>Double-down on my tech skills, or continue to work with my soft skills in a big way too?<\/li><li>See if I can find some bigger, longer term (and better paid?) projects to ease the mental (and financial?) strain? Or carry on my mission of being a bridge enabling smaller organisations to embrace modern website technology, bearing the load as I go?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where I&#8217;m at. Lots of questions, and potentially lots of risks and opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The difficult beauty of being multi-skilled<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be easy if I was just a back-end or reasonably full-stack dev, coding to a provided spec without considering the consequences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be easy if I was an hip young web dev coding React front ends all over the place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be easy if I was a WordPress implementor churning out small sites to a fixed process with a bit of design skill or possibly working with a designer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m an in-betweeny: I have <em>lots<\/em> of skills and interests; I have a keen desire to do good and right things and care about my craft; I&#8217;m a coder and an educator; I&#8217;m a businessman and a geek; I&#8217;m an open-minded developer who wants to get to grips with new technologie, and also a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.brucelawson.co.uk\/2018\/the-practical-value-of-semantic-html\/\">Dull Old Web Fart<\/a>&#8221; who&#8217;s set in his ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And\u2026I must remind myself, I MUST!\u2026what an amazing thing to be!! What a unique, eclectic, diverse range of skills and experiences! How can I not be happy that I&#8217;m capable of being these bridges, building cool things on the web, helping people use technology to solve problems. What a privilege!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Marketing me<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The difficulty is partly marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People don&#8217;t Google for &#8220;multi-disciplinary geeks&#8221; to help them solve problems. They Google &#8220;web designers in Swindon&#8221; or &#8220;Charity website builders&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People don&#8217;t want a landing page to say &#8220;I&#8217;ll use cool technology to help you solve your business problems&#8221; because it doesn&#8217;t really mean anything. They want to see &#8220;We make fast, beautiful WordPress websites&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I want to embrace &#8220;me&#8221;, how do I communicate that to others &#8211; to non-technical people that want to understand what I do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2019 then?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What does it hold? I really don&#8217;t know. Perhaps you can help me write the prophetic 2019 review this week. Have I missed something obvious? Am I running scared? Do I just need to make some decisions and stick them out for a while?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be my coach: what would you do?!<\/p>\n",
