I&#8217;ve been reviewing spec&#8217;s and working up a proposal for a new Laravel project.<\/li><li>I finished off a custom WordPress-to-MailChimp integration that needed to be added to a past project that I worked on.<\/li><li>I&#8217;ve been helping my friends at <a href=\"https:\/\/handsup.co.uk\">Hands Up<\/a> finish off some last minute snags on a custom WordPress build.<\/li><li>I&#8217;ve had the usual background load of fixing other people&#8217;s hosting, DNS and coding issues &#8211; as someone with a strong(er-than-average) networking and hosting background I pick up a lot of this stuff.<\/li><li>In side-project land I&#8217;ve been making a bit of progress with SchoolBot, adding a few commands, some back-end admin stuff that&#8217;s been needed for ages and starting to add some randomness\/fun\/politeness to the bot&#8217;s tone of voice. I&#8217;ve also actually posting some useful information about it on <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/het_schoolbot\">Twitter<\/a>. I still need to make a marketing\/landing page for it and to try to recruit a forward-thinking tech-savvy school that may want to pilot it at some point.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve not posted to the blog this week, but following Paul Jarvis&#8217;s &#8220;Greatest Hits&#8221; idea I don&#8217;t see why I shouldn&#8217;t surface some old stuff and things that were posted in the &#8220;gap&#8221; of my week-notes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/my-new-css-framework-sucss\/\">My new CSS framework: SUCSS<\/a> &#8211; I&#8217;ve never been happy with how people do CSS. I always thought there was a missing middle-ground between all the frameworks and techniques. Maybe I found it? Includes my history with CSS and some ideas about how I may try and drop CSS build tools entierly.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/01\/not-all-software-development-processes-are-equal\/\">Not all software development processes are equal<\/a>: In which I summon up the courage to add my own experiences to that of a software engineering legend. Ultimately I agree with him, but the illustration he chooses may not be the best and I hopefully add some insight into a software world you may not be familiar with!<\/li><li><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pins: things I read and remembered<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sindresorhus\/quick-look-plugins\">Quick Look Plugins<\/a>: A list of MacOS\/Finder Quick Look plugins for developers <\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/securitycheckli.st\/\">SecurityCheckli.st<\/a>: A list of things you can do to improve your online security and privacy.
