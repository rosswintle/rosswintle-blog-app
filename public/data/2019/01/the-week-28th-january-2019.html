<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">The week: 28th January 2019</h1></header><main>
<p>Back in September and October last year I had a weekly thing of writing up my week in posts (I was blogging more frequently then), projects (what I was up to!) and pins (things I had bookmarked).</p>



<p>It was a really good discipline and I enjoyed doing it (even if it didn&#8217;t benefit anyone else), so inspired by <a href="https://andy-bell.design/notes/95/">Andy Bell</a>, who was in turn inspired by <a href="https://paulrobertlloyd.com/2019/01/weeknotes_1">Paul Robert Lloyd</a>, I&#8217;m trying to get back into it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Generally after a slow start to the year, work is starting to come in. I&#8217;ve been reviewing spec&#8217;s and working up a proposal for a new Laravel project.</li><li>I finished off a custom WordPress-to-MailChimp integration that needed to be added to a past project that I worked on.</li><li>I&#8217;ve been helping my friends at <a href="https://handsup.co.uk">Hands Up</a> finish off some last minute snags on a custom WordPress build.</li><li>I&#8217;ve had the usual background load of fixing other people&#8217;s hosting, DNS and coding issues &#8211; as someone with a strong(er-than-average) networking and hosting background I pick up a lot of this stuff.</li><li>In side-project land I&#8217;ve been making a bit of progress with SchoolBot, adding a few commands, some back-end admin stuff that&#8217;s been needed for ages and starting to add some randomness/fun/politeness to the bot&#8217;s tone of voice. I&#8217;ve also actually posting some useful information about it on <a href="https://twitter.com/het_schoolbot">Twitter</a>. I still need to make a marketing/landing page for it and to try to recruit a forward-thinking tech-savvy school that may want to pilot it at some point.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Posts: things I made</h2>



<p>I&#8217;ve not posted to the blog this week, but following Paul Jarvis&#8217;s &#8220;Greatest Hits&#8221; idea I don&#8217;t see why I shouldn&#8217;t surface some old stuff and things that were posted in the &#8220;gap&#8221; of my week-notes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2019/01/my-new-css-framework-sucss/">My new CSS framework: SUCSS</a> &#8211; I&#8217;ve never been happy with how people do CSS. I always thought there was a missing middle-ground between all the frameworks and techniques. Maybe I found it? Includes my history with CSS and some ideas about how I may try and drop CSS build tools entierly.</li><li><a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2019/01/not-all-software-development-processes-are-equal/">Not all software development processes are equal</a>: In which I summon up the courage to add my own experiences to that of a software engineering legend. Ultimately I agree with him, but the illustration he chooses may not be the best and I hopefully add some insight into a software world you may not be familiar with!</li><li></li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pins: things I read and remembered</h2>
