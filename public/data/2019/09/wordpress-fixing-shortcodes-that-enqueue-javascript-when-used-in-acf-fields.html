<p>There wasn&#8217;t really a shorter title for this post.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Too long? Didn&#8217;t read?</h2>



<p>Here&#8217;s the quick bit of learning: WordPress runs the <code>wp_enqueue_scripts</code> action hook during the execution of <code>wp_head</code> and it encourages you to register scripts on this hook. SO if you do something that you want to enqueue scripts correctly, you must do it AFTER <code>wp_head</code> runs &#8211; which usually means after <code>wp_header()</code> is called in the theme.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">My use case and problem</h2>



<p>I was working for a client doing some maintenance on a theme that someone else had built. The theme used Advanced Custom Fields, and in some cases shortcodes were used inside ACF WYSIWYG fields.</p>



<p>One of the shortcodes used needed some styles and/or scripts to be enqueued to make the shortcode work. But this should be fine right? Executing the shortcode would enqueue the assets. No problem there.</p>



<p>Well, then my theme had some code that was using the ACF field&#8217;s content. It set up some values near the top of the file, grabbing values from the ACF fields using the <code>get_field()</code> function, before outputting the template&#8217;s HTML content. Something like this:</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate" title="">
&lt;?php
$title = get_field('title');
$content = get_field('content');
?&gt;

&lt;?php
  wp_header();
?&gt;

&lt;main&gt;
  // Output the content here
&lt;/main&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>But, while the shortcode was definitely running, as I was seeing it&#8217;s output, the scripts that made the shortcode work were not being enqueued.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s going on?</h2>



<p>The plugin that gave me the shortcode actually worked correctly:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Scripts were registered correctly using <code>wp_register_script()</code> on the <code>wp_enqueue_scripts</code> action hook</li><li>The callback function that generated the shortcode output was running the <code>wp_enqueue_script()</code> function</li><li>The scripts were registered to be output in the footer, so enqueuing them during the shortcode output function should be fine</li></ul>



<p>BUT&#8230;because the <code>wp_enqueue_scripts</code> action hook fires during <code>wp_header()</code> this code was failing.</p>



<p>It failed because the shortcode callback was run when I did the <code>get_field()</code> call on the WYSIWYG field. The <code>get_field()</code> call is before <code>wp_header()</code> and therefore before the scripts are registered. So at the point the shortcode call back runs, the script is not registered so it can not be enqueued.</p>



<p>Phew. Are you still with me?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The fix</h2>



<p>The fix is simple &#8211; get the content, and therefore run the shortcodes, after <code>wp_header()</code> has been called so that the scripts are registered before they are enqueued:</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate" title="">
&lt;?php
  wp_header();
?&gt;

&lt;?php
$title = get_field('title');
$content = get_field('content');
?&gt;

&lt;main&gt;
  // Output the content here
&lt;/main&gt;
</pre></div>
