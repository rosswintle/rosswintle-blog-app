<p>Wow &#8211; so school is back this week!! At the start of the long summer holiday I was thinking how this was a LONG time and would really drag, but gosh it&#8217;s flown by. But we&#8217;re about to return to the regular routine.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to</h2>



<p>I&#8217;ve been doing hosting stuff, development stuff, and other stuff. Which is pretty much my life. Side projects are taking a bit of a back seat while I focus on some things that need to be done for students going back to school or university. Things with proper hard deadlines!!</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve always said I would HATE to be a construction company building schools because the deadlines are so fixed. I&#8217;ve built things like advent calendars and new-year projects. But I tend to avoid projects with super-hard deadlines UNLESS the client seems to show a real understanding of the process involved and possible compromises.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Made some big additions to a clever <strong>WordPress</strong> thing I&#8217;m making for a client. It&#8217;s a simple-but-effective tool using some simple <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>AJAX</strong> and <strong>custom tables</strong> to link things together. Oh, and there&#8217;s a <strong>custom CSV import</strong> too. There was a dilemma about using custom tables or custom post types, but I had to deliver quickly and relatively cheaply so I just had to make a decision and go with it. I think I got it right.</li><li>Progressed a <strong>WordPress micro-site build</strong> I&#8217;m doing for a big charity, including building my first <strong>ACF-powered Gutenberg block</strong>!</li><li>Did a bunch of changes to a site I&#8217;m looking after for a smaller charity. This is an interesting one because the theme is quite fixed and they are wanting to make frequent changes to it. The current layout tools aren&#8217;t working, so I&#8217;m hoping to help them break free of the current constraints at some point and make it a bit more flexible.</li><li>A new <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/269157"><strong>government petition</strong></a> went crazy for a while so I became temporary government petitions expert for a short time, because I run <a href="https://petition-track.uk/check-petition/269157"><strong>a service that tracks petition growth</strong></a>. This one hasn&#8217;t quite blown up like the <a href="https://petition-track.uk/check-petition/241584">article 50 petition</a> did.</li><li>I recorded an informal &#8220;fireside chat&#8221; with <a href="https://twitter.com/keithdevon/">Keith Devon</a> that may or may not become an edition of his EXCELLENT <a href="https://pricingwp.highrise.digital/">Pricing WordPress</a> podcast. Watch that space (not this one).</li><li>The week ended with me <strong>supporting a small community group</strong> doing a 10 mile walk/run. <strong>I was bike marshall</strong>, and yes, it was just an excuse to clock up some decent bike miles (and vertical metres too!). But I was handing out Jelly Babies and encouragement and keeping track of everyone as well. Great fun!</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Posts: things I made</h2>



<p>I&#8217;ve written a few blog posts since February</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>In light of the new petition I updated my <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2019/03/all-the-brexit-revoke-article-50-government-petition-resources/">All the Brexit/Revoke Article 50 government petition resources</a> &#8211; A list of resources on Government petitions I collected while being temporary Government Petitions Data Guru</li><li><a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2019/08/lifehack-family-brain/">Lifehack: Family Brain</a> &#8211; Stupid lifehack that basically equates to &#8220;writing things down&#8221;, but it was popular, so I wrote it up.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This week I learned</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>The Google Maps app has a &#8220;Shake to send feedback&#8221; option</strong> that&#8217;s REALLY ANNOYING when your phone is strapped to your bike for navigation. ?</li></ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Laravel&#8217;s </strong><code><strong>dump()</strong></code><strong> and </strong><code><strong>dd()</strong></code><strong> (die-and-dump) functions have built-in search function!</strong> Actually, I&#8217;d known about <code>dd()</code> but wasn&#8217;t aware you could just <code>dump()</code> &#8211; something I&#8217;d always wanted but had never found (even though it&#8217;s in <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/helpers#method-dump">the docs</a> &#8211; duh!).

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Toolbox</h2>



<p>We go camping from time to time (in a huge 5m canvas bell tent I should add). And we sometimes visit beaches and need to carry all the 3- and 7-year old beach paraphernalia with us.  And we now have an Aldi supermarket <em>literally</em> at the end of our road now. So <strong>I&#8217;ve been thinking for a while about buying a big camping trolley</strong>, as we could use it for camping and days out, but also for doing big shopping trips without driving the car to literally-the-end-of-our-street.</p>



<p>After a bit of research I found what appeared to be a good balance of value, functionality, capacity, and foldability in the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kampa-Trucker-Trolley/dp/B00IF61YHO">K<strong>ampa Trucker</strong></a>.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a heavy thing of its own, but this is because it&#8217;s a beast of a thing that will take 100kg of stuff. It&#8217;s great. We didn&#8217;t actually take it on our recent camping holiday as it wouldn&#8217;t fit in the car (not sure how to solve that one). But the kids love it for the shopping trips and I do too! <strong>Highly recommended if&#8230;err&#8230;you have a supermarket at the end of your street.</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Time Machine</h2>



<p><a href="https://beatthestreet.me/"><strong>Beat the Street</strong></a><strong> is returning to Swindon</strong>. It was wildly successful here last year, and I never got around to a proper write up of my thoughts on the game itself. But <strong>I did experiment with building </strong><a href="https://zapthemap.com/"><strong>a virtual version of the game</strong></a> with <strong>smartphones, geolocation, Vue.js, and Laravel</strong>.</p>
