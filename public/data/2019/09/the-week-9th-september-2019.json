        "rendered": "\n<p>We survived going back to school! Hooray. And we&#8217;re well settled into the new weekly routine of key-stage 2. I, unfortunately, have come down with a nasty cold. So I&#8217;m not running at 100% capacity. But it&#8217;s been a good week nonetheless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been continuing to work on a charity microsite re-build that I&#8217;m doing in WordPress with vanilla JS and CSS, and building more ACF Gutenberg blocks. I&#8217;m loving this approach for small projects. It&#8217;s got it&#8217;s problems, but so has any method\/framework. And the simplicity of it is great and, in my opinion, the pros outweigh the cons for small projects like this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I did a big chunk of maintenance for a site that I look after for a small charity client.<\/li><li>Sorted out some <strong>Google Tag Manager and analytics event issues<\/strong> for a client, and learned a few things along the way<\/li><li>Spent an hour or so <strong>helping a client fix up some old micro sites<\/strong> that had been broken by a compulsory PHP upgrade that their hosting company made months ago. This was one of those things were not-every-WordPress-person would have had the skills to diagnose and fix it as I was <strong>digging around in logs and debugging other people&#8217;s stuff<\/strong>. I like to think I added good value here.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/keithdevon\/\">Keith Devon<\/a> and I worked on editing down our informal &#8220;fireside chat&#8221; that should become an edition of his EXCELLENT <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/\">Pricing WordPress<\/a> podcast this week. Watch that space (not this one).<\/li><li>Over the weekend, from my bed-of-poorliness, I started upgrading some of my side projects&#8217; Laravel versions. The excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/laravelshift.com\/\">Laravel Shift<\/a> service can automate this for you, but my apps are really simple and I wanted to experience the manual approach. A write up will come soon.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/09\/camping-thoughts\/\">Camping thoughts<\/a> &#8211; I wrote some random thoughts on camping holidays I had while we were away over the summer. Featuring unlimited screen time for kids, Big Brother for the outdoors and bringing boiled water to campsites.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/09\/tech-communities-are-good\/\">Tech communities are good<\/a> &#8211; Frustrated with some of the negativity that seems prevalent in tech communities, I write this to point out that bad stuff is actually a small percentage of what goes on in tech communities, it&#8217;s just that we hear about it more. There&#8217;s loads of good stuff going on every day in tech communities. Let&#8217;s shout about that some more! (This made it into both the <a href=\"https:\/\/us13.campaign-archive.com\/?u=bf5d11ade9be022f552b86e69&amp;id=6c1faa9e9e\">MasterWP<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/poststatus.com\/newsletter\/\">Post Status<\/a> newsletters! Woop!)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This week I learned<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/make.wordpress.org\/core\/2019\/09\/02\/changes-to-prevent-search-engines-indexing-sites\/\">WordPress is changing how it blocks robots<\/a><\/strong>. AND <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/prevent-site-being-indexed\/\">robots\/crawlers and robots.txt<\/a> don&#8217;t work how I thought they did.<\/li><li>About PHP generators: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.php.net\/manual\/en\/language.generators.overview.php\">PHP: Generators overview &#8211; Manual<\/a> (via the free <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/whats-new-in-laravel-6\/episodes\/1\">Laracasts overview of Laravel 6<\/a>)<\/li><li>About the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/junegunn\/fzf\">fzf fuzzy-find command line tool<\/a> (via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tnash\">@tnash<\/a>)<\/li><li>About the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.php.net\/manual\/en\/function.levenshtein.php\">levenshtein()<\/a> PHP function that finds words that are almost the same as the word you have, sort of. (I think this was also via the <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/whats-new-in-laravel-6\/episodes\/2\">Laracasts overview of Laravel 6<\/a>)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Toolbox<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is worthy of its own blog post, but I cycle a bit and like to listen to podcasts as I do. A couple of years back I tried some cheap Bluetooth wireless ear buds. They weren&#8217;t much good. So I tried a second time paying a bit more and found <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Skullcandy-Bluetooth-Wireless-Ear-Earbuds-Black\/dp\/B06XX123SH?psc=1&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&amp;tag=duckduckgo-ffab-uk-21&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B06XX123SH\">some I liked<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I stupidly lost these last week and so went looking for some new earbuds and wondered what was new in the last couple of years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a bit of help from Twitter (thanks everyone!) I decided to try some cheap-ish &#8220;true wireless&#8221; headphones. And I&#8217;m actually mightily impressed. There are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=a30Hnuzgr6s\">many, many models you can buy<\/a> for under \u00a350, but someone recommended some MPOW wireless ones, and so I opted to try the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/dp\/B07SZ8V339?aaxitk=nGwZgKVZXZbdOX8JyKeDyw&amp;pd_rd_i=B07SZ8V339&amp;pf_rd_p=0192e6ab-5959-4731-9929-242726c28327&amp;hsa_cr_id=2992214720002&amp;sb-ci-n=asinImage&amp;sb-ci-v=https%3A%2F%2Fm.media-amazon.com%2Fimages%2FI%2F416BQLNpTbL.jpg&amp;sb-ci-a=B07SZ8V339\">MPOW true-wireless ones<\/a> and&#8230;they&#8217;re a bit big and stupid-looking, but they stay in my ears (surprisingly!) do the job and for \u00a330 I&#8217;m more than happy with them. I&#8217;m REALLY impressed with this technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time Machine<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I go on about this a lot, but discovering I was a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2015\/07\/highly-sensitive\/\">Highly Sensitive<\/a>&#8221; person was quite a revelation to me and our family. I suspect that many people I know have this character trait too (about 20% of people do!) and understanding it may be helpful. So ages ago I did a write up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you ever felt like you experience the world more intensely than others, if you have a high attention to detail and find big events with lots of people tiring, maybe this is you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pins: things I read and remembered<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I bookmarked this week (not much it would seem!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Brought to you with <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/pinboard.in\"><em>pinboard.in<\/em><\/a><em> and my <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/sync-pinboard\/\"><em>Sync Pinboard<\/em><\/a><em> plugin)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-sync-pinboard-pins\"><ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/shariff\/\">Shariff Wrapper \u2013 WordPress plugin | WordPress.org<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>Interesting privacy-aware sharing buttons plugin via @rmccue<\/span><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2019\/08\/bottom-navigation-pattern-mobile-web-pages\/\">Bottom Navigation Pattern On Mobile Web Pages: A Better Alternative?<\/a><span> &#8211; <\/span><span>I really like the idea of fixed-bottom navigation on websites.
