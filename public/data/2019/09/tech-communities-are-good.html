<p>There&#8217;s been some really nasty stuff going around some tech communities recently. I don&#8217;t follow a lot of it directly, but some of the detail has come to me indirectly. It&#8217;s horrible for all sorts of reasons I won&#8217;t go into here.</p>



<p>BUT&#8230;I want to point out that this drama is a tiny-but-highly-visible portion of what goes on in tech communities.</p>



<p>Last week I got some amazing help from one of the communities I chat with. Free technical help from 4 or 5 people who wanted nothing in return, and when I offered they suggested I gave to charity, which I willingly did this morning.</p>



<p>This is what&#8217;s happening underneath all the drama all the time. In WordPress. In Laravel. In Statamic. In whatever places you hang out there will be good stuff happening.</p>



<p>People helping each other and looking out for one another. People teaming up for support. People being friends and virtual co-workers. People busy answering forum questions. People building cool free (as in both beer and speech) stuff that makes our lives easier.</p>



<p>Yes, we need to tackle what&#8217;s bad in these communities. That&#8217;s SUPER important. But let&#8217;s also elevate, promote, shout about the good stuff.</p>



<ul><li>Promote an <a href="https://github.com/BinaryMoon/wp-toolbelt/">open source project</a> or <a href="https://timnash.co.uk/blog/">blog</a> or <a href="https://worknotes.co.uk/">resource</a> or <a href="https://pricingwp.highrise.digital/">podcast</a>.</li><li>Give <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?text=Thank%20you%20%3Cinsert%20persons%20name%20here%3E...%20!%20You're%20awesome%20because%20you%20%3Cinsert%20awesome%20thing%20they%20did%3E!">thanks online for the help you get</a>.</li><li>Offer to actually buy a coffee or beer (use <a href="https://ko-fi.com/">Ko-fi.com</a> or <a href="https://paypal.me">paypal.me</a> if helpful) or give to charity when someone gives you help and saves you time/money.</li><li>Support people who do good work.</li><li>Collaborate with your competitors.</li></ul>



<p>There&#8217;s so much good stuff going on. Let&#8217;s make that known and help it grow.</p>
