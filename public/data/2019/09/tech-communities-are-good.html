<p>There&#8217;s been some really nasty stuff going around some tech communities recently. I don&#8217;t follow a lot of it directly, but some of the detail has come to me indirectly. It&#8217;s horrible for all sorts of reasons I won&#8217;t go into here.</p>



<p>BUT&#8230;I want to point out that this drama is a tiny-but-highly-visible portion of what goes on in tech communities.</p>



<p>Last week I got some amazing help from one of the communities I chat with. Free technical help from 4 or 5 people who wanted nothing in return, and when I offered they suggested I gave to charity, which I willingly did this morning.</p>



<p>This is what&#8217;s happening underneath all the drama all the time. In WordPress. In Laravel. In Statamic. In whatever places you hang out there will be good stuff happening.</p>



<p>People helping each other and looking out for one another. People teaming up for support. People being friends and virtual co-workers. People busy answering forum questions. People building cool free (as in both beer and speech) stuff that makes our lives easier.</p>



<p>Yes, we need to tackle what&#8217;s bad in these communities. That&#8217;s SUPER important. But let&#8217;s also elevate, promote, shout about the good stuff.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s so much good stuff going on. Let&#8217;s make that known and help it grow.</p>
