<p>Late weeknotes again &#8211; sorry! My heavy cold has been hitting me hard &#8211; struggling to shake it off. So not the best week.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to</h2>



<p>I&#8217;m still working my charity microsite build. I also did two hosting moves and worked on some updates to another client&#8217;s site. Not a hugely exciting week to be honest. But that&#8217;s my bread and butter.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Posts: things I made</h2>



<ul><li>No real posts this week as such, but I was inspired to try and get my <a href="https://press-ups.com/">Press Ups</a> project back up and running a bit, so I set up an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/press_ups/">Instagram</a> for it and started trying to revive social media around it. There&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/press_ups/">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pressupswp/">Facebook</a> too. Deciding to revive what is essentially a video tutorial project when fighting off a heavy cold wasn&#8217;t my best idea ever. But we&#8217;ll see where it goes.</li></ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This week I learned</h2>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.descript.com/">Descript</a> exists! An amazing audio and video editor that works by transcribing text and letting you edit that text &#8211; as you edit the text, it edits the video/audio for you. I tried it out. It seems legit and has a free plan. Really incredible tech. Their intro video is AMAZING. (Note: I&#8217;m <strong>not</strong> an ambassador or on commission or anything)</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Toolbox</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s talk about <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear Notes</a>.</p>



<p>I write EVERYTHING down. I&#8217;m data-hoarder. And so I need a good note-taking app. One that lets me write quickly, sync to the cloud, organise and search my notes. I want:</p>



<ul><li>Either cross-platform, or good ability to export should I need to. MacOS and iOS apps with cloud sync are a must.</li><li>Tagging &#8211; I prefer this to simple folders.</li><li>Search &#8211; fast with relevant results</li><li>Markdown editing &#8211; this is my fastest way to write, I want to stay on my keyboard and am willing to learn shortcuts or formatting tags to make this work.</li></ul>



<p>Importantly, I do NOT care about:</p>



<ul><li>Publishing or sharing notes. I&#8217;ll use other tools for this.</li><li>Fancy user interfaces and text formatting tools</li><li>Import from other tools or integration with other services</li></ul>



<p>For a long time I dabbled with Evernote and SimpleNote.</p>



<p>Evernote was always WAY to complicated and expensive. I couldn&#8217;t fathom the user interface which got in the way, and folders, tagging and search were somehow confusing. It should have been the bomb and I know some people put their whole lives in it, but it just didn&#8217;t work for me.</p>



<p>SimpleNote was great &#8211; it did tagging and search brilliantly, let me JUST WRITE NOTES, but its text formatting fell short. I don&#8217;t want too much, but SimpleNote had too little. I could write Markdown in it, but it didn&#8217;t help me to do so.</p>



<p>Then, about three years ago, <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a> launched. I think I got on board with the Beta, but then was more than happy to pay for a pro subscription. It&#8217;s AMAZING!!!!</p>



<ul><li>Native Markdown editing</li><li>Sync across Apple devices</li><li>Fast, decent search</li><li>Clever tagging and tag indexing</li><li>Brilliant apps</li><li>A clever formatting toolbar that helps you write Markdown</li><li>A whole host of other neat little touches</li></ul>



<p>The only real downside is that it only really works on Apple&#8217;s platform. There&#8217;s ongoing talk of a web-based version, which would be cool if it happened. I would miss it if I ever ditched my Mac and iPhone though.</p>



<p>A super tool. Not for everyone. But perfect for me.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Time Machine</h2>



<p>A while ago I wrote a post that did a critique of a fairly well-known &#8220;Uncle&#8221; Bob Martin post. It took me ages to write and publish it, partly because&#8230;well&#8230;who am I to critique someone as legendary as Uncle Bob? But I felt my background working in safety-critical software engineering game me an alternative view. And I was pretty pleased with how it turned out.</p>



<p>What do you think?</p>
