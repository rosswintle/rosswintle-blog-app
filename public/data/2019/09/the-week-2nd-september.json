At the start of the long summer holiday I was thinking how this was a LONG time and would really drag, but gosh it&#8217;s flown by. But we&#8217;re about to return to the regular routine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been doing hosting stuff, development stuff, and other stuff. Which is pretty much my life. Side projects are taking a bit of a back seat while I focus on some things that need to be done for students going back to school or university. Things with proper hard deadlines!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve always said I would HATE to be a construction company building schools because the deadlines are so fixed. I&#8217;ve built things like advent calendars and new-year projects. But I tend to avoid projects with super-hard deadlines UNLESS the client seems to show a real understanding of the process involved and possible compromises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Made some big additions to a clever <strong>WordPress<\/strong> thing I&#8217;m making for a client. It&#8217;s a simple-but-effective tool using some simple <strong>JavaScript<\/strong>, <strong>AJAX<\/strong> and <strong>custom tables<\/strong> to link things together. Oh, and there&#8217;s a <strong>custom CSV import<\/strong> too. There was a dilemma about using custom tables or custom post types, but I had to deliver quickly and relatively cheaply so I just had to make a decision and go with it. I think I got it right.<\/li><li>Progressed a <strong>WordPress micro-site build<\/strong> I&#8217;m doing for a big charity, including building my first <strong>ACF-powered Gutenberg block<\/strong>!<\/li><li>Did a bunch of changes to a site I&#8217;m looking after for a smaller charity. This is an interesting one because the theme is quite fixed and they are wanting to make frequent changes to it. The current layout tools aren&#8217;t working, so I&#8217;m hoping to help them break free of the current constraints at some point and make it a bit more flexible.<\/li><li>A new <a href=\"https:\/\/petition.parliament.uk\/petitions\/269157\"><strong>government petition<\/strong><\/a> went crazy for a while so I became temporary government petitions expert for a short time, because I run <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/269157\"><strong>a service that tracks petition growth<\/strong><\/a>. This one hasn&#8217;t quite blown up like the <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/check-petition\/241584\">article 50 petition<\/a> did.<\/li><li>I recorded an informal &#8220;fireside chat&#8221; with <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/keithdevon\/\">Keith Devon<\/a> that may or may not become an edition of his EXCELLENT <a href=\"https:\/\/pricingwp.highrise.digital\/\">Pricing WordPress<\/a> podcast. Watch that space (not this one).<\/li><li>The week ended with me <strong>supporting a small community group<\/strong> doing a 10 mile walk\/run. <strong>I was bike marshall<\/strong>, and yes, it was just an excuse to clock up some decent bike miles (and vertical metres too!). But I was handing out Jelly Babies and encouragement and keeping track of everyone as well. Great fun!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve written a few blog posts since February<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>In light of the new petition I updated my <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/03\/all-the-brexit-revoke-article-50-government-petition-resources\/\">All the Brexit\/Revoke Article 50 government petition resources<\/a> &#8211; A list of resources on Government petitions I collected while being temporary Government Petitions Data Guru<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/08\/lifehack-family-brain\/\">Lifehack: Family Brain<\/a> &#8211; Stupid lifehack that basically equates to &#8220;writing things down&#8221;, but it was popular, so I wrote it up.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This week I learned<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>The Google Maps app has a &#8220;Shake to send feedback&#8221; option<\/strong> that&#8217;s REALLY ANNOYING when your phone is strapped to your bike for navigation. ?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_9852-577x1024.png\" alt=\"Screen shot of Google Maps options highlighting Shake to send feedback option\" class=\"wp-image-8584\" width=\"289\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_9852-577x1024.png 577w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_9852-169x300.png 169w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_9852.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Laravel&#8217;s <\/strong><code><strong>dump()<\/strong><\/code><strong> and <\/strong><code><strong>dd()<\/strong><\/code><strong> (die-and-dump) functions have built-in search function!<\/strong> Actually, I&#8217;d known about <code>dd()<\/code> but wasn&#8217;t aware you could just <code>dump()<\/code> &#8211; something I&#8217;d always wanted but had never found (even though it&#8217;s in <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.8\/helpers#method-dump\">the docs<\/a> &#8211; duh!).

And we sometimes visit beaches and need to carry all the 3- and 7-year old beach paraphernalia with us.  And we now have an Aldi supermarket <em>literally<\/em> at the end of our road now. So <strong>I&#8217;ve been thinking for a while about buying a big camping trolley<\/strong>, as we could use it for camping and days out, but also for doing big shopping trips without driving the car to literally-the-end-of-our-street.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a bit of research I found what appeared to be a good balance of value, functionality, capacity, and foldability in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Kampa-Trucker-Trolley\/dp\/B00IF61YHO\">K<strong>ampa Trucker<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a heavy thing of its own, but this is because it&#8217;s a beast of a thing that will take 100kg of stuff. It&#8217;s great. We didn&#8217;t actually take it on our recent camping holiday as it wouldn&#8217;t fit in the car (not sure how to solve that one). But the kids love it for the shopping trips and I do too! <strong>Highly recommended if&#8230;err&#8230;you have a supermarket at the end of your street.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_9723-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"My two kids sat in the Kampa Trucker Trolley\" class=\"wp-image-8586\" width=\"576\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_9723-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/IMG_9723-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Time Machine<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/beatthestreet.me\/\"><strong>Beat the Street<\/strong><\/a><strong> is returning to Swindon<\/strong>.
