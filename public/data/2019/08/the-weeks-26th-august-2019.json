Partly this is because I wanted to automate the &#8220;Pins&#8221; part of making weeknotes, because it was a right bind to do manually, but also I just dropped the ball.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I love my weeknotes, they&#8217;re useful for me if no one else, and I&#8217;m keen to get going with them again. AND I have hope for a couple of new sections:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>&#8220;<strong>This Week I Learned<\/strong>&#8220;: Some hopefully-hot tip that I picked up this week<\/li><li>&#8220;<strong>Toolbox<\/strong>&#8220;: Highlighting a tool (software or otherwise) that I use in my work or life that may be of interest <\/li><li>&#8220;<strong>The Time Machine<\/strong>&#8220;: Where I&#8217;ll try to resurface old-but-popular content<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I just got back from a week&#8217;s camping in the New Forest with my family, and it&#8217;s all systems go for the last week of the school holidays!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I had two GREAT days of work in there and exciting things are happening &#8211; I even submitted a talk to WordCamp London and will await a response to that nervously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a while, so here&#8217;s some of what I&#8217;ve been working on in the last few months<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I re-launched this site with a quirky new design and some developer-related easter eggs on the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/\">homepage<\/a>! Yay!<\/li><li>I built <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/sync-pinboard\/\">a WordPress plugin to sync Pinboard bookmarks<\/a> to a WordPress custom post type, and built my first Gutenberg block, all using vanilla JS and CSS with no build tools!<\/li><li>Started re-making <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/\">my business website<\/a> in <a href=\"https:\/\/statamic.com\/\">Statamic<\/a>! Also with vanilla JS and CSS and no build tools.<\/li><li>Finishing off (but not yet putting live) a mysterious Laravel project involving some in-depth API work. I also love that this project has a proper test suite &#8211; it&#8217;s not 100% coverage or TDD or anything, but enough to give me some confidence.<\/li><li>Continued working on a secret project that I&#8217;m VERY excited about that&#8217;s for probably my best client ever.<\/li><li>Finishing off and go-live of the new website for my local history project, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rodbournehistory.org\/\">Rodbourne Community History Group<\/a>. It looks like a simple Divi-builder site but there&#8217;s been a LOT of complicated work migrating content in, using custom post types and custom meta fields, ensuring meta-data is as complete as I can get it (extracting content from old HTML into structured data) and stuff like that.<\/li><li>Began and ended a small website build for <a href=\"https:\/\/separatedchild.org\/\">The Separated Child Foundation<\/a>. This was also a Divi-builder project but the key here has been squeezing as much value as possible out for the client &#8211; who were brilliant! I&#8217;ve been trying to work on bigger projects recently, buy I loved this cause and wanted to use my skills to support the foundation, who are really pleased with the result. <\/li><li>Started work on a re-build of a micro-site for a large charity that I&#8217;ve worked with for years. This is quick-turnaround after a long design phase. Should be done pretty soon.<\/li><li>Helped out a new client with a quick support request which turned out to be a permissions issue. But the kind of thing they needed an expert to diagnose and fix as no-one else could.<\/li><li>Cleaning up a (fortunately simple) <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.nintechnet.com\/unauthenticated-option-changes-in-wordpress-simple-301-redirects-addon-bulk-uploader-plugin\/\">malware attack<\/a> for a client who had a plugin installed with a huge (but limited severity) security hole.<\/li><li>Helping a new client review some at-scale hosting proposals they had for their new site &#8211; this required some quite in-depth hosting and security knowledge and the client were really happy with the result.<\/li><li>LOADS of small support requests and changes for existing clients.<\/li><li>Attended and spoke at WordCamp London (the official video of the talk isn&#8217;t ready yet, but you can see it from the LiveStream <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GcibNG6gUjE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3596\">here<\/a> &#8211; I was SO happy with it) and attended WordCamp Bristol.<\/li><li>Was temporarily a Government Petitions Data expert when the Revoke Article 50 petition went live &#8211; all because I <a href=\"https:\/\/petition-track.uk\/\">track petition data<\/a>!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Posts: things I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve written a few blog posts since February<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2019\/03\/a-new-look\/\">A new look: What?

I ditched Adobe Creative Cloud a long time ago now, but occasionally I have to work with designers that use Illustrator or InDesign or send me a PDF or something. I don&#8217;t want to pay for CC just to open these files to get assets and measurements out. And the Serif Suite has been the perfect alternative.
