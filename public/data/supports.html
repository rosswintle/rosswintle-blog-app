<p>Both personally and through my business I support a number of businesses and organisations that I like and admire. Sometimes this is through donations or sponsorship, and sometimes this is through paying for products that they make.</p>



<p>I list them here so that you can try them out and support them too, and to inspire and encourage you to use your money to say you appreciate peoples&#8217; work and the value they create, and to make the things you love sustainable.</p>

She runs occasional challenge weeks that have been hugely valuable to me.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Previous support</h2>



<p>My donations and subscriptions get reviewed from time to time. Here are some people and things that I used to support and that you may want to&#8230;</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://worknotes.co.uk/">WorkNotes</a> and the <a href="https://community.independent.work/">Independent Work</a> community &#8211; because Dave Smyth does such great work here</li><li><a href="https://www.doingitforthekids.net/">Doing It for the Kids</a> &#8211; to thank Frankie for the huge amount of work she puts into curating this community of freelancing parents</li><li><a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> &#8211; I did the Kickstarter for Manton&#8217;s IndieWeb Micro.blog project and had a paid account for a long time. It&#8217;s a great little platform and I love the concept behind it, but it never really got traction with me. Perhaps I&#8217;ll be back one day.</li><li><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a> &#8211; I supported Smashing Magazine for a long while as a member. But I&#8217;m off exploring other lands now. <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/membership/">Membership</a> is still worthwhile and recommended if you&#8217;re more design-focussed than I am. But the content isn&#8217;t for me right now</li></ul>



<p>Finally, if I&#8217;ve helped you in some way and you want to support ME then you can <a href="https://ko-fi.com/magicroundabout">buy me a coffee</a> &#8211; it will genuinely put a smile on my face! Thanks!</p>
