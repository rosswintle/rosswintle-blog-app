<p>Often people come to me with a simple &#8220;Can you tweak this thing on my website?&#8221; and when I get a login I end up fixing basic security and performance and privacy things. This totally isn&#8217;t their fault! They don&#8217;t know what they don&#8217;t know. And my job is to educate and guide them in the right direction.</p>



<p>This lead me to thinking I should do a &#8220;WordPress Website Drivers License&#8221; course that covers some of the hidden aspects of running a website and helps people understand not only what they need to do, but why they need to do it.</p>



<p>It <em>could</em> be generic, rather than WordPress specific. But focussing on WordPress would give me a chance to talk about tools and settings that are specific to that platform.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a flip side to this though: why does WordPress, out of the box, have so many basic security and performance problems that require initial lockdown? Sure, some &#8220;features&#8221; of WordPress are wide open to abuse if you can get an admin login, but we could limit the attack vectors; we could close some of the holes.</p>



<p>Surely simple brute force protection/rate limiting, two-factor auth (or password-less login), not-having-a-user-called-admin, page caching, and perhaps even testing SPF records are solved problems now? So why do I have to add these in myself to protect people that I work with?</p>



<p>And yes, I know that some of these things exist and may be merged into WordPress core in future. But until they are, it&#8217;s not just the editing experience that puts WordPress behind the likes of SquareSpace and Shopify.</p>
