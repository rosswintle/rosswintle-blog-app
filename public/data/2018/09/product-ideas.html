<p>Yesterday I looked in the spam box in my email account, and found that there were some messages in there that had an old, out-of-date password in the subject line.</p>



<p>These were quite scary-looking messages trying to blackmail me. But the presence of an actual password that I used to use made them seem very real.</p>



<p>So. Two things.</p>



<p>1) If you get a message like this, it will probably go to your spam box, but if it doesn&#8217;t, then don&#8217;t be scared. It&#8217;s fake.</p>



<p>BUT&#8230;</p>



<p>2) Did you know that there are databases on the internet of &#8220;leaked&#8221; email addresses and passwords? You can check if your email has ever been leaked <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">here</a> and, if you&#8217;re willing to risk typing your password into a box on someone else&#8217;s website, you can see if you&#8217;re password has ever been leaked <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords">here</a>. </p>



<p>The existence of my email address and an (old) password in these leaked databases explains how I got these messages.</p>



<p>So if you DO get an email like this, or see one in your spam email box, and you still use that password. Then I suggest you immediately stop using that password and change it wherever it&#8217;s used.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re response to that is &#8220;But I use it everywhere&#8221; then even more reason to log in everywhere and change it. Try to use different passwords on different websites and apps if you can.</p>



<p>Modern web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) have some brilliant built-in tools for managing passwords, generating and saving random passwords for you, remembering them so you don&#8217;t have to. So try to use those if you can.</p>



<p>Or if you want to be super-advanced try one of the password managers like <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> or <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>. I&#8217;ve made <a href="https://press-ups.com/2017/09/online-security-generating-using-passwords-password-managers/">a video</a> that shows you how that works (once it&#8217;s set up it actually makes logging in to things both EASIER and MORE SECURE!)</p>



<p>As always, ASK ME if you have any questions about this.</p>
