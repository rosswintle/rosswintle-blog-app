<p>This is coming up a lot at the moment. Building forms isn&#8217;t always simple. There are some brilliant WordPress plugins that make is seem simple.  But they need thought. There are more questions you need to ask about forms than you think.</p>

<p>Here are some of them:</p>



<ul><li>Which fields are required and which are optional?</li><li>Does your form have a privacy policy and is this clearly linked? (If you collect any personal information, the answer should be yes!)</li><li>Does your form require any kind of consent because of GDPR?</li><li>What should your form display, or where should your user be sent to once the form is submitted?</li><li>Should the user get an email when the form is submitted? If so:<br/><ul><li>What should it say?</li><li>What name and email address should it be from?</li><li>What should the title and contents of the email be?</li></ul></li><li>Should anyone else (perhaps an administrator) get an email when the form is submitted?  If so:<ul><li>What should it say?</li><li>What name and email address should it be from?</li><li>What should the title and contents of the email be?</li></ul></li><li>Should the details of the form submission be stored on the server? If so:<ul><li>How long should it be stored for?</li><li>How will old entries be deleted?</li></ul></li></ul>
