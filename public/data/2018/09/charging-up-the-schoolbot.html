<p>I&#8217;ve been gently nudging SchoolBot development along in my mornings and evenings the last week.</p>



<p>It has standard &#8220;knowledge&#8221; like term dates and school meals. But you can also add &#8220;Custom messages&#8221; so you can get SchoolBot to respond to questions about other things.</p>



<p>Custom messages have keywords (to match in questions), responses, expiry dates (so you can stop responding to a question after a certain date) and now example questions to use in a FAQ list too.Â </p>

<p>And with example questions (yes, I&#8217;ve struggled with what to call these) now in place , you can build a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list, and the WordPress plugin I&#8217;m building then has a shortcode that displays all the &#8220;custom knowledge&#8221; on a website.</p>

<p>Sweet!</p>



<p>I also added training days to the app, bot, API and WordPress plugin! So we can query and list teacher training days everywhere.</p>

<p>The more technical among you are probably thinking: &#8220;But this is really simple stuff. Just putting simple data into a database and pulling simple data out again!&#8221;. And you&#8217;re right. That&#8217;s exactly what it is. But doing it in a structured way for a given niche is where the value is here.</p>



<p>Adding structure to data means you can do interesting things with it. For example, I can automatically display today&#8217;s meal from the menus and meals lists on the website now, without anyone having to update the website!</p>



<p>That&#8217;s not to say that schools are the only places where making data more structured can help. I want to get SchoolBot in front of some users and schools and see what they make of it. If it&#8217;s useful, then maybe there are other places we can build!</p>
