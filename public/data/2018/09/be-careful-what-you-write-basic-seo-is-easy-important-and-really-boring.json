        "rendered": "\n<p><em>Aside before I begin: Some of what I\u2019ve been writing lately has been inspired by work I\u2019ve done for clients or help I\u2019ve given to people I know. I\u2019m writing up the lessons learned to try to help others (and my future self) avoid the same pitfalls. So this is observation and information, not criticism. If you think anything I write up might be about you and you don\u2019t like what I wrote, please let me know and I\u2019ll fix things. Thanks!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re making a new website for your organisation or company (or for yourself!), it\u2019s kinda trendy to use abstract language that doesn\u2019t actually reflect what you do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be a problem. Especially if you rely on search engines like Google to send people to your website from search results. And DOUBLY especially if your business name itself doesn\u2019t mention what or where you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a problem because search engines are trying to identify who you are and what you\u2019re about, and if you\u2019re too abstract in your language and content then you won\u2019t appear in the right searches.<br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m actually guilty of having a vague company name myself. My company is \u201cOikos Digital Ltd\u201d which, while <a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/about\/\">a clever name<\/a>, doesn\u2019t describe in English any of what I do. So I\u2019m very careful to have my website set up with a big title saying \u201cweb development and technology consultancy for charities, communities and small businesses\u201d and I try to talk about those things a lot on my website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As another, made-up example, let\u2019s say you ran a bakery in Bath. You\u2019ve decided to call it \u201cRisen\u201d. Your marketing agency has suggested you use the tagline \u201cFresh \/ Tasty \/ Treats\u201d. Your website is at risen.co.uk (don\u2019t go there &#8211; I made it up &#8211; I can\u2019t be held responsible for what you actually see), and it has lots of shallow-depth-of-field photos of beautiful cakes topped with sparkly buttercream, and rustic loaves dusted in stoneground flour, and it talks a lot about craft sponges and cup-cakes, artisan icing techniques, and hand-crafted sourdough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google may well put you in search results for these things you mention. But you\u2019ve neglected to mention that you\u2019re a bakery&#8230;in Bath. So if someone does a search for \u201cBakeries in Bath\u201d you may not be found.<br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, while it may seem incredibly boring to do so, it\u2019s actually quite helpful to talk about what you do, and, if you have a physical shop or office or venue, to talk about where you are too. It helps people find you, and when people arrive on your website, they know exactly what they are looking at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This process of making your website\u2019s content help you appear in search results is called \u201cSearch Engine Optimisaiton\u201d, or \u201cSEO\u201d for short. It&#8217;s a big, scary subject, and lots of people will try to sell you lots of expensive services and tools to help you do it well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the basics are simple: Make it clear who you are, what you do, where you are. Talk about those things. Put those things in headings and titles to show they are important. If you know how, include them in meta tags for descriptions and titles too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, my imaginary bakery (this is making me hungry!) may want to be found in searches for \u201cfresh treats\u201d or \u201cartisan sourdough\u201d. Maybe that\u2019s a strategy you\u2019ve chosen. But if you\u2019re an average local business wanting to attract local people then you probably want something less obscure.<br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A trendy website is no good if no one is going to find it. Trendy, abstract, modernist marketing is great, and you can still use some of that, but be careful what you write: you may need to be boring to be found!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br\/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br\/><\/p>\n",
