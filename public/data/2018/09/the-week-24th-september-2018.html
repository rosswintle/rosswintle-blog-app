<p><em>A summary of my week in projects, posts, and pins. This is probably as much for my benefit as anything, but let me know if you find it interesting or helpful. Use the comments – I’m happy to tweak the format to make it more useful for others.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to</h2>



<ul><li>This week involved a lot of meetings kicking off small bits of work. I&#8217;ve been to Bristol, Avebury and on Skype to Paris! So not so much technical work being done, mostly working on smaller tasks and staying on top of minor support requests.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Posts: things I made</h2>



<ul><li><a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2018/09/product-ideas/">Helpful IT notice: emails with your password in!</a> &#8211; Only one post this week and that was about security and spam emails and passwords.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pins: things I read and remembered</h2>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/write-for-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Writing A Smashing Article — Smashing Magazine</a> &#8211; something I kinda hope I might do in future</li><li><a href="http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/local-json/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACF | Local JSON</a> &#8211; this was open in a browser tab. I knew you could export and import ACF field definitions as JSON, but I didn&#8217;t realise you could load the JSON kind-of automatically. It&#8217;s a shame you need to do the manual sync-button thing. But this is pretty neat and I&#8217;ll be using it in the future.</li><li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/image-watermark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Image Watermark | WordPress.org</a> &#8211; An actually really quite good watermarking plugin for WordPress that I&#8217;m using on a project right now.</li><li>(Pardon my language) <a href="https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nvbn/thefuck: Magnificent app which corrects your previous console command.</a> &#8211; seems smart, probably won&#8217;t use it, but maybe you will!</li><li><a href="https://wpmerge.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WPMerge.io – WP DB Merging, made easy.</a> &#8211; The InfiniteWP team try to take on WordPress&#8217;s most difficult challenge: merging database changes. Many have <a href="https://versionpress.net/">tried</a> and many have <a href="https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/doc/mergebot/">failed</a>. I wonder how they will do.</li><li><a href="https://get.gaug.es/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Real Time Web Analytics &amp; Marketing Attribution Tools &#8211; Gauges</a> &#8211; An analytics platform that I&#8217;d not heard of before.</li><li><a href="http://uxdesignmastery.com/freebie-ux-sketchbook-15-free-printable-browser-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Freebie: UX Sketchbook, 15 Free printable browser screens | UX Design Mastery</a> &#8211; Random freebie &#8211; what it says on the tin.</li><li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/helping-a-beginner-understand-getting-a-website-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Helping a Beginner Understand Getting a Website Live | CSS-Tricks</a> &#8211; long article, well written &#8211; an overview for beginners of lots of hosting and domain related stuff</li><li><a href="https://www.sublimemerge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sublime Merge &#8211; Git, done Sublime</a> &#8211; The people behind SublimeText released a GUI for Git!

<p>Phew &#8211; I bookmark a lot of things.</p>



<p>Have a great week!</p>
