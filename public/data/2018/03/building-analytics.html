(Answer: I&#8217;m building analytics!)</h1></header><main><p><em>I&#8217;m going on the journey of building a simple, private, self-hosted, cookie-free analytics tool that I&#8217;m calling Kownter. I may fail. But it will be fun and interesting! Come along!</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about GDPR lately and considering how I will become compliant with it as I run my business and projects, so I&#8217;m looking to slim down the data that I capture about people.  The topics of both analytics and server logs has come up several times. It&#8217;s not entirely clear to me that either fall into the category of personal data, but I&#8217;ve been considering my use of them anyway.</p>
<p>I use Google Analytics on most sites/projects that I create, but I&#8217;m not that sophisticated in my use of it. I&#8217;m mostly interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>how many visitors I&#8217;m getting and when</li>
<li>which pages are popular</li>
<li>where people are coming from</li>
</ul>
<p>and it occurred to me that I can collect this data without using cookies and without collecting anything that would personally identify someone.</p>
<p>I would also be happier if my analytics were stored on a server in the EU rather than in the US &#8211; I can&#8217;t find any guarantee that my Google Analytics data is and remains EU-based.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m aware that there are self-hosted, open-source analytics solutions like <a href="https://matomo.org/">Matomo</a> (previously Piwik) and <a href="http://www.openwebanalytics.com/">Open Web Analytics</a>. But they always seem very large and clunky. I&#8217;ve tried them and never got to grips with them.</p>
<p>So I wondered: how hard would it be to build my own, simple, high-privacy, cookie-free analytics tool?</p>
<p>Now, I know that my requirements for analytics aren&#8217;t common. Many people need conversion rates, events, goals, unique visitors, returning visitors, and so on. So a tool with these limitations wouldn&#8217;t be for everyone.</p>
<p>But, as with all side projects, I feel like I could learn a lot by making something like this. It would be a step above my usual side projects, and a chance to learn more about:</p>
<ul>
<li>handling large volumes of data and scaling for that</li>
<li>how regular web analytics works (and what has to be considered when making something like this)</li>
<li>Laravel and Vue or React</li>
</ul>
<p>So&#8230;I did start a little while ago, and have made some progress. There&#8217;s a lot of decisions to make and I&#8217;m documenting the process at <a href="https://blog.kownter.com/">https://blog.kownter.com/</a> and development is happening on <a href="https://github.com/rosswintle/kownter">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, &#8220;Kownter&#8221; is the silly name I&#8217;ve given this project. It&#8217;s pronounced &#8220;Counter&#8221; but includes the concept of OWNing your analytics. It had a domain available so I just went with it when I thought of it. I&#8217;m not the world&#8217;s best marketer, so go easy on my branding decisions!</p>
<p>Do follow along if you&#8217;re interested. Comments are welcome on the blog if you&#8217;re more experienced than I with this stuff, or if you have ideas that might help out. Or open issues on GitHub if that&#8217;s you&#8217;re thing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fully anticipating that this may be a journey that ends with me saying &#8220;This is too hard &#8211; I&#8217;m gonna leave this to people who&#8217;ve thought through all these things already&#8221; and revert to an existing tool. But the journey seems like an interesting one to go on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m developing this VERY slowly and it&#8217;s very early stages, but I thought the process might be useful for others to follow. It may end in nothing, but maybe the end product will actually be of use to people.</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t comment below to tell me that I&#8217;m crazy! ?</p>
