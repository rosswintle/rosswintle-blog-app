This will mean that cancer patients don&#8217;t have to travel 30 miles to Oxford for daily cancer treatment.</p>

<p>This man is the reason I&#8217;m writing code today. So if you&#8217;ve ever had some advice, good-value work, IT support, any mentoring or coaching or benefitted from a talk I&#8217;ve given, blog post I&#8217;ve written, or screencast I&#8217;ve made&#8230;basically, if you&#8217;ve ever thought you owe me a beer, you probably actually owe it to him.</p>
<p>So go <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/raymond-burcham">make a donation</a> &#8211; he&#8217;s nearly at <code>currency_format(0x400, '£')</code>, let&#8217;s see if we can get him to at least <code>currency_format(0x800, '£')</code></p>
<p>Thanks in advance, and thanks Ray for being an awesome, inspiring, fun, helpful teacher and friend.</p>
