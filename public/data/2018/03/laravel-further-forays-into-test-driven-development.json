        "rendered": "<p><em>I&#8217;m using Test Driven Development (TDD) for the first (and second) time on a couple of side projects. I <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/01\/testing-out-tdd-initial-thoughts\/\">wrote up some of my really early thoughts<\/a> on the process before, but here are some further reflections on the process and issues I&#8217;ve come across.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Assurance is good!<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s great having my test suite able to tell me that I&#8217;ve not broken any core functionality. The flexibility that this gives me to change the structure of my code (&#8220;re-factoring&#8221; they call it) without changing what it does is great, and the confidence I have when adding new functionality is wonderful.<\/p>\n<h2>A mindset change is (possibly) coming<\/h2>\n<p>I mentioned in <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/01\/testing-out-tdd-initial-thoughts\/\">the previous TDD article<\/a> that I was thinking ahead a little as I coded and was wondering where to store those thoughts about what this thing will need to do in the future. And this is still a problem.<\/p>\n<p>But I can see a slight change of mindset happening. I can see how I might be starting to think more in terms of features and functions as I write, and less in terms of data.<\/p>\n<p>To explain, let&#8217;s take and example. I&#8217;m (stupidly) <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/about-kownter\/\">attempting to build my own analytics<\/a>. In its very basic form this has &#8220;sites&#8221; and &#8220;views&#8221; and each view belongs to a site. But in future I can see that I would want multiple users and the ability to assign sites to users.<\/p>\n<p>In the past I&#8217;d have got all hung up on making this ALL work together &#8211; define all my data structures, create my routes, and then build out all my models and controllers to make it all hang together. But with TDD I&#8217;ve taken <a href=\"https:\/\/course.testdrivenlaravel.com\/\">Adam<\/a>&#8216;s approach from his course, and got right down to the core of what this application does &#8211; sites and views &#8211; and written my tests for those things and built them up in code.<\/p>\n<p>So, right now, I have a working system with none of the complexity of users and site ownership.<\/p>\n<p>I still have the issue of not knowing where to store my thoughts about future functionality. So for example, I might have a <code class=\"code-inline\">sites_can_be_displayed<\/code> test, but in future I will need:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"code-inline\">a_user_can_see_their_own_sites<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code class=\"code-inline\">a_user_can_not_see_other_peoples_sites<\/code><\/li>\n<li>and <code class=\"code-inline\">a_guest_can_not_see_any_sites<\/code><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So what then happens to my <code class=\"code-inline\">sites_can_be_displayed<\/code> test? Will that still work? Do I still need it? Do I need to review all my existing tests when I make a change? Or will this test break somehow when I add the new functionality in, prompting me to update or remove the it? Tricky.<\/p>\n<p>I can also see that there might be overhead in building a feature at a time. If I anticipate features and build multiple features at the same time, I can get the benefit of knowing how it ALL hangs together from the start. Doing things a feature at a time might introduce inefficiencies that need to be re-factored away. Of course, having the tests helps with re-factoring, but it&#8217;s still overhead.<\/p>\n<h2>Redirects as responses<\/h2>\n<p>I realised quite early on that testing for HTTP responses in HTTP tests was good. You could test for exceptions as Jeffrey Way does on <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/lets-build-a-forum-with-laravel\/\">his Laracasts TDD course<\/a>, but I&#8217;m not quite there yet. But checking for an appropriate response has been helpful.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;you do need to understand what responses you should be getting. When building out user registration responses, for example, I forgot that Laravel redirects to somewhere immediately after registration. So my test call to:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$response = $this-&gt;post('\/register', &#x5B;\r\n'name' =&gt; 'Testy McTesterson',\r\n'email' =&gt; 'test@example.com',\r\n'password' =&gt; 'blahblah',\r\n'password_confirmation' =&gt; 'blahblah',\r\n] );\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>didn&#8217;t get a 200 response &#8211; my:<\/p>\n<p><code>$response-&gt;assertStatus(200);<\/code><\/p>\n<p>failed, it got a redirect instead! So I needed to&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><code>$response-&gt;assertRedirect('some_path');<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Note that I also got caught out by the default password length check and forgot that this also redirects me back to the register page rather than giving me an HTTP error status.<\/p>\n<p>(Aside: yes, I will use factories at some point)<\/p>\n<p>And all this registration form testing leads to&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>How much should I test?<\/h2>\n<p>One question I had as I went along is: How much should I test at this point?<\/p>\n<p>Should I be testing the default password length check? The registration process at all? Can I just assume that this works?<\/p>\n<p>I think I decided that I should test critical and\/or customised parts &#8211; so I test user registration as that could contain custom fields or parameters that could change, but not login as that&#8217;s pretty much out of the box and doesn&#8217;t really modify any data in the system.<\/p>\n<h2>from() on form requests<\/h2>\n<p>The failed registration also raised another issue. The redirect it created uses the <code class=\"code-inline\">back()<\/code> method (I assume) to send you back to the page you filled the form in on. This, in turn, makes use of the referer header. Which I wasn&#8217;t sending.<\/p>\n<p>So even when I&#8217;d written my <code class=\"code-inline\">assertRedirect()<\/code>, it was failing, because my <code class=\"code-inline\">$this-&gt;post()<\/code> request wasn&#8217;t sending a referer. So this relatively simple form-submitting test tripped me up in quite a few ways.<\/p>\n<p>The fix for this was to use the <code class=\"code-inline\">from()<\/code> method to set the referrer &#8211; so the request in this test is actually:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$response = $this-&gt;from('\/register')-&gt;post('\/register', &#x5B;\r\n  'name' =&gt; 'Testy McTesterson',\r\n  'email' =&gt; 'test@example.com',\r\n  'password' =&gt; 'blah',\r\n  'password_confirmation' =&gt; 'blahblah',\r\n] );\r\n<\/pre>\n<h2>CSRFs and middleware<\/h2>\n<p>As I was writing the form submission test I thought: &#8220;But there&#8217;s a CSRF check. How do I pass that in my request?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And, well, it turns out CSRF checks are disabled in the test suite which makes things a whole load easier.<\/p>\n<p>But should I be bothered by this? Shouldn&#8217;t I be testing that <code class=\"code-inline\">submitting_a_form_without_a_valid_csrf_token_fails<\/code>? How do I know if I&#8217;m supposed to test this or not? Where do I go to find this out?<\/p>\n<h2>Laravel release notes<\/h2>\n<p>In attempting to find out if I should test CSRF checks I found (probably via some forum threads, I don&#8217;t remember) the <code class=\"code-inline\">withoutMiddleware<\/code> trait that you could use. This, it turns out, <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.2\/testing#disabling-middleware\">is optional up to Laravel 5.2<\/a>, but it&#8217;s not &#8211; according to the docs &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.6\/testing\">in the latest version of Laravel<\/a> (5.6 at writing).<\/p>\n<p>My instinct, when I found a thing that was documented in 5.2, but not 5.6 was to look for <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.6\/releases\">release notes<\/a> for Laravel saying what has changed. But the <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.6\/releases\">latest release notes page<\/a> doesn&#8217;t show any historical release notes.<\/p>\n<p>This turns out to be stupidity on my part and you just need to use the version selector to view past release notes (e.g. <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel.com\/docs\/5.3\/releases\">these<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>And in any case, the release notes turned out not to mention the <code class=\"code-inline\">withoutMiddleware<\/code> change.<\/p>\n<p>I guess the release notes can&#8217;t detail every tiny little thing that&#8217;s different, and not finding the release notes was kinda my own fault, but it was just another tiny little thing that piled on top of all the other things I was confused about and got in the way of my learning. But I was expecting the documentation to answer my question and it didn&#8217;t seem to exist and when I did find it it didn&#8217;t answer my question. Grrrr.<\/p>\n<h2>On getting to MVP slower and the value of TDD<\/h2>\n<p>On the face of it, getting to MVP is harder and slower. You write a test for a feature, and then build the feature. But in doing that you realise you need to spawn other tests for the same feature. E.g. <code class=\"code-inline\">user_can_create_thing<\/code> might lead to <code class=\"code-inline\">a_new_thing_has_a_default_state_of_x<\/code> or <code class=\"code-inline\">a_guest_can_not_create_a_thing<\/code> or <code class=\"code-inline\">a_thing_must_have_a_unique_name<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Writing all these tests for the simple feature that you just built helps you refine the feature, sure. But it slows you down.<\/p>\n<p>Or does it? Is this just because I\u2019m learning? Will it speed me up later? Is this not really a good process for small side projects?<\/p>\n<p>I think what I&#8217;ve come to realise is that there is an initial outlay\/investment in getting your test suite off the ground. Those initial tests for simple stuff like creating a user are things that you will do on lots of projects. You&#8217;ll write factories for data early on and use them again and again in your future tests.<\/p>\n<p>So for a relatively small side-project this overhead represents a significant part of the work and probably doesn&#8217;t get you much payback as you won&#8217;t run the tests as much.<\/p>\n<p>But for a large project, the testing overhead is smaller and the value of the tests is much greater. So it will feel more worthwhile.<\/p>\n<h2>Where I&#8217;m at<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m enjoying using TDD, but, as I just mentioned, for the small things I&#8217;m building with it, it feels like a lot of effort.<\/p>\n<p>BUT&#8230;this is serving me well for the future. I HAVE to build these small projects using it because without them I won&#8217;t have confidence that I can use TDD on the larger projects that may come along.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not a 100% convert to either the <a href=\"https:\/\/course.testdrivenlaravel.com\/\">Wathan Way<\/a> or the <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/lets-build-a-forum-with-laravel\/\">Jeffrey Way<\/a> (the Way Way?) of TDD and I think they&#8217;d both say I should be pragmatic and thoughtful in my approach anyway rather than religiously following either of their approaches.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m being pulled up short a bit on unit testing too &#8211; this is something I need to delve into more. Currently most of my tests are feature\/HTTP tests. And unit tests feel a bit like:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n$test = x;\r\n$this-&gt;assertEquals(x, $test);\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>I mean, not quite like that &#8211; it&#8217;s an extreme example. But you get the idea. And I&#8217;m sure I feel this way because I&#8217;m testing the wrong things. So still plenty to learn.<\/p>\n<p>Leave your TTD tips and tricks and wisdom for me and others below. Thanks!<\/p>\n",
