But it will be fun and interesting! Come along!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about GDPR lately and considering how I will become compliant with it as I run my business and projects, so I&#8217;m looking to slim down the data that I capture about people.\u00a0 The topics of both analytics and server logs has come up several times. It&#8217;s not entirely clear to me that either fall into the category of personal data, but I&#8217;ve been considering my use of them anyway.<\/p>\n<p>I use Google Analytics on most sites\/projects that I create, but I&#8217;m not that sophisticated in my use of it. I&#8217;m mostly interested in:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>how many visitors I&#8217;m getting and when<\/li>\n<li>which pages are popular<\/li>\n<li>where people are coming from<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>and it occurred to me that I can collect this data without using cookies and without collecting anything that would personally identify someone.<\/p>\n<p>I would also be happier if my analytics were stored on a server in the EU rather than in the US &#8211; I can&#8217;t find any guarantee that my Google Analytics data is and remains EU-based.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m aware that there are self-hosted, open-source analytics solutions like <a href=\"https:\/\/matomo.org\/\">Matomo<\/a> (previously Piwik) and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openwebanalytics.com\/\">Open Web Analytics<\/a>. But they always seem very large and clunky. I&#8217;ve tried them and never got to grips with them.<\/p>\n<p>So I wondered: how hard would it be to build my own, simple, high-privacy, cookie-free analytics tool?<\/p>\n<p>Now, I know that my requirements for analytics aren&#8217;t common. Many people need conversion rates, events, goals, unique visitors, returning visitors, and so on. So a tool with these limitations wouldn&#8217;t be for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>But, as with all side projects, I feel like I could learn a lot by making something like this. It would be a step above my usual side projects, and a chance to learn more about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>handling large volumes of data and scaling for that<\/li>\n<li>how regular web analytics works (and what has to be considered when making something like this)<\/li>\n<li>Laravel and Vue or React<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So&#8230;I did start a little while ago, and have made some progress. There&#8217;s a lot of decisions to make and I&#8217;m documenting the process at <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/\">https:\/\/blog.kownter.com\/<\/a>\u00a0and development is happening on <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rosswintle\/kownter\">GitHub<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, &#8220;Kownter&#8221; is the silly name I&#8217;ve given this project. It&#8217;s pronounced &#8220;Counter&#8221; but includes the concept of OWNing your analytics. It had a domain available so I just went with it when I thought of it. I&#8217;m not the world&#8217;s best marketer, so go easy on my branding decisions!<\/p>\n<p>Do follow along if you&#8217;re interested. Comments are welcome on the blog if you&#8217;re more experienced than I with this stuff, or if you have ideas that might help out. Or open issues on GitHub if that&#8217;s you&#8217;re thing.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fully anticipating that this may be a journey that ends with me saying &#8220;This is too hard &#8211; I&#8217;m gonna leave this to people who&#8217;ve thought through all these things already&#8221; and revert to an existing tool. But the journey seems like an interesting one to go on.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m developing this VERY slowly and it&#8217;s very early stages, but I thought the process might be useful for others to follow. It may end in nothing, but maybe the end product will actually be of use to people.<\/p>\n<p>Please don&#8217;t comment below to tell me that I&#8217;m crazy! ?<\/p>\n",
