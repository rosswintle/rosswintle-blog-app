<p>I&#8217;ve been using and developing with WordPress for about 10 years now. I know it quite deeply, and I have opinions. And some big changes are coming up.</p>
<p>Today, I want to talk about &#8220;Gutenberg&#8221;, which is the whizzy new &#8220;block-based&#8221; editor that is coming up in WordPress in the new year.Â  I won&#8217;t describe it in detail because <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/">that&#8217;s been done elsewhere</a>, but if you&#8217;ve used SquareSpace or Medium, it&#8217;s quite a bit more like that. If you want to actually try it out then someone cleverly made a way for you to <a href="https://frontenberg.tomjn.com/">do just that</a>.</p>

<p>Some of you will be expecting me to dive into a deep discussion about my thoughts as a developer/coder and meta-boxes and stuff like that. But that&#8217;s for another post.</p>
<p>Today, I was a USER of Gutenberg. I was trying to write <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2018/01/2017-in-review-ask-me-anything/">a year-in-review post</a> that involved a lot of copying and pasting from Facebook, and I was doing it on an iPad. Now, I know that that&#8217;s not necessarily a common use case, but I know that this wouldn&#8217;t have been too hard in the normal WordPress editor.</p>
<p>But wow was it hard in Gutenberg.</p>
<p>Then, after giving up on the iPad, I switched to my laptop to finish it off. What I found there was that, for a post that is mostly just text, images and a couple of embedded videos, Gutenberg actually <em>gets in the way</em> of the writing experience.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t expect this.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying hard to be a proponent of Gutenberg. It seems like it&#8217;s a good evolution of the WordPress software for the use case of blogging and straight-up content creation. I want to think it&#8217;s a good idea.</p>
<p>I also know that the team who are making it have been working REALLY hard on it, engaging fantastically well with those who are testing and critiquing it, and that it&#8217;s still a work in progress and could still end up being the amazing writing tool that I want it to be.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also aware that I&#8217;m an a-typical user. I like to use my keyboard to write, without touching the mouse, and love the markdown-like shortcuts for headings and code and so on that were recently added to the WordPress editor. AND I know that there are some keyboard shortcuts, but I&#8217;ve not learned them yet (Where is the reference? Maybe not there yet.)</p>
<p>But there was just something about all the extra user-interface popping up everywhere. The way that hovering over any paragraph made all these controls appear (a block for each paragraph creates too many pop-up controls). The way that the new-block interface and the block options are present so much of the time.</p>
<p>I just wanted to write &#8211; and, I&#8217;m sad and sorry to say, Gutenberg got in the way, confused me, and I just wanted to turn it off.</p>
<p>If a power user &#8211; someone who uses WordPress a lot and has high hopes for Gutenberg and wants to like it &#8211; finds it intrusive and complicated, then what will that mean for the every-day blogger?</p>
<p>Gutenberg still has work to do to win me over. I hope the team building it can make it right.</p>
