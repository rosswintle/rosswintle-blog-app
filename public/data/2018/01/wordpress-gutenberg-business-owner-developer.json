        "rendered": "<p><em>For more on this topic, see &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/01\/wordpress-gutenberg-user\/\">Where I&#8217;m at with WordPress: Gutenberg &#8211; as a user<\/a>&#8220;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The awesome development team at Delicious Brains (yes, that&#8217;s really their company name) posted <a href=\"https:\/\/deliciousbrains.com\/wordpress-gutenberg\/\">this excellent write up of the Gutenberg project<\/a>\u00a0today, and it prompted me to write more.<\/p>\n<p>This is actually text taken from a discussion I had with a team that I work with. That discussion was a chance to put my long-mulled-over thoughts into text, and I&#8217;m formalising and publicising that here.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know what Gutenberg is then go and read <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2018\/01\/wordpress-gutenberg-user\/\">my previous post about it<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Context: My business<\/h3>\n<p>The context of this is that I&#8217;m a freelance software developer whose bread and butter is MOSTLY writing code for WordPress: custom themes and plugins for clients.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve been doing this for 6 years now, and some clients have come and gone, but I&#8217;ve still got a lot of highly-customised WordPress projects that I maintain and develop, and sites that I host for people.<\/p>\n<p>And WordPress&#8217;s current plan with Gutenberg is to have it on, by default, for everyone that updates to version 5.0 of WordPress when it&#8217;s released sometime in the first half of this year.<\/p>\n<h3>My response<\/h3>\n<p>I can see that this will totally confuse most of the people that I look after sites for.\u00a0 Bear in mind that quite a lot of my clients are small charities or very small businesses &#8211; some of them very rarely log in to their sites. And when they do log in and see something so very different it <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">will<\/span> confuse them and I&#8217;ll have to spend time helping them.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also concerned about custom fields\/meta boxes not working (though I&#8217;m trusting that this will all work without change), and the suitability of the Gutenberg interface for editing certain types of content.<\/p>\n<p>So my default position is that for existing sites I will probably install the Classic Editor Plugin until either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>sites have been reviewed and are ready to have Gutenberg enabled; or<\/li>\n<li>clients have requested the new editor and we&#8217;ve explained the caveats around it; or<\/li>\n<li>I otherwise become confident that nothing will break and my clients have been adequately briefed and trained.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The response from one person I work with to this was &#8220;Do you mean to say that we won\u2019t support this new WP feature?\u00a0\u00a0That feels like a big step &#8211; essentially the 1st time we\u2019ve done such a thing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And to respond to that I put forward some of the issues in more depth.<\/p>\n<h3>Gutenberg Issues<\/h3>\n<h4>1 &#8211; This is a drastically new interface.<\/h4>\n<p>Allowing all sites to suddenly have it will probably result in a raft of support requests and confusion. My opinion (and I&#8217;ve made this clear to core developers) is that NEW sites should have it enabled by default and existing sites should have it as opt-in. BUT it looks like they&#8217;re just going to push it out to everyone as of v5.0.<\/p>\n<h4>2 &#8211;\u00a0The Gutenberg interface simply isn&#8217;t suitable for quite a lot of applications.<\/h4>\n<p>You might not want Gutenberg for editing some custom post types like events or countries. And to have it enabled for <em>some<\/em> post types and not others will be doubly confusing for users.<\/p>\n<h4>2a &#8211; Selective disabling will require code changes<\/h4>\n<p>In any case disabling Gutenberg on a per-post-type basis will PROBABLY require code changes on every site that I\/we have developed that has custom post types. (It&#8217;s not quite clear how this will work yet though).<\/p>\n<h4>2b) Making Gutenberg work the way it&#8217;s been suggested you should is a LOT of work!<\/h4>\n<p>The suggested way to adapt custom-field-heavy post types to Gutenberg that has been <a href=\"https:\/\/riad.blog\/2017\/12\/11\/with-gutenberg-what-happens-to-my-custom-fields\/\">stated by an Automattic engineer<\/a> is:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create Gutenberg blocks instead of meta boxes for custom fields\/post meta data.<\/li>\n<li>Link the blocks to the post meta data so that data is properly structured inside WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Provide a Gutenberg &#8220;template&#8221; layout that contains all the elements\/data in the right places on the screen.<\/li>\n<li>FIX this layout so that the user can&#8217;t modify the layout\/structure\/fields &#8211; only the content.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I have described this as like upgrading a bicycle (a vehicle that&#8217;s cheap, that&#8217;s clean, that you can ride without training and licensing) to a motorbike, and then attaching pedals so that you can get all the benefits of the bike back.<\/p>\n<p>This is a bit of a crazy workaround. And it&#8217;s a large amount of effort to get back functionality that you used to have for free.<\/p>\n<p><em>(Note that yes, a motorbike has its own advantages over a bicycle &#8211; it&#8217;s faster and louder and many would consider it an upgrade! But you have to want a motorbike, and you have to get trained to use it and you have to license it and insure it and buy a helmet and so on&#8230; You don&#8217;t just give everyone a motorbike because you think it&#8217;s better &#8211; some people love <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2015\/11\/new-friend-marin-muirwoods-29er-review\/\">their bicycles<\/a>!)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I trust that custom fields will continue to work. But this alternative, Gutenberg-ready approach is a lot more effort and requires learning\/training for a lot of developers.<\/p>\n<p>I also can&#8217;t help thinking that what developers really wanted was a fields API.\u00a0 And I also find the WordPress data model pretty restrictive and would like something like post relationships in core rather than having to fudge it with <code>post_meta<\/code>\u00a0or a custom table.\u00a0 Gutenberg &#8220;blocks&#8221; are great, but they aren&#8217;t structured data. They&#8217;re just a blob of text in the database. And connecting blocks to an already-lacking data structure as a workaround really doesn&#8217;t seem helpful.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note\/plug: if you liked that paragraph then you might want to <a href=\"https:\/\/wptolaravel.com\/\">learn about MVC frameworks like Laravel<\/a> instead.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>3 &#8211; We don&#8217;t know what will break and how to fix it<\/h4>\n<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear if and how all our meta boxes and ACF fields and stuff will work in a new Gutenberg world. They should all &#8220;just work&#8221; (the ACF guys in particular <a href=\"https:\/\/www.advancedcustomfields.com\/blog\/acf-year-review-2017\/\">seem to be on it<\/a>) but again, it&#8217;s not clear at this point if any work will be required. Right now we don&#8217;t know what, if anything, will break and how much effort it will be to fix it.<\/p>\n<h4>4 &#8211; What will clients do with it?<\/h4>\n<p>Do we really want to let all clients have an interface where they can create columns, layouts, tables, and whatever other &#8220;blocks&#8221; are present in the system? This is nearly the equivalent of installing a page builder for everyone? Is this a good idea?<\/p>\n<p>Opinion amongst the people I work with is divided.\u00a0 And I do understand that some clients have been wanting this. But part of our job is implementing a design and layout that works, and I&#8217;m concerned that Gutenberg allows clients to step outside of our expertly-crafted page structures.\u00a0 Yes, you can lock the layouts. But that&#8217;s more effort again. So I don&#8217;t know what to think here.<\/p>\n<h3>Summary<\/h3>\n<p>Having Gutenberg will be great for new websites and new projects going forward, but I&#8217;ve yet to be convinced that enabling it for all sites when they update to WordPress 5.0 is a good idea. So my plan is not to do that &#8211; to disable it until sites and people are ready for it.<\/p>\n<p>What are your plans?\u00a0 If you&#8217;re a client of mine, feel free to drop me a line to discuss Gutenberg, or even to try it out.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",
