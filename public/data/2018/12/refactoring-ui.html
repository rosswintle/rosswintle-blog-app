<p>As a developer who finds design really hard, I was very much looking forward to the release of Steve Schoger and Adam Wathan&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://refactoringui.com/book/">Refactoring UI</a>&#8221; book and kit of resources. Here&#8217;s some thoughts on it.</p>



<p>Note: I&#8217;m writing my thoughts in the order I had them. The positive stuff comes later!<br></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Price<br></h3>



<p>I heard the quote recently that &#8220;If people complain about the price, you&#8217;re doing it right&#8221;, and I confess, I complained about the price, so maybe they did price it right. I&#8217;d prepared myself for it to be 3 or 4 times the cost of an expensive book. But they priced it at $249 for the digital version of the book (not a physical book!) with all the resources! Yes, there&#8217;s a launch discount of 50%, but even so, this half-priced version was expensive.</p>



<p>Yes, I get the arguments that a lot of experience and knowledge is in here, and a lot of work has been put in to make it a thing. And I get the argument that this will save me time, and it only has to save me a few hours to pay for itself. But actually, I think owning this book won&#8217;t save me time; it will make me do better design work and spend longer on it! Which is fine. As long as someone wants that and is paying me for it!</p>



<p>I also can&#8217;t help thinking that if this was half the price then they&#8217;d sell twice as many copies, make just as much money and share their knowledge more widely. And isn&#8217;t this the point of making such a resource: to share your knowledge with people?</p>



<p>A could of years back I&#8217;d been disappointed by Adam&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://adamwathan.me/refactoring-to-collections/">Refactoring to Collections</a>&#8221; book which I thought wasn&#8217;t worth the money, and the provided videos in particular weren&#8217;t useful at all. So I was skeptical that this book&#8217;s extra resources would be helpful too &#8211; maybe I should just buy the basic package with the book?<br></p>



<p>But persuaded by the <a href="http://www.fullstackradio.com/103">Full Stack Radio podcast</a> that detailed exactly what was in it, I eventually bit and bought the full Refactoring UI kit.<br></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Format</h3>



<p>Aside from it being a digital-only book, it was PDF format. And I get that they&#8217;ve spent time laying it out and typesetting it, but PDF&#8217;s are still not my favourite eBook format.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re also selling it on Gumroad and the Gumroad reader seems to display PDFs at low quality. I&#8217;ve seen complaints on Twitter about the PDF quality and if you download it and open it locally it&#8217;s fine.</p>



<p>More annoying though is that the component library, colour schemes and font selections are all also in PDF form. Which is annoying because the ability to copy/paste stuff out of here, see the code, and tinker with it in the browser would have been great.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Material/Content</h3>



<p>OK, so here&#8217;s the good stuff. Because I&#8217;m not a designer, I can&#8217;t see visual stuff in my head or produce &#8220;nice looking stuff&#8221; out of thin air, I&#8217;m pretty dependent on rules and copying other people&#8217;s ideas to make things I make for the web look nice.</p>



<p>And the book here really delivers. Strategic, rule-based design tips that really suit someone like me. It&#8217;s presented in a really easily digestible format, and has LOADS of very-well-put-together real-life examples.</p>



<p>You can see the amount of work that has gone into this in creating the fictional-but-real-looking designs that illustrate the points being made. They&#8217;re done a really great job.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s great stuff, well presented, and reading it WILL change my work for the better.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">I want exercises!</h3>



<p>Finally, as well as wanting the component library and things in code, I think it would really benefit from some exercises.</p>



<p>The videos are great at explaining the concepts and showing how to transform a bad design into a good one. But I really want to have a go at this myself.</p>



<p>Some exercises a bit like Wes Bos&#8217;s <a href="https://javascript30.com/">JavaScript 30</a> course would be an amazing addition. Give me the video, the starting design/code and the ending design/code, and let me see if I can make some of the changes myself.</p>



<p>Reading and watching is all well and good, but I&#8217;m only going to build up the skills and get them into my &#8220;muscle memory&#8221; if I actually DO then.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Summary</h3>



<p>I love this kit. It&#8217;s expensive, but it&#8217;s an amazing tool for me. But it does also feel lacking/incomplete in its current form.<br></p>



<p>My hope is that Adam and Steve have made so much cash now that they don&#8217;t have to work for a year, and that now the book is out, they can spend some time producing some additional resources for those who have purchased it.</p>
