<p>Reflections on using Firefox for a couple of weeks as primary browser (instead of Chrome) with DuckDuckGo as main search engine:

</p>



<p>✅ it&#8217;s fast enough<br>✅ dev tools are good</p>



<p>❌ it&#8217;s a bit buggy and freezes at times<br>❌ heavy JS seems slower<br>❌ bookmark/tab/history sync is poor</p>



<p>Also, personalised search is SOMETIMES much better than anonymised search. I  still reach for Google occasionally. DDG doesn&#8217;t always recognise I&#8217;m in  UK for example.</p>



<p>And yes, I 100% aware that the browser is one of the most complex bits  of software I have. Firefox still gets ?</p>
