<p>I find that there is a constant tension in my life, and I think particularly in my industry &#8211; working on the web &#8211; between creating content and consuming content.</p>



<p>I always feel like I SHOULD create more content. But it’s hard because the content I consume always make my content feel low value, not as good, unworthy of being published. So I’m constantly catching up. And I catch up by consuming content.</p>



<p>It’s a vicious circle!</p>



<p>I’m currently feeling quite motivated to create.</p>



<p>I’m terrible at short form content but that’s what I want to make more of.</p>



<p>I’m scared of putting out something that’s not good enough, but I keep being reminded that I need to just start.</p>



<p>And I’m conscious of time &#8211; I know I keep on about it but being a parent sucks time for both consuming and creating content. So one really does need to be prioritised if it’s to get time and attention.</p>



<p>The recent move of lots of people off of Twitter and Facebook and onto more open platforms like <a href="Http://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> and <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, and things being said by wise people like <a href="https://timetable.manton.org/2018/08/episode-113-focus-on-smaller-networks/">Manton Reece</a> and <a href="https://robbell.podbean.com/e/episode-200-1528694547/">Rob Bell</a> have really made me want to just make stuff again, and to make it on platforms I own and control, so that it’s properly MINE!</p>



<p>I love my blog, I’ve always loved writing and sharing. I’m going to try (again) to do more.</p>
