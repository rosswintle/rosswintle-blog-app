<p>One thing that I’ve learned about myself in the last few years has been that I have a character trait that gives me a natural tendency towards caring about details.</p>



<p>But learning this about me has also meant learning that the majority of people do not have a natural tendency towards caring about details.</p>



<p>This is not to say that the majority of others don’t care or are not detail oriented. But it has been a revelation to me that it’s possible for people to just breeze through life ignoring how that thing is made, or why that thing doesn’t comply with the rules, or the fact that that apostrophe isn’t in the right place, or what others might think of what they do.</p>



<p>This week I have been struggling with a company who do important legal and regulatory stuff for Oikos. I will not name names, and I will not list the catalogue of small errors that have beset the process. But I really do find myself wondering how you get into this kind of field without having a high level of attention to detail.</p>



<p>So, forgive me if I’m a bit slow sometimes with my work. It sometimes means I’m trying to do something right. Because I’d rather be right than fast.<br/></p>
