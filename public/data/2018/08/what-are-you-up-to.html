<p>I don’t know if this is interesting, but maybe it gives some insight into the breadth of my work in a given week.</p>
<p>Right now I have a number of things on and in the pipeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve just launched a <a href="https://shipoffools.com/">custom WordPress site</a> for an online magazine that has some quite complicated features built out in custom code and <a href="https://www.gravityforms.com/">Gravity Forms</a>. This also involved a highly complex import of existing content scraped from <a href="http://archive.shipoffools.com/mystery/index.html">hundreds of HTML files</a>. I also themed <a href="https://vanillaforums.com/en/software/">Vanilla Forums</a> for <a href="https://forums.shipoffools.com/">this project’s community side</a>, and advised on GDPR, SEO and a bunch of other things.</li>
<li>I’m working on phase&#8230;err&#8230;7 perhaps (?) of a custom Laravel-based food ordering system that uses some hefty amount of <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> and a big bunch of custom logic.</li>
<li>I’m about to launch a site for a Devon-based charity that’s a simple <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/">Divi-based</a> WordPress brochure site. But I’m excited because, effectively, I was the visual designer on this and it ACTUALLY LOOKS REALLY NICE!! (Or so I think)</li>
<li>I have two other small Divi-based sites on the go for local organisations/people. One involves some clever data manipulation and image migration/import work.</li>
<li>I have a WordPress plugin extension to write to enable custom postcode lookup functionality on a <a href="https://ninjaforms.com/">Ninja Form</a>.</li>
<li>I’m providing ad-hoc support to a number of clients &#8211; mostly WordPress stuff, but sometimes diving into UX, hosting, security, site migrations, domains and DNS, email deliverability, and general IT support.</li>
<li>I’m trying to get an important client email out about the new “<a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/">Gutenberg</a>” editor in WordPress (amongst other things) which needs me to edit a screencast video first.</li>
<li>In my spare time I’m building SchoolBot and <a href="https://blog.kownter.com/about-kownter/">Kownter</a> as side projects (amongst other things that have fallen by the wayside), and trying to keep my “<a href="https://press-ups.com/">Press Ups</a>” video tutorials going too. Oh and there’s (hugely unexciting secret WordPress project) happening too.</li>
<li>Fielding whatever support, hosting, minor changes and prospective client queries come in on a day-to-day basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>So there we go&#8230;keeps me busy with family and household stuff around too!</p>
