<p>It was lovely, on holiday last week, to be outdoors in a safe environment without much to do at times.</p>



<p>Despite having a very “indoorsy” job, I love being outside. I find it hard to work outside for some reason, even though flexible freelance life means I could.</p>



<p>But being trapped in an office means I don’t get to be outside often. And at home, when I’m outside, I’m usually gardening, cycling, walking or doing something else with purpose.</p>



<p>And this all means that I rarely get to be barefoot.</p>



<p>It will probably sound like a really odd thing, but I REALLY liked walking around barefoot on the grass and (this will surprise some but&#8230;) the beach on holiday.</p>



<p>I like things that connect me to the earth. Cycling and gardening means I have to pay attention to weather. Gardening and growing food also puts you very much in touch with the seasons.</p>



<p>I like cooking (even though Sally does most of it) and baking.  I like the processes of brewing tea and filter coffee. I like the slowness of making sourdough bread which is a thing which, when starter and dough, feels very much “alive”.</p>



<p>Computers and the internet are great, brilliant, amazing things. But there’s something special about just feeling the grass beneath your feet.</p>
