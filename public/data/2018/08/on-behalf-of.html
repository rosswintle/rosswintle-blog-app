<p>I’ve been contributing to some discussions that have been happening this week about the new WordPress “Gutenberg” editor. Hopefully constructively. And I think its useful to note where I come from when thinking about Gutenberg.</p>



<p>Firstly, there’s my own context. Mostly as a user of WordPress (I’m using it right now!) but also as a developer. And I’m always aware, when thinking about and commenting on Gutenberg, that I’m not a typical user.</p>



<p>So there’s this second context, which is: what does everyone else think? Here, I’m often guessing (probably incorrectly) what the typical user might want.</p>



<p>But I also have this other, third role/context that I think overrides thoughts of “what do I want” and “what might everyone else want”. That role is WordPress educator and support person. The role where I explain to both the public (sometimes) and to my clients (more often) how to use WordPress, or take questions on how to use it.</p>



<p>In this role, the main question I’m asking is: “How the heck am I going to explain this to someone else?”</p>



<p>I’ll happily take advice in the comments on how to answer that question.<br/></p>
