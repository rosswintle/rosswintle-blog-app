<p>Regular readers/followers will have heard me talk about Rob Bell&#8217;s podcast before &#8211; take him with a pinch of salt. And these notes are from <a href="https://robbell.podbean.com/e/kristin-hanggi-and-natalie-roy-are-just-getting-started/">an interview he did with two other people</a> who I think you should take with a pinch of salt.</p>



<p>BUT&#8230;I&#8217;m intrigued by different forms of spirituality at the moment. These people had some really interesting things to say about how spirituality works with creativity, and on creativity in general.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">On listening to other people because THEIR ideas might be the right ones</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
	<p>There are other ways to know things. One vision that&#8217;s trying to come through. I&#8217;m being open enough to see it and interpret it. Sometimes the divine whispers answers in <em>other peoples&#8217; heads</em>. So I have to listen well enough because it might come through someone else. Especially the people who are like: that person&#8217;s vision is not my vision&#8230; The people who seem to be the greatest obstacle to you getting your thing done are actually the people where you pause and listen. </p><cite>At about 11:00 &#8211; 12:00</cite></blockquote>



<p>As Rob Bell would say:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
	<p>Everyone is your teacher!</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Making regardless of the outcome</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
	<p>You create something. You don&#8217;t say &#8220;where&#8217;s it gonna go?&#8221; You don&#8217;t say &#8220;why am I making this?&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s gonna be. Let&#8217;s just go for it. Let&#8217;s ride the train.&#8221;</p>
	<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; never occurs to me. Well: because we&#8217;re here; we&#8217;re breathing!</p><cite>At around 15:20</cite></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Don&#8217;t talk yourself out of it with questions&#8230;go play!</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
	<p>We always say that &#8220;How?&#8221; is not my job, and &#8220;Why?&#8221; is not our business. Once you start asking &#8220;Why?&#8221; you&#8217;re going to talk yourself out of it&#8230;people ask &#8220;Why does the planet need this?&#8221;&#8230;if it&#8217;s in you, it&#8217;s supposed to be made, just go with that. If the idea comes up inside of me&#8230;Divine has said &#8220;you, here you go, go play!&#8221;</p><cite>At around 15:40</cite></blockquote>
