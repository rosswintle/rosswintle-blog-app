You need to go all in. They aren&#8217;t intended to be mashed up with traditional HTML page reloads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I then tried to work out how to use the Axios HTTP client library to do my delete action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And was that easy?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well&#8230;hmm&#8230;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Axios\/AJAX thing was actually pretty simple. I&#8217;ll give you that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I was then faced with the propsect of having to delete the <code>thing<\/code>\u00a0from my list of things stored as data in the top-level component instance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the problem with this is that this data is a nested array that comes from PHP via JSON.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I know some people complain that PHP arrays are trying to be all things to all men, but from a developer happiness point of view they are pretty nice and I&#8217;ve got very used to their flexibility and ease of use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But getting them from PHP into JS isn&#8217;t so simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my case I have a list of things for each day of the week. But not every day needs a list. So I can have:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">[<br\/>  1 => [<br\/>          'thing1',<br\/>          'thing2'<br\/>  ],<br\/>  3 => [<br\/>          'thing3',<br\/>          'thing4'<br\/>  ]<br\/>]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can have this in JavaScript too. Sort of.\u00a0 JavaScript doesn&#8217;t like the gaps &#8211; note in the image below the <code>empty<\/code>\u00a0slots and the length:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3778\" width=\"316\" height=\"84\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08.png 632w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08-300x80.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Screen-Shot-2018-06-15-at-09.45.08-600x159.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT&#8230;to get between PHP and JS we generally use JSON as a kind of intermediate format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And JSON doesn&#8217;t have arrays with indexes. JSON arrays have no specific indices. They always start at zero and subsequent elements are indexed with the next integer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to get around this, PHP&#8217;s <code>json_encode()<\/code>\u00a0function works out if the PHP array is compatible with JSON. If it is then it spits out a JSON array. And if it isn&#8217;t then it spits out a JSON OBJECT!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a valid JSON array &#8211; zero-indexed and all sequential keys:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">> $a = [ 0 => 'a', 1 => 'b' ];<br\/>> echo json_encode( $a );<br\/>[\"a\",\"b\"]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a non-JSON compatible array:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">> $b = [ 1 => 'a', 2 => 'b' ];<br\/>> echo json_encode( $b );<br\/>{\"1\":\"a\",\"2\":\"b\"}<br\/><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Fun! Now I note that you can add the <code>JSON_FORCE_OBJECT<\/code>\u00a0flag to always convert PHP arrays to JSON objects, even if they are JSON-array compatible. But for the most part, you sometime get an array in JSON, and you sometimes get an object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And my list of things, not being JSON-array compatible, was being spat out as an object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s my issue: JavaScript objects aren&#8217;t really iterable. You can&#8217;t easily loop over them. I mean, yes, you can get the keys, and you can use <code>for...of<\/code>\u00a0or <code>for...in<\/code>\u00a0or something. But sometimes you&#8217;ll get properties you don&#8217;t want (such as a Vue <code>__ob__<\/code>\u00a0observer property) and&#8230;well&#8230;objects just aren&#8217;t really intended to be used in this way. Objects are objects, not lists or arrays.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what to do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I could use <code>JSON_FORCE_OBJECT<\/code>\u00a0and treat ALL my arrays as objects and deal with it. That would probably be OK. But then I&#8217;m stuck using objects for lists of things in JS and that&#8217;s not right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or I could try to make all my PHP arrays JSON compatible. So my list would be zero-indexed and sequential, like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">[<br\/>  0 => [],<br\/>  1 => [<br\/>    'thing1',<br\/>    'thing2'<br\/>  ],<br\/>  2 => [],<br\/>  3 => [<br\/>    'thing3',<br\/>    'thing4'<br\/>  ]<br\/>]<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>But enforcing this inside PHP doesn&#8217;t seem like the right thing to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or I could try to find a way to convert JSON objects that only have numeric keys back into JS arrays. But that still has issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, I think, is a major pain point and frustration for me.\u00a0 Once my data is in the right places and in the right types of data structure, I know what I&#8217;m doing and can work quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But moving data between the different parts of these multi-part systems is hard to get right. And doing it in a scalable and maintainable way is even harder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday I also had problems with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">JavaScript scope<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>How how how How HOW do\u00a0I pass a variable to a lexically-out-of-scope callback, like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">function deleteThingFromData( thingToDelete ) {<br\/>  newData = _.mapValues( data, myOutOfScopeCallback );<br\/>  data = newData;<br\/>}<br\/><br\/>function myOutOfScopeCallback( dataItem ) {<br\/>  \/\/ Needs access to thingToDelete!<br\/>}<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">this<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>this is perpetually not my friend. Nothing in programming should be called <code>this<\/code>, especially when its meaning can vary so wildly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday I got caught by the fact that <code>this<\/code>\u00a0inside an arrow function is different to <code>this<\/code>\u00a0with a normal function.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">#learnToLoveJs<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, my delete now works (YAY!), and I&#8217;m still motivated to #learnToLoveJS, but gosh it&#8217;s hard work.<\/p>\n",
