<p>This is from <a href="https://changelog.com/podcast/302">a great episode of the ChangeLog podcast</a> that interviews Tim Bell, the founder and creator of CS Unplugged: a collection of free teaching material that teaches computer science through engaging games and puzzles.</p>



<p>I struggle with how much screentime our kids have. Perhaps this quote will inspire is to do more creative things with our kids&#8217; screentime!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
	<p>We do kinda see the Unplugged stuff as a kind of gateway drug [to actually using a computer] but I think a lot of it is about balance because as parents a lot of us are rightly concerned about screen time, but again we have to think are kids on computers consuming and being a user or are they creating and thinking and so on. And even with programming, if a kid is writing programs and creating things that is quite different things happening in their minds than if they are sitting there watching stuff and playing.</p>
