<p>This comes with all my usual Rob Bell caveats &#8211; make of him what you will, because I&#8217;m not even sure myself &#8211; but I was listening to this interview about food, ecology, the earth, soil, people, education and being alive while making sourdough. It&#8217;s fascinating and inspiring.</p>



<p>It made me glad that I have a garden; that my children get to see food grow, dig in the mud, pull food from the earth and take it straight to their plate occasionally; that we, as a family (and mostly my beautiful wife) cook and bake and chop and peel and wash our food.</p>



<p>I know that we are fortunate to live where we do and that we are able to do this. Perhaps you are less so. But I hope this interview inspires you.</p>
