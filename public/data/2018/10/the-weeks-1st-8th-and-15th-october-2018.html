<p><em>October has been manic and I&#8217;ve been down on my content-production. Here&#8217;s a quick summary in projects, posts and pins!</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Projects: what I&#8217;ve been up to</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>General WordPress project work: tweaks to recently completed projects, starting off some new smaller projects, and working on a slight re-design of a site that I made that is for a project that&#8217;s having a bit of a re-launch.</li><li>Support and tweaks to a WordPress + LearnDash website. This has involved adding some security, debugging ReCAPTCHA&#8217;s, and making some nicer forms.</li><li>Dealing with a seemingly-targetted hack on a prominent website that I help look after. The hosting company spent a lot of time on this with us and I&#8217;m very grateful for their help. We eventually decided it was safe to roll back to a backup of the site, but we lost a few days of data and I&#8217;ve been working through TWO backed up copies of the database to piece together important, missing data, line-by-line. This has actually set me back a couple of days and I&#8217;m still running a bit behind. </li><li>Dealing with another issue that looked like a possible hack, but turned out to be a client&#8217;s hosting company (no names!) doing something they shouldn&#8217;t have without telling us.</li></ul>
