<p>I&#8217;ve also been using the buses a lot.  Partly because I feel I should, and partly because the brakes on the car seem a bit dodgy (maybe just cold weather?).</p>
<p>I <a title="Busism" href="https://rosswintle.uk/2009/05/busism/" target="_self">mentioned buses before</a>, back in May, but after a prolonged exposure to them I have more thoughts.</p>
<h3>Buses are good!</h3>
<p>Yeah, I really think this!  They kept running through the snow, they were quick, mostly on time, the <a title="Traveline South West Journey Planner" href="http://www.travelinesw.com/journeyplanner/enterJourneyPlan.do" target="_blank">journey planner</a>, <a title="Swindon Real-Time Bus Info" href="http://swindon.acislive.com/" target="_blank">realtime information system</a> (and the <a title="Nextbuses.mobi" href="http://nextbuses.mobi/" target="_blank">mobile version</a>) works really well.  I even found them tidy, convenient and enjoyable!</p>
<p>We are fortunate to live near a fairly major bus artery out of the town centre &#8211; I&#8217;m probably commuting against the flow and have plenty of route options with no changes, but even so, I was impressed.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve loved having a deadline by which I must be out of the office.  I&#8217;ve mostly worked my contracted hours this week, and that feels right!</p>
<p>But&#8230;</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>And there&#8217;s some lingering buts&#8230;</p>
<h3>Buses aren&#8217;t so good</h3>
<p>I have several gripes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fares</strong>: buses aren&#8217;t cheap, a return for me to work is £3.40 and it&#8217;s cheaper to buy an all-day travel ticket for £3.20.  This is still a lot.  There are weekly tickets but they don&#8217;t save you all that much and you need to travel a full 5 days to get any benefit at all.</li>
<li><strong>Change</strong>: Buses don&#8217;t give change.  Well, some do (see &#8220;integration&#8221;), and some don&#8217;t.  This means that you&#8217;re constantly fighting to keep the next days&#8217; fare in your pocket and if you don&#8217;t have it then, well, you can&#8217;t travel &#8211; or you end up paying more than you should.</li>
<li><strong>Integration</strong>: There are two bus companies in Swindon.  The all-day ticket works on both companies&#8217; buses.  One company seems to give change when the other doesn&#8217;t.  One company has real-time info, the other doesn&#8217;t.  One company has a convenient &#8220;smart card&#8221; payment system that would reduce the problem of not having the right money&#8230;but it only works on one company&#8217;s buses.</li>
<li><strong>Learning curve</strong>: There is a certain &#8220;culture&#8221; about buses.  If you&#8217;ve never used them there are things you need to learn (like, that they don&#8217;t give change, and which stop to get off at).  It&#8217;s easier to use another form of transport that you know well and understand how it works.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these problems is insurmountable.  With good staff training and customer service skills, a few simple changes, some subsidy, co-operation and investment, I think Swindon&#8217;s buses hold promise.</p>
<p>One final thought: there was much talk of how the snow caused so many problems with people getting to work/school.  Perhaps subsiding the buses during this time of difficult transportation would have got people onto them, used to using them, and kept some of our economy and services running?  They&#8217; re all good things, right?</p>
