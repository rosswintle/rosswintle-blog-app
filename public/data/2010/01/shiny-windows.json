Importing mail into Thunderbird from my old Outlook Express files was easy, and <a title=\"XMarks\" href=\"http:\/\/xmarks.com\" target=\"_blank\">XMarks<\/a> made synching my bookmarks a doddle.<\/p>\n<p>The only real trauma was getting iTunes to keep my library (with playlists, import dates, ratings, album art, etc) intact whilst moving, and, hopefully, not screwing up my iPod when doing a first sync. \u00a0This did happen pretty smoothly, though I&#8217;m not entirely sure how I achieved it. \u00a0I did at one point have two entries for each track, but I just deleted the new ones and convinced it the the old ones were in C:\\Users\\ rather than C:\\Documents and Settings and all seemed to be OK.<\/p>\n<h3>Overall<\/h3>\n<p>Overall, this has been a really good move, and, with all that&#8217;s going on that might need more web development and online collaboration, a timely one too.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a pretty happy, newly upgraded, Windows-7-laptop-owning geek!<\/p>\n",
