<p>While I, in my personal life, find it really difficult to know how to go about doing this <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-761-1' id='fnref-761-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(761)'>1</a></sup>, one of the things I do to try to stop me feeling less guilty about not actually doing it is campainging <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-761-2' id='fnref-761-2' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(761)'>2</a></sup>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Lots of charities provide campainging <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-761-3' id='fnref-761-3' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(761)'>3</a></sup> resources.  <a title="Tearfund" href="http://www.tearfund.org" target="_blank">Tearfund</a> provide the hugely simple &#8220;<a title="SuperBadger" href="http://www.tearfund.org/Campaigning/SuperBadger/" target="_blank">SuperBadger</a>&#8221; Facebook app, for example.</p>
<p>Now, I kinda imagined that these emails would just go to someone at Tearfund who would batch them all up and send them on to be promptly ignored.</p>
<p>But NO!  This app REALLY seems to send emails to the people concerned.</p>
<p>And you REALLY get responses from the people in power.  Check this header from an email I received today:</p>

Dear xxxxx,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Oliver Letwin ahead of the General Election, asking about the Conservative Party’s policy on international development.  He has asked me to respond on his behalf.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have a folder full of responses from Tea companies, UK and foreign politicians, DfID, European Ministers, and so on.</p>
<p>OK&#8230;so far so good, but let&#8217;s get a few things straight:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m not naive and I highly doubt that Oliver Letwin has had any hand in that at all.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t entirely know if this stuff has any effect whatsoever on the decisions made by our politicians and business people.</li>
</ul>
<p>But it&#8217;s worth reading the responses and, occasionally starting dialogue with this intern that&#8217;s replied on the important person&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<p>My latest reply, from which the header is quoted above, points me to <a title="Conservative Party: One World Conservatism" href="http://www.conservatives.com/oneworld/" target="_blank">the Conservatives &#8220;One World Conservatism&#8221; page</a>.  Which all looks well and good &#8211; though I don&#8217;t agree with everything they propose.</p>
<p>Of course, Labour are also committed to the key UN-agreed target of 0.7% GNI to be spent on aid by 2013.  Oh yeah, and they&#8217;re spending on HIV/AIDS too instead of the Tories&#8217; malaria.  Oh and Labour, like the Tories, also want to make foreign governments more accountable.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don&#8217;t see much between the two main parties.  No one&#8217;s taking a lead on it.  No one&#8217;s saying we&#8217;re going to meet the goal by 2011, for example.  No one&#8217;s pledging anything on water and sanitation. No one&#8217;s pledging to hold UK and multinational businesses to account for their activities in the developing world.</p>
<p>I admit that we can&#8217;t do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">everything</span> <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-761-4' id='fnref-761-4' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(761)'>4</a></sup>, so we have to pick and choose what to do.  Yet, I can&#8217;t help feeling like these pages are just spin that make it look like the parties are doing something, when actually, they need to do a whole load more.</p>
<p>Which comes back to me.  What am I doing?  Am I all talk and no action too?</p>
<p>Hmm&#8230;.</p>
