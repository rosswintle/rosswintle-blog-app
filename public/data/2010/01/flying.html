<p>It costs me anything from £80 to £250 to get the train to &#8220;Slough&#8221; depending on when I go and which route I take.  Regardless of route it takes me around 4 hours.</p>
<p>The other day I saw, on the printer in our office, that someone had booked a flight from Southampton to &#8220;Slough&#8221; and back.  It would take an hour, which I confess is hugely convenient.  And it would cost less than £60!  All in!</p>
<p>This is stupid for an almost innumerable number of reasons.  How can it cost £60?</p>
<p>I confess, I&#8217;ve not researched the facts below but I believe them to be true. (Correct me in the comments if I&#8217;m wrong).</p>

<ul>
<li>Planes use more fuel than a trains, so planes should cost more than trains.</li>
<li>Planes create more carbon emissions than  trains.  Pollution of most forms is taxed or financially penalised, so planes should cost more than trains.</li>
<li>Planes are faster, and therefore more convenient than trains, and therefore they are higher value than trains and should cost more than trains.</li>
<li>The capacity of a plane is less than that of a train.  Assuming demand is equal a plane should cost more than a train.</li>
<li>You have to pay an &#8220;airport tax&#8221;, I don&#8217;t believe you pay a &#8220;railway station tax&#8221;.  Using an airport should cost more than using a railway station.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s more.  So by what calculation can this be true?  I AM naive so please, tell me, how is this so?  Are we taking money from the railway companies and giving it to the airlines or something?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s baffling and stupid and it needs to change.</p>
