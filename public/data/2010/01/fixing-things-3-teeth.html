I had a lot of work done on them to straighten them out when I was younger and I&#8217;ve managed to take good care of them since, and so I don&#8217;t often go to see the dentist and, until a couple of weeks ago, had had no fillings as an adult.</p>
<p>But when a bit of one of my lower front teeth just feel out while I was sat watching TV, I decided it might be worth a visit.</p>
<p><!--more-->A short time later I was lighter of pocket, but plus a white filling, after a relatively painless 10 minutes in the chair.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t feel too comfortable, and I was surprised at how sensitive the nerves of the mouth are &#8211; a tiny blob of filling felt like a huge alien residing on the back of my incisor.  From the word go I was never really convinced that it had been done well, but I&#8217;d not had a filling before, so I was willing to accept it and &#8220;get used to it&#8221; as people kept telling me.</p>
<p>I was proved right when, during the weekend after Christmas, it fell out while I was brushing, taking some more tooth with it.</p>
<p>Question is, do I go back to the same guy and get another potentially bad job done?  Or shall I find someone better?  And can I get a refund on a dodgy filling?</p>
