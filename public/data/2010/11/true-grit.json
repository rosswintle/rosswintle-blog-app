        "rendered": "<p>Apologies (again) for lack of blogging commitment of late.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve been VERY busy building websites for people, but that&#8217;s another story.<\/p>\n<p>The first real sub-zero cold snap has come and we&#8217;ve had icy roads, so the gritting lorries have been out.<\/p>\n<p>The gritting lorries, however, don&#8217;t grit the cycle or pedestrian paths!\u00a0 And part of my cycle path has been frozen, slippery leaf mulch for the last few days.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve seen and stopped to chat to one guy who&#8217;d come off and was sat next to his bike, clearly shaken and with a minor injury.\u00a0 The cycle\/pedestrian paths aren&#8217;t safe!!<\/p>\n<p>Towards the end of last year&#8217;s long snowy season they DID grit some of the paths, and I took photos and <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2009\/03\/snow-and-cycle-paths\/\">wrote about it<\/a> as it was melting.<\/p>\n<p>That grit in the photos was put down as the snow was clearing and lasted for several weeks after the snow had gone.\u00a0 Where&#8217;s the logic in that?\u00a0 If it&#8217;s going to last for weeks then surely better to put it out early and let it hang around to keep the paths safe during winter?<\/p>\n<p>So I put that idea to the council yesterday, and today a nice lady from the council got back to me with a very thorough response.\u00a0 Apparently she can&#8217;t help because it&#8217;s not the council&#8217;s policy to treat cycle routes.\u00a0 This is not a purely financial decision, there is a technical explanation:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>Salt only assists in reducing the freezing point of water when it is in solution and the best way to get the salt into a solution, within snow or standing water, is by the action of traffic.\u00a0 [Because] the routes are lightly trafficked [&#8230;] any applied salt could be almost entirely ineffectual, wasting resources and damaging the environment.<\/div>\n<div>Application of grit sand,\u00a0 may assist in snow for a short while, but in the longer term would prove to be a hazard in itself as it could cause skidding accidents, this therefore is not an option either.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<div>As a technical person who likes a bit of science, I genuinely appreciate and mostly understand this explanation.\u00a0 However, it leaves me with questions:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>If that&#8217;s the case, what was with the gritting of this path last year?\u00a0 Perhaps as the snow melted and became solution the grit would help keep it from re-freezing?<\/li>\n<li>If that&#8217;s the case why are there gritting boxes for gritting pavements on steep hills around Swindon?\u00a0 And why does the business park I work on grit the pedestrian paths around the park &#8211; with seemingly excellent ice-reducing effects?<\/li>\n<li>Surely, in the days of iPhones, man-made Satellites, and <a title=\"Graphene\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Graphene\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Graphene<\/a> someone has invented a substance they can put on cycle paths and pavements to make them safe in winter?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So, I appeal to my blog&#8217;s cycling audience&#8230;do your cycle paths get gritted?\u00a0 How is this done in places like Copenhagen and Amsterdam where cycling is a major form of transport?\u00a0 Perhaps someone even know if my council lady is right?\u00a0 Or if there&#8217;s a new kind of grit or salt that I can recommend?<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>Thanks in advance folks!!<\/div>\n",
