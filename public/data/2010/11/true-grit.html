<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">True Grit</h1></header><main><p>Apologies (again) for lack of blogging commitment of late.  I&#8217;ve been VERY busy building websites for people, but that&#8217;s another story.</p>
<p>The first real sub-zero cold snap has come and we&#8217;ve had icy roads, so the gritting lorries have been out.</p>
<p>The gritting lorries, however, don&#8217;t grit the cycle or pedestrian paths!  And part of my cycle path has been frozen, slippery leaf mulch for the last few days.  I&#8217;ve seen and stopped to chat to one guy who&#8217;d come off and was sat next to his bike, clearly shaken and with a minor injury.  The cycle/pedestrian paths aren&#8217;t safe!!</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year&#8217;s long snowy season they DID grit some of the paths, and I took photos and <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2009/03/snow-and-cycle-paths/">wrote about it</a> as it was melting.</p>
<p>That grit in the photos was put down as the snow was clearing and lasted for several weeks after the snow had gone.  Where&#8217;s the logic in that?  If it&#8217;s going to last for weeks then surely better to put it out early and let it hang around to keep the paths safe during winter?</p>
<p>So I put that idea to the council yesterday, and today a nice lady from the council got back to me with a very thorough response.  Apparently she can&#8217;t help because it&#8217;s not the council&#8217;s policy to treat cycle routes.  This is not a purely financial decision, there is a technical explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Salt only assists in reducing the freezing point of water when it is in solution and the best way to get the salt into a solution, within snow or standing water, is by the action of traffic.  [Because] the routes are lightly trafficked [&#8230;] any applied salt could be almost entirely ineffectual, wasting resources and damaging the environment.</div>
<div>Application of grit sand,  may assist in snow for a short while, but in the longer term would prove to be a hazard in itself as it could cause skidding accidents, this therefore is not an option either.</div>
</blockquote>
<div>As a technical person who likes a bit of science, I genuinely appreciate and mostly understand this explanation.  However, it leaves me with questions:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>If that&#8217;s the case, what was with the gritting of this path last year?  Perhaps as the snow melted and became solution the grit would help keep it from re-freezing?</li>
<li>If that&#8217;s the case why are there gritting boxes for gritting pavements on steep hills around Swindon?  And why does the business park I work on grit the pedestrian paths around the park &#8211; with seemingly excellent ice-reducing effects?</li>
<li>Surely, in the days of iPhones, man-made Satellites, and <a title="Graphene" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene" target="_self" rel="noopener">Graphene</a> someone has invented a substance they can put on cycle paths and pavements to make them safe in winter?</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I appeal to my blog&#8217;s cycling audience&#8230;do your cycle paths get gritted?  How is this done in places like Copenhagen and Amsterdam where cycling is a major form of transport?  Perhaps someone even know if my council lady is right?  Or if there&#8217;s a new kind of grit or salt that I can recommend?</p>

<div>Thanks in advance folks!!</div>
