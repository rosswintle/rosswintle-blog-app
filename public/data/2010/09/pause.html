<p>[Note, I searched Flickr for the word &#8220;pause&#8221; to get the image and got <a title="Flickr search for &quot;pause&quot;" href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=pause&amp;w=all" target="_blank">some beautiful pictures</a> back]</p>
<p>Cycling has bad moments.  It has bad days.  It has bad weeks!  I&#8217;ve written about them before and I deliberately don&#8217;t link to those posts now.</p>
<p>Today has been a good cycling day.</p>
<p>A crisp, cool, morning.  I don&#8217;t remember the traffic on my commute to work &#8211; I remember a blue sky with not a cloud in it and not wanting to stop when I reached the gate to the office.</p>
<p>An easy ride home into another beautiful sky with picture-postcard fluffy clouds against a brilliant blue background.  (At the time I actually thought it was more &#8220;The Simpsons&#8221; than picture postcard, but never mind).</p>
<p>A friend&#8217;s party in the evening.  It&#8217;s a few miles away.  I left Fuzzy out of the shed and it didn&#8217;t look like rain. In fact it was still crisp and cool.  Not quite winter-gloves cold.  A nice, refreshing cold.  Stars coming out, moon rising.  &#8220;You came on your bike?&#8221;&#8230;&#8221;Is there another way to travel a few miles on a beautiful evening like this?&#8221;</p>
<p>The roads were quiet on the way home.  The odd boy racer, but next to nothing on the quieter streets.  Still not cold and the moonlight illuminating a few wispy clouds.  I nearly headed, not for home, but for the light-pollution-free country lanes.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I just want to press pause and have every day like this.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m off to sit under the stars.</p>
