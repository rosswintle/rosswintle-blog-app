<p>We dug a pond last year and though a little empty over the winter, it was thriving with life this year.  We started the spring a little concerned with the amount of weed that had grown.  Then got slightly concerned that the four-or-five pond snails that we&#8217;d added had multiplied at an exponential rate.  And then &#8211; cue much excitement &#8211; frogspawn came!</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not entirely sure what eats what, but the weed disappeared.  Did the tadpoles eat it? Did the snails eat it?  Did something else eat it?</p>
<p><!--more-->Anyway, then the tadpoles were, finally, reduced to about 15 tiny frogs.  Oh, and the snail population has&#8230;well, I&#8217;m not sure by what means, but it&#8217;s dramatic growth suddenly ground to a halt.  Which is just as well because, otherwise, Swindon would be overrun with gastropods<sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-863-1' id='fnref-863-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(863)'>1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Then there was the blackfly, which appeared out of nowhere and have never been a problem before. Soon followed by these:</p>

<p>Which we had to look up, but which turn out to be&#8230;ladybird lavae.  It may be that we&#8217;ve just not been looking for them before but when we looked carefully there seemed to be loads of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And what eats blackfly?  Well: &#8220;The aphid&#8217;s enemies include hoverflies, ladybirds,                  lacewings and birds.&#8221; (thanks <a title="Garden Action - Aphid Control" href="http://www.gardenaction.co.uk/techniques/pests/aphids.htm" target="_self">Garden Action</a>!)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Which explains these weird, alien, translucent bugs too:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Yup &#8211; we had to look those up too, but that&#8217;s a hoverfly larvae!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Where they came from, if they deliberately came from anywhere, I don&#8217;t know, but shortly after they appeared the blackfly magically disappeared.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;d heard about this kind of thing happening over many years with larger animals, but I didn&#8217;t realise that populations could boom and bust within less than a season.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nature&#8217;s work continues to fascinate.  There&#8217;s more to gardening than just growing plants you know.  There&#8217;s so much to see, get experience and get involved in &#8211; even for a thirty-something!</p>
