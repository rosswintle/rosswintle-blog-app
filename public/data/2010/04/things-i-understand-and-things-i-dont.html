<p>Another conversation I was having was about political manifestos, pledges, and promises in the run-up to election time.</p>
<p>A good friend of mine, who works for a large financial organisation, and has a degree in law, stated that he didn&#8217;t really know how to fix the economy, and so the politicians can talk until they&#8217;re blue in the face about what they&#8217;re going to do to fix it &#8211; it probably won&#8217;t influence his vote all that much.</p>
<p>A good point from a person who was far more qualified than any of the other people in the room at the time to talk about finances.</p>
<p>And I agree!  I don&#8217;t know how to fix the budget.  I don&#8217;t know how to tackle crime.  I don&#8217;t know how to manage taxes and public spending. Most of the policies on offer sound good.</p>
<p>So I need politicians to be talking about more than those things.  I need bigger, bolder statements about what each party will do.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;d quite like them to be about the environment, creating a sustainable future, taxing the rich and giving to the poor, helping other countries out with aid and trade (sticking plasters) and international justice (to fix the root causes).</p>
<p>So, who&#8217;s talking about these things then?</p>
