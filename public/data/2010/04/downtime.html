<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Downtime</h1></header><main><p>Well, sorry folks, it&#8217;s been over a month. Which kinda counts as downtime for me I suppose. There was also&#8230;shock!!&#8230;downtime on the Blog caused by me fiddling with subdomains. <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-792-1' id='fnref-792-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(792)'>1</a></sup></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not been completely anti-social-networking, in fact, I&#8217;ve been pretty busy building WordPress blogs/sites and doing some web/communications/social media consultancy, and that&#8217;s been taking up a lot of my &#8216;spare&#8217; time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been deliberately cryptic about some stuff that&#8217;s been going on, and I know I keep promising some news, but it&#8217;s hard to know what to make public and when&#8230;I&#8217;m getting there&#8230;honest.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there will be some posts about the garden, which is springing to life, and about politics&#8230;there&#8217;s some big vote or something happening soon and it&#8217;s being thought and talked about quite a bit.</p>
<p>Exciting times!!!   </p>
