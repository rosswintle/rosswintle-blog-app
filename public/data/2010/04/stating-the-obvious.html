<p>So, Labour have announced 5 main pledges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secure the recovery</li>
<li>Raise family living standards</li>
<li>Build a high-tech economy</li>
<li>Protect frontline services</li>
<li>Strengthen fairness in communities</li>
</ul>
<p>I like these pledges.  They are good.  But&#8230;well&#8230;isn&#8217;t this the bare minimum that our politicians should be doing?  I mean, the opposites of these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secure the continuation of the recession</li>
<li>Lower family living standards</li>
<li>Maintain a low-tech economy</li>
<li>Damage frontline services</li>
<li>Weaken fairness in communities</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, so I don&#8217;t really thing the Tories will be stating that they&#8217;re keen to do any of those &#8211; even though some of their policies might?</p>
<p>What do the Tories offer then?</p>
<ul>
<li>Act now on debt to get the economy moving</li>
<li>Get Britain working by boosting enterprise</li>
<li>Make Britain the most family-friendly country in Europe</li>
<li>Back the NHS</li>
<li>Raise standards in schools</li>
<li>Change politics</li>
</ul>
<p>Ooh, ooh.  &#8220;Change politics&#8221;&#8230;something Labour aren&#8217;t doing?  Though, change politics in which ways, it&#8217;s all a bit vague right? <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-799-1' id='fnref-799-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(799)'>1</a></sup>.  But really not much different.</p>
<p>So who&#8217;s going to stand up and say something bold, new and different.  Who&#8217;s got the big ideas that are going to lead Britain well in the next four years?  Who&#8217;s going to do more than the bare minimum I expect of my government?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see much on offer from these two.</p>
