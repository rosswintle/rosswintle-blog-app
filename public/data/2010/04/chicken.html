<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Chicken</h1></header><main><p>Imagine the scene.  You&#8217;re heading to work on your bicycle and you&#8217;ve just turned right into<a title="Google Street View - Penzance Drive, Swindon" href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Swindon,+Wiltshire+SN2+2HG,+United+Kingdom&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=51.562473,-1.79912&amp;panoid=Ood2lWrl0q-uX_DgISkDvw&amp;cbp=12,235.21,,1,4.62&amp;source=embed&amp;ll=51.562412,-1.799033&amp;spn=0,0.013797&amp;t=h&amp;z=16" target="_blank"> this very friendly looking bit of &#8220;Bus and Cycle Only&#8221; road</a>.</p>
<p>Now imagine that, at the bus stop on the right is a parked, single-decker bus, letting on passengers, and approaching behind it is a bright yellow, double-decker school bus.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about 8:40am and it&#8217;s a quaint picture of Swindon in the morning &#8220;rush&#8221; hour.</p>
<p><!--more-->And then&#8230;</p>
<p>The (empty-apart-from-its-driver) double-decker school bus, probably returning to the depot, doesn&#8217;t stop behind the parked bus.  No!  It pulls out to go around it, speeds up and engages with you in a life-or-death game of chicken!  Bike-against-bus.  Let&#8217;s see who wins!</p>
<p>This is the situation I&#8217;ve found myself in twice in the last week.  Today, the driver of the yellow bus didn&#8217;t seem to even see me.  He was looking at the bus he was passing, presumably trying to wave to his &#8220;mate&#8221; driving the stationery bus.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the bus-stop on the left has a little lay-by to pull into and you can pull into this and get out of the way of the oncoming public transport.</p>
<p>I have today written to Thamesdown Transport asking them to have a word with the drivers of their fleet of yellow school buses to tell them to take a little more care when overtaking&#8230;maybe looking at what&#8217;s coming the other way might help?</p>
<p>Maybe some proper pictures tomorrow?</p>
