<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Update on Chicken with Buses</h1></header><main><p>All credit to Thamesdown Transport.  My little email describing the dangerous overtaking got a more-than-satisfactory response from the bus company today.  In fact, the woman in customer services got quite zealous wanting to &#8220;hold a full and thorough investigation&#8221;, &#8220;trace the bus&#8221;, &#8220;examine CCTV footage&#8221; and &#8220;deal with the matter via our internal disciplinary procedures&#8221;.</p>
<p>Woah&#8230;hold on there.  No one was hurt, and I didn&#8217;t want to blame anyone, I just wanted to achieve a little education about a potentially dangerous spot, and that&#8217;s what they are going to do&#8230;in fact, the Operations Manager has agreed to do this as a matter of urgency&#8221;.</p>
<p>It may be that this doesn&#8217;t actually achieve much, but if one bus driver reads a poster and as a result chooses not to do something silly that endangers a smaller, squishier road user, then something good has happened.</p>
<p>Seriously, I&#8217;d like to personally and publicly thank Thamesdown Transport for a quick, thorough, and highly professional response.  I&#8217;m really quite impressed.</p>
