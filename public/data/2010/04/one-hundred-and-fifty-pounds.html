<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Conservatives have outlined their plans to give four million married couples and civil partners an annual £150 tax break.&#8221; (Source: <a title="BBC News" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8612000/8612792.stm" target="_blank">BBC</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m a strong family man.  I love my wife <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-801-1' id='fnref-801-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(801)'>1</a></sup> and think that commited relationships expressed in the declaration and execution of the promises of marriage <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-801-2' id='fnref-801-2' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(801)'>2</a></sup> is an important part of society.</p>
<p>But £150?  What does that achieve?  Are people supposed to say &#8220;Hey, there&#8217;s a great tax break&#8230;let&#8217;s get married!&#8221; in response to the promise of £150?</p>
<p>Come on Tories, stop pledging to waste my money and come up with some ideas that will really fix society!!</p>
