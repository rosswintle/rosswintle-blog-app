<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Not a mornings person</h1></header><main><p>So I&#8217;m trying to reclaim my cyclist image slightly after a bad winter and start to the year. My documented 20-mile ride on Monday was good, so I tried to follow it up with my 9-mile extended commute today.</p>
<p>Now, I love the thought of mornings. I love the crisp, fresh air, the quietness and the glow you get from the knowledge that you&#8217;re up and about when everyone else is still in bed <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-810-1' id='fnref-810-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(810)'>1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Yes, psychologically I&#8217;m a mornings person.</p>
<p>Physiologically, however, I&#8217;m definitely NOT a mornings person. Physical activity always feels much harder in the morning and I always seem to start waking up again at about 10:30pm.</p>
<p>So after getting down to wearing shorts, short-sleeves, sunglasses and fingerless mitts earlier in the week, I struggled into work today in longs, and my winter gloves and arrived feeling pretty worn out.</p>
<p>The sun&#8217;s come out though and I&#8217;m looking forward to a lunch-fuelled dash home. It&#8217;s always so much easier!</p>
