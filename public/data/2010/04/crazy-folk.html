<p>Folks, I know that last Saturday I appeared to be repeatedly filling a watering can, trudging up the garden path, and emptying its contents over an already-waterlogged garden&#8230;in the pouring rain&#8230;wearing a waterproof.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not, despite what conclusions you may have drawn, gone mad. This is merely another of the odd activities that being a gardening family means we need to engage in.  In this case I was distributing NemaSlug, an all-natural pest control product that kills slugs without harming children, pets, or other wildlife.</p>
<p>We thank you for bearing with our apparent madness.</p>
