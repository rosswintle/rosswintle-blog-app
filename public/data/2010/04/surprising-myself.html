<p>But the reality is that, other than one extended, 9-mile ride, I&#8217;ve not done more than a 3.5-mile commute this year.</p>
<p>So when I set out on a ride this evening after work it was a little tentatively.  But I clocked nearly 20 miles in just over an hour averaging 16.9mph!  If that&#8217;s my base level of strength and fitness then I wonder what I could achieve if I tried!</p>
