<p>No.  I actually have something literally brewing.</p>
<p>Last Christmas (2008!) I got given, by one of my Godsons, a Ginger Beer kit.  It&#8217;s been sat in a cupboard doing nothing for ages, even though I love Ginger Beer.</p>
<p>During a recent tidy-up it came out of the cupboard and I decided to get it started.</p>
<p>I sterilised a nice old wide-necked wine bottle, boiled and cooled some water and added the yeast, sugar and ginger.  I&#8217;ve been nurturing the plant quite zealously, but needed some additional equipment to finish the job.</p>

<p>Fortunately, while visiting friends in Durham, we made a trip to Whitley Bay <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-775-1' id='fnref-775-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(775)'>1</a></sup> where there is a fantastic home-brewing shop that seemed much bigger inside than out <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-775-2' id='fnref-775-2' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(775)'>2</a></sup>.  While my friends and wife looked on I was given a fascinating lesson in home brewing by a wonderful, informative-but-not-at-all-patronising man &#8211; you don&#8217;t get customer service like that much these days!</p>
<p>I left Whitley Bay with some bottles, some corks, a small brewing bin, some sterilising powder, and a 25p muslin sock.</p>
<p>On return to Swindon I fed the plant once more and then, the next day, sieved the plant, added lemon juice and sugar and bottled the beer.  While that&#8217;s maturing the plant has been restarted!  I thought I&#8217;d killed it at first but it&#8217;s definitely still alive and responds well to being fed.</p>

<p>Oh, and, OK, I confess, I&#8217;ve tried some and, even half-matured, it&#8217;s delicious!  Though I&#8217;m not sure how much that&#8217;s because I made it.</p>
<p>The home-brew shop experience was interesting.  A whole other world of potential geekiness.  I can see how/why people could get hooked on brewing.  My brew is precious and needs tending and my attention is rewarded.</p>
<p>So, what an I brew next?!?</p>
