<p>I <a title="Car Parks and Council Cash" href="2009/10/car-parks-and-council-cash/" target="_self">previously questioned the logic of that</a> back in September.</p>
<p>Now, I understand the economics and I agree that it&#8217;s good to get people into town, but, as always, isn&#8217;t throwing the money at car usage incredibly short sighted?  Here&#8217;s a few reasons why (most of them repeated from last time):<br />
<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li>Encouraging people to travel into town in cars increases congestion and make travel less pleasant for everyone.</li>
<li>There are lots of people (e.g. students, the elderly, those with financial problems) who don&#8217;t drive and who won&#8217;t be helped into the town centre by this.</li>
<li>It increases pollution.</li>
<li>It affirms the car as the most important travel option.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a less healthy option.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the meantime, Park and Rides have been closed and the already-expensive bus services cut.</p>
<p>To add insult to all this, the <a title="Change4Life" href="http://swindon.gov.uk/challengeswindon/active_swindon_strategy-2.htm" target="_blank">Change4Life </a>team were out in town last Saturday with their message of &#8220;Eat Well, Move More and Live Longer&#8221; &#8211; right outside the two main car parks too!  So if you took advantage of the cheap parking and drove to town you would have been confronted with a load of people wanting you to &#8220;gain big health benefits by making small lifestyle changes&#8221; &#8211; presumably one of which is to walk or cycle to places instead of use the car.</p>
<p>I just wish they&#8217;d make up their minds.  Do that want Swindon to be a healthy, sustainable city?  Because if they do then they really need to be wholehearted and a little more creative in their approach to fixing the economic problems.</p>
