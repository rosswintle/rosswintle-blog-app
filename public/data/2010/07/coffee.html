<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Coffee!</h1></header><main><p>I like my coffee &#8211; it&#8217;s widely known that I despise that dirty water some call &#8220;tea&#8221; &#8211; and over time it&#8217;s become clear that espresso, and espresso-based coffees &#8211; are by far my favourite.</p>
<p>So when I got some nice birthday money, I decided that now was the time, and a shiny new espresso machine now sits on our kitchen worktop.</p>
<p><!--more-->I love, not just the coffee, but the routine of setting up, brewing, steaming, cleaning, and of course, drinking.  It&#8217;s easier to use and clean than a hob-top pot too.</p>
<p>Partly inspired by <a title="Julie Boggle: Latte Art" href="http://blog.firstsolo.net/index.php/2009/08/latte-art/">my friends&#8217; attempts</a> the aim, with some practice, is to try and produce some latte art.</p>
<p>Oh, and it may make good coffee, but surely the BIGGEST bonus is frothy, steamed-milk hot chocolate.  Mmmm mmmmm!</p>
