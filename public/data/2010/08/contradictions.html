<p>Today, on the same page of A4 news I saw the same company announcing:</p>
<ul>
<li> the closure of a building as part of their drive towards reducing carbon emissions;</li>
<li>that you could be driving a new SUV by September!</li>
</ul>
<p>More disjointed thinking on sustainability there then.Â  When will the people in charge realise that you can&#8217;t just do the odd bit here and there &#8211; you need consistency or people will see right through your greenwash!</p>
