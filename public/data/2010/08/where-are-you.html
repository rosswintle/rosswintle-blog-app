<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Where are you?!</h1></header><main><p>I don&#8217;t think anyone really has social media sussed out yet, but you can probably tell that I&#8217;m enjoying being part of the experiment and taking a great interest.  One thing I&#8217;ve never understood though is Geolocation services.</p>
<p>From the moment I first heard of <a title="Google Latitude" href="http://google.com/latitude" target="_self">Google Latitude</a> I wondered why on Earth I&#8217;d want to tell the world where I was.  Surely that was dangerous?  People could a) find me (maybe that&#8217;s the point?) b) know when I&#8217;m not at home and that my place was safe to break into without disturbing me.</p>
<p>No, other than last-night&#8217;s bike ride, I&#8217;m usually telling people where I&#8217;ve been rather than where I&#8217;m going or where I am, and I&#8217;d recommend others with any kind of public social media footprint to do the same.</p>
<p>Latitude has been followed, seemingly very successfully, by services like <a title="foursquare" href="http://foursquare.com" target="_blank">foursquare</a> and <a title="Gowalla" href="http://gowalla.com" target="_blank">Gowalla</a>, and today, in the USA at least, Facebook are joing the club with <a title="Facebook Places" href="http://facebook.com/places" target="_blank">Facebook Places</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s had some minor criticism for privacy issues, but I think they&#8217;ve actually got it right this time.  It&#8217;s an opt-in service; you&#8217;re notified when people &#8220;tag&#8221; you as being in a location; you can delete location tags; and the default is to only show your location tags to your friends.  They&#8217;re trying to do something possibly kinda useful, but, privacy wise, it&#8217;s a pretty safe starting point.  Read more about <a title="Facebook Places - How it Works - The Guardian" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/aug/19/facebook-places-how-it-works" target="_blank">how it works in the Guardian</a>, and <a title="How to Disable Facebook Places - Lifehacker" href="http://lifehacker.com/5616395/how-to-disable-facebook-places" target="_blank">how to disable it on Lifehacker</a>.</p>
<p>But I still don&#8217;t get it, and I&#8217;m frustrated that with all the technology we have I still can&#8217;t do one really simple geolocation thing that I&#8217;d like to do occasionally when trying to meet up with friends in unfamiliar places&#8230;I&#8217;d like to just be able to send my location from my mobile phone to a specific person so that they can find me.  Can I do that with any of these services?  And if not, who&#8217;s going to develop it for me?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on Geolocation?  Useful?  Dangerous?  Which services do you use and why?</p>
