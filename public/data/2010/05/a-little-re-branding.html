<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">A Little Re-branding</h1></header><main><p>We are now, hopefully, post-<a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2010/05/a-crisis-of-identity/">identity-crisis</a>, and if you follow me on Twitter you&#8217;ll have picked up on that, but a few other things are changing as a result of that too.</p>
<p>I do like my &#8220;magicroundabout&#8221; identity, but this Blog&#8217;s title is (was!) a bit cumbersome and&#8230;well&#8230;I&#8217;ve not been happy with it for a long time.  It suited the first few years of life here in Swindon but we&#8217;re pretty settled now and, while I still discover new things often, my writing is less about &#8220;discovering new things in an old home&#8221;.</p>
<p><!--more-->I spent some time thinking about how I might retain the &#8220;magicroundabout&#8221; theme while also signifying that I&#8217;ve moved on, and making the name simpler in the process.  I&#8217;ve settled on the subtle double-meaning of &#8216;Which Way Now?: Notes from Swindon &#8211; home of  the Magic Roundabout&#8217;.</p>
<p>At some point I&#8217;ll refresh the blogs&#8217; theme and revamp the static pages a little.</p>
<p>Thanks, as always, for reading and contributing.</p>
