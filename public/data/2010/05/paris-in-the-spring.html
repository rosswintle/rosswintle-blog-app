<p>It was an amazing few days.  I totally chilled out.  Anyone who knows me knows that I think a lot and I didn&#8217;t think about much at all&#8230;not about church, not about work, not about technology, not (much) about cycling.  I confess, I thought quite a bit about food, but that&#8217;s France for you, and we talked a bit about politics too.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t normally travel well, but France is OK because I know the lingo pretty well, and in a city it&#8217;s easy to find food and drink and pretty much anything else that you need, at pretty much any time of day.</p>
<p>We went on the train to London and Eurostar to Paris&#8230;so much nicer than flying.  We stayed in a Hotel on the southern edge of the Latin Quarter and found lots of reasonable-quality, cheap food on Rue Moufftard, which helped keep costs down a bit &#8211; in fact, I loved Rue Moufftard, it was the quintessential trendy French street.</p>
<p>The weather was perfect, and we walked our socks off exploring the city, and generally had a really relaxed and fun time.</p>
<p>Some more specific thoughts will follow, but generally, visiting Paris was good, going by train was good, staying in the Latin Quarter was good.</p>
<p>Oh, and being married for 5 years has also been very, very good!</p>
