<p>&#8220;It&#8221;s been a tough week, cycling wise. Last night I  was feeling fragile and rethinking if I should be cycling on roads, cycling in Swindon feels unsafe right now and that makes me sad. What can I do? I shouted through 2 windows and reported a police driver but apart from individually educating as many people as I can, what can I do to make people give cyclists respect and space??&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had numerous close calls this week. At least one incident each day (apart from today.  I&#8217;ve not been hit or hurt at all, but the sheer lack of space and thoughfulness on the part of drivers has really shaken me up to the point where I&#8217;m really considering my options.</p>
<p>Then @t1mmyb quoted (so he thinks) Benjamin Franklin who said: &#8220;Those who sacrifice a little liberty for temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety&#8221;.  I&#8217;m not sure if he directed that at me at all, or if he had his own reasons for quoting it, but it made me think.</p>
<p>I could give in.  I could revert to using cycle paths more and stay away from cars.  I could sacrifice my right to be on the road.  I could give up the wonderful freedom of being able to cycle fast and direct routes.  I could do all this for my safety.  But should I be giving up my rights and my freedom?</p>
<p>Today was better.  I did a half-decent ride up to Elcombe and back via Croft Road and Old Town &#8211; 11 or so hilly miles.  One guy held back, gave me loads of room and accepted my thankful wave with a smile as he passed.  Someone else in a residential area was very helpful.  My faith in the majority of road users was restored slightly.</p>
<p>I will write more on this topic. I still feel fragile and the events of this week have spurred me to action.  But I might need help.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the folks who gave support and encouraged me in little ways.  And if you read anything I wrote and gave a cyclist a bit more room when passing in your car then, really, thank you.  Please spread the word &#8211; cyclists need space on the road, and if you give it us you might get a cheery wave of thanks and the warm glow that you made Swindon a safer place.</p>
