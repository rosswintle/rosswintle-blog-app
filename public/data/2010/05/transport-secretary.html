<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Transport Secretary</h1></header><main><p>Now, the London Evening Standard is not my favourite newspaper by a long way, and I suspect some element of bias in the writing, but <a title="London Evening Standard - Transport Secretary prefers to travel by Jaguar than cycle London's streets" href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23838800-my-jags-a-joy-but-cycling-in-london-ive-never-braved-it.do" target="_blank">this article</a>, a brief interview with Phillip Hammond, the new Transport Secretary, caught my attention and is worth comment.</p>

<p>Firstly, I have no problem with anyone owning a nice car or enjoying driving, but to use the fact that &#8220;the car was the greenest in its class&#8221; to justify yourself as &#8220;taking safety and the environment deeply seriously&#8221; is nonsense.  The Jaguar XJ comes with either a 3.0 or 5.0 litre engine.  If you took the environment &#8220;deeply seriously&#8221; then you&#8217;d make some sacrifices to make your point &#8211; you&#8217;d give up your personal desire to own a nice car and buy something smaller.</p>
<p>Second, the article says that &#8220;he does not seem keen on walking to work, pointing out that his&#8230; ministerial office&#8230;is &#8216;a good 10 minutes hoof&#8217; to Westminster Tube Station&#8221; and that he &#8220;has been picked up by a government driver in a Honda  Civic from home in Pimlico,  a 30-minute walk from his office&#8221;.</p>
<p>Hang on.  He lives a 30-minute walk from his  office and it&#8217;s 10 minutes walk from the tube? Lots of people would LOVE to live that close to where they work so that they could walk or cycle.  10- or 30-minutes walk is nothing and would be very good for you, it&#8217;s not an excuse to use a car.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s another reason that he doesn&#8217;t cycle: “I&#8217;ve never actually cycled in London&#8230;I&#8217;d have to take a deep breath. I think you need to know what you are  doing to cycle in London.”</p>
<p>Well there you go then Mr Phillips &#8211; you&#8217;re transport secretary and you won&#8217;t cycle because it&#8217;s too dangerous.  I think you have identified one of the key problems that you need to sort out.  We need to make cycling a safe and viable form of transport for more people &#8211; including government ministers.</p>
<p>Sitting in your nice Jag or Honda, watching cyclists and walkers go by isn&#8217;t going to help, you&#8217;ll need to get out, join them, take up the cause, start taking the environment and safety &#8220;deeply seriously&#8221; and do your bit to help.</p>
<p>The article may well be biased, but it seems that Mr Phillips has a lot of changes to make himself as well as on behalf of the country.</p>
