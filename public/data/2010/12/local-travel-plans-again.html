<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Local Travel Plans (again)</h1></header><main><p>I wrote <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2010/03/local-travel-plan-3/">a long reflection on Swindon\&#8217;s Local Travel Plan</a> a while back.  Thanks to the <a title="Swindon BUG" href="http://www.swindonbug.co.uk/">Swindon Bicycle User Group</a> I&#8217;ve been made aware that consultation on the plan is open.  Responses have to be in by January the 4th.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t say much more at this point, but if you have any kind of interest in travel and transport I&#8217;d encourage you to have a go at reading the plan and making a response.</p>
<p>The draft plan comprises:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>overarching strategy</strong> to 2026</li>
<li><strong>Supplementary documents</strong> covering key topics &#8211; walking, cycling, public transport, freight, road safety, network management, smarter choices, parking and rural issues</li>
</ul>
<p>An implementation plan will follow in early 2011 once the funding position becomes clear.</p>
