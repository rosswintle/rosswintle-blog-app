Me?<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Yes, I know how this will sound. It will sound like the sad complainings of a person with no friends. And it will sound like a &#8216;Hey, look at me&#8217; post too. But it&#8217;s not either of those. I&#8217;m too old to be bothered about such things now and this is merely an observation and a musing on how technology is changing things.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday was my birthday. And, relative to other people i know, I had surprisingly few happy birthday messages. And by messages I mostly mean people writing or commenting on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Some people pointed out that I didn&#8217;t allow others to see when my birthday was. There&#8217;s a whole post that, frankly I don&#8217;t have time to write, about Facebook&#8217;s complicated security settings and the fact that I had no idea that this was the case. I still don&#8217;t actually know if I&#8217;ve fixed that.<\/p>\n<p>And someone else even said: &#8216;I&#8217;m going to write this in my calendar seeing as you&#8217;re keeping this information from Facebook&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>I observe that two things have changed.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The means by which people are reminded about birthdays<\/strong>. People now depend on Facebook for this information &#8211; at least, for the subset of their contacts that are on Facebook and have their privacy set up right.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The means by which people wish each other a happy birthday. <\/strong>For many people a card is no longer necessary. \u00a0This has an up side: you can probably wish many more people a happy birthday than you previously did. \u00a0And a down-side: because it&#8217;s easier to do it somehow &#8211; in my head at least &#8211; has less value.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I&#8217;m torn about whether or not this is a good thing. \u00a0It&#8217;s hugely convenient, but does it de-value the interaction we have with each other over occasions? \u00a0And that&#8217;s a geuine question&#8230;does it? \u00a0In my heart I think it does, but I can&#8217;t think of any real reason why. \u00a0Of course, I&#8217;m delighted that lots of people can now very easily be reminded of my birthday and very easily wish me a happy one. \u00a0And I too make use of that convenience to celebrate other peoples&#8217; special days too.<\/p>\n<p>However, I note this fact&#8230;it now seems that it&#8217;s my responsibility to publish the fact that it&#8217;s my birthday. \u00a0This is a new piece of knowledge to me. \u00a0I&#8217;ve always assumed that people put these things in their calendars anyway. \u00a0That assumption has been challenged.<\/p>\n<p>What other assumptions that I have about the world might have changed because of social media? \u00a0What else don&#8217;t I know that I don&#8217;t know?<\/p>\n",
