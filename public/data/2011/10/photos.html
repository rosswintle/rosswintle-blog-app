<p>Despite the leanings of my family and any amount of nature or nurture I&#8217;ve never been much of a photographer.  However, this year, with Sally getting a DSLR and with me exploring photography apps on my iPhone (which has a remarkably good camera), my interest has been growing.</p>
<p>Also this year, one friend took up a picture-a-day challenge that he blogged, another new friend of mine attempts a photo a day, and someone else I know used <a title="BlipFoto Photo Journalling" href="http://blipfoto.com">BlipFoto </a>to document a foreign trip.</p>
<p>All of these things piqued my interest in photography, and having the phone with me pretty much everywhere I go means I&#8217;m taking quite a few snaps and, I think learning some composition.</p>
<p>So I wondered if photo-a-day might be a good challenge for me.  For one thing my blog needs more images. Plus, I&#8217;ve been preaching about media being important in social media strategy and SEO, so I ought to practice too.</p>
<p>I looked at BlipFoto for a photo journal but it has content rules that I don&#8217;t get on with (my photos with borders got taken down&#8230;no <a title="Hipstamatic" href="http://hipstamatic.com/">Hipstamatic</a>?!), so I&#8217;m going to self host here.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t expect me to post every day. Do expect me to cheat, with the aforementioned Hipstamatic, and the newly discovered <a title="Noir App" href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/noir-photo/id429484353?mt=8">Noir</a> bringing my amateur shots to life.  Don&#8217;t hesitate to comment. But do be nice and constructive if you can.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
