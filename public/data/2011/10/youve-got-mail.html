<p>In similar vein to the last pic, this one shows code. But it&#8217;s specific code. This is an email header: the writing on the envelope, the stamp, the &#8216;return to sender&#8217;, that gets you message from sender to recipient.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working a lot with emails in the last couple of days, trying to find the best way to decode this complex structure.</p>
<p>The main challenge with this photo: not including any sensitive data!!</p>
