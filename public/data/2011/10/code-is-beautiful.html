<p>I&#8217;m seeing a lot of this these days. I&#8217;ve seen plenty of attempts at photographing code and I do find something beautiful in it. Not always symmetry, but patterns emerge and individual characters blend together into broader &#8216;brush strokes&#8217; that appear.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not just static either: this is the engine room of that increasingly interactive place, the Internet!</p>
<p>The photo? I&#8217;ve seen these done with ultra-shallow depth of field, but I quite like it being deeper. It&#8217;s not a better effect, just different. The odd patterns created by capturing a screen on a digital camera bring texture too.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a gallery with another pic:</p>
