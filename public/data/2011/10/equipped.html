<p>A funny and trivial photo today. This isn&#8217;t about composition, lighting, effects, or depth of field. It&#8217;s all about taking coffee on your bike!</p>
<p>We went, with trepidation, to the National Childbirth Trust &#8216;nearly new&#8217; sale today. I suggested not taking the car as parking would be a nightmare and it&#8217;s easy cycling and walking distance. I was hugely proud that my 32-week pregnant and very lovely wife agreed to walk. I took the bike in case we bought something big&#8230;I could dash home and pick up wife and shopping without having to park.</p>
<p>Why the coffee? Well, we were told that queuing was a large part of the event.</p>
<p>That my travel mug fits my bottle cage was serendipity of the finest kind!</p>
