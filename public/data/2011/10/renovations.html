<p>We&#8217;ve been meaning to get some plastering done in our house for ages. Some of the previous renovations were a bit slap-dash! The impending arrival of baby Wintle has forced us to get a move on with the home improvements.</p>
<p>This photo shows the old and new. Capturing the colours and textures of the plaster was hard, so I opted for an abstract shot of some contrasts.</p>
<p>Quite pleasing! (Both the plastering and the photo!)</p>
