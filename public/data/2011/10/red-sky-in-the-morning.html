<p>This is actually from a couple of days ago. I love sun-sets and sun-rises and am mostly of the opinion that they&#8217;re not worth photographing. They are beautiful, temporary, unique, ephemeral, and are better enjoyed in the moment. Plus, the photo never does it justice. However, occasionally I still try and capture it. On this particular day I wished I was atop a tall hill and could see for miles, but I tried to make the best of what I had: nice thirds, make a point of the telegraph pole, etc. not bad.</p>
