<p>A bit behind on daily pictures. This from Sunday as I completed the third coat of paint on the ceiling of our lounge, which we&#8217;ve had re-plastered.</p>
<p>I like the abstract-ness, and the weird dark patch that the iPhone&#8217;s HDR produced. And I like the smooth, white ceiling we now have too! ðŸ™‚</p>
