<p>Last night we did a bit of TV catchup and saw the jungle episode of the BBC&#8217;s brilliant &#8216;Human Planet&#8217;. And while the programme as a whole was extraordinary what got me was the little &#8216;the making of&#8217; documentary at the end.</p>
<p>For those that missed it they&#8217;d done a section on a tribe of people who, with primitive tools, had built a tree house&#8230;in a 35m-high tree!!  The tribesmen climbed to the treetops using  no more than sticks and vines and strength and stamina. Yet, in the making-of we see the BBC crew all safety-harnessed up with lines and backup lines, helmets, etc.</p>
<p>At the end they interviewed one of the crew. What had he learned from his visit?</p>
<p>&#8220;I judge my own inadequacies against their expertise and knowledge. You come here and you&#8217;ve got boots in case of snake bites, we&#8217;ve got sun cream on because of the sun, you know, you&#8217;ve got twin safety ropes to make sure if one fails you get caught by the other one. And these guys, OK maybe they have a higher mortality rate but they&#8217;re much freer in their lifestyle. You know they&#8217;ll shimmy up and down these trees. I think I&#8217;d much rather live a shorter, fuller life like they do out here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sometimes rules and safety measures give you freedom. Other times they take it away. Perhaps not having a safety rope stops us climbing the tree!</p>
<p>Leaving my stable, secure job to pursue something more interesting has been like that. I still wonder what the heck I&#8217;ve done sometimes and check if my safety ropes are ok. But I also have days when I&#8217;ve shimmied higher than ever and can see the view unfolding.</p>
