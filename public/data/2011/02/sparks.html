<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about how my journey to leaving my job started.  It&#8217;s funny how a few words can have such a profound effect on your life.</p>
<h2><!--more-->Creative?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve never really considered myself to be &#8220;creative&#8221;.  I&#8217;d always associated creativity with &#8220;doing art&#8221;, visual things, physical crafts.   Stuff that I&#8217;m generally not good at.</p>
<p>We have some good friends who&#8217;ve known me for years, and we&#8217;ve had many conversations with them about creativity.  But it was only when they took us out for a meal and brought along two of their friends who we&#8217;d only met once before, that a change of mind began.</p>
<p>These two people, who hardly knew me, refused to believe that I was not creative.  I don&#8217;t think it was specifically me, they believed in the creativity present in every person.</p>
<p>That conversation was the start of a change in my worldview, my thinking not only about myself, but about everyone.  And the start of a journey that will probably result in huge changes in my life.</p>
<h2>Making Stuff</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned that creativity is not just painting and drawing, or pottery, or making films or music.  Creativity is a more general concept&#8230;making stuff.</p>
<p>This knowledge has been incredibly freeing for me, because, the truth is, I love to make stuff.  Not necessarily physical things, but&#8230;and yes I know how much of a geek I will sound when I say this&#8230;I love to make computer programs!</p>
<p>From little scripts that make repetitive everyday tasks quick and simple to big web applications that store lots of important configuration data.  I thrive on the challenge of solving the logic puzzles of coding and producing tools that make people&#8217;s (mine and other&#8217;s) jobs and lives easier.</p>
<p>And more recently I&#8217;ve had the bonus pleasure of working with some great designers to bring some designs to life as real working websites.  So, though I may not be very visually creative myself, I can feel like I&#8217;m making something not just practical, but beautiful too.</p>
<h2>Learning Graphics</h2>
<p>Things have now come full-circle as well.  Not only do I acknowledge and embrace my creativity, I want to be more creative!  I desire more and different kinds of creativity.  I find myself wanting to be able to design and understand the visually creative process too.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve been playing with Photoshop and Illustrator, soaking up design blogs and website galleries and praying for the gift of visual creativity.</p>
<h2>Where now?</h2>
<p>So where has all this lead?  Well, that little conversation in a restaurant with two people I hardly know planted the seeds of change that resulted in me quitting my job &#8211; where I don&#8217;t get to make stuff &#8211; to pursue a career where I do.</p>
<p>And guess what? I&#8217;m even finding the process of working out what&#8217;s next a creative one too.  I&#8217;m not just making &#8220;stuff&#8221;, I&#8217;m making the rest of my life!</p>
