<p>I cannot tell you what a gaff it&#8217;s been to reinstate this light after having our ceiling re-plastered. I think this was the fifth attempt. Failures I recall are:</p>
<p>1. Not cutting a hole for the rose.<br />
2. Running out of arm strength because I was too stupid to remove the glass bowls.<br />
3. Wiring it wrong.<br />
4. Not having long enough screws to reach the joists through the new, thicker plaster layer.</p>
<p>And this wasn&#8217;t even the thing that got me electrocuted&#8230;that&#8217;s a WHOLE other story!!!</p>
<p>Photographically, an unusual angle can turn a relatively simple object into a thing of beauty. Different angles gave different exposures. Here&#8217;s some different views:</p>
