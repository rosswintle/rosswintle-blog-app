        "rendered": "<p>Earlier today I tweeted as follows:<\/p>\n<p>[blackbirdpie url=&#8221;https:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/magicroundabout\/status\/133945796117790720&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p>And&#8230;it turns out, several people were intrigued. \u00a0So I ought to explain myself in full.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>The National Childbirth Trust<\/h2>\n<p>Yeah, yeah, you all know, we&#8217;re having a baby (real soon!) right.<\/p>\n<p>We decided, after some good feedback from friends and family, to go on the National Childbirth Trust&#8217;s ante-natal class. \u00a0This is worthy of a post of its own, but in general was very good.<\/p>\n<p>One of the sessions was dedicated to breastfeeding. \u00a0We won&#8217;t mention the fact that I got to wear lipstick. \u00a0We WILL mention the fact that it was run by a knowledgeable woman who obviously cared greatly about the welfare of women and babies at what can be a very stressful time. \u00a0She said &#8220;if you have any problems, call me any time, we can give you help and I can come around and help you work out what&#8217;s going wrong and how you might be able to make things easier&#8221; &#8211; or words to that effect.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s true. We have her number. We can call. She will help. She reinforced the fact: &#8220;call me, I want to help&#8221;. The course tutor reinforced the fact &#8220;call her, she wants to help&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>What a fantastic service! And she, and the team of breastfeeding counsellors in Swindon (and, I believe, around the country) are 100% voluntary.<\/p>\n<h2>So What&#8217;s Breastfeeding Got To Do With Cycling?<\/h2>\n<p>I was impressed by this. Very impressed. And it got me thinking. \u00a0Here&#8217;s someone who:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>passionately believes that a particular activity is good<\/li>\n<li>understands that that activity isn&#8217;t always simple\/easy<\/li>\n<li>longs to help others take up and sustain that activity<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m like that. \u00a0I&#8217;m like that about cycling. \u00a0Many of the regular readers of this blog are like that about cycling too.<\/p>\n<p>And so I find myself thinking, what if we had &#8220;Cycling Counsellors&#8221;?<\/p>\n<p>What if there were people you could call and ask questions like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I&#8217;m thinking of buying a bike, what sort of bike should I get?<\/li>\n<li>How can I easily get from A to B on my bicycle &#8211; I don&#8217;t know the safest\/quickest way<\/li>\n<li>What simple safety checks should I do to my bike every now and then? How hard are they? Can I do them myself?<\/li>\n<li>My tyre&#8217;s flat\/chain&#8217;s come off\/handlebars wobble\/brakes aren&#8217;t very good, what should I do?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Why Not?<\/h2>\n<p>I mostly had very positive responses to this idea. I think it&#8217;s a good one. But I, myself have questions about it, and some people pointed out some useful things.<\/p>\n<h4>It&#8217;s all online!<\/h4>\n<p>There&#8217;s masses of books, internet forums, blogs, Twitter accounts, bike shops anyway. Don&#8217;t these provide that service?<\/p>\n<p>Yes, to some extent they do. And, in particular, there&#8217;s LOADS of good information online.<\/p>\n<p>But despite reading lots of books, articles, blogs, and so on, about birth, parenting, and breastfeeding, Sally and I still found the one-to-one, practical, visual stuff in the NCT course massively valuable. And exploring some of the issues and difficulties with other, real people has been really important.<\/p>\n<p>I think there&#8217;s a lot to be said for personal, local knowledge. <a title=\"A Boris Bike Adventure\" href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2011\/09\/a-boris-bike-adventure\/\">My experience of riding in London<\/a> is testimony to this. As is <a href=\"http:\/\/cityexile.wordpress.com\/2011\/09\/25\/second-class-citizen\/\">Town Mouse&#8217;s trip through Newcastle<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Surely someone else is doing it already?<\/h4>\n<p>This is a great question &#8211; and one of mine! But I don&#8217;t think they are. Councils do personal travel planning, explaining to people their travel options. CTC have local groups, but, from what I understand, they&#8217;re mostly about social rides and for already-experienced cyclists (though I&#8217;m sure novices would be welcome too). Sustrans have rangers who look after paths, and maintain the national cycle network. And I&#8217;ve heard of Bike Buddy things where you can get someone to show you a route for your commute.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s no centrally co-ordinated, trained, recognised means of doing such a thing. Is there?! (Please comment if you know something I don&#8217;t).<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure it would be great to get CTC, Sustrans and local councils to take up this idea. But, to my knowledge, no one&#8217;s doing it yet.<\/p>\n<h4>Is it needed\/wanted?<\/h4>\n<p>Who would take up such a service? How would they find out about it? Wouldn&#8217;t people abuse it as a way to get cheap bike maintenance?<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really know the answers to these questions. It&#8217;s just an embryonic idea. It would be great to tie in to personal travel planning projects that councils might be doing and to other local cycle\/transport projects that are going on. But&#8230;hmm&#8230;needs thought.<\/p>\n<h4>What are you going to do about it.<\/h4>\n<p>Ah, it&#8217;s just a flash-in-the-pan idea. I&#8217;ll forget about it in a few days time. And besides, I&#8217;m having a baby any day now.<\/p>\n<p>I dunno. What do you think? Is there mileage in this? Or is the notion of a nationally co-ordinated team of cycling counsellors a crazy dream?<\/p>\n",
