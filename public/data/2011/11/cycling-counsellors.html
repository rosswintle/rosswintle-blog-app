<p>[blackbirdpie url=&#8221;https://twitter.com/#!/magicroundabout/status/133945796117790720&#8243;]</p>
<p>And&#8230;it turns out, several people were intrigued.  So I ought to explain myself in full.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>The National Childbirth Trust</h2>
<p>Yeah, yeah, you all know, we&#8217;re having a baby (real soon!) right.</p>
<p>We decided, after some good feedback from friends and family, to go on the National Childbirth Trust&#8217;s ante-natal class.  This is worthy of a post of its own, but in general was very good.</p>
<p>One of the sessions was dedicated to breastfeeding.  We won&#8217;t mention the fact that I got to wear lipstick.  We WILL mention the fact that it was run by a knowledgeable woman who obviously cared greatly about the welfare of women and babies at what can be a very stressful time.  She said &#8220;if you have any problems, call me any time, we can give you help and I can come around and help you work out what&#8217;s going wrong and how you might be able to make things easier&#8221; &#8211; or words to that effect.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s true. We have her number. We can call. She will help. She reinforced the fact: &#8220;call me, I want to help&#8221;. The course tutor reinforced the fact &#8220;call her, she wants to help&#8221;.</p>
<p>What a fantastic service! And she, and the team of breastfeeding counsellors in Swindon (and, I believe, around the country) are 100% voluntary.</p>
<h2>So What&#8217;s Breastfeeding Got To Do With Cycling?</h2>
<p>I was impressed by this. Very impressed. And it got me thinking.  Here&#8217;s someone who:</p>
<ul>
<li>passionately believes that a particular activity is good</li>
<li>understands that that activity isn&#8217;t always simple/easy</li>
<li>longs to help others take up and sustain that activity</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m like that.  I&#8217;m like that about cycling.  Many of the regular readers of this blog are like that about cycling too.</p>
<p>And so I find myself thinking, what if we had &#8220;Cycling Counsellors&#8221;?</p>
<p>What if there were people you could call and ask questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m thinking of buying a bike, what sort of bike should I get?</li>
<li>How can I easily get from A to B on my bicycle &#8211; I don&#8217;t know the safest/quickest way</li>
<li>What simple safety checks should I do to my bike every now and then? How hard are they? Can I do them myself?</li>
<li>My tyre&#8217;s flat/chain&#8217;s come off/handlebars wobble/brakes aren&#8217;t very good, what should I do?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Not?</h2>
<p>I mostly had very positive responses to this idea. I think it&#8217;s a good one. But I, myself have questions about it, and some people pointed out some useful things.</p>
<h4>It&#8217;s all online!</h4>
<p>There&#8217;s masses of books, internet forums, blogs, Twitter accounts, bike shops anyway. Don&#8217;t these provide that service?</p>
<p>Yes, to some extent they do. And, in particular, there&#8217;s LOADS of good information online.</p>
<p>But despite reading lots of books, articles, blogs, and so on, about birth, parenting, and breastfeeding, Sally and I still found the one-to-one, practical, visual stuff in the NCT course massively valuable. And exploring some of the issues and difficulties with other, real people has been really important.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a lot to be said for personal, local knowledge. <a title="A Boris Bike Adventure" href="https://rosswintle.uk/2011/09/a-boris-bike-adventure/">My experience of riding in London</a> is testimony to this. As is <a href="http://cityexile.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/second-class-citizen/">Town Mouse&#8217;s trip through Newcastle</a>.</p>
<h4>Surely someone else is doing it already?</h4>
<p>This is a great question &#8211; and one of mine! But I don&#8217;t think they are. Councils do personal travel planning, explaining to people their travel options. CTC have local groups, but, from what I understand, they&#8217;re mostly about social rides and for already-experienced cyclists (though I&#8217;m sure novices would be welcome too). Sustrans have rangers who look after paths, and maintain the national cycle network. And I&#8217;ve heard of Bike Buddy things where you can get someone to show you a route for your commute.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s no centrally co-ordinated, trained, recognised means of doing such a thing. Is there?! (Please comment if you know something I don&#8217;t).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure it would be great to get CTC, Sustrans and local councils to take up this idea. But, to my knowledge, no one&#8217;s doing it yet.</p>
<h4>Is it needed/wanted?</h4>
<p>Who would take up such a service? How would they find out about it? Wouldn&#8217;t people abuse it as a way to get cheap bike maintenance?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really know the answers to these questions. It&#8217;s just an embryonic idea. It would be great to tie in to personal travel planning projects that councils might be doing and to other local cycle/transport projects that are going on. But&#8230;hmm&#8230;needs thought.</p>
<h4>What are you going to do about it.</h4>
<p>Ah, it&#8217;s just a flash-in-the-pan idea. I&#8217;ll forget about it in a few days time. And besides, I&#8217;m having a baby any day now.</p>
<p>I dunno. What do you think? Is there mileage in this? Or is the notion of a nationally co-ordinated team of cycling counsellors a crazy dream?</p>
