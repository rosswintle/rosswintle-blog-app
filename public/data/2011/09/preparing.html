<p>We&#8217;re having a baby! Have I told you that? Well, it&#8217;s really public but just not something that I&#8217;ve been writing about on here, despite it being a rather dominant feature of our lives right now.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the complete FAQ:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Do you know what it is?</strong></p>
<p>No we don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a boy or a girl. We were hoping for a giraffe because they can look after themselves after about 2 hours, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s likely.</p>
<p><strong>When&#8217;s it due?</strong></p>
<p>End of November/Beginning of December</p>
<p><strong>How&#8217;s Sally doing?</strong></p>
<p>She&#8217;s flippin&#8217; unbelievable. I mean, really, my respect for women grows almost daily when I see what she&#8217;s doing and how she&#8217;s coping with it. But she&#8217;s really well, thanks, and we&#8217;ve been massively fortunate in having a very uncomplicated pregnancy so far.</p>
<p><strong>Can I feel the bump?</strong></p>
<p>No. Unless you&#8217;re a close friend or family. Or&#8230;well&#8230;maybe if I can poke your stomach in return?</p>
<p><strong>Is it kicking yet?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Are you excited?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. It&#8217;s a whole mix of emotions though. I&#8217;m under no pretenses about what a hugely life changing thing this is, especially with me working from home and freelancing, the dynamic in the household is going to be quite odd. But we are excited and, I think, growing more so as the arrival approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Do you want to borrow/have our baby clothes/monitor/changer/dresser/re-usable nappies/car seat/buggy/pram/moses basket/etc&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Well, yes! Actually, we have been accumulating baby essentials. People have been very generous and we&#8217;ve managed a large degree of frugality by careful shopping, use of eBay and not being too picky and choosy. This is worthy of a blog post of it&#8217;s own.</p>
<p><strong>How are you doing?</strong></p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s a great question, thanks for asking.  I&#8217;m REALLY good, though not unaffected by the whole thing.  Sympathy eating is definitely an issue (I&#8217;m eating for two too!), and this post began with me wanting to post two videos.  Yes, they&#8217;re cheesy, yes they&#8217;re very clever bits of marketing, but it seems that I&#8217;ve definitely gone all gooey and hormonal myself &#8211; it&#8217;s not just Sally!  We sat and watched these Google Ads the other day and both ended up in a strange state of simultaneous laughter and tears. One can only hope that there&#8217;s LOTS more of both emotions to come!</p>
