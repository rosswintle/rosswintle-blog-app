<p>I was out cycling today and thinking about 9/11 &#8211; the ten year anniversary is coming up, of course.  For some reason I then thought of the &#8220;Cautionary Tale&#8221; by Hillaire Belloc called &#8220;Matilda&#8221;, which, for reasons I won&#8217;t go into, I have memorised.  If you don&#8217;t know it, <a title="Matilda" href="http://www.poetry-archive.com/b/matilda.html">go have a read</a>!</p>
<p>I think it was brought to mind by remembering the firemen of 9/11 which we saw a program about the other day. Says the poem:</p>
<blockquote><p>Within an hour the gallant band</p>
<p>were charging in on every hand</p>
<p>from Putney, Hackney Downs and Bow</p>
<p>with courage high and hearts a-glow.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyway, as I pedalled I put the two ideas together and started recomposing &#8220;Matilda&#8221; in light of 9/11.  I got this far&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Our George he had such thirst for oil</p>
<p>It made his country proud and spoiled</p>
<p>His dad, whose term some years ago</p>
<p>Had kept the price-per-barrel low</p>
<p>Apparently supported him</p>
<p>Their efforts, they changed everything</p>
<p>For once, towards the noon of day</p>
<p>Some terrorists grew tired of play</p>
<p>And finding they were not alone</p>
<p>Went planning terror quite unknown</p>
<p>They hijacked two innocent planes</p>
<p>And took the towers down in flames</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not quite the tribute to the firemen that I think I set out to produce, but it kinda works.</p>
<p>I think it should end:</p>
<blockquote><p>And later, when his troops returned</p>
<p>Our George found all his oil was burned.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone fancy filling in the middle?</p>
