        "rendered": "<p>Despite being from Western Ward, I &#8220;gatecrashed&#8221; the West Swindon Forum last night. \u00a0Here&#8217;s some thoughts on it.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>What is the West Swindon Forum<\/h2>\n<p>The West Swindon Forum seems to be a bi-monthly (that is, every-other-monthly) meeting between West Swindon residents, councillors and other interested\/interesting parties. \u00a0Residents can share and discuss local issues, and get updates on important changes in their local area and across the borough.<\/p>\n<p>It was well run, being chaired by Councillor Mary Martin and moving relatively quickly between issues. \u00a0I&#8217;ve certainly been in more boring and chaotic business meetings, so to have one full of members of the public moving so smoothly was pleasantly surprising.<\/p>\n<p>It was also well attended. \u00a0Well, actually, I say that, but while numbers were high I would say that the demographic was quite narrow and that the forum appeared to be full of people whom the councillors and other panel members knew quite well anyway.<\/p>\n<h2>Why I Went<\/h2>\n<p>I went along because I&#8217;d had a couple of invitations from various places to hear a man from the transport planning department talk about Swindon&#8217;s successful bid to the <a title=\"Local Sustainable Transport Fund\" href=\"http:\/\/www2.dft.gov.uk\/pgr\/regional\/transportfund\/\">Local Sustainable Transport Fund<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To keep things brief I&#8217;ll talk about the sustainable transport in a separate post.<\/p>\n<p>I confess that I went with slight trepidation, not sure what the format would be, how many would be there, and whether it would be interesting or incredibly boring.<\/p>\n<h2>What Did I Think?<\/h2>\n<p>Overall I was pretty impressed and interested. \u00a0Yes, it was a little boring, but that&#8217;s just the nature of the subject matter of raised kerbs, parking issues and street lighting. To be fair, if this was my ward&#8217;s community forum, I&#8217;d be raising the issue of pavement parking outside my house and of parking on Rodbourne Road between Linslade Street and Redcliffe Street.<\/p>\n<p>But I also felt that the forum was hugely important and that&#8217;s why I stuck it out. \u00a0That the councillors take a long evening out to invite people to air their views should be valued and some of the presentations are on hugely important topics, like the potential change from Council-owned council housing to a housing association. \u00a0I left with lots of useful information!<\/p>\n<p>I was also left a little disappointed. Not with the councillors, or the people who attended the meeting, but about local politics in general. \u00a0I guess I was the second youngest person in the room and, as I said before, I seemed to be one of the few people who didn&#8217;t seem to be a regular.<\/p>\n<p>I would love to see more younger people engage with this forum and find out what their councillors do, and what they can do for us.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll certainly be finding out if there&#8217;s a similar forum in my ward, and popping along if I can. \u00a0And I&#8217;ll be encouraging others to as well. Local politics isn&#8217;t massively exciting &#8211; I wonder how we can make it more interesting for people? &#8211; but it is important. \u00a0Get involved if you can!<\/p>\n",
