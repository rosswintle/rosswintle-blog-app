<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Routine</h1></header><main><p>I&#8217;m a far-from-compulsively over-organised person and I like to think that I&#8217;m quite balanced: we need to be organised to get things done, but being TOO organised can, in my opinion, hinder your work.</p>
<p>But&#8230;it&#8217;s gotten a little too chaotic around here. I&#8217;m not overloaded. It&#8217;s actually been quite quiet of late. But with working from home and for myself, I&#8217;m both loving the flexibility and missing the routine.  I&#8217;ve enjoyed the flexibility for a while now, but it&#8217;s time to impose some order on my days.</p>
<p>So&#8230; starting tomorrow: the routine!!</p>
<p>Hopefully this will include some personal blogging time. I guess you&#8217;ll find out soon enough if it&#8217;s worked.</p>
