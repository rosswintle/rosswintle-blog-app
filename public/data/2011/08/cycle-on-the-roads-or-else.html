<p>http://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/news/9201293.___Cycle_on_the_roads_or_else/</p>
<p>The Facebook post asked for comments. I wrote this in response:</p>
<p>SO many things wrong with the comments from the police.</p>
<p>First of all I&#8217;m totally with Andy, cyclists should obey the law. There&#8217;s no excuse for illegally cycling on the pavement and scaring pedestrians. BUT&#8230;</p>
<p>We might want to ask WHY cyclists feel a need to do this. Is it because Cricklade Road is narrow and congested, but also a key link in the cycle routes from Stratton into town? Punishing cyclists is all well and good but what&#8217;s being done to make cycling on the roads safer? Are there plans to put an alternative cycle route in? Or to make a decent amount of space on Cricklade Road for cyclists?</p>
<p>We may also want to consider road safety again. The article says there have been no accidents involving bikes. The other day I read this:</p>
<p>&#8220;In Swindon between summer 2008 and summer 2011, 2,322 cars were in accidents resulting in 10 fatalities and 186 serious injuries.&#8221;</p>
<p>We might like to consider if it&#8217;s a good use of police time cracking down on the non-existent threat of cyclists and spending some time pulling over some of the shockingly bad motorists who pose a real threat to everyone. People who use mobiles while driving; people who speed; perhaps the guy who overtook me on Croft Road because I&#8217;d slowed down to give a cyclist room.</p>
<p>Finally get get the police to stop putting the burden of road safety on to vulnerable users. It&#8217;s all well and good telling cyclists to wear helmets and hi-viz (which MIGHT protect you somewhat in a collision with a vehicle), but who&#8217;s telling motorists to look out for cyclists, to give cyclists room, to drive carefully in residential areas.</p>
<p>Like so many articles about cycling, this one is ALL backwards, it both blames cyclists for being a threat and tells them that they&#8217;re vulnerable and need to protect themselves using every measure available.</p>
<p>Cycling is a safe, healthy, efficient and clean mode of transport. If you really want safer streets go tackle the real issue of motoring, and make cycling as easy as possible.</p>
