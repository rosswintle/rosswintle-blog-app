<p>It&#8217;s amazing how quickly time passes.  It was a whole SIX years ago, before I married my lovely wife, that we were visiting my now-in-laws for Christmas and it snowed on Christmas day.</p>
<p>Sally always gets very excited about snow, but I don&#8217;t really get it.  The difference, it turns out,  is hills.  When you have hills you can go proper sledging.  Swindon doesn&#8217;t have hills, but Devon does!</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>So, having got the sledging bug, on Christmas Day in 2004 we wrapped our camera in a plastic bag and I took it down the hill with me.  We later edited together some footage and made&#8230;&#8221;SledgeCam&#8221;.</p>

<p>This year, we arrived in Devon with deep snow all ready and waiting for us.  We recently upgraded to a waterproof, shockproof Olympus camera, and so I couldn&#8217;t resist re-making SledgeCam in HD.</p>

<p>Slightly different in that, rather than bailing out, I went the whole hog and down the steep bit too.</p>

<p>Great fun!  I was going to edit it together but I think they stand alone.  Thanks to Sally and the rest of the family for bearing with me while I had &#8220;just one more go&#8221; several times.</p>
