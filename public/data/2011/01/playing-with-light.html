<p>The world has gone mad on a couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>End-to-End Cycle Challenges &#8211; loads of people I know are planning cycling either John O&#8217; Groats to Land&#8217;s End or vice versa this year.  I&#8217;d love to have a go myself but I&#8217;m behind on cycling and exercise in general, and with current circumstances can&#8217;t really commit to it&#8230;but it&#8217;s very tempting to join this trend.</li>
<li>Photography &#8211; I got lovely wife a Nikon D5000 DSLR for Christmas so the last few days have involved a lot of photography.  In fact, lots of people seem to have got cameras, or just the photography bug, over the Christmas period, including, to my pleasant surprise, <a title="Sanctified - Dave Berry's Blog" href="http://sanctified.co.uk">a very good friend of mine who&#8217;s attempting a photo a day this year</a> &#8211; if you&#8217;re a photographer, do pop by and offer Dave your tips!</li>
</ol>
<p>We headed to London to see in the New Year with some good friends there.  New Year&#8217;s Eve was no exception.  The Nikon is really good in low light and she got some great shots of me juggling with rings of light-sticks. Here&#8217;s a sample for you.</p>
<p>I hope you had a very happy Christmas and that you have a blessed, happy, and joyful year in 2011!!</p>
