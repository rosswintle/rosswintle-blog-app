Pragmatic Environmentalism and; Cycling.<\/p>\n<p><!--more-->Andy&#8217;s posts about user experience have got me thinking a lot about my own experiences of human computer interaction and today has raised an interesting example.<\/p>\n<h2>IE9 for the Average Joe<\/h2>\n<p>As a web developer I like to stay on top of technology so I used a spare moment to get downloading Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer 9.<\/p>\n<p>We should bear in mind that web browsers are a pretty key piece of computer software these days and Microsoft are, of course, competing more and more with Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox, Google&#8217;s Chrome and others. \u00a0So an average man-on-the-street, non-technical person, wanting to take advantage of the new features and increased speed of IE9 should be given a VERY easy time when doing this upgrade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And yet, I &#8211; a highly technical person &#8211; was initially bamboozled at pretty much step one of the install process.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After double-clicking the installer that I&#8217;d downloaded by clicking the big &#8220;Download Now&#8221; button, I got the following message:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020\" title=\"IE9 Install Error\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error.jpg\" alt=\"Internet Explorer 9 Install Error: &quot;Wrong Version of Internet Explorer Installer - This version of setup doesn't support your Windows system type (32\/64 bit)&quot;\" width=\"506\" height=\"145\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error.jpg 506w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-300x85.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-150x42.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>My first thought was, &#8220;wrong version?&#8221;. \u00a0I didn&#8217;t remember having a choice of versions. \u00a0I just clicked the &#8220;Download Now&#8221; button. \u00a0Was there another version?<\/p>\n<p>My second thought was &#8220;What?&#8221;. \u00a0I mean, what is this telling me?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It tells me that I&#8217;ve done something wrong, but it doesn&#8217;t really tell me what I&#8217;ve done wrong.<\/li>\n<li>It uses technical language that a lot of people won&#8217;t understand: &#8220;32-bit\/64-bit&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>It assumes that you know that there are two &#8220;Windows system types&#8221;, which is not necessarily true.<\/li>\n<li>It tells me nothing about how to fix the problem or what I need to do to complete the install.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of particular confusion is the fact that it tells me I&#8217;ve used the wrong installer, but doesn&#8217;t tell me where to get the right installer.<\/p>\n<h2>Giving Up<\/h2>\n<p>I confess, I actually gave up at that point. \u00a0If MS can&#8217;t make this easy for a busy person I&#8217;m wasn&#8217;t going to bother.<\/p>\n<p>For the average user at this point I&#8217;ve got an error I probably don&#8217;t understand and no help in doing the job right. \u00a0There&#8217;s no encouragement to persevere and get it right either.<\/p>\n<h2>A Better Error<\/h2>\n<p>If this message was to remain technical, it should say something more like:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You&#8217;re trying to use the 32-bit installer on a 64-bit Windows system. \u00a0Please use the 64-bit installer instead&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>But, even better, this more technical information should be hidden under a &#8220;More information&#8221; button. \u00a0The error needs to be as simple as possible and give the user the simplest resolution.<\/p>\n<p>I suggest:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You are using the wrong version of the installer for your system. \u00a0Please download and install the right version to continue your upgrade to a faster, better internet experience.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Download Internet Explorer version 9 for your system<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">More Information on this error<\/span>&#8220;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Get it Right First Time<\/h2>\n<p>Even better would be to try to deliver the correct installer anyway &#8211; detect if the user is using 32- or 64-bit and have the download button deliver the correct version. \u00a0This can be easily done in JavaScript by testing the values of:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><code>window.navigator.cpuClass<\/code><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><code>window.navigator.platform<\/code><\/p>\n<p>(I confess to not having used these values before and a quick test shows that, in practice, cpuClass is &#8220;unknown&#8221; for my system and platform is &#8220;Win32&#8221;, so maybe MS try to detect this but it&#8217;s not reported correctly)<\/p>\n<h2>Lessons Learned<\/h2>\n<p>As a techie it&#8217;s easy to assume that everyone knows what I do and to unthoughtfully write error messages that may not be understood. \u00a0But especially for a tool that non-technical people will be installing, errors need to be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>clear;<\/li>\n<li>non-technical (but with an option to get a more technical message); and<\/li>\n<li>help me fix the problem or take the appropriate action to achieve my objective.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the meantime I&#8217;m downloading the 64-bit version and will let you know what I think soon.<\/p>\n<h3>Update<\/h3>\n<p>ARRGH! \u00a0OK, I&#8217;m now running the 64-bit version and I get this message:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024\" title=\"Confusing IE9 Install Dialog\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2.jpg\" alt=\"A confusing IE9 install dialog\" width=\"492\" height=\"190\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2.jpg 492w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2-300x115.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/03\/ie9-install-error-2-150x57.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Which again, suggests something quite complicated and scary while giving me very little help. \u00a0At this point I&#8217;m thinking:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What customized settings does this install include? \u00a0What will it change?<\/li>\n<li>What additional programs will it install?<\/li>\n<li>Is there an option to not install the additional programs?<\/li>\n<li>Is there a version that doesn&#8217;t include customized settings and additional programs?<\/li>\n<li>And if so where do I get it from?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>At least I get a link to the license terms but at this point I&#8217;m still clicking cancel. \u00a0I&#8217;ve been bitten before by &#8220;additional programs&#8221; being installed and I don&#8217;t trust Microsoft not to mess up my system.<\/p>\n<p>Back to watching the rugby.<\/p>\n",
