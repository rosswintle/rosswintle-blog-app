<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Getting you there without costing the Earth</h1></header><main><p>I just belatedly picked up today&#8217;s Guardian and there&#8217;s a supplement called &#8216;<a href="http://mygreenplace.info/greenmagazine" alt="Green Magazine">Green</a>&#8216; which is &#8216;published quarterly and is an independent magazine&#8217;.</p>
<p>The editorial says what&#8217;s in the issue, including &#8216;assessing the pros and cons of different vehicle choices to get you there without costing the earth&#8217;.</p>
<p>Marvellous&#8230;only, the article is ACTUALLY about new motor vehicle technologies with not a single reference to other, more sustainable modes of transport.</p>
<p>There is some good stuff in this little magazine, but as it&#8217;s free it&#8217;s mostly adverts, which means it&#8217;s mostly greenwashed consumerism.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help thinking that real sustainability contains a big chunk of reducing consumption and for me that means removing the assumption that we can continue to travel as much as we currently do and in the ways that we currently do.</p>
