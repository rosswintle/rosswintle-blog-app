Not giving too much away, the question was along the lines of:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>What output will you get from the following statements:<\/p>\n<p>x=4;<br \/>\necho x&lt;=6 ? &#8216;less than or equal to&#8217; : &#8216;greater than&#8217; . &#8216; six&#8217;;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: Apologies to those that don&#8217;t code at this point &#8211; this won&#8217;t make a whole load of sense.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a clever question because it lures you into thinking that the code is correct and will print &#8216;less than or equal to six&#8217;, but it actually prints just &#8216;less than or equal to&#8217;, because the precedence of the conditional operator is lower than that of string concatenation. \u00a0In case you&#8217;re wondering, no, I didn&#8217;t look this up as I know that the ternary operator has quite low precedence.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth nothing that this is, in my opinion, ambiguous code and any statement like this should always be written more clearly:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>echo (x &lt;= 6 ? &#8216;less than or equal to&#8217; : &#8216;greater than&#8217; ) . &#8216; six&#8217;;<sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1011-1' id='fnref-1011-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(1011)'>1<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Adding parentheses adds no computational overhead <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1011-2' id='fnref-1011-2' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(1011)'>2<\/a><\/sup> and makes the code easier to understand.<\/p>\n<h2>Learning languages<\/h2>\n<p>Do I also have evidence that learning new tools and languages is easier if you have a good grounding in computer science? \u00a0Well, yes.<\/p>\n<p>I was recently on a training course where we were learning a tool that had a built-in scripting language. \u00a0Some of the other guys on the course didn&#8217;t have my computer science background and theory. <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-1011-3' id='fnref-1011-3' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(1011)'>3<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>When we got to doing exercises, they raced ahead for the first few, applying the specific bits of knowledge about the language they&#8217;d picked up from the course slides, while I was slow, asking questions like &#8220;what does that function return?&#8221;, or &#8220;why does that query do what it does?&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>However, come the later exercises, where you had to do more than just refer back to the the slides, I&#8217;d gained a deeper understanding of the language and raced ahead.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always believed that a thorough grounding in the principles of programming makes you a better coder than someone who just picked up a book and started writing code. \u00a0Occasionally I see practical evidence of this being the case.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday&#8217;s test proved to me that, while I may not know the exact syntax and purpose of every last PHP function or configuration setting, I can still be a PHP expert, and that I have skills and knowledge that are more valuable than I thought.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps tomorrow I&#8217;ll be a C# expert!<\/p>\n<div class='footnotes' id='footnotes-1011'>\n<div class='footnotedivider'><\/div>\n<ol>\n<li id='fn-1011-1'> You can argue about putting the comparison operator in parentheses too, but it&#8217;s pretty safe to assume that a simple numerical comparison will have greater precedence over the conditional operator. <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-1011-1'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li id='fn-1011-2'> OK, perhaps a TINY overhead when PHP tokenises the script. <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-1011-2'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li id='fn-1011-3'> If they&#8217;re reading, I hope they don&#8217;t mind me sharing this story! <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-1011-3'>&#8617;<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n",
