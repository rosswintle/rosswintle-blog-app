<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Why?</h1></header><main><p>I&#8217;ve often been asked why?  Why bare your soul in this way?  Why wear you heart on such a public sleeve?  Why write all this stuff where everyone&#8230;the whole world&#8230;can see it?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no one simple answer.  So here&#8217;s a stab at a few complex ones.</p>
<h3>Inspired by others</h3>
<p>I was inspired to start writing by others who were already doing so.  Friends who were already sharing bits of their lives on the internet.</p>
<ul>
<li>An amazing ex-colleague who was dying from cancer in a highly dignified manner.</li>
<li>A few friends who&#8217;d moved abroad and was keeping his family and friends updated through an entertaining blog.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fatcyclist.com">The Fat Cyclist</a> &#8211; who entertains me almost daily with his highly amusing cycling- and food-related writing.</li>
<li>Another friend who is using the internet to share the early years of their first child with their family who live on the other side of the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t really help explain why I&#8217;m waffling on here.  I&#8217;m not inspiring people with my stories of fighting a terrible illness.  I&#8217;ve only moved as far as from London to Swindon and my family and friends are physically closer then they were.  I&#8217;m not massively funny.  I don&#8217;t have a new child.</p>
<h3>Enjoyment</h3>
<p>But I do like writing, and others have shown me that it&#8217;s OK to share some of your thoughts and experiences.  They can be interesting &#8211; especially to people that already know you.  I&#8217;ve really enjoyed reading other people&#8217;s writings, photos, experiences, thoughts, stories.  Perhaps they&#8217;ll enjoy some of what I&#8217;ve got to say.</p>
<h3>Discovering and learning</h3>
<p>I had a tough year a few years back with lots of illness.  Nothing hugely serious, but stuff that was all new to me and that dragged on.  I was also taking up cycling in a big way, had moved to a new town, was learning some new technology stuff, improving as a musician, and continuing in my Christian faith.</p>
<p>Writing stuff down to record it, reflect on it, and refer back to it has been both theraputic, and very helpful.  I can see repeated patterns of things I did that caused me injury or poor health.  I can look back over success and rejoice.  I can look back at failures and learn from my mistakes.</p>
<p>Doing this electronically makes referring back much easier.  But still, I could do this privately.  (Actually I do&#8230;I have a private blog that I use for personal journalling too!)</p>
<p>However, in sharing some of my thoughts and dicsoveries, I hope that others can join in learning and experience these things as I go along, and maybe be inspired to take up something new themselves, be it cycling, bird watching, gardening, or DIY.</p>
<h3>A footnote on Why</h3>
<p>My readership is small.  I like that.  And the day it gets too big I&#8217;ll probably head offline.  I write mostly for myself, but I enjoy doing so in a way that may be of use or interest to others.  I hope that you enjoy being among them.</p>
