<p>One of the reasons I keep on with <a href="https://turbo-admin.com/">Turbo Admin</a> is that I&#8217;ve had some <em>major</em> validation of the idea in the form of investment offers and even &#8211; no, I can&#8217;t believe it either &#8211; offers to buy it!</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been really encouraged by these offers. Here&#8217;s my thoughts on the idea of selling it:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Too many independent software projects are being bought up. I&#8217;m determined for it to stay indie &#8211; for now at least!</li>



<li>I enjoy making it and I learn from making it. Perhaps a buyer would pay me to keep working on it? Or I could just find another project. But it&#8217;s my little hobby thing for now.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s definitely a thing that I make, in part at least, for myself to use! I <em>literally</em> use it <em>all</em> the time. I used it to log in to this site and start writing this post. I don&#8217;t want someone else to own the roadmap. I know what <em>I</em> want it to be. I don&#8217;t want it to be a lead generator or a nice add-on business to something much bigger. I want it to be a useful tool for WordPress users.</li>



<li>There&#8217;s a really nice group of dedicated customers (THANK YOU!) who love the product. I like being able to serve them personally.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s not (yet) in a state where I think it&#8217;s worth someone buying from me! It has lots of potential, but I want to realise more of that by myself before I would consider it something that is sellable. So I won&#8217;t rule it out in the future. But the buyer would have to promise to keep it what it is.</li>
</ul>



<p>There may be benefits to it having a bigger owner. Development might be faster. Support too (but support requests are SO rare).</p>



<p>I&#8217;m honestly flattered by the offers. Maybe one day it will make sense to sell it? But for now it&#8217;s staying with me. I hope that&#8217;s OK.</p>



<p>If people want to keep making me offers, I&#8217;m totally happy to receive them. It&#8217;s a very lovely and encouraging thing!</p>



<p>And if customers think I <em>should</em> sell it, let me know. I&#8217;d be keen to hear what you think.</p>
