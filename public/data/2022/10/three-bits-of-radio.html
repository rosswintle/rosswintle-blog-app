<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a longer commute in to work and catching up on my podcast queue.</p>



<p>Three BRILLIANT podcasts that I&#8217;d love to send you lots of quotes from, but actually, you should just listen to the whole thing.</p>



<ul>
<li>Caleb Porzio encourages you to &#8220;<a href="https://notesonwork.transistor.fm/episodes/grow-where-youre-planted">Grow where you are</a>&#8221; in a delightful audio journey through some of his local area and some things that he loves.</li>



<li>My total nerd crush and the best voice on radio, Roman Mars, gets <a href="https://pca.st/episode/7942121c-12db-4475-980b-08a7dc609ce0">interviewed by Bill Clinton</a> and explains how we&#8217;re all connected and why this is so important.</li>



<li>And &#8211; along the same lines &#8211; Rob Bell begins a wander through the topic of <a href="https://robbell.podbean.com/e/hope-part-1/">Hope</a> in which he shows us that we&#8217;re not just observers of the world, but we are all active participants in it. (You can take or leave Rob Bell &#8211; I still don&#8217;t know what to make of him, but this episode is good)</li>
</ul>
