<p>I&#8217;ve often felt the peer pressure of the podcasting bandwagon. I&#8217;ve always resisted on the basis that the world really doesn&#8217;t need another white tech dude mouth-blogging.</p>



<p>But I&#8217;ve often wondered what would it look like for me to have a podcast or be on a podcast on a regular basis. And recently I&#8217;ve had reason to think about this properly.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s my thoughts:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>It would be short, with a hard-limit of 20 minutes, a goal of 15 minutes, and a stretch-goal of 10.</li><li>It would be at least weekly (to keep cadence) but with bonus episodes as and when I have stuff to talk about.</li><li>It would not just be me and it would ideally feature another person that is not a white man. And I would love to use it to promote the work of others who fly under the radar.</li><li>It would not be sponsored. It would be for the joy of sharing what I know and what I do with others.</li><li>It would be primarily, not only about tech. My world is richer than that and I love learning about all sorts of things.</li><li>Related to 5, it would be carefully named so as to not limit the topic or audience. And who cares about the SEO anyway?!</li><li>I would be allowed to be critical, but it would never be personal. HOWEVER any critique would always be balanced with positivity. I would expect any co-host and the audience to hold me to this.</li><li>It would be fun and have energy. Perhaps modelled on the XKCD concept of &#8220;<a href="https://xkcd.com/1053/">you&#8217;re one of todays lucky 10,000</a>&#8220;.</li><li>I would love the format to be different or original in some way, to inject some kind of creativity into people&#8217;s feeds. There would have to be something about it that is unlike all the other podcasts I listen to.</li></ol>



<p>What would your imaginary podcast look like?</p>
