<p>Today I tweeted this:</p>

<p>I posed it as a question. But it wasn&#8217;t really. It was a comment on how hard freelancing can be (for some types of work) hard to get closed down.</p>



<p>I strived for a while to get my business into a place where I could more easily wind it down if I got a job (which I now have). But the nature of my work is that I often helped small organisations work with technology that they really didn&#8217;t understand.</p>



<p>Some of that technology is now changing (I&#8217;m looking at you Google Workspace!) and I find myself feeling heavily obliged to helping people through the transition. I was the one who set them up and I&#8217;m really the only admin left on most of the accounts.</p>



<p>So yes, some freelancers can just complete a job and wrap it all up and be done. But I seem to have dug myself a bit of a hole.</p>



<p>If I was starting again, I wouldn&#8217;t offer hosting, and any ongoing services that my clients depend upon would be well and truly owned by them so that they could more easily be handed over.</p>



<p>And lo, another of my values starting with the letter &#8216;C&#8217; is evident (they all start with &#8216;C&#8217;!): Conscientious!</p>
