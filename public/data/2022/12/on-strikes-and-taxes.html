<p>I want to say something about strikes.</p>



<p>Nurses, postal workers, train drivers, border force, paramedics: you have my support.</p>



<p>The whole gig economy sucks. The lack of investment sucks. The rich getting richer sucks. People need good jobs that pay well. Get what you deserve!</p>



<p>And for ministers saying &#8220;we can&#8217;t raise taxes when people are struggling&#8221;: you absolutely can &#8211; tax the people who AREN&#8217;T struggling. Tax the millionaires and billionaires. Tax the corporations making massive profits. There are options here. Do it!</p>



<p>You might say: &#8220;But Ross, aren&#8217;t you doing OK? You have a good IT job and stuff. What if they come and tax you?&#8221; And I reply: &#8220;Yes! I&#8217;m VERY fortunate and privileged. And I&#8217;d actually CELEBRATE being able to pay more tax if I knew it was going to front-line workers and not into the grimy hands of already-rich people who milk off the state with their corrupt business schemes.&#8221; ?</p>



<p>There is also a whole thing about how we talk about tax. That tax is bad because it takes from us. We need to turn that around. Being able to pay a lot of tax is a privilege. I get to GIVE from what I earn to pay for OUR nurses, OUR teachers, OUR bin collectors. Let&#8217;s make that GOOD!!</p>
