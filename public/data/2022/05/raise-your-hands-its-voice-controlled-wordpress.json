That is, things you can get code to do in a browser, like locate where you are and play sounds and&#8230; do speech recognition&#8230;?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That sounds fun&#8221;, went my train of thought, &#8220;I&#8217;d love to tinker with that and see how it can be used.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; wait&#8230; I could hook up speech input to <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a> &#8211; my command palette plugin and browser extension for WordPress. Then you could control WordPress (to some extent) with your voice!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cue visions of the Minority Report computer:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/tom-cruise-steven-spielberg-minority-report-BLVqLi1p4Pt7i\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media0.giphy.com\/media\/BLVqLi1p4Pt7i\/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Tom Cruise GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"500\" height=\"249\" \/><\/a>\n<\/div><figcaption>Tom Cruise works with the new block editor in WordPress 9.3<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Or &#8220;Alexa for WordPress&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/sandwich-skill-alexa-l0Iy7Y2y0RuckTwLm\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media0.giphy.com\/media\/l0Iy7Y2y0RuckTwLm\/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Peanut Butter Sandwich GIF by Doctor Popular - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" \/><\/a>\n<\/div><figcaption>Voice control FTW!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So I set to work and, about 90 minutes of hacking later, I had a working prototype&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/709816581?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is pretty amazing. I mean, I know it doesn&#8217;t really SEEM all that amazing. It&#8217;s a bit clunky in this first attempt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if we compare what we have here to where we started &#8211; the standard WordPress admin dashboard &#8211; a lot of cool stuff has happened, and it&#8217;s the combining of all these things together that has made this voice navigation possible:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Turning the WordPress menus into a command palette<\/li><li>Adding &#8220;fuzzy&#8221; search to the palette to allow direct access to commands and content<\/li><li>Adding on top of that, the speech recognition to &#8220;type&#8221; with your voice.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think about it, each of these things in itself is no mean feat. Although the <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/API\/Web_Speech_API\/Using_the_Web_Speech_API\">web speech API<\/a> does a LOT of the heavy lifting for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was really fun combining these existing technologies to bring something new to life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a bit more work I got here, which is a bit more &#8220;hands-free&#8221;&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Voice Controlled WordPress part 2\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/709816673?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"389\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Limitations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This technology is not without limitations. Primarily, it only works in some browsers. There is no Firefox support; Chrome works (this is what my tests were in); Safari works in theory but I&#8217;ve not tested it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should also be noted that Chrome does its speech recognition in the cloud, so there are privacy concerns over that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>Note: On some browsers, like Chrome, using Speech Recognition on a web page involves a server-based recognition engine. Your audio is sent to a web service for recognition processing, so it won&#8217;t work offline.<\/p><cite><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/API\/SpeechRecognition\">Speech recognition API docs (mozilla.org)<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It accepts all of the limitations of Turbo Admin. It just lets you do navigation. It&#8217;s not intelligent in any way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the prototype is English only. Though I believe you could pass your browser&#8217;s language setting to the speech recognition easily enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Implementation and challenges<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In theory there isn&#8217;t really anything very special going on here. The basic steps are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Initialize the speech recognition API.<\/li><li>When the command palette is shown, start recognition.<\/li><li>The speech recognition API sends events when text has been generated from speech. It basically says &#8220;I recognized some text. Here it is!&#8221;<\/li><li>Listen for the events, and when they are triggered, grab the text, shove it into the input field, and trigger a palette update.<\/li><li>When the command palette is closed, stop recognition.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The format of the data given to you by the events takes a bit of figuring out, but that&#8217;s not too hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real difficulty for me was that I was writing this into the browser extension. This works by injecting a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Mozilla\/Add-ons\/WebExtensions\/Content_scripts\">content script<\/a>&#8221; that runs the whole show.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This content script is &#8220;sandboxed&#8221;, which means it has access to the content of the page, and can change that. But it doesn&#8217;t have access to other JavaScript on the page. And, sadly, this means it doesn&#8217;t have access to the speech recognition API, as tihs is a property of the <code>window<\/code> object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The workaround for this is to inject a <code>&lt;script&gt;<\/code> tag into the page with the code that needs to use the voice recognition. BUT&#8230; this is now in a different sandbox to the command palette code. So some communication is needed between the palette and the speech recognition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This needed some custom JavaScript events to be triggered and listened for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing too taxing, but the architecture is a bit weird.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I added this to <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/turbo-admin\/\">the plugin version<\/a> of Turbo Admin this wouldn&#8217;t be a problem. BUT&#8230; fun fact&#8230; the plugin version of Turbo Admin uses (almost) identical JavaScript &#8211; the only real difference is how it&#8217;s added to the page and initialized. So it should be trivial to port this to the plugin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So&#8230; err&#8230; what now?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, I made this as a toy. A developer plaything. Just because I could. I didn&#8217;t think it had any real practical value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I shared it on Twitter, the initial reactions backed up my self-amusement and internal amazement at what modern tech can do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\ude02 love it!
