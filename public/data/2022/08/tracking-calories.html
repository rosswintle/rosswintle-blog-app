<p>Right. My metabolism ain’t gonna be getting any faster! Time to act!!</p>



<p>Partly inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1559700219633274881">@adamwathan’s health success</a>, I’ve started tracking calories.</p>



<p>Historically I’ve been fortunate enough (sorry!) to just burn pretty much whatever I eat and stay lean with a bit of exercise.</p>



<p>But I’m mid-forties now and my body seems to be slowing down.</p>



<p>I’m about 6-8 kilos above where I want my weight to be, and it’s starting to show too.</p>



<p>It’s not a lot, relatively. But it’s a trajectory I don’t like. And I need to start moving the line the other way.</p>



<p>I don’t like giving away all the data to some tracking app, but they do seem to be really useful helpers for this kind of thing. So I have accepted it.</p>



<p>I have <a href="https://loseit.com/">an app ready to go</a> (the same one Adam was using, I think?)</p>



<p>I’ve never tracked calories before. So a big part of it is to shock myself into seeing how much I actually consume.</p>



<p>I’m a grazer. And I’m prepared to quickly be shocked by my snacking!</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s see how this goes!</p>
