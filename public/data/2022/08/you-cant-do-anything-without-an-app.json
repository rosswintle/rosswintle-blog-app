We had a great time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that, as I relax and unwind, and the adrenaline that&#8217;s been keeping everything at bay dissipates, and the major life stuff is put aside, things come crashing down and the minor annoyances of life are suddenly much more noticable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And other than appliances and customer service, the other thing that really bugged me while on holiday was that you need a flippin&#8217; app or website registration for SO many things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Get a voucher for a meal at a restaurant: Download an app and register.<\/li><li>Check which beaches are safe to swim at: Probably on a website, but the encouragement was to download the app.<\/li><li>Get a map for the forest park: OK, this didn&#8217;t NEED an app, but, again, it was encouraged and signposted when paper maps were not.<\/li><li>Hire a scooter: Download app and register.<\/li><li>Scan a non-standard QR code on a box of cereal. I didn&#8217;t have to do this, but I was curious. Apparently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.packaginginsights.com\/news\/kelloggs-smartphone-detectable-cereal-boxes-championed-as-game-changer-for-blind-consumer-inclusivity.html\">it&#8217;s great for accessibility<\/a>, and could be some wonderful tech, but it&#8217;s proprietary tech that&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/edent\/status\/1411732397314486278\">not without issues<\/a> and, really, an app to read a colorful QR code?<\/li><li>Trying to find out when the next bus is: the app was optional, but again, encouraged. And it had neat real-time bus-tracking features too.<\/li><li>Buying tickets for the aquarium: this probably legitimately needed registration, but was still ANOTHER account I had to create while mobile.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And don&#8217;t get me started on parking. I now have JustPark, RingGo, PhoneAndPay, PayByPhone, and Apcoa Connect and they all forget who I am and fail in every possible way when ALL I WANT TO DO IS PAY \u00a33 TO PARK MY CAR!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The friction that tech has brought to all of these things seems to be huge. Downloading apps on mobile data isn&#8217;t nice. Registering for anything that requires a password isn&#8217;t nice (yes I use a password manager, and no it&#8217;s not very helpful in these scenarios). Confirming identity by email is a mess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can we make this better?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Use lightweight, progressive web apps, that I can open in a regular browser, without an app download.<\/li><li>Allow some way to do the thing without creating an account, or allowing me to create an account later. Surely someone has fixed the spam and fraud issues by now?<\/li><li>Find some better way than passwords for login. Login with Apple\/Google seems to help here, but isn&#8217;t always implemented and I&#8217;m not entirely sure if I like its magic.<\/li><li>Go and actually user test your applications and websites in real life scenarios &#8211; like, I want to book a ticket to the aquarium from the beach. Or I want to frickin pay \u00a33 to park my frickin&#8217; car in a frickin&#8217; car park and we can land a car-sized rover on Mars using a rocket-powered hovering crane so why can&#8217;t I reset my password right now. I feel like so many of these apps are tested in offices and never actually taken into the real world and used in a real-world scenario.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I dunno. There are some hard problems here. But there are some awesome opportunities to use tech to make things easier and better for people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we MUST reduce the friction of trying to do these things to grasp those opportunites and not just frustrate people who are trying to enjoy their holiday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&lt;\/rant><\/p>\n",
