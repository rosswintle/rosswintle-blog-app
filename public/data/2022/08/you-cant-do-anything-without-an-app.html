<p>If you follow me on socials, you might think that I really didn&#8217;t enjoy my holiday&#8230;</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s not really true. We had a great time.</p>



<p>I think that, as I relax and unwind, and the adrenaline that&#8217;s been keeping everything at bay dissipates, and the major life stuff is put aside, things come crashing down and the minor annoyances of life are suddenly much more noticable.</p>



<p>And other than appliances and customer service, the other thing that really bugged me while on holiday was that you need a flippin&#8217; app or website registration for SO many things.</p>



<ul><li>Get a voucher for a meal at a restaurant: Download an app and register.</li><li>Check which beaches are safe to swim at: Probably on a website, but the encouragement was to download the app.</li><li>Get a map for the forest park: OK, this didn&#8217;t NEED an app, but, again, it was encouraged and signposted when paper maps were not.</li><li>Hire a scooter: Download app and register.</li><li>Scan a non-standard QR code on a box of cereal. I didn&#8217;t have to do this, but I was curious. Apparently <a href="https://www.packaginginsights.com/news/kelloggs-smartphone-detectable-cereal-boxes-championed-as-game-changer-for-blind-consumer-inclusivity.html">it&#8217;s great for accessibility</a>, and could be some wonderful tech, but it&#8217;s proprietary tech that&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/edent/status/1411732397314486278">not without issues</a> and, really, an app to read a colorful QR code?</li><li>Trying to find out when the next bus is: the app was optional, but again, encouraged. And it had neat real-time bus-tracking features too.</li><li>Buying tickets for the aquarium: this probably legitimately needed registration, but was still ANOTHER account I had to create while mobile.</li></ul>



<p>And don&#8217;t get me started on parking. I now have JustPark, RingGo, PhoneAndPay, PayByPhone, and Apcoa Connect and they all forget who I am and fail in every possible way when ALL I WANT TO DO IS PAY £3 TO PARK MY CAR!!!!</p>



<p>The friction that tech has brought to all of these things seems to be huge. Downloading apps on mobile data isn&#8217;t nice. Registering for anything that requires a password isn&#8217;t nice (yes I use a password manager, and no it&#8217;s not very helpful in these scenarios). Confirming identity by email is a mess.</p>



<p>How can we make this better?</p>



<ul><li>Use lightweight, progressive web apps, that I can open in a regular browser, without an app download.</li><li>Allow some way to do the thing without creating an account, or allowing me to create an account later. Surely someone has fixed the spam and fraud issues by now?</li><li>Find some better way than passwords for login. Login with Apple/Google seems to help here, but isn&#8217;t always implemented and I&#8217;m not entirely sure if I like its magic.</li><li>Go and actually user test your applications and websites in real life scenarios &#8211; like, I want to book a ticket to the aquarium from the beach. Or I want to frickin pay £3 to park my frickin&#8217; car in a frickin&#8217; car park and we can land a car-sized rover on Mars using a rocket-powered hovering crane so why can&#8217;t I reset my password right now. I feel like so many of these apps are tested in offices and never actually taken into the real world and used in a real-world scenario.</li></ul>



<p>I dunno. There are some hard problems here. But there are some awesome opportunities to use tech to make things easier and better for people.</p>



<p>But we MUST reduce the friction of trying to do these things to grasp those opportunites and not just frustrate people who are trying to enjoy their holiday.</p>



<p>&lt;/rant></p>
