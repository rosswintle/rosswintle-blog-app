I&#8217;m not a clean desk person. Our home is big on &#8220;floordrobes&#8221;. We are slightly-chaotic, creative, mad-professor types. (Well, I should only speak for myself but&#8230;)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet I have a feeling if I embraced it, minimalism would really be my thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I loved <a href=\"https:\/\/thingsworthlearning.show\/episodes\/minimalism-with-diana-scharf\">this Podcast<\/a> from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stauffermatt\">Matt Stauffer<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DianaWebdev\">Diana Scharf<\/a>, it really piqued my interest and got me wondering what more I can do to embrace minimalism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m particularly challeneged by the idea that everything you own has an ongoing cost: looking after it; having a space for it; fixing it if it breaks; finding it if its lost; moving it if you move home. Posessions have a small ongoing cognitive load.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my first thoughts was about books. I don&#8217;t really need books. I have an eReader now and much as I dislike not actually OWNING my books, it saves on all the space and is SO much easier to travel with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m really keen to start ditching physical books!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I had other thoughts about focus and distraction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My Phone&#8217;s Homescreen<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I&#8217;ve really noticed is how distracting my phone is. So in an attempt to clean this up I wondered if I could somehow just delete all my app icons (or put them in the hidden away app library thing) and use Siri or Spotlight (search) to go straight to the thing I want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t ready to completely embrace this, and wanted a back-out plan &#8211; I&#8217;m not ready to delete my crafted layouts and groups of apps that are in muscle memory. So I thought I&#8217;d keep my app screens for now, and just add one as the &#8220;home&#8221; screen with no apps on. I added a couple of nice widgets, but the vast majority of the apps are gone.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-473x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11345\" width=\"305\" height=\"660\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-473x1024.jpg 473w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-139x300.jpg 139w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-768x1663.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-709x1536.jpg 709w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324-946x2048.jpg 946w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_0324.jpg 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>When I&#8217;m disciplined about sticking to this one screen it&#8217;s AWESOME. I should probably delete all my app pages and just do this all the time. But I can&#8217;t bring myself to do it yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a really neat trick though. Swipe down, search for what you want. Go straight there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So much better than scrolling and getting distracted before I&#8217;ve even started the task I set out to achieve!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recommended.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sticking with keys &#8211; a journey<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve long been working on the same idea for my (MacBook) laptop. I switch apps a LOT. I don&#8217;t want to use the dock. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/apple.stackexchange.com\/questions\/59556\/is-there-a-way-to-completely-disable-dock\">the dock can just disappear entirely<\/a> for all I care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alt-Tab-ing my way through apps is a simple way to stay on the keyboard for switching apps. And pairing that with using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alfredapp.com\/\">Alfred<\/a> (or Apple&#8217;s Spotlight) is great. But I&#8217;ve often wondered if I could do better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hyper Keys<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I&#8217;d heard about &#8211; mostly from <a href=\"https:\/\/syntax.fm\/show\/315\/hasty-treat-hyper-productivity-with-keyboard-shortcuts-window-management\">the Syntax.fm podcast<\/a> &#8211; is making your caps-lock key a hyper key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I was sceptical about re-mapping my caps-lock key for another purpose. But I really don&#8217;t miss it one bit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is a &#8220;hyper key&#8221;? Well the idea is that you map caps-lock to ALL the other meta-keys being pressed at once. On a Mac this is Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Option. You need special tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/karabiner-elements.pqrs.org\/\">Karabiner Elements<\/a> to do this, but once you have you can then use another tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/folivora.ai\/\">Better Touch Tool<\/a> to map Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Option-&lt;some-key> to do things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly have a whole keyboard of new shortcuts open up to you with Hyper-Something!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I set about mapping Hyper-&lt;key> to applications so that I could go straight to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Hyper-F opens Firefox<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hyper-P opens PHPStorm<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hyper-W opens Wavebox<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hyper-I opens iTerm<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>and so on.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Direct access to apps. Sweet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I loved this approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even Hyper Keys are a bit limited. I know I&#8217;ll sound selfish, but I wanted MORE!!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stream Deck<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So I tried out Elgato&#8217;s Stream Deck.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First as an app on my phone. This has a small subscription cost, but is a good way to try out the principle of a custom keypad without investing in the reasonably expensive hardware.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It worked REALLY nicely. So, as a treat to myself when I got my new job last year, I bought a proper Stream Deak (the 15-key version) in a sale. And it works really great. Go straight to any app without typing, remembering keyboard shortcuts, or multiple alt-tabs. It keeps me focussed on what I want to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a certain amount of remembering to use the Stream Deck at first. Alt-tab is STRONG in my muscle-memory! But it&#8217;s physical presence actually helps, drawing me back to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with different pages of buttons I have a setup for when I&#8217;m on a call, for when I&#8217;m in my code editor, and shortcuts for opening websites and GitHub repos. It&#8217;s a great tool. Elgato&#8217;s software is pretty terrible (come on folks, do better!!), but this is also a recommended for going straight to apps without passing Go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with Stream Deck is&#8230; you need your Stream Deck. I don&#8217;t have it when I&#8217;m not in my office. And I&#8217;m not paying for the app if I also have the hardware. Annoying!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I still like the Hyper-Key approach too. Even though it is a bit clumsy to set up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">R-Cmd<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To finish off this journey then, one day I saw <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/rcmd-app-switcher\/id1596283165?mt=12\">R-Cmd<\/a>&#8230; a really simple MacApp that says &#8220;Hey, stuff caps-lock, it&#8217;s the Right-Cmd key that you don&#8217;t need&#8221; (really, you don&#8217;t) &#8220;so here&#8217;s a really simple app that lets you set Right-Cmd-&lt;key> as a key to open an app.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my Hyper-key setup, but SO much easier and with one app controlling it. Sure, it&#8217;s not as configurable, but I LOVE this way of doing things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Am I completely, over-the-top obsessed with avoiding my mouse and pressing too many keys? YES! Unashamedly. For something I literally do hundreds of times a day, the ergonomics and minimalism in this are great.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, finally, finally&#8230; if you want to take this to the next level then you need to read &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/tighten.com\/blog\/how-to-train-your-keyboard\/\">How to Train Your Keyboard<\/a>&#8221; (which also has <a href=\"https:\/\/twentypercent.fm\/episodes\/andrew-morgan-train-your-keyboard\">an accompanying podcast episode<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now go, be productive and ditch YOUR mouse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n",
