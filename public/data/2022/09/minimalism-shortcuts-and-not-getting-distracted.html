<p>Today I&#8217;m tidying up an old draft post on the topic of minimalism for posting.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t really think of myself as minimalist. I&#8217;m not a clean desk person. Our home is big on &#8220;floordrobes&#8221;. We are slightly-chaotic, creative, mad-professor types. (Well, I should only speak for myself but&#8230;)</p>



<p>Yet I have a feeling if I embraced it, minimalism would really be my thing.</p>



<p>So I loved <a href="https://thingsworthlearning.show/episodes/minimalism-with-diana-scharf">this Podcast</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/stauffermatt">Matt Stauffer</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DianaWebdev">Diana Scharf</a>, it really piqued my interest and got me wondering what more I can do to embrace minimalism.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m particularly challeneged by the idea that everything you own has an ongoing cost: looking after it; having a space for it; fixing it if it breaks; finding it if its lost; moving it if you move home. Posessions have a small ongoing cognitive load.</p>



<p>One of my first thoughts was about books. I don&#8217;t really need books. I have an eReader now and much as I dislike not actually OWNING my books, it saves on all the space and is SO much easier to travel with.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m really keen to start ditching physical books!</p>



<p>But then I had other thoughts about focus and distraction.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">My Phone&#8217;s Homescreen</h2>



<p>One thing I&#8217;ve really noticed is how distracting my phone is. So in an attempt to clean this up I wondered if I could somehow just delete all my app icons (or put them in the hidden away app library thing) and use Siri or Spotlight (search) to go straight to the thing I want.</p>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t ready to completely embrace this, and wanted a back-out plan &#8211; I&#8217;m not ready to delete my crafted layouts and groups of apps that are in muscle memory. So I thought I&#8217;d keep my app screens for now, and just add one as the &#8220;home&#8221; screen with no apps on. I added a couple of nice widgets, but the vast majority of the apps are gone.</p>

<p>When I&#8217;m disciplined about sticking to this one screen it&#8217;s AWESOME. I should probably delete all my app pages and just do this all the time. But I can&#8217;t bring myself to do it yet.</p>



<p>This is a really neat trick though. Swipe down, search for what you want. Go straight there.</p>



<p>So much better than scrolling and getting distracted before I&#8217;ve even started the task I set out to achieve!</p>



<p>Recommended.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sticking with keys &#8211; a journey</h2>



<p>I&#8217;ve long been working on the same idea for my (MacBook) laptop. I switch apps a LOT. I don&#8217;t want to use the dock. In fact, <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/59556/is-there-a-way-to-completely-disable-dock">the dock can just disappear entirely</a> for all I care.</p>



<p>Alt-Tab-ing my way through apps is a simple way to stay on the keyboard for switching apps. And pairing that with using <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> (or Apple&#8217;s Spotlight) is great. But I&#8217;ve often wondered if I could do better.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hyper Keys</h3>



<p>One thing I&#8217;d heard about &#8211; mostly from <a href="https://syntax.fm/show/315/hasty-treat-hyper-productivity-with-keyboard-shortcuts-window-management">the Syntax.fm podcast</a> &#8211; is making your caps-lock key a hyper key.</p>



<p>Yes, I was sceptical about re-mapping my caps-lock key for another purpose. But I really don&#8217;t miss it one bit.</p>



<p>So what is a &#8220;hyper key&#8221;? Well the idea is that you map caps-lock to ALL the other meta-keys being pressed at once. On a Mac this is Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Option. You need special tools like <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/">Karabiner Elements</a> to do this, but once you have you can then use another tool like <a href="https://folivora.ai/">Better Touch Tool</a> to map Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Option-&lt;some-key> to do things.</p>



<p>Suddenly have a whole keyboard of new shortcuts open up to you with Hyper-Something!</p>



<p>And I set about mapping Hyper-&lt;key> to applications so that I could go straight to them.</p>



<ul>
<li>Hyper-F opens Firefox</li>



<li>Hyper-P opens PHPStorm</li>



<li>Hyper-W opens Wavebox</li>



<li>Hyper-I opens iTerm</li>



<li>and so on.</li>
</ul>



<p>Direct access to apps. Sweet.</p>



<p>And I loved this approach.</p>



<p>But even Hyper Keys are a bit limited. I know I&#8217;ll sound selfish, but I wanted MORE!!!!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stream Deck</h3>



<p>So I tried out Elgato&#8217;s Stream Deck.</p>



<p>First as an app on my phone. This has a small subscription cost, but is a good way to try out the principle of a custom keypad without investing in the reasonably expensive hardware.</p>



<p>It worked REALLY nicely. So, as a treat to myself when I got my new job last year, I bought a proper Stream Deak (the 15-key version) in a sale. And it works really great. Go straight to any app without typing, remembering keyboard shortcuts, or multiple alt-tabs. It keeps me focussed on what I want to do.</p>



<p>There is a certain amount of remembering to use the Stream Deck at first. Alt-tab is STRONG in my muscle-memory! But it&#8217;s physical presence actually helps, drawing me back to it.</p>



<p>And with different pages of buttons I have a setup for when I&#8217;m on a call, for when I&#8217;m in my code editor, and shortcuts for opening websites and GitHub repos. It&#8217;s a great tool. Elgato&#8217;s software is pretty terrible (come on folks, do better!!), but this is also a recommended for going straight to apps without passing Go.</p>



<p>The problem with Stream Deck is&#8230; you need your Stream Deck. I don&#8217;t have it when I&#8217;m not in my office. And I&#8217;m not paying for the app if I also have the hardware. Annoying!</p>



<p>So I still like the Hyper-Key approach too. Even though it is a bit clumsy to set up.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">R-Cmd</h3>



<p>To finish off this journey then, one day I saw <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rcmd-app-switcher/id1596283165?mt=12">R-Cmd</a>&#8230; a really simple MacApp that says &#8220;Hey, stuff caps-lock, it&#8217;s the Right-Cmd key that you don&#8217;t need&#8221; (really, you don&#8217;t) &#8220;so here&#8217;s a really simple app that lets you set Right-Cmd-&lt;key> as a key to open an app.&#8221;</p>



<p>This is my Hyper-key setup, but SO much easier and with one app controlling it. Sure, it&#8217;s not as configurable, but I LOVE this way of doing things.</p>



<p>Am I completely, over-the-top obsessed with avoiding my mouse and pressing too many keys? YES! Unashamedly. For something I literally do hundreds of times a day, the ergonomics and minimalism in this are great.</p>



<p>Finally, finally, finally&#8230; if you want to take this to the next level then you need to read &#8220;<a href="https://tighten.com/blog/how-to-train-your-keyboard/">How to Train Your Keyboard</a>&#8221; (which also has <a href="https://twentypercent.fm/episodes/andrew-morgan-train-your-keyboard">an accompanying podcast episode</a>)</p>



<p>Now go, be productive and ditch YOUR mouse.</p>
