<p>The experimental &#8220;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/17/command-center-request-for-feedback/">command center</a>&#8221; is coming to WordPress core. What do I think of it? And what does it mean for my own &#8220;command palette&#8221; product, <a href="https://turbo-admin.com/">Turbo Admin</a>?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Short Story</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>I will continue to sell Turbo Admin, but I want you to buy it knowing that parts or all of it could become obsolete in the future. Possibly quite soon!</li>



<li>I won&#8217;t offer discounts at this point. Mostly because Turbo Admin is (in my opinion) ridiculously good value anyway!</li>



<li>While there is talk of a new admin design, and I&#8217;m sure it will be re-done in React JS, I don&#8217;t see the current admin being phased out any time soon. So Turbo Admin will continue to make the admin more useful.</li>



<li>I will continue to work on Turbo Admin and add new things to it. It&#8217;s a passion project, it has a small community of dedicated users who love it, and I&#8217;m not abandoning it.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s changing in core?</h2>



<p>Two things are changing in WordPress core that might affect Turbo Admin.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. A command centre is being added. Probably.</h3>



<p>WordPress is building what they call a &#8220;command center&#8221; in WordPress. It&#8217;s currently:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>experimental</li>



<li>available in <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">the Gutenberg plugin</a> (read the testing post linked below for instructions)</li>



<li>only currently available in the site editor screen</li>



<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/17/command-center-request-for-feedback/">open for testing and feedback</a>.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. A design refresh is coming. Maybe. Sometime.</h3>



<p>There are some <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/06/13/thinking-through-the-wordpress-admin-experience/">early discussions about a design refresh</a> for the WordPress Dashboard.</p>



<p>Given all the use of React components and libraries inside WordPress, I guess I knew this was coming. And a design refresh is long overdue. And much as I hate the idea of it being Reactified, I know that WordPress needs to move on and this is probably the way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How will these things affect Turbo Admin?</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Adding a command centre will clearly affect Turbo Admin as it will mean that the main function of Turbo Admin is now in WordPress core.<br><br>I&#8217;m hoping that the core command center can be disabled so that if people prefer Turbo Admin they can still use it!<br></li>



<li>Re-vamping the dashboard, however, could really affect Turbo Admin more broadly and prevent many of its <a href="https://turbo-admin.com/instructions.html">features</a> from working.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How do I feel about all of this?</h2>



<p>On the one hand, I built Turbo Admin because I wanted something like this in core. And now it&#8217;s coming to core. So &#8220;Yay&#8221;. But also, I&#8217;m sad that Turbo Admin may now have a limited life.</p>



<p>BUT&#8230; I recently spent some time working with some code that modified some things in the dashboard and I was reminded how many hooks into it there are, and how deeply people integrate with it.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t imagine they can write a React-based dashboard that&#8217;s fully backwards compatible with all the things that currently integrate with the dashboard.</p>



<p>So I have to believe that there will, for quite a long time, be a &#8220;classic dashboard&#8221; option. And Turbo Admin will continue to offer a bunch of dashboard improvements as long as that exists.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s coming next?</h2>



<p>I got distracted by life for a while. But I&#8217;m still implementing some new things in Turbo Admin &#8211; list table navigation improvements, and I really want to bring back my prototyped &#8220;dashboard widget hiding&#8221; feature.</p>



<p>No promises on timelines, but there will be a new release and it will do new fun things!</p>
