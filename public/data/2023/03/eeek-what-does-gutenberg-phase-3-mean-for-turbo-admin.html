<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Turbo Admin features to be in WordPress core! ðŸ™Œ</h2>



<p>TheÂ <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/24/phase-3-collaboration/">WordPressÂ Gutenberg Phase 3 announcement</a> is very interesting for me.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Because it will be disruptive for my <a href="https://turbo-admin.com/">Turbo Admin</a> plugin/browser extension.</p>



<p>An admin redesign is in the works which, especially if done in React, may make Turbo Admin impossible to run.</p>



<p>Fortunately they are also considering adding their own &#8220;global search &amp; command component&#8221; so Turbo Admin may no longer be needed (this is a GOOD thing &#8211; I&#8217;d much rather this were in core!)</p>



<p>They also want to refine list tables, which I&#8217;m currently working on enhancing with Turbo Admin! Again, this is great news because it benefits <em>everyone</em>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">I hate to say &#8220;I told you so&#8221;! ðŸ˜‰</h2>



<p>But you know what? </p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to take this as huge validation for my work â€“ turns out I was way ahead of the curve in some of this stuff!!</p>



<p>But it does present a dilemma: what to do with Turbo Admin!?</p>



<p>How long will it be until these new things exist?</p>



<p>Will there still be a need for it after an admin redesign?</p>



<p>Should I just open source it now and call it a day?</p>



<p>For now, I use Turbo Admin daily and would now find the WordPress dashboard pretty confusing without it.</p>



<p>It strikes me that so many plugins integrate deeply with the WordPress dashboard that making a new admin that doesn&#8217;t break everything will be a huge task. Especially when the main focus of Phase 3 is collaboration. The redesign seems like a side-quest.</p>



<p>So this won&#8217;t happen quickly. And my intention is to keep making Turbo Admin better &#8211; for me if not for everyone else.</p>



<p>But there are questions, and I&#8217;ll be figuring these things out in the coming months.</p>



<p>With thanks to all who love and support <a href="https://turbo-admin.com/">Turbo Admin</a>. It&#8217;s only $35 so it&#8217;s STILL good value if you want some of Gutenberg&#8217;s Phase 3 features in all your WordPress dashboards today!!</p>
