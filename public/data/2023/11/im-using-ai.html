<p>GitHub’s command line and AI-powered co-pilot suggest feature is a great combination.</p>



<p>I know I can use variables and loops and <code>wget</code> to grab a bunch of URLs that I want to save. But I don&#8217;t do this often enough to remember all the syntax nuances.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s ask copilot:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I want to loop through all months and days in the format MMDD (e.g. 1201 for December the 1st) and fetch a URL based on that date string. The URL needs to be of the format https://somewebsite.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?slug=&lt;date>. Use wget to fetch the URL. Save the contents in a file named after the date.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Note: I&#8217;m doing this to a free-to-view site that has arguably-open material and that has not been updated for YEARS to generate an interface to it entirely for my own use. I consider this fair use of the content. I am NOT re-publishing copyrighted work.</em></p>



<p>I really feel like this is where AI works well: as a productivity tool to boost human productivity, not as a replacement for human productivity.</p>



<p>In this case, removing friction from obtuse command-line stuff.</p>



<p>Next it will help me generate some code to fetch this saved data from JavaScript without me needing to look up the docs. It’s great.</p>



<p>Yesterday I tried ChatGPT&#8217;s voice chat interface. That was amazing too.</p>



<p>I do feel like a bunch of important and useful websites don&#8217;t get hits and kudos and advertising bucks when I use this way of finding out things. We need to sort that. This tech is amazing. But gosh I can see how it breaks the web.</p>
