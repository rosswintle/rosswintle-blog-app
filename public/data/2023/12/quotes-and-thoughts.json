They are on the snack aisle, the baking aisle and in the produce department.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various packet sizes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The actual requirement is something like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Ground Almonds, 150g for baking cake\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lesson: Think about what the other person needs to know to fulfil your requirement without needing further exchange of information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, further communication is needed, which slows you down. OR, the person makes their own assumptions (&#8220;here&#8217;s a 50g packet of flaked almonds!\u201d) and the whole process becomes blocked and rework is needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes longer to do the initial work, but you get your cake baked on time for the birthday party!!<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;I was coaching someone on how to be a better mentor recently. One perspective I shared is that while you can teach people better work habits, you can\u2019t teach them to care. That is intrinsic, only the person can choose to care about a job or problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can teach how to code, how to run meetings or how to write status reports. You can\u2019t teach them to give a shit.&#8221;<\/p>\n<cite>https:\/\/mas.to\/@carnage4life\/111576437786345840<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cLife is harder when you expect a lot of the world and little of yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life is easier when you expect a lot of yourself and little of the world.<br>High standards, low expectations.&#8221;<\/p>\n<cite>James Clear<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n",
