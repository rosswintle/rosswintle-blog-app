<p>There&#8217;s a lot going on right now and I&#8217;ve been having a lot of thoughts about what is going on. In some cases I think I&#8217;ve expressed these thoughts well. In other cases, other people have expressed things that have helped me.</p>



<p>Here are some quotes and thoughts&#8230;</p>

<p>Came up with a great analogy yesterday for how specific requirements help everyone:</p>



<p>I often do the grocery shopping.</p>



<p>My wife often lists things like “almonds”.</p>



<p>I arrive at the shop.</p>



<p>There are ground almonds, flaked almonds, blanched almonds, whole almonds. They are on the snack aisle, the baking aisle and in the produce department.</p>



<p>There are various packet sizes.</p>



<p>The actual requirement is something like:</p>



<p>&#8220;Ground Almonds, 150g for baking cake”</p>



<p>The lesson: Think about what the other person needs to know to fulfil your requirement without needing further exchange of information.</p>



<p>Otherwise, further communication is needed, which slows you down. OR, the person makes their own assumptions (&#8220;here&#8217;s a 50g packet of flaked almonds!”) and the whole process becomes blocked and rework is needed.</p>



<p>It takes longer to do the initial work, but you get your cake baked on time for the birthday party!!</p>

<p>&#8220;I was coaching someone on how to be a better mentor recently. One perspective I shared is that while you can teach people better work habits, you can’t teach them to care. That is intrinsic, only the person can choose to care about a job or problem.</p>



<p>You can teach how to code, how to run meetings or how to write status reports. You can’t teach them to give a shit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Life is easier when you expect a lot of yourself and little of the world.<br>High standards, low expectations.&#8221;</p>
