But&#8230; WHY???<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Some background<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I made a simple, app-like, completely static-file version of this site! It&#8217;s super-fast and pretty lightweight and it didn&#8217;t take very long. It&#8217;s here:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/m.rosswintle.uk\/\">https:\/\/m.rosswintle.uk\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s some of what I was trying to achieve and why&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Keeping it simple<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I find myself rebelling a lot against the complexity of modern web solutions. I&#8217;m a use-the-platform guy who firmly believes that the simple solutions are better, easier to make and maintain, faster, cheaper, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Proving things to myself<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m working with a lot of complexity at work: mostly building a headless site with React and Next.js and highly-scalable headless solutions involving many layers of caching and integration. This is right (maybe?) for the context of the work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve found myself wondering if a much simpler solution could achieve the same benefits &#8211; to <em>some<\/em> extent, at least.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to prove that there was a &#8220;headless&#8221; solution to websites that didn&#8217;t require node.js or a ton of heavy JavaScript framework code and a zillion dependencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Yes, I&#8217;m (probably) reinventing the wheel<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If I build a tool that scrapes all the content from the WordPress API and dumps it to some static format for serving as a static site, am I just making a poor-man&#8217;s Gatsby? Or Astro. Or&#8230; Next.js &#8211; the thing I&#8217;m proving that I don&#8217;t need? Or <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/simply-static\/\">Simply Static<\/a>? Is it not just what the JAMStack was doing all along for so many years?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, maybe. And one of the main reasons for using such a tool is that they handle all the complex edge cases that I&#8217;ve almost certainly not thought of yet and don&#8217;t have the constraints that I had. Probably the best reason I&#8217;ve been presented with for using Next.js for a web<em> site<\/em> (rather than a web <em>application<\/em>) is that if you start adding more and more code to handle features and use-cases, you end up with your own Next-like framework anyway, and it&#8217;s better to use a framework maintained by a framework expert! So I see the reasons you would do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I wanted to show what is possible with a very simple approach. It seems to me that you should be able to get a long way building a static site with a simple scraper script and a basic template.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with a bit of JavaScript, maybe using a small reactive framework, we can make it app-like too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Statically hosting all of this on a CDN means free hosting in the best case, and enormous scalability, and global edge serving in the other best case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I won&#8217;t do<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach had some hard constraints\/limitations:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>It will be slow to generate a large site<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It will need developer experience and tooling to use<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It won&#8217;t be able to do anything that requires server-side processing without some third party service (e.g. forms, signups, etc &#8211; though I DID find a way to do search!)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Template editing won&#8217;t be WYSIWYG &#8211; the resulting output will be pretty bland and made in HTML and CSS.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all limitations I&#8217;m happy to accept for my simple personal blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I made<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I made&#8230; it&#8217;s not finished, but it&#8217;s 80% of the way there:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/m.rosswintle.uk\/\">https:\/\/m.rosswintle.uk\/<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately the back-end is my regular WordPress blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The static version is built using a PHP-based CLI tool, using <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel-zero.com\/\">Laravel Zero<\/a> to scrape the content, restructure it and save it. It&#8217;s pretty efficient &#8211; the slowness is in the API queries. It builds my 750-page\/post site in about 80 seconds.<br><br>There&#8217;s then a simple HTML template and some <a href=\"https:\/\/alpinejs.dev\/\">AlpineJS<\/a> scripting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was really glad to stumble upon <a href=\"https:\/\/pagefind.app\/\">PageFind<\/a> &#8211; a tool that builds a static content index and that allows search. This makes everything a bit more dynamic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things I want to add in the future:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>History\/back\/forward navigation\/URL updates<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Page listing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ability to re-use the scrape\/build scripts across sites. They&#8217;re not quite site-agnostic yet, and I want to write some docs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a shorter list than I thought it would be before I started writing it! So that&#8217;s good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusions and thoughts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For many years I was pretty unimpressed by the JAMStack approach. I think because it always seemed to be querying some dynamic back-end anyway, so it felt like you had the complexity of a dynamic CMS AND the complexity of a dynamic front-end app, but without very much benefit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps I misunderstood. But it seemed like you had:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Static site generators: all static files, built at run time<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;JAMStack&#8221; sites: static templating, but pulling in dynamic content over an API<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As I&#8217;ve been moving from a &#8220;Spin up a WordPress site for every little project&#8221; approach to a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2023\/08\/free-websites-for-side-projects\/\">Make some static HTML files and host them for free<\/a>&#8221; approach, I&#8217;ve been thinking about how this model can be used more. It&#8217;s cheap. It&#8217;s secure. It&#8217;s fast. I love developing with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not what Next does. Next needs a back-end server and a zillion (ish) dependencies. And it&#8217;s better suited to applications that need lots of dynamic content, not a simple blog site. I remain that if you&#8217;re building a marketing site, the cost\/benefit of Next is low if not negative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s probably what <a href=\"https:\/\/astro.build\/\">Astro<\/a> does, but Astro also has &#8230; checks notes &#8230;  450 ish dependencies!! (Astro looks really interesting, very nicely done, and has <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.astro.build\/en\/guides\/cms\/wordpress\/#building-a-blog-with-wordpress-and-astro\">a guide on working with a WordPress blog\/site<\/a>!). There are probably other frameworks and site generators that can help too. I&#8217;m no expert in this area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My site has 93 JavaScript package dependencies, which is still too many, but most of them are via TailwindCSS which is entirely optional, which I trust, and which rarely breaks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My project also has a bunch of Composer\/PHP dependencies. But most of those are to create the CLI tool that does the scraping. These are not problematic. This stuff just works. It&#8217;s stable. And when it&#8217;s broken you get helpful errors. It&#8217;s not a world of pain like I find npm to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I proved the concept. I achieved my goals. I like this. It&#8217;s not perfect. But I will take it a bit further and see where I get to.<\/p>\n",
