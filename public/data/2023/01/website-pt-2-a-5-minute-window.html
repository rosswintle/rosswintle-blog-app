<p>Hi!</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not sure how this will go today. I don&#8217;t have much of a plan.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re building a website though.</p>



<p>Infrastructure is in place (See the last video).</p>



<p>The site is a simple index for a domain I own: veryuseful.app</p>



<p>I build small side projects on subdomains of this. And I want a landing page to show<br>what is there.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve seen a new component library for TailwindCSS recently called…</p>



<p>Sailboat!</p>



<p>So I&#8217;m going to try that out.</p>



<p>My CSS and front-end may be a bit rusty, so bear with me!</p>



<p>We&#8217;re working in VS Code…</p>



<p>My little starter kit doesn&#8217;t have hot reloading or anything, but I run the<br>build script in a loop…</p>



<p>Like this:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>> while true; do ./build.sh; sleep 5; done;</code></pre>



<p>Hang on &#8211; where IS this site?</p>



<p>Ah yes, veryuseful.test!</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s grab the card component…</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s see what the parts of this are.</p>



<p>Need to include it in the main template first!</p>



<p>What happened?</p>



<p>Ah! Didn&#8217;t save the card. Silly me.</p>



<p>Not helpful. I&#8217;ll do some more work and pick it up tomorrow.</p>



<p>Hopefully you see how the little framework is helpful though.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s at…</p>

<p>Good night!</p>
