<p>Yay! I made it to 10!</p>



<p>What&#8217;s that… 50 minutes of video. Not bad.</p>



<p>Now…</p>



<p>Today, let&#8217;s talk about something that you may, or may not, have noticed.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m on a Mac. And if you familiar with Mac&#8217;s you may be asking: &#8220;Where is the dock?&#8221; and &#8220;How is he switching apps without anything showing on the screen?&#8221;</p>



<p>Maybe you aren&#8217;t. And that&#8217;s OK too.</p>



<p>But I do try to use the keyboard as much as possible. Otherwise, the constant reaching for the mouse takes its toll on my arms and wrists. Plus, I find that with a little learning you can be a lot more efficient.</p>



<p>So:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>I hide the dock.</li>



<li>I could then Cmd-Tab to switch apps. That&#8217;s still possible.</li>



<li>But I learned about &#8220;Hyper Keys&#8221; once. A hyper key is where you map an unused key &#8211; normally caps-lock to some unused modifier key combination &#8211; usually Cmd-Alt-Ctrl-Shift. And then you can &#8220;Hyper-&lt;something>&#8221; and build up a set of new shortcuts. This was cool for a while.</li>



<li>Then I got a StreamDeck and used that to switch apps. That was fun.</li>



<li>THEN, I found a cheap, simple app called rcmd.</li>
</ul>



<p>rcmd kinda maps your right Cmd key to a sort-of hyper key<br>and then allows you to use it for switching applications. rcmd has a simple interface, and tries to work automatically. I&#8217;ve set it for things like</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>rcmd-V opens VS Code</li>



<li>rcmd-P opens PHPStorm</li>



<li>rcmd-A opens Arc &#8211; a web browser</li>



<li>rcmd-C opens Chrome</li>



<li>rcmd-I opens iTerm &#8211; my terminal.</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, after a bit of learning, I can switch around quickly and easily.</p>



<p>See? I LOVE this way of working!</p>
