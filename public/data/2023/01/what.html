<p>Yesterday I posted a nearly-silent video, with just some music, about PHP arrays and objects.</p>



<p>&#8220;That was weird&#8221;, I hear you say.</p>



<p>Yeah. Maybe. I was inspired by Aurooba though.</p>



<p>Gonna check that…</p>



<p>Yup &#8211; Aurooba &#8211; <a href="https://thedaily5.xyz/">https://thedaily5.xyz/</a></p>



<p>She&#8217;s doing a 5-minute podcast each day. And I really like the short-form format of it.</p>



<p>I have two kids though, and no dedicated space at home to make recordings like that.</p>



<p>And I can&#8217;t do it as part of my day job.</p>



<p>So I figured I&#8217;d try a silent video format!</p>



<p>&#8220;Why not a blog post, Ross?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yeah, I hear that too. And the answer is that I want to SHOW you things.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure this format isn&#8217;t perfect. It may not be any good at all. But I might try it for a bit and see what happens.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m aiming for relatively light touch. Little editing &#8211; you will see my mistakes!</p>



<p>And I encourage questions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>What&#8217;s your editor?</li>



<li>What&#8217;s that icon in your menu bar?</li>



<li>Why Light Mode?i</li>
</ul>



<p>Perhaps we can answer some of these questions as we go.</p>



<p>Tomorrow &#8211; or whenever I get time &#8211; I&#8217;ll get back to PHP and objects.</p>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t quite finished.</p>
