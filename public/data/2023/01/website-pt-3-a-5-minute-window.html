<p>Morning!</p>



<p>Or whatever time of day.</p>



<p>Yesterday was a bit longer than 5 minutes.</p>



<p>5 minutes is an aspiration, not a hard limit!</p>



<p>No apologies here!!</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s continue building a website.</p>



<p>We have the starter kit and I was adding my first card component. But it was a bit weird.</p>



<p>Turns out I just needed to wait for the build. It runs every 5 seconds.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start the loop again!</p>



<p>Nice. Here&#8217;s how we&#8217;re looking…</p>



<p>We&#8217;re working in VS Code… let&#8217;s sort that spacing!</p>



<p>That&#8217;ll do.</p>



<p>Now I want a grid. But…</p>



<p>CONFESSION!</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve never really used CSS Grid, so it&#8217;s flexbox all the way!!</p>



<p>Hmm… only one card! Weird.</p>



<p>Did I save? <em>facepalm</em></p>



<p>That will do for now.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll add some content offline, and maybe we can deploy in the next video!</p>
