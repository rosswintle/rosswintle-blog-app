<p>An observation from work.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m a senior developer, but I&#8217;m still a developer. I&#8217;m the &#8220;bottom of the pile&#8221;. I don&#8217;t pass work to others. They pass it to me. My job is really to shut up and do what I&#8217;m told.</p>



<p>I might do technical architecture and have technical opinions about HOW to do the things that I&#8217;m told. But I&#8217;m not supposed to do strategy and planning and determine WHAT to do.</p>



<p>Previously I was in a similar job working with IT systems at a low-level. Working with the bottom of the pile in a technical stack.</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s this weird thing about being bottom of the pile; about being the place that the work ends up at: you get to see a lot of things!</p>



<p>It seem backwards, or upside-down. But I keep finding myself in roles where I seem to have a much wider view than others above me.</p>



<p>When everyone needs something done on your system, you get a sometimes-uniquely-broad view of what&#8217;s going on. A bunch of different plans and strategies that can&#8217;t necessarily see each other all end up with actions that arrive at the bottom of the pile &#8211; with you!</p>



<p>So here&#8217;s the opportunity that you have as a bottom-of-the-pile developer: making connections!!!</p>



<p>It sounds odd because it&#8217;s a people thing, not a technology thing. And it may not be your strength. But there&#8217;s a chance that you are one of the few people who can see both &#8220;that thing up there&#8221; <em>and</em> &#8220;that thing over there&#8221;. So here&#8217;s my tip for levelling up and being a great developer:</p>



<p>Take responsibility for making connections! At the very least, ask the question: &#8220;I see that you want to me do &#8216;This&#8217;&#8230; but it might conflict with &#8216;That&#8217;. Are you aware of &#8216;That&#8217;?</p>



<p>This relates to another thought of mine. I remember hearing on a podcast once that a senior person should be faster at their work. This is why senior people get paid more &#8211; they get more done.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with this.</p>



<p>I mean, yes: if I know my task, and if I have focus time, I should &#8230; I <em>will</em> &#8230; be quicker at getting the job done.</p>



<p>But if you come to me with a request rather than a defined task, I say that a senior digs in; asks questions; finds out more; challenges assumptions; takes steps back to look at the broader picture; and does some &#8220;systems thinking&#8221;, before knuckling down.</p>



<p>That might slow you down. Possibly a LOT. But the difference is that it gets you <s>the right</s> a better result.</p>



<p>So: maybe you too are in a bottom-of-the-pile developer role? If so, don&#8217;t think you are unimportant. You might see things that no one else does. So take in the view; ask questions; make connections; think about the broader picture that you &#8211; and maybe only you &#8211; can see.</p>



<p>It could slow you down, but honestly, for the sake of asking a few questions about what you can see, you could also end up being a hero!</p>
