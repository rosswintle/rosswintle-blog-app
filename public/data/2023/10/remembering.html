<p>It sounds simple, but the concept of &#8220;remembering&#8221; has becoming really important to me. Not facts, or information, but people and situations.</p>



<p>We can so easily “forget” &#8211; just get on with our own things.</p>



<p>&#8220;Remembering” people &#8211; bringing them and their situations to mind &#8211; makes us mindful of their reality. And when we do that we gain empathy.</p>



<p>I sometimes try to do this when navigating a busy city. Noting that the people around me are… people! They have thoughts and feelings.</p>



<p>Perhaps they have a difficult situation they are working through and life is hard.</p>



<p>Perhaps they are celebrating.</p>



<p>Perhaps they are on their way to a job interview. Or an important meeting.</p>



<p>Perhaps they couldn&#8217;t pay their electricity bill today or visited a food bank.</p>



<p>Perhaps they have a Jewish friend.</p>



<p>Perhaps they know someone living in Gaza.</p>



<p>It can be overwhelming, realising that all those people passing by have complex inner lives and relationships.</p>



<p>And yet, it seems more critical than ever that we remember.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also overwhelming to think of people we don&#8217;t see.</p>



<p>People who, themselves, live &#8211; or are struggling to live &#8211; in Gaza&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8230;</p>



<p>People who are on the front-line in Ukraine&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8230;</p>



<p>People working in hospitals in war zones&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8230;</p>



<p>People digging through rubble to find their child or sibling or parent&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8230;</p>



<p>It is overwhelming. And it&#8217;s OK to not focus on it all day long. To distract yourself. To switch off.</p>



<p>But we must remember.</p>



<p>For if we don&#8217;t remember, we don&#8217;t have empathy; we are, as I once heard, &#8220;like a cow looking at cars. You know, a cow looks at a car. They watch it. But nothing&#8217;s going on. When you drive past a cow [in Ireland] it looks up, it watches, but there&#8217;s nothing going on inside. And then it goes back to eating. That&#8217;s how we treat people in daily life&#8230; you don&#8217;t really see them. They&#8217;re just objects. They are functions.&#8221;</p>
