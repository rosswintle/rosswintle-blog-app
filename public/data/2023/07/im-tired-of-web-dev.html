<p>I&#8217;m tired of web dev. I won&#8217;t stop working on it, but I&#8217;m tired.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve never been a natural front-end dev. I&#8217;d much rather be working on APIs, databases, command-line tools, algorithms, and so on. But I work full-stack.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m tired.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m tired of resolving complex, but poorly explained npm dependency issues.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m tired of debugging multi-layer caching issues.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m tired of testing and merging dependabot PRs.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m tired of trying to learn React and its idiosyncrasies when it&#8217;s a constantly moving target.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m tired of choosing between Next and Astro and npm and yarn and Bun and Deno and webpack and esbuild and Vite and SWC.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m tired of wondering where the heck WordPress is going and of logging in to something that&#8217;s changed again and that still feels like it&#8217;s shunned all the UI conventions that I know. And of wondering what all the people excited by this see that I don&#8217;t.</p>



<p>The web used to be fun and simple and easy to get stuff done with. Now it&#8217;s discovering that someone who doesn&#8217;t know what they were doing used a <code>div</code> instead of a <code>button</code> and fixing it involves half a day of frustratedly poking around files that make no sense and fixing a broken build process.</p>



<p>Is any other software process better?</p>



<p>Yes, I truly believe this is a bad world. Marketing hype has taken over, burdening us with perpetual intellectual and technical debt. Giving the illusion of helping us while actually hindering us.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m convinced that there MUST be a LOAD of JS/web developers who are killing it. Who have sharpened their tools and knowledge to such an extent that this world is one of wonder and awe.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I love learning new things. And am willing to do whatever is needed to get the job done. But I&#8217;m just not convinced that the things that the world says I &#8220;should&#8221; learn and use are the right things to learn and use. They may seem better for the short term &#8220;wow factor&#8221;. But they so quickly seem to become problematic, fragile, or obsolete. And yet the world keeps saying that they are the things I should learn and use.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t get it. It makes no sense to me.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m so tired.</p>
