<p>Last night I gave a talk at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Cheltenham-WordPress-Meetup">Cheltenham WordPress Meetup</a> on the amazing toolkit called &quot;(Developer) Tools&quot; in your web browser.</p>

<p>The group is very mixed in terms of technical ability so this was a great topic, and I put &quot;Developer&quot; in brackets because there&#x27;s something in Developer Tools for all website creators, regardless of whether or not you can code.</p>



<p>You can see the <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/rosswintle/developer-tools-the-amazing-toolkit-inside-your-browser">slides from the talk</a>, and they are embedded below. They&#x27;re not ALL that useful because most of the talk was a live demo of developer tools features. But the last couple of slides have some useful links and keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dev Tools Tutorial Videos</h3>



<p>I&#x27;m also making a bunch of videos on my free <a href="https://press-ups.com/">Press Ups</a> tutorial video site about Developer Tools. So head over to the <a href="https://press-ups.com/2017/11/web-browser-dev-tools-part-1-mobile-website-testing/">first video there about mobile/responsive testing</a> and, if you&#x27;re interested and want more, you can sign up for email notifications of new videos, or click through to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/pressupswp">YouTube channel</a> and subscribe to that.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dev Tools for Remote Mobile Device </h3>



<p>Finally, I had one question about an advanced topic that I didn&#x27;t have time to cover on the night. I had mentioned that you could plug in a mobile device and &quot;inspect&quot; the contents of web pages showing on that device.</p>



<p>This is easier on a Mac than on Windows, but it is possible.</p>



<p>On a Mac you can plug an iOS device in and debug it from Safari as shown below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Recording-2017-11-09-at-10.08-am.gif" alt="Animation showing how to open dev tools for an iOS device in Safari" /></figure>



<p>In Chrome you can plug in an Android device and run dev tools on it from inside Chrome.  Instructions for that are in the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging/">Dev Tools documentation</a>.</p>



<p>There&#x27;s a few set-up steps you&#x27;ll need to take before this will work. On Windows you may need to install USB drivers, and in all cases you&#x27;ll need to <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options.html">enable developer options</a> and flip a toggle switch on the Android device.  But you only do that once and then you&#x27;re ready to go!</p>
