<p>How do you get from &#8220;Who&#8217;s under R2D2?&#8221; to voice dubbing in iMovie?</p>



<p>I: Who&#8217;s under R2D2?<br>Me: Under?!<br>I: Yes, who&#8217;s the real one under R2D2?<br>Me: Oh, you mean who&#8217;s the person controlling him?<br>I: Yes<br>Me: I don&#8217;t know<br>I: Well, who&#8217;s under Obe Wan Kenobi?<br>Me: Ah, I know that one. That&#8217;s a man called &#8220;Alec Guiness&#8221;<br>I: And who&#8217;s under Luke Skywalker?<br>Me: Ah, I know that too. That&#8217;s a man called Mark Hamill<br>I: And who&#8217;s under Darth Vader<br>Me: Hmm&#8230;that&#8217;s complicated. The man dressed as Darth Vader is a very tall man from Somerset, but I don&#8217;t know his name. But someone different does his voice.<br>I: *thinks* What do you mean? Does he hold something? (I assume he means a microphone or speaker or something).<br>Me: No. They&#8230;.hmm&#8230;.let me show you&#8230;</p>
