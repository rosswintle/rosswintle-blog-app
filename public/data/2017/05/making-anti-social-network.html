<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">On making an anti-social network</h1></header><main><p>So I have this silly side project on the go. It&#8217;ll never be anything big &#8211; I&#8217;m just scratching an itch as always. But you&#8217;re always wondering &#8220;what if&#8230;?&#8221;.</p>
<p>And this side project allows people to post short notices. It&#8217;s a niche social network, in effect.</p>
<p>But when you&#8217;re developing something where people can post anything, you start down the road of thinking about terms and conditions, getting permission/licences to publish content, acceptable use rules, even the possibility of moderation and blocking.</p>
<p>So, I think I&#8217;ve decided that this really is not worth it. I don&#8217;t want to build a niche social network. It seems like an exciting prospect at first, but it only takes a little thought to realise that it&#8217;s a bad idea.</p>
<p>So, if anything I (may) be building a niche anti-social network.</p>
<p>Will it ever see the light of day? I both hope so, and suspect not. Let&#8217;s see.</p>
