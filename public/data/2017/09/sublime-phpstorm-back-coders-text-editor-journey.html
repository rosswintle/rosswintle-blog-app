Actually, it was a really good exercise, and here&#8217;s why.</strong></p>
<p>I was chatting with my friend Keiron today about text editors. I recently followed him in transitioning from <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> to <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PHPStorm</a>. But I explained to him that I&#8217;d been using Sublime Text for a big project recently and that sparked a bit of discussion.</p>
<p>For one thing, switching BACK to the less-functional-but-much-faster Sublime has forced me to make it work better. I fixed an issue I had where SCSS files weren&#8217;t recognised, and suddenly I had both regular CSS text expansion/completion back, and <a href="https://emmet.io/">Emmet</a>-style coding back working which was a boon for writing lots of CSS. (An animated GIF will eventually load below showing you Emmet-style coding &#8211; and check the amazing <a href="https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/">cheat sheet</a> full of abbreviations!)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also made me realise how much I value certain aspects of PHPStorm. Probably the biggest example is having it auto-import classes for me. When you&#8217;re in Laravel and you type <code>Auth::something()</code> and you&#8217;ve not imported the <code>Auth</code> facade and you have think:</p>
<p><em> &#8220;Where the hell is it? <code>Illuminate\Something\Somethingelse\Facades\User</code> or somewhere.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>PHPStorm both points out that you&#8217;ve forgotten to import it, AND offers to help you fix it. Amazing. (After a while a GIF may load below showing you PHPStorm doing it&#8217;s thing!)</p>

<p>BUT&#8230;being forced to type <code>use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth</code> every time or even just <code>use App\User</code> or whatever, has really helped reinforce Laravel&#8217;s project structure in my &#8220;muscle memory&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be back in PHPStorm soon, but it&#8217;s good to know I&#8217;m still a mean coder in Sublime, and a better one for having switched to it for a short while.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an advanced IDE user, try ditching it for a while. You might learn something, or you might find your old editor, with a bit of work, can be made to work OK after all.</p>
