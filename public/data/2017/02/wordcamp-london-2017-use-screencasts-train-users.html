<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">WordCamp London 2017: How and why to use screencasts to train users</h1></header><main><p>I had a blast last year at <a href="https://2016.london.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp London</a> and got some great feedback on <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2016/05/28/ross-wintle-user-experience-its-for-everyone/">my talk</a> &#8211; my first go at big conference speaking. So I was encouraged to apply to speak again at <a href="https://2017.london.wordcamp.org/">this year&#8217;s event</a>.</p>
<p>Despite being a highly technical person, I find the idea of doing a technical talk quite hard, and I assume that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lots</span> of technical people apply to speak about technical things at WordCamps. So, as with last year, I&#8217;ve tried to give a technical person&#8217;s view on something non-technical.  This year: how and why you can use screencasts for user training.</p>
<p>I should clarify a few things about this talk.</p>
<h2>The term &#8220;screencasts&#8221;</h2>
<p>OK, naming things is hard.  I&#8217;ve used the term &#8220;screencasts&#8221; because it&#8217;s kinda trendy.  The &#8220;screen&#8221; bit of it is fine &#8211; I will be talking about sharing what&#8217;s going on on your screen with others.  But the &#8220;casts&#8221; part could be interpreted as being like a &#8220;broadcast&#8221;. So I want to make clear that I&#8217;ll be talking about private screen recordings that you produce <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> for your clients, more than I will be talking about public screencast training like you might see on <a href="https://www.lynda.com/">Lynda.com</a>, <a href="https://www.wp101.com/">WP101</a>, <a href="https://laracasts.com/">Laracasts</a>, and so on.  This is not a talk about becoming a public training figure and running public courses &#8211; though I will challenge listeners to give something back to the WordPress community!</p>
<p>So, maybe &#8220;screen recordings&#8221;, or, more generically &#8220;videos&#8221; is more appropriate. But I like &#8220;screencasts&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that I&#8217;ll be covering use of video both with and without narration, and the use of animated GIF&#8217;s. So don&#8217;t worry if you hate the sound of your own voice &#8211; there&#8217;s still some great value tips and tricks in here.</p>

<h2>Not just &#8220;to train users&#8221;</h2>
<p>OK, naming things is hard. I&#8217;ve put &#8220;to train users&#8221; in the title of my talk for brevity, and that&#8217;s a major topic. But actually the uses for screen recordings go beyond training. I&#8217;ll be talking about using screen recordings for customer support, software development, internal communications, and possibly marketing too.</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s not for everyone, but actually, it is for everyone!</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m really aware that I&#8217;m presenting an alternative to in-person training. For me this is a real boon because though happy users are incredibly important to me, software development is my main area of expertise and where I bring most value.  I  also do most of my work remotely for smaller clients with smaller budgets. So in my world in-person training is expensive and has several drawbacks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> business makes money from in-person training. And in which case this talk may not be for you. BUT&#8230;hear me out. Because I think that screen-recorded training can make a great addition to personal, face-to-face events. And I&#8217;ll explain why that is the case</p>
<h2>Interested? Let&#8217;s go!</h2>
<p>Sound interesting? Well, if not then maybe something else on <a href="https://2017.london.wordcamp.org/schedule/">the schedule</a> does. I&#8217;m really excited at this years range of talks. And the event is being so very thoughtfully organised with accessibility at its core, a creche for parents, and so many brilliant little touches. And if you&#8217;re attending the conference, ask me about the contributor day on the Friday too &#8211; it&#8217;s a brilliant way to be involved in WordPress and far less scary than it actually sounds.</p>
<p>Tickets are&#8230;I still can&#8217;t quite believe it&#8230;just £30! And they&#8217;re selling fast. As I write this there are just 28 left. Go visit the <a href="https://2017.london.wordcamp.org/tickets/">box office</a> now!  And if your nervous or have any questions about WordCamps then drop me a line.</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
