<p>A couple of weeks ago I fixed a broken window in our shed. After doing so we noticed a robin in the shed. It didn&#8217;t seem to want to come out. We left the door open hoping it would fly out eventually. &nbsp;I guess we eventually shut the door not knowing the fate of the robin.</p>
<p>Well, today I was doing some tidying and found a plastic box with&#8230; well&#8230; &nbsp;with a load of random organic stuff in it.</p>
<p>Closer inspection revealed the sad nature of the random organic stuff.</p>
