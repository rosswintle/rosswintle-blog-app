<p>So this all started with a trip to the <a href="https://www.at-bristol.org.uk/">atBristol science centre</a> on Tuesday (it&#8217;s school holidays).</p>
<p>There was a small interactive video exhibit called &#8220;Will it fly?&#8221; which just showed you videos of bizarre early attempts at flight, including the epic-fail of the Gerhardt Cycle Plane.</p>

<p>Bedtime is nigh, and we&#8217;re about to have supper (which falls between bathtime and actually going to bed) when the child declares &#8220;I want to see &#8216;Will it fly?'&#8221;</p>
<p>So while porridge rotates in the microwave we pull out YouTube to see if we can find anything from &#8220;Will it fly&#8221;.</p>
<p>Amazingly, a YouTube search for &#8220;Will it fly&#8221; reveals a channel called &#8220;Flite Test&#8221; who do a series called &#8220;Will it fly&#8221; and the second of these results appears to be a video of them building and test-flying Â a 10ft-tall replica CyclePlane.</p>

<p>Incredible! It works! (All be it in slighty-modified and battery-powered fashion)</p>
<p>Anyway, in the related results is then the same people making a 9ft-wide flying model of an Imperial Star Destroyer!</p>

<p>We then get talking about building planes and electronics and remote controls and how a drone might be easier to fly (or not) and how there might be a Millennium Falcon drone and&#8230;.</p>
<p>Yes, this is why bedtime takes so long.</p>
