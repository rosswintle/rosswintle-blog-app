<p>I was in my car. I saw you from afar and had resolved to cheer you on. At first I wasn&#8217;t sure if you were a man, because of your curly hair, but you were. A dad on a pink scooter, chasing down a young girl, also on her scooter, in a way that feigned that you were trying hard, but you were clearly letting her win.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d been thinking, in the previous few days, about how you don&#8217;t see parents, and especially dads, playing in public with their children much.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d been wondering why it was that when groups of parents and children gather, children somehow gravitate to me and talk to me.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;d been realising that it&#8217;s because I play. I kneel. I ask. With children. In public.</p>
<p>And this, to my great sadness, is unusual.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m a bit of a show off. And in later years I&#8217;ll be hugely embarrassing. </p>
<p>But I want to talk to my children when we&#8217;re out and about. And I want to make everyday activities fun. And I want to explore and laugh.</p>
<p>I feel weird because most children seem to be left to play by themselves in public. Or strapped in a buggy and ignored.</p>
<p>So when I saw you: a grown man, on a three-wheeled, pink, Barbie scooter; in public; clearly having fun with your daughter (?); unashamed; and clearly enjoying yourself too, yes, I cheered you on.</p>
<p>I admired and respected your attitude. And I wanted to encourage it. It was a beautiful thing to see and it made me smile.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry if you thought I was weird.</p>
<p>Race sometime?</p>
