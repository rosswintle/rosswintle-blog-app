But I have a talk idea that I&#8217;d like to run past people too.<\/p>\n<p>In another post that&#8217;s not written yet, I will talk about how I come across lots of people who start as WordPress users, then tentatively edit themes, and eventually start writing PHP code to change or enhance their websites, without ever getting a proper understanding of the code they are writing.<\/p>\n<p>This seems to be the path of many a WordPress developer. And I recently heard from two very successful WordPress professionals that this was their path, and therefore it is the recommended way to learn WordPress development. I was startled to hear no mention of learning about coding principles as a part of this journey to become a WordPress developer.<\/p>\n<p>I, personally, think that learning coding principles can both help you learn faster, and give you a much greater problem solving ability.<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;I have this brewing idea for a talk &#8211; possibly for WordCamp London, possibly for elsewhere &#8211; that is a <em>very<\/em> quick overview of basic coding principles. For those that already know what these are, I&#8217;d cover things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>variables and types<\/li>\n<li>expressions<\/li>\n<li>conditionals<\/li>\n<li>functions<\/li>\n<li>(the VERY basics of&#8230;) scope<\/li>\n<li>control structures<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In testing the water for this idea I guess I have a few questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is this something you&#8217;d be interested in?<\/li>\n<li>Do you think I&#8217;d be able to cover enough ground in 30 minutes?<\/li>\n<li>Is it a good idea, but one for which a conference talk is the wrong format?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Use the comments to let me know! And thanks in advance for your input.<\/p>\n",
