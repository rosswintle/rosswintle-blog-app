<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">So, 2017, should I propose a WordCamp talk on coding basics?</h1></header><main><p>Yes, it&#8217;s the third of January and I&#8217;m writing a blog post so you&#8217;d be quite entitled to think that I&#8217;ve started some new year&#8217;s resolution to write more and am already three two days behind. Â And, well, that&#8217;s not strictly true, but it is partly true.</p>
<p>What I <em>have</em> been doing is putting together some ideas for conference talks for the year. <a href="https://2017.london.wordcamp.org/2016/12/20/call-for-speakers/">Applications</a> (and <a href="https://2017.london.wordcamp.org/tickets/">tickets</a>) are open for WordCamp London which I&#8217;m hoping to at least attend. But I have a talk idea that I&#8217;d like to run past people too.</p>
<p>In another post that&#8217;s not written yet, I will talk about how I come across lots of people who start as WordPress users, then tentatively edit themes, and eventually start writing PHP code to change or enhance their websites, without ever getting a proper understanding of the code they are writing.</p>
<p>This seems to be the path of many a WordPress developer. And I recently heard from two very successful WordPress professionals that this was their path, and therefore it is the recommended way to learn WordPress development. I was startled to hear no mention of learning about coding principles as a part of this journey to become a WordPress developer.</p>
<p>I, personally, think that learning coding principles can both help you learn faster, and give you a much greater problem solving ability.</p>
<p>So&#8230;I have this brewing idea for a talk &#8211; possibly for WordCamp London, possibly for elsewhere &#8211; that is a <em>very</em> quick overview of basic coding principles. For those that already know what these are, I&#8217;d cover things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>variables and types</li>
<li>expressions</li>
<li>conditionals</li>
<li>functions</li>
<li>(the VERY basics of&#8230;) scope</li>
<li>control structures</li>
</ul>
<p>In testing the water for this idea I guess I have a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this something you&#8217;d be interested in?</li>
<li>Do you think I&#8217;d be able to cover enough ground in 30 minutes?</li>
<li>Is it a good idea, but one for which a conference talk is the wrong format?</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the comments to let me know! And thanks in advance for your input.</p>
