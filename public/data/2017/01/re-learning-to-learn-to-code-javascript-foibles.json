I&#8217;ve previously said that I think JavaScript is like the assembler of the web: coding in vanilla JS isn&#8217;t really something you should do because it&#8217;s too easy to get things wrong, so you should have a layer of abstraction on top.<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;oddly&#8230;I&#8217;ve actually really got into vanilla JS.<\/p>\n<p>I was thinking about the origin of this and I think it was that I got stuck reading ES6 code, or was baffled by it in the <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/learning-vue-step-by-step\">Laracasts Vue.js tutorials<\/a>. So I started doing <a href=\"https:\/\/es6.io\/\">Wes Bos&#8217;s ES6 tutorials<\/a> (paid but excellent &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/laracasts.com\/series\/es6-cliffsnotes\">Laracasts also now has an ES6\/ES2015 series<\/a>) and it kinda went from there.<\/p>\n<p>On suggestion from a friend, I got a couple of\u00a0Kyle Simpson\u2019s excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/wordery.com\/search?term=you+don%27t+know+js&#038;oid=1625_1\">You Don\u2019t Know JS books<\/a> (<- Note: affiliate link!), and have got stuck into the first one: Up and Going. Which is short (about 50 pages of real content), but...well.\n\nMy mind has been blown.\n\n\n<h2>JS: Behind the scenes<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m the kinda person that likes to know what&#8217;s going on behind the scenes. And I&#8217;ve never really understood exactly how JavaScript works. And so learning it form first principles is quite revelatory. It&#8217;s actually very different to other languages that I was brought up on in quite a number of ways. So no wonder it always baffled and freaked me out a little.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the quirks\/oddities\/differences that I&#8217;ve discovered along the way.<\/p>\n<h3>Values are typed, variables are not<\/h3>\n<p>Yep. This may seem obvious, but it&#8217;s actually quite a shift of thinking from someone who&#8217;s previously coded in strictly-typed languages. I&#8217;ve never even come across the phrase &#8220;values are typed&#8221; before.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean?<\/p>\n<p>Well, in other languages you have typed variables. So when you declare a variable you give it a type:<\/p>\n<p><code>int age = 0;<\/code><\/p>\n<p>for example. This can be handy because the program can detect when a value that is not an integer is assigned to the variable, which can catch errors. But it&#8217;s also constraining because you can&#8217;t assign, say, a <code>null<\/code>\u00a0or <code>false<\/code>\u00a0value to say that there isn&#8217;t a number yet.<\/p>\n<p>Does it affect how I code? Probably not. But it&#8217;s good to know and understand.<\/p>\n<h3>Equality shenanigans<\/h3>\n<p>On top of type coercion (more below) when doing equality, and issues with comparing references (also see below) there&#8217;s also this list of unusual values and their equal-nesses. \u00a0Some of these are really quite bizarre:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>0 === -0\u00a0\/\/ \u00a0true - what the heck is -0 anyway?<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code>NaN === NaN \/\/ false, because NaN is defined to be unequal to any other value<\/code><\/li>\n<li>and so on<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What does this mean? Well, it&#8217;s just stuff you need to know.<\/p>\n<p>Does it affect how I code? Not in a big way. It may help with debugging when values aren&#8217;t what you expect them to be.\u00a0It&#8217;s knowledge that&#8217;s also helpful for the odd challenges at &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/alf.nu\/ReturnTrue\">return true<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<h3>Objects\/Arrays\/etc are assigned and passed as references<\/h3>\n<p>Forgive me if I don&#8217;t get my terminology exactly right, but &#8220;non-primitive&#8221; values like objects and arrays are passed around as references.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean?<\/p>\n<p>Well, if the same object is assigned to two variables &#8211; which is possible because assignment is of the reference and not a copied value &#8211; then updating one will update the other:<\/p>\n<pre>let a = {\r\n  x: 1,\r\n  y: 2\r\n};\r\nlet b = a;\r\nb.x = 4;\r\nconsole.log(a);\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>Logs:<\/p>\n<pre>[object Object] {\r\n  x: 4,\r\n  y: 2\r\n}<\/pre>\n<p>Does it affect how I code? Yes. Stuff like this is REALLY good to know.<\/p>\n<h3>Objects\/Arrays\/etc equality is not by value<\/h3>\n<p>The fact that non-primitives are assigned and passed by reference also means that comparisons are also made on references, not values.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean? So you have:<br \/>\n<code>[1,2,3] == [1,2,3] \/\/ false - they are two different arrays<\/code><br \/>\nAnd also, if you want to copy an array you have to do it via some other means than simple assignment (the ES6 rest\/spread operator helps here).<\/p>\n<p>I also learned that when coerced to a string, arrays are joined with a comma!:<br \/>\n<code>[1,2,3] == \"1,2,3\" \/\/ true!<\/code><br \/>\nDoes this affect how I code?<\/p>\n<p>Yes. Be careful with non-primitives!<\/p>\n<h3>Object wrappers &#8211; e.g. `String` vs `string`<\/h3>\n<p>I confess I still don&#8217;t understand this &#8211; need to do more reading. But:<\/p>\n<pre>typeof(\"a\"); \/\/\u00a0gives \"string\"<\/pre>\n<p>but string values are actually &#8220;wrapped&#8221; by the type <code>String<\/code>. And this &#8220;wrapping&#8221; is also true for all primitive types. \u00a0So you can see this:<\/p>\n<pre>a = new String;\r\n\r\ntypeof(a); \/\/ gives \"object\"\r\n<\/pre>\n<p>I&#8217;m not quite sure what it means yet and I don&#8217;t think it will affect my programming. But who knows what else I&#8217;ll find out?<\/p>\n<h3>Inequality not the same as (symmetric) non-equality &#8211; WHAT?!?!<\/h3>\n<p>This line appears in one of the books and also, at first, confused me:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The ! forms [of equality operators] are of course the symmetric &#8220;not equal&#8221; versions of their counterparts; <em>non-equality<\/em> should not be confused with <em>inequality<\/em>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s later on made&#8230;hmm&#8230;clearer (?) that <em>inequality<\/em> is the greater-than, less-than and so-on conditional operators.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean? Oh. Well. Nothing. It was an interesting interlude though.<\/p>\n<p>Onwards. What else?<\/p>\n<h3>Oh. Equality?<\/h3>\n<p>So with the knowledge that values, not variables, are typed, some other things need to be put into place.<\/p>\n<p>One of which is the equality operators. They aren&#8217;t &#8220;typed equality&#8221; and &#8220;untyped equality&#8221;. They\u00a0are actually compare-without-coercion and compare-with-coercion.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean? Well, it means that understanding the coercion can help you understand how to write correct conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Does this\u00a0affect my code? \u00a0I think so, in subtle ways. It should make things a bit more predictable.<\/p>\n<h3>Hoisting applies to functions too&#8230;sort of?<\/h3>\n<p>I only learned about variable hoisting recently while learning about <code>let<\/code>\u00a0and <code>const<\/code>\u00a0in ES6.<\/p>\n<p>With non-ES6 <code>var<\/code>\u00a0declarations, if you make them in the middle of a scope they are &#8220;hoisted&#8221; to the top of the scope. So when the code is running, the variable exists in an undefined state in the scope until the point of the <code>var<\/code>\u00a0declaration. \u00a0Best explained in an example. Here we use a variable without ever declaring it (you&#8217;ll need to put this in a file and run it, not just type it into the console):<\/p>\n<pre>console.log(x);\r\n\r\n&gt;\u00a0ReferenceError: x is not defined<\/pre>\n<p>Then if we use the variable before later declaring it:<\/p>\n<pre>console.log(x);\r\n\r\nvar x = 4;\r\n\r\n&gt; undefined<\/pre>\n<p>Spot the difference!<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean?<\/p>\n<p>Well not much in reality, though it was good to understand.<\/p>\n<p>What is interesting is that function declaration is also effectively variable declaration, and so functions can be used before they are declared&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>But&#8230;oh&#8230;hang on. \u00a0They&#8217;re hoisted AND DEFINED!:<\/p>\n<pre>foo();\r\n\r\nfunction foo() {\r\n console.log('foo');\r\n}\r\n\r\n&gt; \"foo\"<\/pre>\n<p>That&#8217;s not <code>undefined<\/code>. OK. I&#8217;m curious now. So what happens if I&#8230;:<\/p>\n<pre>bar();\r\n\r\nvar bar = function() {\r\n console.log('bar');\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; TypeError: bar is not a function<\/pre>\n<p>Oh. Well, that&#8217;s not entirely simple then.<\/p>\n<p>Will this affect my code? Probably not, but it&#8217;s good to know how both variables and functions are hoisted, even if the behaviour is slightly different in a way that I don&#8217;t currently understand.<\/p>\n<h3>Initial variable assignment without var makes a global<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;d forgotten this! I used to not use <code>var<\/code>\u00a0at all when declaring variables and was forever accidentally making globals.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean? \u00a0That I&#8217;ve already been on a journey of learning JavaScript long enough that I&#8217;ve forgotten about this.<\/p>\n<p>Will it affect my code? Well, no. But it&#8217;s a good reminder of how far I&#8217;ve come, even before the last few months.<\/p>\n<h2>What do I think of JS now?<\/h2>\n<p>Well so far so geeky. \u00a0Let&#8217;s wrap up.<\/p>\n<p>This almost feels more like research than practical learning. Though I&#8217;m hopeful that learning these things will have very positive practical benefits. I&#8217;m coming to know JavaScript as a fascinating and mis-understood teenager of a language.<\/p>\n<p>I still don&#8217;t like it. I <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2013\/12\/treachery-code\/\">still wouldn&#8217;t want anyone to learn it as a first language<\/a>. In fact, in some ways, understanding it more reinforces this view.<\/p>\n<p>JavaScript is a language of enigma and subtlety. Things are not always what they seem. And choosing to know it deeply is not, actually, something for the beginner coder (or the faint-hearted).<\/p>\n<p>I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed a little tour of some of the subtleties. I hope that you have learned something new. And I hope that you are encouraged to learn more!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",
