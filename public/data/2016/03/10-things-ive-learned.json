        "rendered": "<p>My friend\/colleague\/client Huw, has posted <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@huwtyler\/10thingsivelearned-4e36c39af437#.ncbly6484\">10 things he&#8217;s learned recently<\/a> and challenged me to do the same. So here goes. 10 things I&#8217;ve learned recently.<\/p>\n<h3>1. All children really are different<\/h3>\n<p>You hear this a lot as a parent. And as we&#8217;ve had the recent addition of a second baby to our existing family of three, I can confirm that, despite having the same genes to work with, we&#8217;ve turned out two VERY different little Wintles. People say &#8216;ah but you&#8217;re a different parent the second time &#8211; you know what you&#8217;re doing&#8217;. And there is truth in that. The first bit at least. But our two kids are definitely polar opposite characters.<\/p>\n<h3>2. That you can sometimes give yourself a job title<\/h3>\n<p>I came across a guy recently who gave himself a job title that he had invented. I&#8217;ve actually already done this &#8211; my self-assigned job title at my own company Oikos is &#8216;<a href=\"https:\/\/oikos.digital\/about\/\">Creator &#8211; Engineer -Advisor<\/a>&#8216;. But as I&#8217;ve become more and more interested in the field of user experience and usability I&#8217;m working out at what point I&#8217;m allowed to call myself a UX&#8217;er of some sort. And then <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dogwonder\">Rich Holman<\/a> turns up and he has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dogwonder.co.uk\/2012\/01\/30\/why-i-am-a-ux-developer\/\">a VERY similar journey to my own, and he&#8217;s called himself a UX developer<\/a>, and I wonder if, actually, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to become and call myself one day.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Halo orbits and that piece of Apollo kit that&#8217;s flying around the solar system<\/h3>\n<p>Random space facts. The other day I came across this animation of an object that came between the earth and the moon several times back in 2002 called <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/J002E3\">J002E3<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" src=\"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/39\/J002e3f_orbit.gif\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This object was originally thought to be an asteroid, but they now think it&#8217;s actually part of one of the rockets that launched the Apollo space missions. Bonkers.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, at about the same time I came across the brilliant <a href=\"https:\/\/www.popchartlab.com\/products\/the-chart-of-cosmic-exploration\">Chart of Cosmic Exploration on Pop Chart Lab<\/a>\u00a0which I hope you can still see. This contains reference to something called ISEE-3 which seems to be in orbit around the sun on the diagram &#8211; at least for some of its life. Anyway, I <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/International_Cometary_Explorer\">looked that up<\/a> and it&#8217;s a thing that was put into what&#8217;s called a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Halo_orbit\">halo orbit<\/a>&#8220;, which is where an object can orbit a thing called a Lagrange point, which is a point in space affected by the gravity of two other bodies. Anyway, you can be in orbit around nothing it would seem. And that&#8217;s cool.<\/p>\n<h3>4. I am a highly sensitive person&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>&#8230;and there&#8217;s a 20-ish% chance that you might be too!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll keep harping on about the &#8220;high sensitivity&#8221; character trait because it&#8217;s been a revelation to my family and I suspect I know people who are highly sensitive (or people know people who are highly sensitive) who could really benefit from hearing about it. \u00a0Stop hanging around here and <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2015\/07\/highly-sensitive\/\">READ THIS<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>5. I AM CREATIVE&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>&#8230;and there&#8217;s a 100% chance that you are too.<\/p>\n<p>I learned this a while ago but it was another revelatory lesson for me. I&#8217;d always associated creativity with arts and crafts. But the realisation that creativity is much broader was a turning point for me. If you make anything &#8211; code, art, food, writing, furniture, electronics, lego, sermons, birthday cards, cakes, plants &#8211; anything, then you are creative. Everyone has made something in their life. Everyone is creative. Everyone has a craft.<\/p>\n<p>The first book of the bible, Genesis, talks about God as creator (I don&#8217;t believe it literally &#8211; it&#8217;s a poem, a metaphor). And it says that God made man in his image &#8211; which I take to mean that we all have, in our being, some likeness to God. And I put that all together and understand it to mean that we are all creators. We all make stuff.<\/p>\n<p>And God said: &#8220;Let there be&#8230;&#8221;. And God saw that it was good.<\/p>\n<p>Go make things. Making things is good!<\/p>\n<h3>6. Anxiety is REALLY common and very real for very many people.<\/h3>\n<p>The more I have exchanges with people about anxiety, the more I feel like anxiety is in all of us. It might be full-blown, debilitating panic attacks. Or it might be way more subtle. But it&#8217;s everywhere and it&#8217;s real and it affects people in their everyday lives greatly.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t share my main anxiety. But I know what it is. I know where it comes from. And I&#8217;m trying to deal with it.<\/p>\n<p>So the next time someone wants to travel by themselves. Or needs a break from a situation. Or doesn&#8217;t call you on the phone. Or doesn&#8217;t want to drive a long distance. Or wants to stand by the exit of a busy room. Or wants to do something odd and seems stressed about it. Give them a break. This might be REALLY hard for them.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Anger is OK<\/h3>\n<p>Blimey &#8211; this is turning into a full-blown therapy session.<\/p>\n<p>I was a pretty placid person until a certain set of things in my life happened which caused me to\u00a0discover that I could actually get quite angry under the right circumstances. I&#8217;ve REALLY struggled with this. I struggled because getting angry felt wrong, and bad. But I&#8217;ve come to accept it. And to accept it I had to acknowledge that anger is actually a part of normal human existence. We shouldn&#8217;t feel bad that we get angry. It&#8217;s just something that happens. It&#8217;s a physiological response to external stimuli that&#8217;s often out of our control.<\/p>\n<p>How one deals with anger is a whole other story &#8211; and one that I won&#8217;t go into here. But anger in itself is OK. That was a HARD lesson to learn.<\/p>\n<h3>8: Our conscious reality is about 0.5 seconds behind actual reality.<\/h3>\n<p>Seriously. Our brains process different senses at different speeds, so we get sound quicker than vision. So why isn&#8217;t the world all out of sync? Well, our brains cleverly assemble our &#8220;reality&#8221; and re-sync everything so that we perceive in-sync. But this means that we&#8217;re constantly living in the past.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you do something like hit a baseball travelling at 90mph? Or clap in time with a group of other people.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/b06zqpcg\">This&#8230;THIS&#8230;is one of the most fascinating pieces of radio that I&#8217;ve ever listened to.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Two more&#8230;?<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s late&#8230;I made it to eight. I think I&#8217;m done.<\/p>\n<p>What have YOU learned recently?<\/p>\n",
