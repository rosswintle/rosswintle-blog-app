I&#8217;m still in the process of listening, but he said some interesting things about public speaking that resonated with me, because <a href="https://2016.london.wordcamp.org/speaker/ross-wintle/">I&#8217;m thinking about that a LOT at the moment</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, my mission&#8230;is to make a certain kind of change happen. I want to help people see the world differently and if they choose to make a different choice after they see the world differently. I want to help people connect to each other and to use that connection to make things better&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;You have people in a room&#8230;eager to hear what you have to say&#8230;and for 45 minutes or an hour you have a screen that&#8217;s 30ft by 20ft and you have a microphone that&#8217;s amplified. And maybe just maybe you can get under their skin&#8230;and then I can&#8230;change the conversation&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;Everyone who can hear this [podcast] has more power than they think they do and the question is what are you going to do with that power? &#8230; Are you going to make change happen? Or are you going to ignore it?&#8221;</p>
