<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Short-form all the things!</h1></header><main><p>More inspiration fromÂ <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2016/03/make-change-happen/">Seth Godin</a>&#8230;apparently he blogs 5 times a day but doesn&#8217;t use Twitter. This is kind-of a place I&#8217;d like to be. Content on my blog is mine. I can promote it on social media, but it&#8217;s mine! I get to keep it and its existence isn&#8217;t dependent on anyone else or any company or thing. Even if WordPress dies I can still theoretically get my data back and spin my content up somewhere. I like that this is MY space.</p>
<p>But I do tend to write long-form. And writing long-form on a frequent basis just isn&#8217;t possible.</p>
<p>So I need to try to keep short-form. How can I better achieve that? Perhaps by being more spontaneous and frequent in jotting down my thoughts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been toying with the idea of short-form podcasts too&#8230;watch this space for some info on that as I&#8217;ll need your help!</p>
