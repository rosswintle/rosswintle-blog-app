<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Side Project: UX for Everyone</h1></header><main><p>So, now that I&#8217;ve got a <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2016/03/argh-im-speaking-at-wordcamp-london-2016/">post out about my speaking gig</a> published, I can now talk about something that&#8217;s happening as I prepare to speak.</p>
<p>First of all, a big thank you to all the people who <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2016/03/launch-not-launch-question/">voted to say whether I should launch this thing now, or after the talk</a>. The result was pretty balanced, so I was left to make my own decision.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve decided to part-launch it.</p>
<h3>Back story</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve been on a journey. I&#8217;ve always been generally interested in psychology and the behaviour of people. Then, as I&#8217;ve worked on the web a lot, I&#8217;ve been learning from others about user interaction, usability, user experience and so on. This is now at a point where I&#8217;m confident with talking about these things, and I&#8217;m having the same conversations again and again about these things. This stuff really has value, even at small scale.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s where the WordCamp talk came from. I want people to realise, as I ahave, that there are a lot of simple tips, tools, tricks and ideas that can make any website better. I guess I&#8217;m a UX evangelist now!</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve been writing my talk, I&#8217;ve been paying close attention to my social and news feeds, and I&#8217;ve been reading books (to check I&#8217;ve got things right). I&#8217;m basically digesting anything I come across that has UX and usability in it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m curating some of this information into my talk, but there&#8217;s a lot of it, so I wanted another way to share what I&#8217;m learning and discovering. Even if it becomes nothing more than an appendix to my talk.</p>
<p>Though I&#8217;m hoping it becomes something more than that.</p>
<h3>UX for Everyone</h3>
<p>So&#8230;without further ado and with apologies for my total lack of design skill, I give you: UX for Everyone.</p>

<p>Currently mostly a <a href="https://twitter.com/uxforeveryone">Twitter feed</a> curating and commenting on simple UX ideas. But there is a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uxforeveryone">Facebook page</a> too which I need to start posting to. And there is more to come.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re coming to my talk then I warn you: there may be spoilers. But it may also be interesting background reading; an appetiser before the main course arrives.</p>
<p>This may be a short, temporary side project? Or it may continue and evolve. But it felt right to put it out there while it was in progress.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
