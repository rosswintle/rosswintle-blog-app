<p>Despite <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2016/03/a-new-addition-ada-isabel/">the baby being</a> on the way, and my relative public-speaking inexperience and a few other things, I stupidly decided to submit a talk proposal to <a href="https://2016.london.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp London</a> (a large UK WordPress conference). Amazingly, the proposal got accepted! And so I now need to hope that I can scale up the apparent success of a couple of meetup presentations to this enormous stage:</p>

<p>While I don&#8217;t want to give too much away, this post is the precursor to another. So I just want to say that I&#8217;m speaking on the topic &#8220;<a class="wcpt-session-title" href="https://2016.london.wordcamp.org/session/user-experience-its-for-everyone/">User Experience: it’s for everyone</a>&#8220;. It&#8217;s a topic that I&#8217;ve realised is close to my heart and I want to share some of my user experience experience (yes, this IS correct) with people, and try to get people to see that this isn&#8217;t a field that&#8217;s the domain of UX experts &#8211; we ALL have a part in the UX process.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be sharing some stories, tips, examples and resources as I go too. I hope it will be fun, interesting, and inspiring. And if it&#8217;s not, it will be a total train wreck. Either way, it&#8217;s entertainment that should be worth the £30 conference ticket fee alone. So <a href="https://2016.london.wordcamp.org/tickets/">GO AND BOOK NOW</a> if you&#8217;re into WordPress and fancy a fun, friendly, two day conference complete with food and swag for not-much-money-at-all.</p>
<p>I hope to see you there!</p>
