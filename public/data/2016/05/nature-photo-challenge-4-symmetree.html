I know they can be explained in so many ways, but in others they are mysterious. They seem to have souls. They get old and wise. And each and every trunk, branch and leaf is very much the same, and yet, totally unique. A symbol of both the infinite complexity of nature, and the rigid order within which that complexity it constrained. A tension I still fail to resolve.</p>
<p>We found this horse-chestnut branch. It&#8217;s symmetry is so almost-perfect as to be perplexing. I LOVE it.</p>
