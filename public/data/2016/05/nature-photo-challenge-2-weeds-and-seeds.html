But I have great respect for my enemy. Weeds are tenacious and hardy. They thrive even where we try our utmost to suppress them. The dandelion is particularly tricksy/clever. Its root is deep but weak, making it hard to fully pull out. And its seeds are cunningly designed &#8211; though I&#8217;m not sure if their purpose is to blow away in the wind, or to be carried and blown around by small children. Both appear to be effective strategies.</p>
