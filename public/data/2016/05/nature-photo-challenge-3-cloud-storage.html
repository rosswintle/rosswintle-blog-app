But I still can&#8217;t quite understand how so much water gets up to the sky. Water is HEAVY. Cumulonimbus clouds have been said to &#8220;weigh&#8221; up to one million tonnes. And you see the result when it rains. LOTS of water falls from the sky. LOTS. And it has to get up there somehow. And I know that it evaporates from the oceans and lakes but&#8230;that&#8217;s a LOT of energy. Clouds. Amazing.</p>
