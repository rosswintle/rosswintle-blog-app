My 14-week-old girl Ada&#8217;s hand. What a true marvel of nature. So delicate and intricate. So miraculous. Such an incredible feat of creation. Tiny-but-perfect muscles powered by her extraordinary miniature cardiovascular system, pull thread-like tendons to move the complex arrangement of small bones. It&#8217;s not just a wonderÂ of natural construction, but a sign of future potential: What will these hands do? What will they make? Who will they hold?</p>
