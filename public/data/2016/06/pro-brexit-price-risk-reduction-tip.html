<p>If you run a non-UK-based subscription service, such as a SAAS or product with software licensing, this could be a good marketing opportunity that could pay for your summer holiday, and here&#8217;s why.</p>
<h3>In? Out? Shake it all about?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how widely it&#8217;s known in the rest of the world, but the UK is currently part of a thing called the European Union (EU), which essentially means we share some administration and trade and free-movement agreements with the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>And on June 23rd we&#8217;re having a referendum on our membership of the EU. And <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36271589">the polls are showing it to be a Very Close Thing</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m no economics expert, but I know that market stability is based very much on understanding what the future will look like politically and economically. And the uncertainty about the EU is <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/volatile-pound-underscores-market-jitters-as-brexit-vote-looms-1465326028">making our currency a little volatile</a>.</p>
<p>Plus, many important and far more knowledgable people than I have said that there is a significant economic risk to leaving: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36273448">the governor of the bank of England</a>, our <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36459451">prime minister</a>, our &#8220;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/25/ifs-brexit-extend-austerity-budget-deficit-eu-referendum">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a>&#8220;, the <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/670496/Angela-Markel-EU-referendum-needless-risk-David-Cameron">German Chanellor</a>, and others.</p>
<p>And if there&#8217;s an economic shock, then our pound will almost certainly fall.</p>
<h3>Give me deals!</h3>
<p>If the pound falls, it become expensive for me to buy things in other currencies.</p>
<p>So I can get some insurance on price by buying things in other currencies now.</p>
<p>So I went annual with my cloud storage to minimise the risk of it becoming more expensive. And as I did so I was thinking &#8220;what other services might I be able to extend for a year at this point?&#8221;.</p>
<p>And I just wondered if there&#8217;s something in here that&#8217;s helpful for software/service providers and their customers: offer them a &#8220;Pre-Brexit Price Risk-Reduction renewal&#8221; and allow them to extend their subscriptions for a year before the 23rd June, regardless of their renewal date.</p>
<p>It could get you some cash in the bankÂ and some happy customers if you get it right!</p>
