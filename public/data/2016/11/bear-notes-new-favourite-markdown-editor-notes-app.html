<p><em>Note: I&#8217;m not affiliated with Bear, it&#8217;s just a new product that I love.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/">Bear App</a> team let me be a beta tester for this app and so I&#8217;ve been using it for a while now. On release I had no hesitation: I installed and bought a pro subscription immediately.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used many notes apps and Markdown editors. <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> is highly functional but its formatting is weird and the interface is clunky and inconsistent. <a href="https://simplenote.com/">SimpleNote</a> is great but is pretty bare-bones and just lacks functionality. <a href="https://bywordapp.com/">Byword</a> is a beautiful editor but lacks any real organisational mechanism other than folders, and there&#8217;s no search ability.</p>
<p>Bear takes the best of all of these: beautiful Markdown editing; a clever tagging system; sophisticated search; an interface that&#8217;s not in-your-face. It&#8217;s a joy.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t be for everyone. You have to be keen on, or willing to learn to use Markdown (which I am). And it&#8217;s currently iPhone/iPad/Mac only. But if you fall into the category of Markdown-using, Apple-device-owning power user, it&#8217;s highly recommended.</p>
<p>My only issues are small, but not insignificant:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s tied to Apple&#8217;s devices and infrastructure when I&#8217;d prefer a more cross-platform solution. That was an engineering decision that they took to make the app viable. Perhaps a web-version will come along at some point?</li>
<li>It&#8217;s not a &#8220;cloud&#8221; notes app, like Evernote or Simplenote. Notes are synchronised across devices, but are not really stored &#8220;in the cloud&#8221;.  And as such it has no API &#8211; there&#8217;s no way to send stuff to it from the outside world, such as by using an <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> recipe.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nearly perfect. Great job on the release!</p>
