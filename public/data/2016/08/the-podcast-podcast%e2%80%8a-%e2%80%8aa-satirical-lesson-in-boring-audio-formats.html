<p><em>On my walk to work today I was listening to a podcast. I can’t help but think that format isn’t quite right. Here’s a transcript of how not to make a boring piece of audio. With apologies to anyone that makes podcasts — I actually admire and respect your work. Consider this “constructive feedback”, and I hope you’ll laugh along.</em></p>



<p>Hi, and welcome to this episode of The Podcast Podcast. The Podcast that tells you about the Podcast about Podcasts.</p>



<p>Later
 on we’ll tell you about this week’s podcast, but I want to start today 
by telling you all about last weeks podcast which was mostly all about 
last weeks podcast, but also told you a bit about the week before’s 
podcast, and even, excitingly, gave you a look ahead to this week’s 
podcast.</p>



<p>If
 you’ve not already listened then you really should and make sure that 
you review it on iTunes, share it with all your friends, and subscribe 
in your favourite podcast app so that you never miss and episode.</p>



<p>Now
 before I tell you about this week’s podcast we just need to take a 
quick sponsor break but we’ll be back soon with this week’s podcast and 
if you can hold on long enough we may even give a teaser later on of 
what in next week’s podcast.</p>



<p>We’ll be back after the break.</p>



<p>Today’s sponsor is AudioChimp….</p>



<p>Welcome
 back to The Podcast Podcast. Before the break we told you what would be
 coming up after the break, which we’ll get to in a minute.</p>



<p>Today’s
 episode is actually a listener question. Our listener Chas is an avid 
follower of The Podcast Podcast and I’d just like to say thank you, 
Chas, for listening. The podcast wouldn’t be what it is without our 
listeners and I’d like to thank each and everyone of them for 
subscribing and listening and submitting questions. It’s people like 
Chas that make The Podcast Podcast worthwhile.</p>



<p>So
 Chas submitted a question via The Podcast Podcast website, which is on 
podcastpodcast.not, or you can contact us on Twitter at @podcastpodcast 
which you can also do if you have a question. Not all of our episodes 
are listener questions, but they give us something to talk about when 
we’ve run out of ideas of our own.</p>



<p>Chas
 actually submitted a question previously on The Podcast Podcast, and if
 you want to hear that then you can look up episode 32 on iTunes or on 
our website at podcastpodcast.lol. It’s truly hard to believe that we’ve
 now been going for 68 episodes and next week we’re expecting to hit 
100,000 downloads which is JUST amazing. I’m so grateful to everyone 
that listens to the show. It started as just a stupid thing in my spare 
time, and has now grown into this huge network of podcasts which is just
 incredible. And it’s our goal to provide you with a stack of 
interesting content week-by-week. So make sure you look up our other 
podcasts too.</p>



<p>Speaking
 of interesting content, that’s exactly what Chas’s question is about. 
Chas asks “Why is there not more content on The Podcast Podcast?”. Well,
 Chas, this is a great question, and we’ll answer it after the break 
when we’ll come back and actually answer your question and give a teaser
 for next week’s episode.</p>



<p>Don’t go away.</p>



<p>This week’s second sponsor is Mail Ocean…</p>



<p>Welcome
 back to The Podcast Podcast. Before the break we told you about 
long-term Podcast Podcast listener Chas’ listener question, and how we 
were going to answer his question after the last break. So that’s what 
we’re about to do.</p>



<p>You’ll remember that Chas’ question was “Why is there not more content on The Podcast Podcast?”</p>



<p>Well
 the answer, Chas, is that sponsorship is really important for podcasts 
because it pays us to make them. So I’m sure you totally understand the 
need for that. But as for why we can’t just run an ad, get on with the 
content, and then run another ad at the end? Well, I really don’t know.</p>



<p>I hope that answers your question Chas and thanks for submitting it.</p>



<p>So
 today we’ve looked at what we were going to speak about today, told you
 lots about this podcast, and spent a short time answering a listener 
question. In a moment we’re going to tell you about next week’s podcast.</p>



<p>But
 first don’t forget that if you, like Chas, have a question for The 
Podcast Podcast then you can submit it through our website at 
podcastpodcast.not, or ask us via Twitter at @podcastpodcast</p>



<p>Next
 week on The Podcast Podcast, we’re going to talk about this week’s 
podcast, next week’s podcast, and maybe even look ahead to the following
 week’s podcast. We’ll even throw in the usual segments where we ask you
 to share our podcast and rate it on iTunes.</p>



<p>Thanks for listening to The Podcast Podcast, and see you next time!</p>
