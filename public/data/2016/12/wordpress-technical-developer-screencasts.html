<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Forays into WordPress Technical Developer Screencasts</h1></header><main><p>For a long time, many people told me &#8220;you should be a teacher&#8221;. And, I confess, I actually love the idea of teaching people &#8211; but only really if I can teach people who want to learn.  Regular teachers have to teach even those who don&#8217;t want to learn &#8211; and they have my utmost respect because of it (seriously&#8230;school teachers: you have so much respect here!).</p>
<p>So I guess my forays into public speaking at meetups and conferences this year have been a stab at some kind of teaching. But I also set up a challenge to myself to produce <a href="http://press-ups.com/about-press-ups/">some screencast tutorial videos</a> back in 2015 (which I gave the cheesy name &#8220;<a href="http://press-ups.com/">Press Ups</a>&#8220;), and that was useful both as a resource to share with others, and as an exercise for myself in creating such things.</p>
<p>More recently I have, myself, been learning a LOT from screencast tutorials from Jefferey Way&#8217;s <a href="https://laracasts.com/">Laracasts</a> and Wes Bos&#8217;s many <a href="http://wesbos.com/courses/">JavaScript courses</a>.</p>
<p>So when my attendance at <a href="http://wpbristol.co.uk/">my local WordPress meetup</a> started to wain due to family commitments and health issues, I started wondering if I could contribute answers to questions that had come up at the meetup, in the form of videos.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve had a go at that. First, an attempt at answering the question &#8220;What&#8217;s the difference between WP_Query, query_posts, and get_posts?&#8221;</p>
<p>http://press-ups.com/2016/11/wordpress-loops-queries-guide-developers/</p>
<p>And then a follow up where I expand on a technique referenced in the first video that I use for structuring code related to post types:</p>
<p>http://press-ups.com/2016/12/keeping-wordpress-post-types-code-clean-simple-classes/</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve really enjoyed making these. They&#8217;re not perfect, but I&#8217;ve had positive and constructive feedback on them that I&#8217;ve tried to take to heart. And I hope they are really useful for people out there.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not about to be the next Jeffrey Way, or Wes Bos, but I do enjoy making these and have a setup for making them that is steadily improving. So if you have a technical question that you think I might be able to cover in a tutorial, submit a request on the <a href="http://press-ups.com/suggest/">Press Ups suggestions page</a>, grab me in a meetup, or drop me a line <a href="https://twitter.com/magicroundabout">on Twitter</a>, and I&#8217;ll see if I can help you &#8211; and others &#8211; out. And if you have constructive feedback about any of this, feel free to drop me a line too.</p>
<p>People have stopped saying it of late, but perhaps I should be a teacher after all?</p>
