<p>So much so that I wonder how I got through my twenties without realising that I got grumpy when I needed to eat. Or that I hit &#8220;the wall&#8221; about 9 hours after waking up and need half an hour of downtime before I can as much as converse with anyone again.</p>
<p>Then Sally points out that, in my twenties, I only ever got properly grumpy or angry about twice a year. Which is totally true. And she pointed out that having kids probably made me these things start happening.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s right &#8211; it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;ve <strong>realised</strong> that these things happen, it&#8217;s that these things just didn&#8217;t used to happen. They happen because I&#8217;m doing things &#8211; sleeping and eating &#8211; on someone else&#8217;s schedule. Or, at best/worst, a combination of someone else&#8217;s schedule AND my schedule.</p>
<p>And so we&#8217;ve come to see that one of the key facts of parenting is that you really truly do start living someone else&#8217;s life.</p>
