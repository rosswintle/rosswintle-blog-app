        "rendered": "\n<p>Hello. I&#8217;m an EV owner. But I like to think I&#8217;m not an EV zealot. I may even have not-fully-formed-thoughts about how eliminating <em>all<\/em> petrol vehicles may not be a good thing. So bear with me. I&#8217;m NOT trying to force anything on you. This is just a thought experiment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A while ago I heard someone say, when discussing battery EV&#8217;s, something like: &#8220;there are trade-offs with filling your car with fuel too&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it got me thinking: What if we were in some alternate universe, considering moving FROM battery EV&#8217;s to petrol\/diesel-powered transport? What would our objections be there?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Fuel is more expensive!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I have to travel to a special place to top up? I can&#8217;t have fuel delivered to my house?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>And you need to get all the fuel to the top-up places too. How will that work? And isn&#8217;t moving all that flammable liquid around really dangerous?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>We don&#8217;t drill for oil in the UK. At least, not much. Will we have to import all this fuel? Sounds expensive.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Won&#8217;t it be really messy and environmentally bad getting all of the oil out of the ground?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I have to carry round a box-full of highly-flammable liquid? My kid has to sit on top of this box? Surely that will explode or cause loads of fires? Isn&#8217;t that really dangerous in crashes?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Won&#8217;t it will be really noisy? Both inside the car and even more so on the streets?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Won&#8217;t it cause loads of pollution and make the air hard to breathe? Sounds like a public health nightmare!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>How will I remember that I need to get more fuel? If the range is high and I can&#8217;t change at home, I can totally see myself forgetting to check when I need to top up.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The engine will have limited speed, so I&#8217;ll need a complicated gearbox to be able to go fast? Sounds like an expensive thing to replace when it breaks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>And the engine&#8230; won&#8217;t that be really complicated with lots of moving parts to maintain and potentially replace when they break? Won&#8217;t it frequently go wrong and won&#8217;t servicing be really expensive?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fueleconomy.gov\/feg\/atv.shtml\">Only about 20% of the energy goes into actually moving<\/a>? My EV gets about 90%! What?!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It&#8217;s slow to heat up the interior in winter? And the engine runs hot all year round? What a waste!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The brakes don&#8217;t regenerate energy? So they wear down quickly and dissipate all the energy as heat?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>All so that cars can be a bit cheaper and I can travel a bit further? You must think I&#8217;m mad!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I imagine drivers would be incensed. No one would want this. It sounds utterly absurd.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, EV&#8217;s aren&#8217;t without their problems right now, and I don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re the only things we need to so by a LONG way. Not owning a personal vehicle is far preferable! But if you look at it like this&#8230; could we get to a place where petrol-powered personal transport seems outrageous?<\/p>\n",
