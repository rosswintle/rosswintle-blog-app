<h2 class="wp-block-heading">I made a completely free Scrabble-like game!</h2>



<p>Pretty much all the online Scrabble games I&#8217;ve played are bloated, ad-ridden, gamified things that need sign-ups and stuff to play. I hate all this. I just want to play games without all the crud.</p>



<p>I make <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2024/02/a-manifesto-for-small-static-web-apps/">simple web apps</a>. So why can&#8217;t I make a Scrabble clone?</p>



<p>And I did! It&#8217;s still early days. Things don&#8217;t work or are broken. There are things it doesn&#8217;t do right. But this is kinda playable right now. Before you let me know things are broken please see if <a href="https://github.com/rosswintle/static-word-game/issues">I already know about it</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://words.pico.games/">https://words.pico.games/</a></p>



<p>Sure, this is not the BEST Scrabble clone. But it&#8217;s free, needs no sign up, has no ads. There are no catches. I just use <a href="https://usefathom.com/ref/SVE71E">Fathom Analytics</a> to collect minimal, anonymised usage stats. That&#8217;s it! You can just play!</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s something about it that the computer nerds will find interesting. I think. Read on if you want to know how this works because a static-file, multiplayer game without a login or database&#8230; how does that work?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How DOES it work? </h2>



<p>Ages ago I heard a thing on a podcast, and I can&#8217;t even remember what it was, that made me wonder if you could have an online, multi-player, turn-based game where the game state is encoded in URLs and you just swap URLs with other people using messaging to take turns.</p>



<p>You could prove this with something very simple like tic-tac-toe. But that seemed TOO simple. And I love word games. So Scrabble seemed to be a reasonable step up.</p>



<p>What you are about to read is a technical deep-dive on encoding Scrabble games in URLs. This is kinda computer-sciencey stuff including binary representations of data, bitwise operations, and JavaScript &#8220;BigInts&#8221;. I hope it&#8217;s interesting to someone!</p>



<p><em>Aside: Scrabble(TM) is owned by Mattel and Hasbro and they have enforced their copyright over some aspects of the game in the past, so I&#8217;m cautious about naming it and using anything of the game that may be copyrighted.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Computer Science &#8211; a quick primer on binary representations</h2>



<p>We don&#8217;t talk a lot about &#8220;bits&#8221; in web development. The high-level languages we use, the speed of processing, and the memory we have available in computers nowadays means we don&#8217;t have to think about it much. But I want to do something <em>super</em> efficient here, so I&#8217;m turning to binary encoding.</p>



<p>Under the hood, our computers use binary &#8211; 0&#8217;s and 1&#8217;s to represent data.</p>



<p>Whole numbers usually translate pretty directly. Zero is <code>0</code> in binary. Eight is <code>1000</code>. Thirteen is <code>1101</code>. I won&#8217;t go into why here. But bigger numbers take up more bits.</p>



<p>Boolean &#8220;true/false&#8221; values can be represented in just a single bit!</p>



<p>Letters and characters? Well, they are also converted to numbers. Numbers are really all that we&#8217;ve got. And computers use standardised codes for this. Major standards for encoding text are ASCII and Unicode (sometimes known as UTF).</p>



<p>ASCII is pretty simple. Each character is given a number that fits into, say, 7 bits. 7 bits gives you numbers up to 128. That lets you have lower case and upper case Latin alphabet that we use for English, digits 0-9 and still have 66 slots for punctuation and other stuff.</p>



<p><em>Aside: This is fine for English, but in the global world there&#8217;s a huge number of other characters we might want to use, and Unicode includes all sorts of non-Latin characters and all the emoji!</em></p>



<p>But what if you don&#8217;t need punctuation? In Scrabble you only need single-case letters (and blanks) on your tiles. That&#8217;s 27 options. And 27 options fit into just 5 bits. So can we just do that?</p>



<p>Of course you can!</p>



<p>In fact, if you know what the &#8220;shape&#8221; of your data is, you can really efficiently &#8220;encode&#8221; it in Binary.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to propose, below, that data for a &#8220;player&#8221; in Scrabble is:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A score that is a number between 0 and 1000</li>



<li>A &#8220;rack&#8221; of tiles, that is a list of 7 letters</li>
</ul>



<p>We know this data &#8220;shape&#8221;. So if we can somehow manipulate individual bits we can store a player as a single string of bits. 10 bits for the score. And 5 bits for each letter. 45 bits in total.</p>



<p>This then raises questions though. Like, what if a player is at the end of the game and only has 4 tiles? Well, we can either use one of the spare (not-a-letter) 5-bit values to mean &#8220;empty&#8221;. OR&#8230; we could add another bit of data that says how many letters there are and only store those letters. The number 7 can be represented in 3 bits (<code>111</code>) so a player could be:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A score that is a number between 0 and 1000 (10 bits)</li>



<li>A count of the number of tiles in the rack (3 bits)</li>



<li>A &#8220;rack&#8221; of tiles, that is a list of <em>up to</em> 7 letters (5 bits each)</li>
</ul>



<p>There&#8217;s a trade off here. If we have 7 letters then we&#8217;re adding 3 bits for the count.</p>



<p>But if we have less than 7 letters, we <em>save</em> at least 2 bits (5 fewer bits for a letter, but 3 added for the count). A player with just one tile saves 27 bits!</p>



<p>This is all super-nerdy stuff. But hopefully you see what I&#8217;m trying to do here.</p>



<p>There is an issue though, and that&#8217;s that the languages we use on the web don&#8217;t necessarily make it easy to work with individual bits. I&#8217;ll come back to this later.</p>



<p>In the meantime, given we know we can use bits in this way, how can we represent a Scrabble game?</p>



<p>If you think this is all very interesting then I can highly recommend Julia Evan&#8217;s &#8220;Zine&#8221; (small-comic-book format) called &#8220;<a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/integers-floats/">How Integers and Floats Work</a>&#8220;, and you can tinker with binary codes and numbers using her simple <a href="https://integer.exposed/">integer.exposed</a> tool.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Minimal Scrabble game representations</h2>



<p>I started by wondering what the smallest way to represent a Scrabble-like game was. I don&#8217;t want URLs to get too long as I pass the game state around. So how can I do this efficiently?</p>



<p>Things you COULD store are:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The board.</h3>



<p>This is a 15&#215;15 square grid where each square can be empty or contain a letter.</p>



<p>A letter can be one of 26 things, or a blank (which is different to empty!). If we do a minimal binary representation, this fits into 5 bits.</p>



<p>Representing the whole board would take up up to 1,125 bits. That 161, 7-bit ASCII characters.</p>



<p>Could you compress this? Maybe by encoding multiple empty spaces somehow? Maybe. But that gets complicated.</p>



<p>What else do we need?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Players</h3>



<p>Players have a tile rack &#8211; that&#8217;s up to 7 lots of 5-bits-per-tile. So 35 bits.</p>



<p>Players also have a score. That could be up to 1000, so let&#8217;s give that 10 bits.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll ignore names for now. I think we can do without that. Is that it? I think it is, as moves will be separate.</p>



<p>So a player can be up to 45 bits each. That&#8217;s 7, 7-bit ASCII characters.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Tile Bag</h3>



<p>You could choose to store the tile bag. There are 100 tiles, so this would be 100 * 5 = 500 bits.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s another 72, 7-bit ASCII characters.</p>



<p>Summing up, if you were to store data in this way: board state, player state and tile bag, that&#8217;s a total of 1,715 bits, or 245 characters. Not bad I suppose.</p>



<p>There may be some efficiencies to be gained somewhere. But it would either:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Be very minimal on average; or</li>



<li>Add complexity to the encoding</li>
</ul>



<p>But it feels like there&#8217;s some data duplication here. Perhaps we can do better?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Alternative: Store the Moves</h3>



<p>Rather than storing the board and the player scores, we could just store a list of moves. This may be more efficient. But it may also be hard to tell.</p>



<p>A list of moves can be &#8220;played back&#8221; onto the board to get player scores and the board state.</p>



<p>You also don&#8217;t need to maintain a tile bag. The &#8220;full bag&#8221; minus all the used tiles (in players hands or on the board) gives you the tiles remaining. You can shuffle them whenever you like. You don&#8217;t have to keep the original shuffled order &#8211; that doesn&#8217;t affect the game.</p>



<p>So what does a move look like? It can be tricky because a move can &#8220;wrap&#8221; around other letters or words on the board.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s three options:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Combine a starting point co-ordinate on the board with the entire word played. Oh, you&#8217;ll need a flag to say if it&#8217;s across or down too. For a 5-letter word, this would be 2 * 4-bit co-ordinates, a 1-bit flag, and 5 * 5-bit tiles. That&#8217;s 34 bits in total for a 5-letter word.</li>



<li>Same as 1, but you only store the played tiles, and you skip existing tiles when you replay moves onto the board. That might reduce the storage from option 1 by a bit (for some moves, by a LOT!)</li>



<li>Have a list of played tiles, each with their coordinates. This would be 2 * 4-bit co-ordinates and a 5-bit tile per letter played. So 13 bits per letter, or 65 bits for a 5-letter word.</li>
</ol>



<p>Option 3 seems inefficient, especially for longer words.</p>



<p>Option 2, in hindsight seems best. But I didn&#8217;t consider it at the time.</p>



<p>So I went with option 1.</p>



<p>The internet says that the average number of words played in a game seems to be between 16 and 22 per player. It feels like a low-move game would have longer words. There&#8217;s 100 tiles. A 34-move game averages very close to 3 tiles per move. So that&#8217;s 8 + 1 + (3 * 5) = 24 bits per move, and 34 * 24 = 816 bits for an average-looking game.</p>



<p>This is better than storing a 1,125-bit board. It will vary per game, but we&#8217;ve reduced the ASCII character representation to 117 characters from 161. That&#8217;s pretty good.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A conclusion on game storage</h3>



<p>So a minimal data set is:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Array of moves at 5<em>n</em> + 9 bits per move and an average-looking game using around 816 bits.</li>



<li>Player tile &#8220;racks&#8221; at 5 * 7 = 35 bits each. 70 bits total.</li>
</ul>



<p>That&#8217;s it. Everything else &#8211; the board, the tile bag, the scores, can all be derived from this.</p>



<p>Is this the most efficient way? I wouldn&#8217;t really know without some experimentation or writing some complicated formulae. There may be games where another encoding works better. But this seems good to me.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Working with bits in JavaScript</h2>



<p>As I said before, it&#8217;s not entirely easy working with individual bits in modern web development languages.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m making a Scrabble-like web app, so JavaScript is the language I have to hand.</p>



<p>JavaScript <em>does</em> provide operators for working with bits. But the difficulty is that its types are more abstract/high level. And the JavaScript <code>Number</code> type doesn&#8217;t directly map whole numbers into Binary. All numbers in JavaScript are actually &#8220;floating point&#8221;, which means <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number#number_encoding">they are stored in a complicated format</a> that&#8217;s suitable for both whole numbers (&#8220;integers&#8221;) and decimal numbers.</p>



<p>HOWEVER&#8230; while I was thinking about this I remembered that JavaScript has a &#8220;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt">BigInt</a>&#8221; type for storing &#8220;Big Integers&#8221;. This sounds good. We need integers really.</p>



<p>And BigInt&#8217;s support <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#bitwise_shift_operators">binary (&#8220;bitwise&#8221;) operators</a> like shifts (which move binary numbers left and right) and logical AND / OR. These are exactly what we need, and it seems that a BigInt is almost unlimited in size, and so a single BigInt can represent a Player, a Move, or an entire game!!</p>



<p>This is exactly what I need.</p>



<p><em>And just to note again, if you think this is all very interesting then I can highly recommend Julia Evan&#8217;s &#8220;Zine&#8221; (small-comic-book format) called &#8220;<a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/integers-floats/">How Integers and Floats Work</a>&#8220;, and you can tinker with binary codes and numbers using her simple <a href="https://integer.exposed/">integer.exposed</a> tool.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A small library class for bitwise manipulation of BigInts</h2>



<p>The BigInt&#8217;s worked out GREAT!</p>



<p>But I found myself doing a lot of what I called &#8220;push&#8221; and &#8220;pop&#8221;, of bits like with Arrays. Like, &#8220;Here&#8217;s a number that&#8217;s less than 15. It&#8217;s 3 bits long. Please &#8220;push&#8221; it onto the right-hand side of my BigInt.</p>



<p>(A push &#8220;left shifts&#8221; the bits of the BigInt to the left and then does a logical OR to add the new bits on. A pull does a logical &#8220;AND&#8221; of the BigInt with a mask like <code>1111111</code> to get the popped value, and then &#8220;right shifts&#8221; the BigInt to move everything along.)</p>



<p>Abstracting this made my encoding and decoding work much easier. And I included functions/methods to convert the BigInt to and from both ASCII (7 bits at a time!) and then also into Base64, which can be sent in a URL! YAY!</p>



<p>You can see that little helper class in <a href="https://gist.github.com/rosswintle/94f7778a2cad77eb4520490ed61d99e1">this Gist</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Making the game work</h2>



<p>With all that binary data representation done, I could get on with building the game.</p>



<p>It turns out that complex game UI and logic can be a bit tricky. I&#8217;ve got the game to a state where it works in it&#8217;s basic form. It&#8217;s playable. And that&#8217;s great.</p>



<p>I could write a whole other post about all the user interface concerns and algorithms for doing stuff.</p>



<p>I mean, it&#8217;s not <strong>hard</strong> hard. It&#8217;s not Tears of the Kingdom or Call of Duty. But for a little web-based side-project? There&#8217;s been a lot to think about.</p>



<p>Right now I&#8217;m doing some simple play testing of the mechanic of sending links back and forth. Interestingly, most of the feedback I&#8217;ve had has either been about Scrabble stuff that I&#8217;ve not implemented yet, or about the UI. No one has really complained that sending links back and forth over messenger is annoying. So that&#8217;s good.</p>



<p>Why not give it a go? It&#8217;s at <a href="https://words.pico.games/">https://words.pico.games/</a>, and it&#8217;s totally free. </p>



<p>Let me know what you think, but be sure to check GitHub issues before you report anything to see if I already know about it.</p>



<p>Enjoy!</p>
