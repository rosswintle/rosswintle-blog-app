<p>I actually finished this a good while ago. I&#8217;d heard a lot about Brandon Sanderson, and &#8211; as is my probably-not-very-ethical-really way &#8211; I saw The Book of Kings on offer on Kobo and bought it to see if I could get into it.</p>



<p>And WHAT a book.</p>



<p>I mean, it&#8217;s epic. Literally. It&#8217;s huge. And I&#8217;m a slow reader. But I did make it through. And I was entranced by the world that had been created and the story that was set before me.</p>



<p>I DID love it.</p>



<p>There were downsides though. Some of the descriptive parts &#8211; especially of battles &#8211; were just really very ridiculously long and drawn out. It was slow and hard-going at time.</p>



<p>And the ending was pretty disappointing too. I knew it was part one of at least five and maybe several more. But even with that knowledge the ending should have been a relief, but instead I felt the weight of the next tome already upon me.</p>



<p>I will have a break, but yes, book 2 is lined up ready to go.</p>



<p>Brilliant.</p>
