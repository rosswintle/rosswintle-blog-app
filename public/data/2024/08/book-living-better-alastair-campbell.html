<p>If you just read my review of Seth Godin&#8217;s &#8220;Tribes&#8221; and now read this you&#8217;ll probably think I&#8217;m in a right grumpy mood. But I&#8217;m not.</p>



<p>But the truth is, I was disappointed by this book too.</p>



<p>Mostly, I wasn&#8217;t expecting it to be so biographical. Campbell is very open about mental health and a supporter of mental health causes, so I bought the book with interest.</p>



<p>And if you&#8217;re looking for a very open, frank, honest, and detailed biography/memoir with lots of family history, and to gain an understanding of what suffering from depression is like then this is probably a good read.</p>



<p>I, personally, found it rather self-indulgent.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking for science, or self-help then you probably want something else.</p>



<p>Just, not what I thought it would be.</p>
