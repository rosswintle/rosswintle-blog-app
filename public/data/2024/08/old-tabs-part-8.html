<p>My habit of keeping interesting things open in tabs on my mobile is WAY out of hand. So I&#8217;m challenging myself to blog them as I close them down. 10 a day. This is part 8.</p>



<p>I am terrible at keeping up streaks like this. But I seem to be doing so OK with this that you&#8217;re probably starting to get bored!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Pen Pals &#8211; Kev Quirk</h2>



<p><a href="https://kevquirk.com/penpals">https://kevquirk.com/penpals</a></p>



<p>I love this idea for digital pen pals. I tried it myself briefly and had some good chats with some people. I may try again at some point!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. The PHP Lands</h2>



<p><a href="https://lands.php.earth">https://lands.php.earth</a></p>



<p>And fun and interesting way to explore the PHP Ecosystem: using a pirate map!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. How mice can spark a social movement in your organisation</h2>



<p><a href="https://implementconsultinggroup.com/article/how-mice-can-spark-a-social-movement-in-your-organisation">https://implementconsultinggroup.com/article/how-mice-can-spark-a-social-movement-in-your-organisation</a></p>



<p>Not sure why this is in my tabs. Must have found it interesting at the time. It is vaguely (on a skim-read).</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Trojan mice are small experiments that continuously challenge and test assumptions with the intent of creating learning and insight.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Understanding Gmail and Yahoo Error Codes</h2>



<p><a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2024/02/understanding-gmail-and-yahoo-error-codes/">https://securityboulevard.com/2024/02/understanding-gmail-and-yahoo-error-codes/</a></p>



<p>I remember Google doing this:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Google and Yahoo’s new sender requirements have come into force, and the two email giants have started sending out temporary warning messages to non-compliant senders.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I&#8217;m not sure I did anything about it and my email sending from my own domains seems OK. Hmm&#8230;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Google And Yahoo New Email Authentication Requirements</h2>



<p><a href="https://easydmarc.com/blog/google-and-yahoo-new-email-authentication-requirements">https://easydmarc.com/blog/google-and-yahoo-new-email-authentication-requirements</a></p>



<p>More on the above topic. I hate how hard it is to send email. Spammers and hackers can get in the sea. You make life so hard!!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Links &#8211; Michal Zelazny</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.michalzelazny.com/links">https://www.michalzelazny.com/links</a></p>



<p>Nice list of links to good folks with websites and RSS feeds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Web Development Is Getting Too Complex, And It May Be Our Fault &#8211; Juan Diego Rodríguez (Smashing Magazine)</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/02/web-development-getting-too-complex">https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/02/web-development-getting-too-complex</a></p>



<p>I mean, they&#8217;re not wrong. Good article and analysis. Lots I agree with.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Composer 2.7 and CVE-2024-24821: Code execution and possible privilege escalation</h2>



<p><a href="https://blog.packagist.com/composer-2-7-and-cve-2024-24821">https://blog.packagist.com/composer-2-7-and-cve-2024-24821</a></p>



<p>Nasty Composer bug. I hope I updated all the things!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. The Great Fiction of AI &#8211; The Verge</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23194235/ai-fiction-writing-amazon-kindle-sudowrite-jasper">https://www.theverge.com/c/23194235/ai-fiction-writing-amazon-kindle-sudowrite-jasper</a></p>



<p>More really excellent art-directed work from The Verge. A great read.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. “What I Did Yesterday” by Chris Fason</h2>



<p><a href="https://daddysgrounded.com/what-i-did-yesterday-by-chris-fason">https://daddysgrounded.com/what-i-did-yesterday-by-chris-fason</a></p>



<p>This looks like a great graphic novel that was being funded on Kickstarter.</p>



<p>I guess if I was inspired, it’s by my own depression and this is an effort to pierce through the fog. It’s my cry for help, maybe.</p>
