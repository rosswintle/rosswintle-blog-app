<p>My habit of keeping interesting things open in tabs on my mobile is WAY out of hand. So I&#8217;m challenging myself to blog them as I close them down. 10 a day. This is part 9.</p>



<p>I am terrible at keeping up streaks like this. I&#8217;m actually 2 days behind now due to life happening. So you may get multiple posts today!</p>



<p>I say you, I mean, I/me. No one&#8217;s <em>actually</em> reading these are they?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Pluralistic: Big Tech disrupted disruption (08 Feb 2024)</h2>



<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/08/permanent-overlords/">https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/08/permanent-overlords/</a></p>



<p>Long article from Cory Doctorow on how large tech incumbents stifle competition and what we might do about it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. puter.com</h2>



<p><a href="https://puter.com">https://puter.com</a></p>



<p>A neat little computer-on-a-web-page. Describes itself as &#8220;a privacy-first personal cloud to keep all your files, apps, and games in one secure place, accessible from anywhere at any time&#8221;. Such a cool idea, but I have no idea what to do with it.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been fascinating watching <a href="https://social.lol/@triptych">@triptych</a> <a href="https://emojiscene.puter.site/">make</a> <a href="https://pixplat.puter.site/">cool</a> <a href="https://triptych.puter.site/">stuff</a> with it. And the publish-a-folder-as-a-website is amazing! (How do they make money though? üßê)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Building my first htmx application &#8211; Mark Story</h2>



<p><a href="https://mark-story.com/posts/view/building-my-first-htmx-application">https://mark-story.com/posts/view/building-my-first-htmx-application</a></p>



<p>I&#8217;m curious about HTMX but have never used it. I&#8217;ll read this at some point.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. The Chairs&#8217; Hiatus &#8211; Part 1</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.matthewbogart.net/the-chairs-hiatus-part1">https://www.matthewbogart.net/the-chairs-hiatus-part1</a></p>



<p>I like Matthew Bogart&#8217;s graphic novels. I like his style. I like his retro knowledge. This is a free web comic thing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. A Totally Objective Ranking of Every UK Local Authority Logo</h2>



<p><a href="https://robin-cg.medium.com/a-totally-objective-ranking-of-every-uk-local-authority-logo-b76e8f7efd5a">https://robin-cg.medium.com/a-totally-objective-ranking-of-every-uk-local-authority-logo-b76e8f7efd5a</a></p>



<p>Very good. Very funny. Very long!!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Craft (not the CMS)</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.craft.do">https://www.craft.do</a></p>



<p>I&#8217;ve actually no idea what this is. Even reading the website. Their words are: &#8220;Craft the best docs in the world&#8221;. Looks like some kind of knowledge organiser? Really not sure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. mezzio</h2>



<p><a href="https://docs.mezzio.dev/mezzio">https://docs.mezzio.dev/mezzio</a></p>



<p>This says &#8220;PSR-15 Middleware in Minutes&#8221;, but I&#8217;m still not quite sure what it does. Must have seemed useful at the time. PHP related.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Fauna</h2>



<p><a href="https://fauna.com">https://fauna.com</a></p>



<p>A distributed, cloud-based database. One I was looking at when I was researching cloud-based key-value stores.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. Athena Crisis</h2>



<p><a href="https://athenacrisis.com">https://athenacrisis.com</a></p>



<p>A modern retro turn-based strategy game inspired by Advance Wars. Looked like an interesting little game. Was probably recommended.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. A deck of accessibility issues</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.perpendicularangel.com/2019/05/a-deck-of-accessibility-issues/">https://www.perpendicularangel.com/2019/05/a-deck-of-accessibility-issues/</a></p>



<p>An interesting tool for web developers and designers to consider accessibility, but also great for putting in front of management/stakeholders. I wanted to <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/alphabet-of-accessibility-deck">buy it</a>, but it was quite expensive.</p>
