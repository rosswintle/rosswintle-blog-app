<p>I have a proper day off so I&#8217;m catching up with some writing/sharing.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve finished a few books recently, which is very unlike me!</p>



<p>I have a few Seth Godin ebooks lined up in my wishlist on Kobo. This one got reduced to super-cheap and I bought it and read it pretty quickly. It&#8217;s not long.</p>



<p>This was my first Godin book, and I have to say it was disappointing. Perhaps it&#8217;s not his best? I don&#8217;t know.</p>



<p>It just felt like lots of short blog posts mashed together into a not-actually-all-that-coherant whole.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s about how traditional marketing can (in some cases, I guess) be replaced by what I would call community-building:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Marketing used to be about advertising, and advertising is expensive. Today, marketing is about engaging with the tribe and delivering products and services with stories that spread.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And it&#8217;s just some stories and thoughts and encouragements on that theme. Though I didn&#8217;t come away remembering much of what I&#8217;d read. So it wasn&#8217;t that impactful.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Ideas that spread, win. Boring ideas don&#8217;t spread. Boring organizations don&#8217;t grow. Working in an environment that is static is no fun. Even worse, working for an organization that is busy fighting off change is horrible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ironic, then, that I found Godin&#8217;s ideas pretty boring?</p>
