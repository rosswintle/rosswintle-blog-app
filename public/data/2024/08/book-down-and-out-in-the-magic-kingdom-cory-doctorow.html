<p>Well this was a wild ride. I&#8217;ve not read anything like this before.</p>



<p>I got a collection of eBooks of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a>&#8216;s novels on Humble Bundle. I was curious about his fiction work.</p>



<p>I think this book fits into the category of post-scarcity sci-fi. It&#8217;s Doctorow&#8217;s first novel and is actually released under a creative commons license, and can be <a href="https://craphound.com/category/down/">read for free</a>.</p>



<p>I started off very confused. There was a bunch of terminology early on &#8211; some of which I think was deliberately introduced early, and explained later. Some of which I just didn&#8217;t know because I don&#8217;t know much about Disneyland.</p>



<p>But I persevered, most things were explained, and it turned into quite a ride.</p>



<p>Very odd. Ended disappointingly. But worth a read.</p>
