<p>My habit of keeping interesting things open in tabs on my mobile is WAY out of hand. So I&#8217;m challenging myself to blog them as I close them down. 10 a day. This is part 7.</p>



<p>I am terrible at keeping up streaks like this. But I seem to be doing OK with this!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Correction/Apology</h2>



<p>I had an email from Taylor Hunt, who <a href="https://dev.to/tigt/the-weirdly-obscure-art-of-streamed-html-4gc2">wrote about streamed HTML</a>. Thanks Taylor!</p>



<p>I had skim read his article, and not fully got to grips with what it was about. So I&#8217;d like to say sorry to Taylor. When you read the article in detail and take time to understand it, streamed HTML is an interesting concept. I&#8217;ve update my commentary <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2024/07/old-tabs-part-5/">in part 5</a>.</p>
