<p>I have a new job!</p>



<p>In 2021, after ten years of freelance web development, I applied for a web developer job at Delicious Brains. It was a dream job. Almost. I not-very-secretly hoped that at some point I would move from developing the Delicious Brains websites to developing the Delicious Brains products that the websites were selling.</p>



<p>In 2022, Delicious Brains was bought by WP Engine. And because I was in the web development team, I moved into the equivalent team. Which happened to be in the marketing department.</p>



<p>And so I&#8217;ve inhabited this strange role of being a highly technical engineer working in a department of not-engineers.</p>



<p>My team has been completely wonderful. My boss is awesome, and my colleagues are some of the best engineers I&#8217;ve ever worked with. They work hard, but they have fun too. They are a friendly and smart bunch of people who care a lot about their work and the team.</p>



<p>But the direction of the team is very much marketing and front-end. That&#8217;s not really a direction that suits me, and therefore I&#8217;m not really a person that suits the direction. Someone else will be better suited to this team&#8217;s future than I am.</p>



<p><em>If you&#8217;re a senior level developer who is experienced in WordPress and React, has experience of making custom blocks, and is looking for a remote role in a busy marketing team, you could <a href="https://wpeng.in/webdev/">backfill my role</a>!</em></p>



<p>So when an engineering role came up in one of the Delicious Brains product teams, all these historic and future things combined into an obvious application. I apparently made a good impression. I got the job and started today.</p>



<p>It was a bittersweet decision to leave marketing and web dev &#8211; I&#8217;m sad to leave my friends and colleagues in the old team. But I know it&#8217;s the right thing for me to try this new thing!</p>



<p>Day one was good. I&#8217;m hoping to have made my first PRs on day two. And I&#8217;m looking forward to working on a set of products I&#8217;ve been a user of for over 10 years!</p>



<p>(My first WP Migrate DB Pro order was an order number less than 1800. My latest order number was over 111,100! I was an early customer, for sure!)</p>
