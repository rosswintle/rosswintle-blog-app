<p>My habit of keeping interesting things open in tabs on my mobile is WAY out of hand. So I&#8217;m going to set myself the challenge of blogging them as I close them down. 10 a day.</p>



<p>I am <em>terrible</em> at keeping up streaks like this but let&#8217;s get started and see what happens. I&#8217;m going oldest to newest. Let&#8217;s see what I was looking at a LONG time ago&#8230;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Rethinking WordPress Product Pricing Models by Jon Christopher</h2>



<p><a href="https://jonchristopher.us/blog/rethinking-wordpress-product-pricing-models/">https://jonchristopher.us/blog/rethinking-wordpress-product-pricing-models/</a></p>



<p>I don&#8217;t even know this person&#8217;s name but this sounds interesting. It&#8217;s from 2022. Has it been open THAT LONG‚ÄΩ</p>



<p>I skim-read this. It&#8217;s a look at how you could use paying for major software updates as a source of recurring revenue. It looks like Jon is still using this model 2 years later for <a href="https://organizewp.com/checkout/">OrganizeWP</a>. So maybe it worked? Or maybe he&#8217;s just not worked on the product much. Hard to tell.</p>



<p>Aside: I use this model for <a href="https://turbo-admin.com/">Turbo Admin</a>!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. What is a WordPress developer? &#8211; Post Status</h2>



<p><a href="https://poststatus.com/what-is-a-wordpress-developer">https://poststatus.com/what-is-a-wordpress-developer</a></p>



<p>This is a link to a podcast episode that I think I listened too. I probably had opinions. Not bookmarked.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Finding a new home for the WordPress community &#8211; Mike McAlister</h2>



<p><a href="https://olliewp.com/finding-a-new-home-for-the-wordpress-community/">https://olliewp.com/finding-a-new-home-for-the-wordpress-community/</a></p>



<p>Back at the end of 2022, while Elon&#8217;s Twitter acquisition was new, Mike was asking how we might use WordPress to power the WordPress community, rather than a proprietary social network.</p>



<p>At the time there was lots of interest and he spun up <code>openpress.social</code>. This is now dead.</p>



<p>Interesting because this week I have seen people asking why WordPress companies don&#8217;t use WordPress for other things.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. StellarWP Releases Open-Source Libraries for Advanced WordPress Development</h2>



<p><a href="https://stellarwp.com/stellarwp-releases-open-source-libraries-for-advanced-wordpress-development/">https://stellarwp.com/stellarwp-releases-open-source-libraries-for-advanced-wordpress-development/</a></p>



<p>StellarWP is a brand with some big WP plugin properties. This introduces us to <a href="https://github.com/stellarwp">their open source libraries</a> and explains why they see it as a positive thing to share their work. Nice!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Web Scraping With PHP by darshankhandelwal12</h2>



<p><a href="https://serpdog.io/blog/web-scraping-with-php/">https://serpdog.io/blog/web-scraping-with-php/</a></p>



<p>This is a from-scratch tutorial (like, it starts with how to set up PHP!) on web scraping. I probably bookmarked it because it references <a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/Goutte">Goutte</a> &#8211; a now archived screen scraping and web crawling library for PHP. Seems to have been replaced by <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/browser_kit.html#making-external-http-requests">Symfony&#8217;s HttpBrowser</a> component. So I&#8217;ll bookmark that!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. No Sponsors ??</h2>



<p>https://git.joinfirefish.org/</p>



<p>This seems defunct. It says &#8220;No Sponsors &#8211; git.joinfirefish.org currently does not have any sponsors for you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Open feedback as a gift</h2>



<p><a href="https://werd.io/2023/a-tool-for-open-feedback-as-a-gift">https://werd.io/2023/a-tool-for-open-feedback-as-a-gift</a></p>



<p>Oooh, I like this. We need feedback to thrive. We can&#8217;t get better if we don&#8217;t know what we are doing wrong. But giving and receiving feedback is hard. So frameworks can be helpful for ensuring we all get better together! Yay!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. ‚ÄúI want to communicate and be understood, but it‚Äôs a struggle‚Äù &#8211; apolitical</h2>



<p><a href="https://apolitical.co/solution-articles/en/i-want-to-communicate-and-be-understood-but-its-a-struggle">https://apolitical.co/solution-articles/en/i-want-to-communicate-and-be-understood-but-its-a-struggle</a></p>



<p>I remember reading this. It&#8217;s about what it&#8217;s like for an autistic person to communicate with a neurotypical person: It&#8217;s exhausting! And enlightening to read about.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. Using Custom Templates with Rewrite Rules in WordPress Plugins &#8211; Tom Mcfarlin</h2>



<p>My thoughts on this, in order, were:</p>



<p><a href="https://tommcfarlin.com/custom-templates-with-rewrite-rules/">https://tommcfarlin.com/custom-templates-with-rewrite-rules/</a></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>How does Tom capitalise his surname? It&#8217;s all caps on the site so I can&#8217;t tell.</li>



<li>Wow, he&#8217;s still using the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/hemingway/">Hemingway theme</a>! That&#8217;s 10 years old. I used that for a while. It&#8217;s stood the test of time. I like it!</li>



<li>What on earth is this about? One of those sadly-necessary, word-soup WordPress things.</li>



<li>Wait, I was fighting rewrite rules today. This might be useful. Bookmarked!</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. At last, marshmallows from a spray can &#8211; Axios</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/06/26/marshmallows-whipped-cream-aerosol-spray-can">https://www.axios.com/2023/06/26/marshmallows-whipped-cream-aerosol-spray-can</a></p>



<p>Might just leave this one open, tbh. ü§£</p>
