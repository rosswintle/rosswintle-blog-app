<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Lots of new things</h1></header><main>
<p>I haven&#8217;t written for a while.</p>



<p>I haven&#8217;t been creative in many ways of late. Not the normal ways anyway. Most of my coding projects are stalled. I&#8217;ve not been doing much deeper thinking about things.</p>



<p>So what have I been doing?</p>



<p>Well, mainly, I&#8217;ve been:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Clearing out and tearing down two sheds in my garden to make way for&#8230;</li>



<li>Arranging installation of a new garden office because I&#8217;m&#8230;</li>



<li>Moving out of my old office.</li>



<li>Changing jobs.</li>



<li>Voting in a new government.</li>
</ul>



<p>So yes, lots of change.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll keep this post short as each of these changes deserves a post of its own.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s not been much going on here. It&#8217;s been all change!</p>
