<p>My habit of keeping interesting things open in tabs on my mobile is WAY out of hand. So I&#8217;m challenging myself to blog them as I close them down. 10 a day. This is part 4.</p>



<p>I am terrible at keeping up streaks like this. We&#8217;ll see how long it lasts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1.  De-coupling Domain Logic in WordPress &#8211; Tom McFarlin</h2>



<p><a href="https://tommcfarlin.com/domain-logic-in-wordpress/">https://tommcfarlin.com/domain-logic-in-wordpress/</a></p>



<p>More good stuff from Tom on code architecture in WordPress.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Create a static build &#8211; FrakenPHP</h2>



<p><a href="https://frankenphp.dev/docs/static">https://frankenphp.dev/docs/static</a></p>



<p>FrakenPHP is a PHP application server written in Go. This help article explains how to use the static-php-cli project to create a statically built PHP application. Useful for me because I was looking at making a statically-built PHP CLI tool.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. static-php-cli</h2>



<p><a href="https://static-php.dev/en/guide/manual-build.html">https://static-php.dev/en/guide/manual-build.html</a></p>



<p>Docs for the actual static-php-cli project.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. static-php-cli&#8217;s precompiled binaries</h2>



<p><a href="https://dl.zhamao.xin/static-php-cli">https://dl.zhamao.xin/static-php-cli</a></p>



<p>Index of static-php-cli&#8217;s precompiled binaries. Boring!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. The Year Twitter Died &#8211; The Verge</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23972308/twitter-x-death-tweets-history-elon-musk">https://www.theverge.com/c/23972308/twitter-x-death-tweets-history-elon-musk</a></p>



<p>The Verge&#8217;s really excellent, uniquely art-directed article about the death of Twitter in 2023. Funny. Poignant.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. dnspeep  &#8211; Julia Evans</h2>



<p><a href="https://github.com/jvns/dnspeep">https://github.com/jvns/dnspeep</a></p>



<p>Julia (<a href="https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk#.">@b0rk</a>) makes amazing educational &#8220;Zines&#8221; about tech stuff. But she also makes tools that help you understand those things. dnspeep is an experimental tool for spying on your DNS queries.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Glorious GMMK 2 Compact 65% Keyboard</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/gmmk2">https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/gmmk2</a></p>



<p>I think I had this open as a possible gift for my son. It&#8217;s a good quality mechanical gaming keyboard that you build yourself and is highly customisable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Teller &#8211; <a href="https://www.dannyvankooten.com/">Danny van Kooten</a></h2>



<p>https://teller.dvk.co</p>



<p>I love Danny&#8217;s work. Teller was an attempt at &#8220;simple website analytics software that only does aggregate counts&#8221;. Seems it&#8217;s abandoned, but you can see something of it at <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~dvko/teller">https://git.sr.ht/~dvko/teller</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. You don&#8217;t need JavaScript for that &#8211; Kilian Valkhof</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2023/2">https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2023/2</a></p>



<p>I&#8217;m very much into the web platform and using minimal JS and progressive enhancement. So this list of some things that you think you need JavaScript for but maybe don&#8217;t is good. Custom switches/toggles; datalist/autosuggest; colour pickers; accordions; and dialogs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. The case of the Golden Idol</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thegoldenidol.com">https://www.thegoldenidol.com</a></p>



<p>A recommended game. You can play the first chapter in the browser, which is kinda cool.</p>
