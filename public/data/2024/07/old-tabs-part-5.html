<p>My habit of keeping interesting things open in tabs on my mobile is WAY out of hand. So I&#8217;m challenging myself to blog them as I close them down. 10 a day. This is part 5.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m terrible at keeping up streaks like this. But I&#8217;m doing OK at this one so far!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. The weirdly obscure art of Streamed HTML</h2>

<p>Streamed HTML is an interesting idea. A shame it&#8217;s not well supported server-side.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Neocities</h2>



<p><a href="https://neocities.org">https://neocities.org</a></p>



<p>Free retro websites. What&#8217;s not to like! I should make one.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Tricky Quiz</h2>



<p><a href="https://community.naimaudio.com/t/tricky-quiz/32397">https://community.naimaudio.com/t/tricky-quiz/32397</a></p>



<p>We got given a print out of Richard Osman&#8217;s 60-cities quiz for Christmas. It was an excellent gift.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. WP PHP Unit</h2>



<p><a href="https://github.com/wp-phpunit/docs">https://github.com/wp-phpunit/docs</a></p>



<p>The WordPress PHPUnit unit test library included in the WordPress core develop repository, made installable via Composer.</p>



<p>Boring. Useful. Bookmarked.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Report: Unity Cutting About 1,800 People In Company&#8217;s Largest Layoff (in January 2024)</h2>



<p><a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-layoffs-1800-people-jobs-25-percent-january-2024-1851150254">https://kotaku.com/unity-layoffs-1800-people-jobs-25-percent-january-2024-1851150254</a></p>



<p>I knew a person who worked at Unity. So probably opened this out of interest. Not really interesting any more.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Website Monitor &#8211; Neatnik</h2>



<p><a href="https://github.com/neatnik/website-monitor">https://github.com/neatnik/website-monitor</a></p>



<p>A simple PHP-based website monitoring tool from the maker of <a href="https://omg.lol/">omg.lol</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Web Dev Toolkit &#8211; Chris Ferdinandi</h2>



<p><a href="https://gomakethings.com/toolkit">https://gomakethings.com/toolkit</a></p>



<p>Chris is a proponent of sensible use of JavaScript. This is his collection of boilerplates, helper functions, and libraries you can copy/paste to make building a simpler, more resilient web a bit easier. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Niklaus Wirth: ‘A Plea for Lean Software’ (via John Gruber / Daring Fireball)</h2>

<p>Excellent quotes from an essay. Mentions communication problems, complexity and size of both projects and teams.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. LÖVE</h2>



<p><a href="https://love2d.org">https://love2d.org</a></p>



<p>An <em>awesome</em> framework (their words, not mine!) you can use to make 2D games in Lua. It&#8217;s free, open-source, and works on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a parallel universe in which I don&#8217;t have kids or a job and I just tinker with retro gaming stuff all day. This is the kind of thing.</p>

<p>A little cartoon from Chris about how web development gets out of hand, you build a framework, and then&#8230;</p>
