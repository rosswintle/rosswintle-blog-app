<p>My habit of keeping interesting things open in tabs on my mobile is WAY out of hand. So I&#8217;m challenging myself to blog them as I close them down. 10 a day. This is part 3.</p>



<p>I am terrible at keeping up streaks like this. We&#8217;ll see how long it lasts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.peppercarrot.com/en/webcomics/index.html">https://www.peppercarrot.com/en/webcomics/index.html</a></p>



<p>Just beautiful, free web comics. &#8220;A free(libre) and open-source webcomic supported directly by its patrons to change the comic book industry!&#8221;</p>

<p>I follow Rhys as a fellow UK WordPresser. He&#8217;s a super nice guy and very experienced. This was a podcast he was on. I don&#8217;t think I ever got around to listening to it.</p>

<p>Jeffrey runs <a href="https://laracasts.com/">Laracasts</a>. He seems like just such a smart, humble, kind, and gentle person. </p>



<p>This is an excellent article on creating a business that fits your life and personality.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Code Simplicity (free eBook)</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.codesimplicity.com/book/?ck_subscriber_id=2339842437">https://www.codesimplicity.com/book/</a></p>



<p>This is a free eBook about fundamental laws of software design. 80 pages of PDF. Probably a good read!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Turn Any PHP Script into a Native Single-File Binary &#8211; Roman Pronskiy</h2>



<p><a href="https://pronskiy.com/blog/php-script-as-binary">https://pronskiy.com/blog/php-script-as-binary</a></p>



<p>This is an example of how you can use <a href="https://github.com/crazywhalecc/static-php-cli">crazywhalecc/static-php-cli</a> to create a PHP script bundled with a static PHP binary that works as a standalone tool. Ideal for CLI tooling. Probably open because I was working on some <a href="https://github.com/rosswintle/quick-wp">PHP-based CLI tooling</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. 67 Weird Debugging Tricks Your Browser Doesn&#8217;t Want You to Know &#8211; Alan Norbauer</h2>



<p><a href="https://alan.norbauer.com/articles/browser-debugging-tricks">https://alan.norbauer.com/articles/browser-debugging-tricks</a></p>



<p>This is a big bunch of debugging tricks for devtools in your browser. 67 is a weird (but big!) number.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. get_debug_type &#8211; PHP</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.get-debug-type.php">https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.get-debug-type.php</a></p>



<p>A new function in PHP v8.0 that gets the type name of a variable in a way that is suitable for debugging. Like an improved <code>gettype()</code></p>



<p>I guess I didn&#8217;t know this existed! (So many useful little functions in PHP)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Ada &amp; Zangemann &#8211; A Tale of Software, Skateboards, and Raspberry Ice Cream &#8211; Free Software Foundation Europe</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s an illustrated book about a girl who discovers the power of technology to make change. I&#8217;d buy it just based on the title!!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. Thoughtful Block UI for WordPress &#8211; Aurooba Ahmed</h2>



<p><a href="https://courses.auroobamakes.com/course/thoughtful-block-ui-for-wordpress/">https://courses.auroobamakes.com/course/thoughtful-block-ui-for-wordpress/</a></p>



<p>Aurooba&#8217;s excellent and good-value course on creating thoughtful block user interfaces. It&#8217;s under an hour of content, but Aurooba is an expert at this stuff and you can learn a lot (yes, I now own this course).</p>
