<p><em>I was putting some new habits in place to try and bring more energy and discipline to 2024. How&#8217;s that all going?</em></p>



<p>Previously, <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2023/12/2024-self-improvement-and-habits/">I explained how I wanted to start some new habits</a> to make 2024-me better. The top habits &#8211; the easy ones with the most impact &#8211; were:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Eat well</li>



<li>Exercise</li>



<li>Floss</li>



<li>Declutter</li>
</ul>



<p>But there were others that should have been do-able too:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Clean/tidy/fix up our house properly</li>



<li>Stop going to bed late</li>



<li>Read more books</li>



<li>Write more</li>
</ul>



<p>And the things I wanted to do, but that really had to give way because they were harder and lower value:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Work on side projects&#8230; ðŸ˜•</li>
</ul>



<p>Well, I&#8217;m just about recovered from Covid, which hasn&#8217;t helped matters. It&#8217;s basically written off the last week, and February will be a clean start. But let&#8217;s look at how it&#8217;s gone.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m tracking in the excellent TickTick app (which I plan to write about sometime) and it lets me export a nice little graphic of my month.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Clarifications on some of the habits</h3>



<p>Just to clarify some of these, because their wording in some cases doesn&#8217;t really say what they are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>&#8220;Quit snacks&#8221; is pretty self-explanatory, but I&#8217;m basically calorie tracking with the Lose It app, and this is me hitting my goal there.</li>



<li>&#8220;Do housework&#8221; makes is sound like I don&#8217;t normally do any. Which is not true. The idea of this is that I will do a significant piece of housework OR a DIY job on the house/garden/car _before_ I sit and have &#8220;me time&#8221; in the evening. It&#8217;s about doing things in the right order (rather than playing Zelda for two hours and then rushing to get the dishes done before I go to bed).</li>



<li>&#8220;Early to bed&#8221; actually means not starting doing anything new after 10:30pm. I still may not be asleep until quite late. But it&#8217;s the cut off for new things that&#8217;s important.</li>
</ul>



<p>How&#8217;s it going then?</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Plan your day: Started well, but have dropped off. This ALWAYS happens. Need to nail it because it&#8217;s SO useful.</li>



<li>Quit snacks: Was doing so well and losing some weight and was proud of myself. Then events and illness happened. A fresh start in February. Let&#8217;s do better!!</li>



<li>Mini workouts: Again, started strong, but succumbed to events. Need to find ways to not let events get in the way here. Should be doable.</li>



<li>Do housework: Not sure what happened in that middle week. But I recovered before Covid struck. This is good!</li>



<li>Reading: This is was lower importance, but has clearly been easy to do. I&#8217;ve even finished <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2024/02/book-doughnut-economics-by-kate-raworth/">two</a> <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2024/02/book-indie-microblogging-by-manton-reece/">books</a>!</li>



<li>Early to bed: Excellent. Skipped a few nights. Because sometimes I just want to pause and do something fun or interesting. But generally good here!</li>



<li>Flossing: Excellent. I am now a &#8220;person who flosses&#8221;. My dentist will be proud!</li>



<li>Declutter: Very poor. This is really interesting. BUT&#8230; given how well I&#8217;m doing with the others I&#8217;m not going to beat myself up about it. Call this a stretch goal.</li>



<li>Exercise: The goal here is actually 5 days a week of either cycling to my office, or doing some other &#8220;proper&#8221; exercise. So I&#8217;m actually doing pretty well. Again &#8211; Covid stopped me in my tracks. But I should be able to get this one back on the go.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Summary</h3>



<p>Overall, I&#8217;m REALLY happy. It&#8217;s supposed to be hard to work on multiple habits, and I&#8217;ve done it pretty well. I&#8217;m really pleased.</p>



<p>Covid did really mess things up though. It&#8217;s Monday tomorrow. A new week. Let&#8217;s see how we get on as we reset and start a new month!</p>



<p>How are your goals or resolutions going?</p>
