The book is finally here. And I&#8217;ve managed to read it quite quickly (for me). Is it any good?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s worth saying that Manton&#8217;s book on Indie Microblogging is <a href=\"https:\/\/book.micro.blog\/\">free to read on the internet<\/a>, can be downloaded as a <a href=\"https:\/\/book.micro.blog\/indie-microblogging.epub\">free ePub<\/a> and is licensed as Creative Commons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve always loved the idea of micro blogging, of the Indie Web, of owning your content, of federation and so on. I blog here, on my own site, and my Mastodon feed is replicated to <a href=\"https:\/\/latest.rosswintle.uk\/\">https:\/\/latest.rosswintle.uk\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, despite trying&#8230; hard&#8230; several times&#8230;, I&#8217;ve always found Manton&#8217;s Micro.blog service a bit clumsy and over complicated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now Manton has, after all these years, finally finished the book! Hooray! And congrats!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does this help me get my head around the Micro.blog service any more?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it kinda does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two things I took away from this book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Manton&#8217;s thoughts (and those of others) on the nature of the web, of blogging, and of social media.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some really deep detail on the inner workings of the Micro.blog service and some of the protocols and standards that it uses.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, I think this should be two books. One is a really good manual\/technical guide to Indie Web protocols and a user manual and developer guide for Micro.blog. And the other is the &#8220;thinky&#8221; bit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I enjoyed both, I suppose. I got much more out of the thinky bit. But it was interesting to learn more about how Micro.blog works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just found it weird that the start and end were philosophical, and relevant to many. But then there was a huge diversion in the middle into code snippets and JSON output and&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. That felt like it should have been elsewhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also left me feeling&#8230; well&#8230; how the Indie Web always leaves me feeling. It&#8217;s too complicated! Manton walks the talk, by literally running a service that makes the indie web protocols much easier (THANK YOU!!!!). But then&#8230; it&#8217;s still complicated. RSS, XML, JSONFeed, ActivityPub, Webmention, Micropub, Pingbacks, Microformats, PubSubHubub.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, this book does help you understand how it all fits together. But it also makes it evident that it&#8217;s just really complicated. And if even <em>I <\/em>don&#8217;t care enough, then there&#8217;s a very small number of people who do. And that&#8217;s always bothered me about the Indie Web.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All credit to Manton though. He got the book out! And it&#8217;s good. Just feel free to skip the Micro.blog manual parts.<\/p>\n",
