<p>[Contains mild spoilers]</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not sure how I came across Blake Crouch. Probably recommended by the Kobo algorithm. Or his book was in a sale and sounded cool. I remember downloading a free preview of &#8220;Dark Matter&#8221; and reading it and thinking it was good.</p>



<p>Anyhow, I ended up reading &#8220;Recursion&#8221; first. &#8220;A compulsive, breathtaking exploration of memory and what it means to be human.&#8221;</p>



<p>I got through it pretty quickly and was pretty gripped. It&#8217;s essentially a time travel story, but one which tries to escape all the &#8220;but what about&#8221;s of regular time travel in its execution. It held together well though, helped by not having to many main characters to keep track of.</p>



<p>About half way through I thought it had ended and was wondering what else would happen. It turns out the answer is: a whole load of weird and unnecessary traumatic and violent stuff!</p>



<p>It was good. Good story. Well written. A fun romp. I enjoyed reading. But that second half could have been a lot shorter and I felt the ending was missing something. The characters put SO much effort into fixing what they had messed up and then, in the end, the solution &#8211; if that&#8217;s what it was &#8211; was pretty simple.</p>



<p>I will read more from Crouch. He&#8217;s a good storyteller!</p>
