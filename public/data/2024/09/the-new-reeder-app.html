<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of using RSS and I&#8217;ve loved the iOS and MacOs Reeder app for years.</p>



<p>Recently a new version of <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> came out that&#8217;s in many ways different, but in many ways similar.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>It&#8217;s a subscription model to get all the features (but it&#8217;s VERY good value).</li>



<li>It doesn&#8217;t integrate with other services for it&#8217;s syncing. It&#8217;s just a feed reader and read-it-later app that syncs over iCloud.</li>



<li>It includes a video player and seems to also have a good podcast ability.</li>



<li>It emphasises a timeline sync feature.</li>
</ol>



<p>I immediately tried it out as Reeder is so good and I use it a lot. I was keen to see what was new and different.</p>



<p>First of all, the free version only lets you add 10 feeds, and as such it doesn&#8217;t let you import. So if you&#8217;re an existing Reeder user, it&#8217;s not easy to migrate and try it out, which was a bit sad. I&#8217;m hoping the developer will realise that this could be better and maybe a one-time import should be allowed or a free trial or something.</p>



<p>As I haven&#8217;t paid anything for Reeder since a £10 purchase of Reeder 5 for Mac in 2021, I was happy to pay £1 to get a month&#8217;s upgrade and do an import and try it out.</p>



<p>The first thing I realised is that my existing Reeder app syncs with <a href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a> (which I also love &#8211; especially in the browser). And Feedbin has a bunch of other features that I use, like forwarding email newsletters, which I would miss in Reeder.</p>



<p>So I kind of immediately dropped it and unsubscribed.</p>



<p>But I kept opening it to check in. And what you have to get is that this timeline-sync thing is the main thing here. It&#8217;s trying to be a curated social news feed algorithm thing. You have to think of it like that.</p>



<p>And if you do, and you combine that with the save-for-later feature, you can scroll through your main feed; swipe to read-later anything that&#8217;s of interest, then switch to the read-later feed to actually read things.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s quite a nice workflow.</p>



<p>So I&#8217;ll keep trying it out this month, but I&#8217;ll also keep Feedbin because the email newsletters thing is such a cool feature.</p>



<p>Feedbin can provide a combined feed of starred articles that I could subscribe to with Reeder, but that&#8217;s not really want I want.</p>



<p>I might try out <a href="https://kill-the-newsletter.com/">kill-the-newsletter.com</a> as a way to get around this &#8211; send newsletters to this address, and subscribe to that feed in Reeder. That might work and may be worth a try. But I don&#8217;t know how reliable and sustainable Kill the Newsletter is.</p>



<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s a nice app. It&#8217;s great value. I&#8217;m going to keep trying it and see if I can figure out a way to use it for what I need. But in the meantime it&#8217;s Feedbin and &#8220;<a href="https://reederapp.com/classic/">Reeder Classic</a>&#8220;.</p>
