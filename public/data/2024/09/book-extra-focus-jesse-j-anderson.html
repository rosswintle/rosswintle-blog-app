<p>So&#8230; I&#8217;m not diagnosed with any form of ADHD or ASD, but I do often feel like I&#8217;m not neurotypical. If I am then I&#8217;m very high-functioning, with enough coping strategies that you probably wouldn&#8217;t notice. </p>



<p>But I have a pile of books about topics like this ready to go.</p>



<p><a href="https://adhdjesse.com/">Jesse J Anderson</a> is what I would call an &#8220;ADHD influencer&#8221;. He&#8217;s big on social media, and ended up writing this short book, <a href="https://www.extrafocusbook.com/">Extra Focus: The Quick Start Guide to Adult ADHD</a>.</p>



<p>It covers both what ADHD is like, and it has a load of short practical strategies for coping with it.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a short, concise book, which is great for people who struggle to focus on long rambling stories. It is to-the-point and Iove it as a result.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the kind of book that you will refer to over and over again to revisit the strategies as and when you need them. I almost wish I had a paper copy. I really recommend it.</p>



<p>As I read this book I felt myself thinking a lot: What, you mean, most people DON&#8217;T experience that?</p>



<p>People don&#8217;t find All The New Things interesting and love to dive in deep to a random new field of study or creativity?</p>



<p>People don&#8217;t get focussed so deep on things that &#8220;you’re afraid that if you try to redirect your focus anywhere else, you’ll disrupt your momentum and never get it back&#8221;?</p>



<p>People don&#8217;t find themselves wandering off on the more interesting tangential piece of work?</p>



<p>They don&#8217;t &#8220;primarily find motivation through interest, novelty, challenge, and urgency&#8221;?</p>



<p>They don&#8217;t like to have a messy desk with work actually on it and a load of open tabs because &#8220;hoarding is actually a form of self-preservation. Why? Because we often forget things we can’t see.&#8221;</p>



<p>I left me feeling more and more certain of my own probable &#8220;neuro-spicyness&#8221;. But also gave me a pile of new coping strategies! Hooray!</p>



<p>The book also came with a bunch of introductory emails with extra information that was helpful. A really neat addition! Thanks, Jesse!</p>
