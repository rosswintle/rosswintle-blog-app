<p>I don&#8217;t buy many clothes.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t like buying clothes.</p>



<p>But I needed to buy clothes.</p>



<p>And so I bought clothes.</p>



<p>In the sale.</p>



<p>I bought three nice jumpers, a pair of jeans, and a new hat! From a more-premium outlet. For an average ticket price of under Â£15!</p>



<p>Seriously, the hat was the second most expensive item!!</p>



<p>I confess, I was partly embarrassed about wearing the same boring things over and over on Zoom calls.</p>



<p>But now I have different hat styles. And different coloured jumpers. They were literally all grey and blue before.</p>



<p>So now I can mix it up a bit more. Like my incredibly well-dressed Zoom-based colleagues do EVERY day!</p>



<p>And it was fun!!</p>



<p>And exciting.</p>



<p>And everyone likes the new hat!</p>



<p>Do I feel bad about indulging in retail therapy?</p>



<p>No.</p>



<p>Because, I don&#8217;t do fast fashion.</p>



<p>I buy few clothes and make them last a long time.</p>



<p>But it really was fun.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m very proud of myself.</p>



<p>I _almost_ posted a selfie.</p>



<p>Almost.</p>
