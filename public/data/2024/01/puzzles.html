<p>Remember Wordle? I LOVE puzzles, and we&#8217;ve accumulated quite a few fun things to do each day as a family. We generally do some of these over the breakfast table. It&#8217;s AMAZING that all this stuff exists and is so accessible. Here&#8217;s our favourites.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Wordle</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html</a></p>



<p>The classic. We still love it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Connections</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections">https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections</a></p>



<p>This is my current favourite. 16 words that you have to group into four groups of four that have something in common. A real brain teaser. But quick and interesting.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Waffle</h3>



<p><a href="https://wafflegame.net/daily">https://wafflegame.net/daily</a></p>



<p>I found out about this from a Slack group that has a &#8220;Wordle/Waffle/etc&#8221; channel. 6 Wordles in one in a crossword arrangement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Keyword</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/games/keyword/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/games/keyword/</a></p>



<p>My daughter loves this for some reason. But I&#8217;m not so much of a fan. We usually get it without error.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Crosshare</h3>



<p><a href="https://crosshare.org/">https://crosshare.org/</a></p>



<p>I love this daily, mini crossword. The app is good. It can be done quickly. Though it often has US-specific cultural references that make it tricky for a Brit.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Puzzmo</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re REALLY into Puzzles, then Puzzmo is a good place to hang out. It&#8217;s like a subscription puzzle service (with a free tier) with a community and leaderboards. Co-created by Zach Gage who seems to be churning out puzzle games with a fun design aesthetic (<a href="https://www.playgoodsudoku.com/">Good Sudoku</a>, <a href="http://www.spelltower.com/">Spell Tower</a>, <a href="https://playknotwords.com/">Knotwords</a>).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Quordle/Octordle</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/games/quordle/#/">https://www.merriam-webster.com/games/quordle/#/</a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/games/octordle/daily">https://www.britannica.com/games/octordle/daily</a></p>



<p>Multiple Wordles with limited guesses. These are an interesting challenge. We have a good strategy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Framed</h3>



<p><a href="https://framed.wtf/">https://framed.wtf/</a></p>



<p>For film buffs. You get to guess a movie from 6 images. It&#8217;s good, but requires very specific knowledge and can rarely be worked out. So more of a quiz than a puzzle. We did it for a while but rarely do now. Not kid friendly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Worldle</h3>



<p><a href="https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/">https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/</a></p>



<p>Guess the country from its outline. A good little geography quiz. Occasionally veers off to weird Pacific islands that you&#8217;ve never heard of. There are extra bits too like guess the neighbouring countries that improve your geography knowledge. Limited by the number of countries in the world (we&#8217;ve been round at least once).</p>
