<p><em>This phrase has been a huge change of mindset for me. Really transformative. And I&#8217;m much happier. Here&#8217;s what I mean.</em></p>



<p>The phrase is from James Clear, of Atomic Habits fame:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Life is harder when you expect a lot of the world and little of yourself.</p>



<p>Life is easier when you expect a lot of yourself and little of the world.</p>



<p>High standards, low expectations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It seems to me that you can play life two ways.</p>



<p>You can expect everyone to do things your way.</p>



<p>Which is tough, because not everyone even knows what &#8220;your way&#8221; is.</p>



<p>This applies as much at the stacking of the dishwasher as it does at the Zoom call.</p>



<p>Applying your own standards to others is hard (the &#8220;Life is harder&#8221; bit?).</p>



<p>Because you need to educate people. Because your way might be worse than someone else&#8217;s, so they need to educate YOU. Because you will be critical of others (silently, or vocally &#8211; both are bad!).</p>



<p>I am guilty of these things. And there is balance to be found.</p>



<p>Life CAN be easier when people you collaborate with have the same expectations.</p>



<p>Wisdom is therefore knowing when to expect a lot of yourself, and when to expect a lot of the world.</p>



<p>For me, I had lost that balance and swung to expecting too much of others in the hope that they might work in my ways.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve known this for a long time and have been figuring out:</p>



<ul>
<li>Do I keep putting my expectations on them?</li>



<li>Do I accept the status quo?</li>



<li>Or do I just get on with things myself?</li>
</ul>



<p>&#8220;Life is harder when you expect a lot of the world&#8221; because:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>There is conflict</strong>, because the world doesn&#8217;t know what your expectations are.</li>



<li><strong>You will be disappointed</strong> if you expect others to work the way you want them to, because they are not you &#8211; they have different values and goals.</li>



<li><strong>And your goals aren&#8217;t met</strong> because you&#8217;re not doing the work in the hope that others will.</li>
</ul>



<p>I will soon write about &#8220;confidence&#8221;. These topics are related.</p>



<p>I am becoming confident in how I do things. And so I will do them. And if others want to join in then they can.</p>



<p>YES, there are places where processes and standards are necessary for effective collaboration. But where that&#8217;s not the case, I&#8217;m doing things my way, and accepting that others will do things their way.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been quite a mindset shift for me.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m much happier as a result.</p>
