<p>Easter is upon us. It is Holy Week.  And the shops are full of Easter merchandise hoping that the sun and the temptation of copious quantities of chocolate will spur people on to spend their hard earned reddies.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s it really about?</p>
<p>M&amp;S have a series of signs up:</p>
<p>Easter is&#8230;<br />    eating together<br />Easter is&#8230;<br />    giving gifts<br />Easter is&#8230;<br />    all good things<br />Easter is&#8230;<br />    simply chocolate</p>
<p>OK, so the first three probably redeem themselves by bearing a passing resemblance to things that actually happened at Easter.  After all there was the last supper; probably the most remembered meal in history; and Jesus is the greatest gift of all and a very good thing!  Yet the symbols of fancy wrapping paper and gravy-coated beef don&#8217;t quite cut it.</p>
<p>Easter is a celebration of the greatest life ever lived and the greatest death ever died; a chance to remember the meaning of life and to celebrate the man who brings us reality and eternity.</p>
<p>Easter is&#8230;the best celebration ever.  Hallelujah!</p>
