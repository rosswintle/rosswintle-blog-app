For some reason I bailed out of posting it when I wrote it back in November 2011. I don&#8217;t know why. To my knowledge, I&#8217;ve not cycled this roundabout since &#8211; and it&#8217;s still a bit scary to drive!]</em></p>
<p>Those who follow me on Twitter, or who have been reading for a while, may know I go by the alias &#8220;magicroundabout&#8221; sometimes. This is a name I acquired long ago, for good reason at the time, and it&#8217;s stuck.</p>
<p>I chose the name, not after the children&#8217;s cartoon, but after the junction in my home town, and current place of residence: Swindon. If you&#8217;re not familiar with the junction perhaps a video demonstrates best:</p>

<p>Now, the Magic Roundabout has a bad reputation. &#8220;Complicated&#8221;,  &#8220;scary&#8221;, &#8220;designed by traffic planners in the 70&#8217;s while on acid&#8221; are all things you&#8217;ll commonly hear.  But it&#8217;s actually really good and I&#8217;ve never felt unsafe in all my hundreds and thousands of crossings on it.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The real danger is almost at the end of my road: Bruce Street Bridges.  Where I just suffered my second &#8220;assassination attempt&#8221; (to coin a phrase from <a href="http://karlmccracken.sweat365.com/">Karl</a>).</p>
<p>Take a look on <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/?ll=51.568504,-1.801468&amp;spn=0.002331,0.006539&amp;hnear=Swindon+SN2+2HG,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=h&amp;z=18&amp;vpsrc=6">Google Maps</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve now TWICE had drivers charge at me whilst cycling this roundabout.  I think today&#8217;s was a low-sunlight-induced &#8220;Sorry Mate I Didn&#8217;t See You&#8221;, but my opinion would be that if the sun&#8217;s in your eyes you slow down and look twice. And then look again! Not speed up!</p>
<p>The previous incident had no such excuse.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fine. But finding this junction increasingly dangerous, even in a car.  More and more people coast towards the give way lines, stopping is the second thing on their mind.  I confess, I&#8217;m probably guilty too.</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s never any excuse for bad driving, but I think bad driving is encouraged by the design of the junction:</p>
<p>1) It&#8217;s really busy but I don&#8217;t think it has an even-enough flow of traffic.  There are places where, at peak times, it&#8217;s impossible to join the flow of traffic because it&#8217;s all coming from one side.</p>
<p>2) I think there&#8217;s too many lanes. Here&#8217;s an image of the approach to the location of my first assassination attempt (<a title="Bruce Street Bridges on Google Street View" href="http://g.co/maps/5uz58">explore for yourself</a>). There&#8217;s three lanes here on the approach from the left, and visibility approaching the roundabout from that direction is poor &#8211; people in the second and third lanes won&#8217;t be able to see much of what&#8217;s coming (but still want to coast in order to join the traffic flow).</p>
<p><a href="https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/bruce-street.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1252" title="bruce-street" src="https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/bruce-street-1024x585.png" alt="" width="500" height="285" srcset="https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/bruce-street-1024x585.png 1024w, https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/bruce-street-300x171.png 300w, https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/bruce-street-150x85.png 150w, https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/bruce-street.png 1218w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>3) Because it&#8217;s a complicated junction there&#8217;s also lots of street furniture. That big sign on the left is important, but probably hinders visibility too.</p>
<p>4) It&#8217;s non-standard.  Standard two-lane approach to a roundabout is: left lane for turning left or straight on; right lane for turning right or straight on (<a title="Highway Code Roundabout Rules" href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/Highwaycode/DG_070338">Rule 186!</a>). But most of the roundabouts here have non-standard approaches.  Three lanes, or left-lane only for turning left. It causes lots of confusion and last-minute lane-changes.</p>
<p>5) Cycle/pedestrian infrastructure exists, but is incomplete. There are toucan and pedestrian paths and crossings, but they seem to only cover 3/4 of the junction. And it certainly feels like pedestrians and cyclists are impeded and low priority. I guess they&#8217;ve made it as safe as they can given it&#8217;s awkward, under-the-railway location and the busy-ness of the place.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s definitely driving issues too though. These aren&#8217;t huge roundabouts, you should be able to safely cycle them. But actually, I feel unsafe in a CAR on this junction.  I often find myself in a situation where I&#8217;m on the roundabout and cars are coasting towards me not looking like they&#8217;re going to stop. I slow down. They slow down but still don&#8217;t look like they want to stop. I slow down more.   I even got honked for doing this one day, like my own caution was causing an issue to the person whose place it was to give way.</p>
<p>This morning, that stuff, combined with some hideous overtaking didn&#8217;t make my first bike ride in a week particularly pleasant.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve debriefed with Sally. I&#8217;m not cycling Bruce Street again. My life is too precious. I&#8217;ll stop and use the half-baked pedestrian/shared infrastructure.  Cycling feels dangerous. But I know that risks to my health are greater if I DON&#8217;T cycle. Especially now I&#8217;m a work-from-home freelancer.</p>
<p>There are<a title="Plans for Great Western Way Improvements" href="http://www.swindon.gov.uk/cd/cd-consultations/cd-consultations-current/Documents/greatwesternwayhighwayimprovements.pdf"> plans to improve Great Western Way from Bruce Street right through to Transfer Bridges (PDF)</a>. I&#8217;ve not made it along to the exhibitions about this. But a quick scan of the plans makes me thing that they&#8217;ll fix some things, and break others. I guess there&#8217;s no silver bullet for a complex and busy junction like this.</p>
