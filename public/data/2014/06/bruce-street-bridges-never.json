        "rendered": "<p><em>[Note: I just found this sat in my drafts. For some reason I bailed out of posting it when I wrote it back in November 2011. I don&#8217;t know why. To my knowledge, I&#8217;ve not cycled this roundabout since &#8211; and it&#8217;s still a bit scary to drive!]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Those who follow me on Twitter, or who have been reading for a while, may know I go by the alias &#8220;magicroundabout&#8221; sometimes. This is a name I acquired long ago, for good reason at the time, and it&#8217;s stuck.<\/p>\n<p>I chose the name, not after the children&#8217;s cartoon, but after the junction in my home town, and current place of residence: Swindon. If you&#8217;re not familiar with the junction perhaps a video demonstrates best:<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Magic Roundabout, Swindon\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/kiZtGSwv1no?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Now, the Magic Roundabout has a bad reputation. &#8220;Complicated&#8221;, \u00a0&#8220;scary&#8221;, &#8220;designed by traffic planners in the 70&#8217;s while on acid&#8221; are all things you&#8217;ll commonly hear. \u00a0But it&#8217;s actually really good and I&#8217;ve never felt unsafe in all my hundreds and thousands of crossings on it.<\/p>\n<p>No.<\/p>\n<p>The real danger is almost at the end of my road: Bruce Street Bridges. \u00a0Where I just suffered my second &#8220;assassination\u00a0attempt&#8221; (to coin a phrase from <a href=\"http:\/\/karlmccracken.sweat365.com\/\">Karl<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Take a look on <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.co.uk\/?ll=51.568504,-1.801468&amp;spn=0.002331,0.006539&amp;hnear=Swindon+SN2+2HG,+United+Kingdom&amp;t=h&amp;z=18&amp;vpsrc=6\">Google Maps<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve now TWICE had drivers charge at me whilst cycling this roundabout. \u00a0I think today&#8217;s was a low-sunlight-induced &#8220;Sorry Mate I Didn&#8217;t See You&#8221;, but my opinion would be that if the sun&#8217;s in your eyes you slow down and look twice. And then look again! Not speed up!<\/p>\n<p>The previous incident had no such excuse.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fine. But finding this junction increasingly dangerous, even in a car. \u00a0More and more people coast towards the give way lines, stopping is the second thing on their mind. \u00a0I confess, I&#8217;m probably guilty too.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there&#8217;s never any excuse for bad driving, but I think bad driving is encouraged by the design of the junction:<\/p>\n<p>1) It&#8217;s really busy but I don&#8217;t think it has an even-enough flow of traffic. \u00a0There are places where, at peak times, it&#8217;s impossible to join the flow of traffic because it&#8217;s all coming from one side.<\/p>\n<p>2) I think there&#8217;s too many lanes. Here&#8217;s an image of the approach to the location of my first assassination attempt (<a title=\"Bruce Street Bridges on Google Street View\" href=\"http:\/\/g.co\/maps\/5uz58\">explore for yourself<\/a>). There&#8217;s three lanes here on the approach from the left, and visibility approaching the roundabout from that direction is poor &#8211; people in the second and third lanes won&#8217;t be able to see much of what&#8217;s coming (but still want to coast in order to join the traffic flow).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/bruce-street.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1252\" title=\"bruce-street\" src=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/bruce-street-1024x585.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/bruce-street-1024x585.png 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/bruce-street-300x171.png 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/bruce-street-150x85.png 150w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/11\/bruce-street.png 1218w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>3) Because it&#8217;s a complicated junction there&#8217;s also lots of street furniture. That big sign on the left is important, but probably hinders visibility too.<\/p>\n<p>4) It&#8217;s non-standard. \u00a0Standard two-lane approach to a roundabout is: left lane for turning left or straight on; right lane for turning right or straight on (<a title=\"Highway Code Roundabout Rules\" href=\"http:\/\/www.direct.gov.uk\/en\/TravelAndTransport\/Highwaycode\/DG_070338\">Rule 186!<\/a>). But most of the roundabouts here have non-standard approaches. \u00a0Three lanes, or left-lane only for turning left. It causes lots of confusion and last-minute lane-changes.<\/p>\n<p>5) Cycle\/pedestrian infrastructure exists, but is incomplete. There are toucan and pedestrian paths and crossings, but they seem to only cover 3\/4 of the junction. And it certainly feels like pedestrians and cyclists are impeded and low priority. I guess they&#8217;ve made it as safe as they can given it&#8217;s awkward, under-the-railway location and the busy-ness of the place.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s definitely driving issues too though. These aren&#8217;t huge roundabouts, you should be able to safely cycle them. But actually, I feel unsafe in a CAR on this junction. \u00a0I often find myself in a situation where I&#8217;m on the roundabout and cars are coasting towards me not looking like they&#8217;re going to stop. I slow down. They slow down but still don&#8217;t look like they want to stop. I slow down more. \u00a0 I even got honked for doing this one day, like my own caution was causing an issue to the person whose place it was to give way.<\/p>\n<p>This morning, that stuff, combined with some hideous overtaking didn&#8217;t make my first bike ride in a week particularly pleasant.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve debriefed with Sally. I&#8217;m not cycling Bruce Street again. My life is too precious. I&#8217;ll stop and use the half-baked pedestrian\/shared infrastructure. \u00a0Cycling feels dangerous. But I know that risks to my health are greater if I DON&#8217;T cycle. Especially now I&#8217;m a work-from-home freelancer.<\/p>\n<p>There are<a title=\"Plans for Great Western Way Improvements\" href=\"http:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/cd\/cd-consultations\/cd-consultations-current\/Documents\/greatwesternwayhighwayimprovements.pdf\"> plans to improve Great Western Way from Bruce Street right through to Transfer Bridges (PDF)<\/a>. I&#8217;ve not made it along to the exhibitions about this. But a quick scan of the plans makes me thing that they&#8217;ll fix some things, and break others. I guess there&#8217;s no silver bullet for a complex and busy junction like this.<\/p>\n",
