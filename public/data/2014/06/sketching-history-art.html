And (yes, boring I know), I&#8217;m going to tell you why and to describe my thoughts as I go. Yes, yes, this is another or Ross&#8217;s grand blogging ideas that will fail spectacularly after about 3 posts, but I&#8217;ll try.  But before all of that: some history.</p>
<h2>Art School</h2>
<p>School was a funny time for me. I suppose I was pretty academic, and good at some stuff: maths and science in particular. But I was an introvert and didn&#8217;t really like the classroom as a place to learn.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have many strong memories of school actually, but there were some particularly bad English and music classes that stand out.</p>
<p>And art. I hated art. I remember crying over art homework.</p>
<p>But actually, I liked drawing. In later school years, in design and technology, we got to to technical drawing. Drawing boards, set squares, rulers, pens, and H pencils (not B pencils, they left too much of a mark). Orthographic projections, oblique projections, perspective, hatching, scales, and mm-perfect accuracy. I loved it!</p>
<p>And I remember my final GCSE art teacher. He embraced this and got me doing final projects with lots of detail, and using the tools I had bought for design and tech. He was brilliant, and helped me to a C grade and some drawing I was proud of.</p>
<p>But art wasn&#8217;t my thing.</p>
<h2>An aside: guitars</h2>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t musical at school either. Or at home.</p>
<p>We had a piano at home and my parents helped me have cornet lessons, but it didn&#8217;t last long.</p>
<p>At university I got into listening to music, but how it was made was a pretty mysterious thing.</p>
<p>Soon after graduation, I had this odd moment where I decided that, if I put my mind to it and worked hard, I could do anything. So I bought a guitar and a songbook.</p>
<p>My patient, patient housemate I was sharing with put up with my initial playing. And I&#8217;m now a pretty competent rhythm guitarist.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve not had another &#8220;I can do anything moment&#8221;&#8230;well&#8230;perhaps&#8230;not until recently.</p>
<h2>Sketching</h2>
<p>I do all this web development, but I&#8217;m not a designer. I&#8217;ve tried to do design, and I&#8217;m just not a designer. I know what looks good and what doesn&#8217;t, and I understand user interaction and colour theory and grid systems and typography, but I just can&#8217;t do visual design. So it&#8217;s maybe a bit odd that when I read an article called &#8220;<a title="Why I Sketch Every Day - Medium" href="https://medium.com/@tchurch/why-i-sketch-every-day-f5174a2b2c6e">Why I Sketch Every Day</a>&#8221; I was inspired to try to take up sketching.  But actually, quotes from that article like</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);">Learning to sketch in a meaningful way hasn’t come easily to me, but it’s been worth the effort many times over.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);">&#8220;Sketching has made visible my thought process and has opened it up to feedback instantaneously (at least from myself.) It has made me a much more effective communicator.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>should get a lot of us thinking about learning to sketch. I bought a copy of <a title="Drawing Ideas - Amazon.com" href="http://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Ideas-Hand-Drawn-Approach-Better/dp/0385344627">Drawing Ideas</a> which has also been inspiring in its introductory sections. I&#8217;m pretty excited, actually, about learning to draw!</p>

<h2>Throwing myself at it</h2>
<p>So I&#8217;ve thrown myself at this task. Yes, I don&#8217;t have too much time (though having an office is actually making me have more &#8220;free&#8221; time), but I&#8217;m really going to try to do drawing a couple of times a week at least. I&#8217;ve been kitting myself up with some nice stationary as inspiration (new toys!!!) and I&#8217;ll be trying to document my learning process and thoughts as I go.</p>
<p>Look out for Tweets, photos of kit and sketches, and more posts as we go.</p>
<p>Oh, and some of my sketching might have another purpose too.  Watch out for that!</p>
