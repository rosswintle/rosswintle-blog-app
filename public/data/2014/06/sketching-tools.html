<p>Fortunately, I recently had a birthday, and I&#8217;d carefully primed my lovely wife with some ideas for presents.</p>
<p>And so it was with great delight that I received a beautiful Moleskine sketchbook, some fine-point rollerball pens, and a pack of grey markers.  These to add to the small sets of fine-point and ultra-fine point Sharpie markers that I already had waiting to go.</p>

<p>Pens have always been a bit of an obsession of mine. I LOVE a good pen. And so exploring the world of technical and drawing pens again is great fun.  Rollerballs and markers work in such different ways, and there&#8217;s actually a huge variety of different types of nib: nylon, ballpoint, chunky marker, brush-type marker. All waiting for me to experiment with.</p>
<p>All I need now is some pencils!</p>
