<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Awesome communities</h1></header><main><p>It&#8217;s late. But I&#8217;m up and by brain is, for various reasons, unusually not caffeine-related, buzzing. Partly because I&#8217;m really thankful this evening.</p>
<p>Thankful because, both online and off, I&#8217;m part of some amazing communities of people who inspire and encourage one another.</p>
<p>Thankful because I&#8217;ve had support and encouragement of my own from friends, family, and people who weren&#8217;t friends but who now most definitely are.</p>
<p>Thankful that I&#8217;m able to pass on the things that I&#8217;ve learned to others so that they can be blessed as I have been.</p>
<p>Giving and receiving are part of any community and family. May we be generous in our giving and gracious in our receiving.</p>
<p>Grace.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s that word again.</p>
<p>It keeps coming up.</p>
<p>Grace.</p>
<p>Hmm&#8230;</p>
