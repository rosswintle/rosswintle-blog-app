We get set in our ways. We lose our childlike imagination!<\/p>\n<p>We should come at problems as both the young, enthusiastic, imaginative child, but also as the older, wiser expert. And we should work with others: designers, performance experts, etc<\/p>\n<p>We don\u2019t often have time on projects to try out lots of new things. But perhaps we can focus on a particular area for each project. Try something out, user-test it. Learn as we go.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBus Stops\u201d are the best times to do user testing.

Has 1.5million sites. Uses themes. The theme design team often don\u2019t know what purposes the themes will be put to. So they are \u2018designing for the unknown\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Twice as many websites are created every minute than babies are born!<\/p>\n<p>\u201cContent first\u201d is a trend but doesn\u2019t really reflect what Basekit does, or the reality of web development. TakeAway: you don\u2019t need the content before designing.<\/p>\n<p>But think about content when designing, . The design will need to fit the content rather than the other way around. E.g. Three column feature boxes: often designed to be the same length, when content is anything but.<\/p>\n<p>Flexbox can come to the rescue here! Flexbox also gives you a cheeky generic vertical centre\/middle alignment!<\/p>\n<h3>Images<\/h3>\n<p>70% of images on Basekit are landscape. 20% portrait. Only 10% square. But most galleries are designed for square and so crop images. The design doesn\u2019t work with the content!<\/p>\n<h3>Headers<\/h3>\n<p>These are really contentious and VERY unknown. E.g. Logo formats and layouts, number of nav items.<\/p>\n<p>Nav is HARD!<\/p>\n<h3>Logos<\/h3>\n<p>People upload HUGE logos images. Often including the company name.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to handle this \u201cunknown\u201d is to just centre-align everything.<\/p>\n<p>But need more control. Use \u201celement queries\u201d (this is a poly-fill, not built in)<\/p>\n<h3>Other<\/h3>\n<p>Lots of businesses running on Facebook.

Long term.<\/p>\n<p>Funded startups also don\u2019t tend to talk about money until they have to. Only when a sale or reinvestment is needed.<\/p>\n<p>Product choice:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Something for your community<\/li>\n<li>Something you can deliver quickly<\/li>\n<li>Something that solves a problem that people will be willing to pay to be solved<\/li>\n<li>Launch a product that has competition<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Something for the community<\/h3>\n<p>Look for problems close to home, that you understand and can test assumptions of.<\/p>\n<p>But be aware: Does the community want the product? Do they want you to come in and fix that problem for them?<\/p>\n<h3>Ship quickly<\/h3>\n<p>Perch v1.0 was about 4 weekends of work. Plus, another 4 weeks setting up documentation, website, sales, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Ship something that you will use yourself, so it it fails, you\u2019ve still benefitted.<\/p>\n<p>Ship small: come up with a minimum product, but one that is a usable product. Keep it specific and small.<\/p>\n<h3>Something that people will pay for<\/h3>\n<p>Easier to businesses than consumers.<\/p>\n<p>(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bootstrappedwithkids.com\/\">Bootstrapped with Kids<\/a> podcast)<\/p>\n<p>Do people care that their workflow sucks and you think it could be better?<\/p>\n<p>With Perch, agencies could solve the problem themselves, but Perch saves them time so they are willing to pay. Price appropriately: relate to time saved.<\/p>\n<p>Getting people to pay is good!<\/p>\n<p>Feedback from paid users is better. Free, community products take more time to build up a community base.<\/p>\n<h3>Launch a product that has competiton<\/h3>\n<p>Existing products allow you to research how you are different.<\/p>\n<p>Totally new things need user education about why they need it.<\/p>\n<h3>Finding the time<\/h3>\n<p>Focus on one thing: one completed thing is worth way more than lots of incomplete things.<\/p>\n<p>People find time for things that are important. Make your product important!<\/p>\n<p>Make use of dead time between projects or when waiting for feedback from clients.<\/p>\n<p>(Personal thought: Hack days?)<\/p>\n<p>Make the product a \u2018first class citizen\u2019. Make them as important as your other jobs.<\/p>\n<p>Set aside time. Plan in advance your tasks.<\/p>\n<p>Set goals! Tasks with deadlines.<\/p>\n<p>If not time, either re-plan, or re-scope: remove features to get MVP out of the door. Missing features will be more important to you than to your customers.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be apologetic about small feature set. Sell what you have!<\/p>\n<p>Start small. Get feedback from customers. Improve based on feedback.<\/p>\n<h3>Launch and beyond<\/h3>\n<p>Side projects need support. Launch isn\u2019t the end, it\u2019s the beginning!<\/p>\n<p>If it\u2019s not profitable then why? Are you using expensive services? Pricing too low?<\/p>\n<p>Growth of bootstraps is slow. How to manage it and keep it slow.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t promise dates for features.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t publish a roadmap. Allows you to adjust roadmap according to customer needs.<\/p>\n<p>Work to use cases, not feature requests. Make sure you tell people when new features are implemented. Make it personal. Delight your customers in this way.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, where appropriate and changes are trivial and non-breaking, release things quickly.<\/p>\n<p>But don\u2019t lose focus on your core use case. Don\u2019t just do anything and everything. Say \u2018no\u2019!<\/p>\n<p>Keep releases small. A major release could be done alongside a new website, payments, etc. avoid this!!<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be led by a noisy Minority of customers.<\/p>\n<h3>Marketing<\/h3>\n<p>Marketing is about stories, not solutions. Tell people about real use cases.<\/p>\n<p>Pre-launch sign-up: collect email address.<\/p>\n<p>Market to a community that might want the product. This will work for a while but then you will flatline. Need to expand.<\/p>\n<p>Content marketing: not just writing blog posts. Write and speak.<\/p>\n<p>Sponsorship: conferences, podcasts, sites that you like.<\/p>\n<p>Paid ads. Google, etc.<\/p>\n<p>If you can\u2019t track ads, don\u2019t pay for it.<\/p>\n<p>Target long-tail keywords. They\u2019re cheaper and better targeted.<\/p>\n<p>Buy sell ads. Research smaller sites that your ideal customer might visit. Advertise on them?<\/p>\n<p>Social media: if someone mentions Perch to ask about it, perch retweet it, customers then reply.<\/p>\n<p>Tractionbook.com<\/p>\n<p>Create your own definition of success.
