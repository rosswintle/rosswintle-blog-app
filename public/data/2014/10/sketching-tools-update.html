<p>I hadn&#8217;t realised, but I neglected to post an update to my original &#8220;<a title="Sketching: Tools" href="https://rosswintle.uk/2014/06/sketching-tools/">Sketching: Tools</a>&#8221; post. When I wrote that I had some nice pens, including, my favourite things: grey markers at various percentages of darkness.</p>
<p>That post ended with me saying that I needed some pencils and, well, you&#8217;ll be glad to hear, I now have some. I&#8217;ve had them for a while, of course.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve bought a nice tin of 6 pencils ranging from just HB to 4B. But I also bought a cheaper, but <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B003DQLFPW">more complete pack</a> of pencils and other funky things like charcoal sticks and this weird woodless-graphite pencil.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying them all out. I don&#8217;t think the posh/cheap pencils seem to vary in quality much, but I love the variation that you can get with charcoal and sketching sticks.</p>
<p>I also bought a cheaper sketchbook, thinking that I could save the nice Moleskin for when I&#8217;m a bit better.</p>
<p>So, I guess I&#8217;m all tooled up now. Let&#8217;s get drawing!</p>
