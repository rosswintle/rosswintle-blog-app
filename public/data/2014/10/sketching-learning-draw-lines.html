<p>A sketching update.  I have been doing some on and off. I need to get into more of a routine with it.</p>
<p>It sounds stupid, but I&#8217;ve been learning to draw straight lines, free-hand.  This is the first thing that my &#8220;Drawing Ideas&#8221; book explains; trying to nail the basic components of drawing so that later, when you come to draw more complex forms, you&#8217;re not thinking about it.  Even to the extent that you&#8217;ve build muscle memory for simple shapes.</p>
<p>But drawing straight lines, it turns out, isn&#8217;t as easy as it seems.</p>
<p>My book advocates good posture, a good desk with good light and a drawing action that engages the whole arm from the shoulder, not just the wrist and elbow.  It&#8217;s working quite nicely.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve also discovered a few things that the book doesn&#8217;t mention about drawing lines.</p>
<h2>Faster isn&#8217;t better</h2>
<p>I had this theory that focussing my eyes on where I wanted the line to go and then moving as fast as possible would lead to the straightest lines.  But, counter-intuitively, I get straighter lines when going slightly slower.  I discovered this when a rollerball pen I was using couldn’t keep up with fast lines, so I slowed it down a bit, and got better results.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a sweet spot and that going too slow also creates more wobble though.</p>

<h2>Flat means straight</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m mostly drawing in sketch <strong>books</strong>, which is proving not to be the best material.  This is because it&#8217;s easy to wobble your lines if the page/surface isn’t flat. In fact, an un-even surface seems to override any attempt I make to draw straight. Even fold-flat sketch books can have a slight slope towards the middle, and so drawing straight lines on ANY part of the page is proving to be pretty impossible. I suspect a hard surface with a single sheet of paper is better.</p>
<h2>Stop at the edge</h2>
<p>Another issue with sketch <strong>books</strong> is that they don&#8217;t let you go to the edge.  On right-hand pages (I&#8217;m right-handed) there&#8217;s a drop-off where you can&#8217;t rest your wrist. And on left-hand pages the binding and right-hand page get in the way.  This means that, especially with a small notebook, you can&#8217;t use as much of the page as you would like.</p>
<h2>Argh!</h2>
<p>Seriously.  I&#8217;m a competent, thirty-something professional person, and I&#8217;m having problems with drawing straight lines.</p>
<p>It turns out there are lots of nuances to this sketching lark!!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got to draw squares next. What can possibly go wrong?</p>
