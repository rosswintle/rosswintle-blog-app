<h4>What might Twitter&#8217;s new &#8220;Digits&#8221; login system mean for security, hackers, operators, and all of US?!</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/22/7034113/inside-twitters-ambitious-plan-to-kill-the-password-on-mobile-devices">Twitter’s “Digits” mobile phone login system</a> was announced to the world yesterday. Attempting to capture the interest of app developers, and to cater for people the world over &#8211; including those in developing countries that have phones but not necessarily email addresses, is interesting. Is it good idea?</p>
<p>My initial reaction was &#8220;well hold on, my phone now is the key to all my online stuff&#8221;. And, truth is, with 2-factor authentication (ask me in the comments if you don&#8217;t know what that is) our phones, and our phone numbers, are increasingly becoming the key to important systems that we use.</p>
<p>I was pondering the implications of this. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s way more complicated than I&#8217;ll make out here, but a few things seem obvious to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile phones will increasingly become targets for theft as they start to not only be of physical value, but contain increasingly valuable data.</li>
<li>Mobile phone <span style="text-decoration: underline;">numbers</span> and operator accounts will increasingly become targets for theft, social engineering, spoofing, etc. How secure is the PAC code process for transferring numbers? How secure are mobile operator&#8217;s online portals?  Will operators need to tighten up security on number ownership somehow?</li>
<li>Hackers (and hacks!) will start needing to get hold of phones and phone numbers to initiate attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, a simple, one-time, phone-locked login system seems like a good idea, and as I&#8217;ve read in several places, a huge improvement over the existing username-and-password systems that so many places use and which are so easy to exploit.</p>
<p>But I do wonder what the future holds if Digits takes off.</p>
