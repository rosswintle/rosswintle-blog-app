<p>I’ve been at the <a title="WebDevConf 2014" href="http://2014.webdevconf.com/">WebDevConf</a> in Bristol today. I confess that I didn’t <em>learn</em> a whole lot, but I have been pretty inspired. And it reinforced some ideas that have been bouncing around on my head for a while already.</p>
<p>Three main things stood out and, bizarrely, they’re all kinda related.</p>
<h2>Job descriptions</h2>
<p>Everyone’s talking about them in my work sector at the moment. What is a web developer? Does anyone know any more? Does anyone care? How much can developers and designers overlap and become ‘designgineers’ (or ‘devigners’ &#8211; that one cracks me up!). Can you truly be full-stack? This is worthy of a short post of its own.</p>
<h2>Do what you’re good at!</h2>
<p>I’ve been learning recently to focus on my strengths. Working hard doing something you’re not good at badly and slowly is frustrating. Drop it. Do the thing you’re good at. But…</p>
<h2>do_action()!</h2>
<p>(That’s a WordPress joke by the way)</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to try new things! Maybe to find out exactly what you’re good at. Maybe to focus your work. I have umpteen ideas for side projects. I’m starting to throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks because if I don’t I’ll never do any of them. We shouldn’t be afraid to just try. Especially on the Internet where you can fail really fast and move on to the next thing.</p>
<p>That’s me. I won’t promise to actually follow up with further posts on those things. But I might. We’ll see.</p>
<p>Any of these things resonating with you right now?</p>
