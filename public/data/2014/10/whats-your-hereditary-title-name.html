<ul>
<li>Take your first pets name and then your mother&#8217;s maiden name.</li>
<li>Follow it with &#8220;the&#8221; and the date you were born on, and then &#8220;st&#8221;, &#8220;nd&#8221; or &#8220;th&#8221; appropriately</li>
<li>And then add &#8220;of&#8221; and the town you were born in.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, something like: &#8220;Fluffy Parkinson the 18th of Hereford&#8221;</p>
<p>Hilarious, see!</p>
<p>Now&#8230;</p>
<p>Get all your friends to put that on Facebook, and then&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;see how many of their bank accounts you can log in to!</p>
