<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Lenten Acts</h1></header><main><p>As a Christian involved in digital media,&nbsp; I&#8217;m bombarded with opportunities to give up or take up things around the beginning of the season of lent. Indeed,&nbsp; this year I&#8217;m helping create a website that is offering one such opportunity. I can&#8217;t really escape it, and the choice of activities and tools is brilliant. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been crazy busy preparing this new website and haven&#8217;t really had to choose something to do for lent. But at some point I seem to have signed up to do Stewardship&#8217;s 40 acts, and the first of those is to create a journal. </p>
<p>I figure that this blog serves that purpose, and blogging more often is also a habit I want to develop, so here we are.<br />
I&#8217;m not sure if it will continue this way in public. Proclaiming our acts from the modern-day street corner may defeat the point of lenten disciplines. But we shall see. I don&#8217;t know what the activities will be yet. </p>
<p>Today I&#8217;m to write a list of things that I&#8217;m thankful for. Being thankful is also something I try to have as a discipline, helped along&nbsp; by the Twitter hashtag #thankyoutoday.&nbsp; But most days I find myself wanting to be thankful for either God&#8217;s provision or for my family.</p>
<p>And today is no exception.</p>
