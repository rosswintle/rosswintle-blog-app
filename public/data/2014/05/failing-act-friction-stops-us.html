<p>That kinda never happened and I got stuck at act 2.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to have a massive guilt trip about this, but it is quite a disappointment. But it&#8217;s also got me thinking about a word/concept which keeps coming up, both in work and personal situations: &#8220;Friction&#8221;.</p>
<p>Friction is something that I&#8217;ve come across both in website user interfaces (Facebook talk about &#8220;frictionless sharing&#8221;, for example), but also in psychology. I saw an interesting article (I don&#8217;t think it was <a title="How Incredibly Lazy People Can Form Productive Habits - Fast Company" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3021820/work-smart/how-incredibly-lazy-people-can-form-productive-habits">this one</a>, but it&#8217;ll do) about this recently. I use an app called &#8220;Lift&#8221; (available for <a title="Lift - Daily motivation - for iOS" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lift-daily-motivation/id530911645?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a title="Lift - Daily motivation - for Android" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.liftworldwide.lift">Android</a>) to try and build positive, daily habits into my routine, and I&#8217;m astounded by how rubbish I am at doing positive, simple tasks on a daily basis. And I&#8217;m convinced that &#8220;friction&#8221; is the problem.</p>
<p>In A&#8217; Level physics I learned that the <a title="Friction - WikiPedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction#Static_friction">coefficient of static friction</a> (the force required to get a stationary object moving) is often greater than the coefficient of dynamic friction (the force required to accelerate an already-moving object). Once moving, and object is easier to get moving more!</p>
<p>I think that the same is true with people and habits.</p>
<p>Here are some of the causes of friction that stopped me doing 40 Acts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work &#8211; and being busy and dedicated to my work</li>
<li>Family &#8211; having a feisty and demanding toddler who I love to bits</li>
<li>Travel &#8211; daily habits are hard to keep when you travel or go on holiday and your routines get messed up &#8211; we had a long weekend away just after starting Lent which got me off to a bad start</li>
<li>Weather &#8211; sounds odd, but I think the weather, and the changing seasons, change my behaviour a lot</li>
<li>Distraction &#8211; the dreaded mobile phone and all the many forms of communication that constantly seek our attention in a highly digitally-literate household</li>
</ul>
<p>I still have the 40 Acts emails stored up. I may, possibly, still try to work through them and write about them.  But to do so means removing, or overcoming those friction points.</p>
<p>We shall see.</p>
