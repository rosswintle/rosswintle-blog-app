        "rendered": "<p>My last blog post was all about how I was going to attempt 40 Acts over lent and write about it as I went.<\/p>\n<p>That kinda never happened and I got stuck at act 2.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to have a massive guilt trip about this, but it is quite a disappointment. But it&#8217;s also got me thinking about a word\/concept which keeps coming up, both in work and personal situations: &#8220;Friction&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Friction is something that I&#8217;ve come across both in website user interfaces (Facebook talk about &#8220;frictionless sharing&#8221;, for example), but also in psychology. I saw an interesting article (I don&#8217;t think it was <a title=\"How Incredibly Lazy People Can Form Productive Habits - Fast Company\" href=\"http:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3021820\/work-smart\/how-incredibly-lazy-people-can-form-productive-habits\">this one<\/a>, but it&#8217;ll do) about this recently. I use an app called &#8220;Lift&#8221; (available for <a title=\"Lift - Daily motivation - for iOS\" href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/gb\/app\/lift-daily-motivation\/id530911645?mt=8\">iOS<\/a>, <a title=\"Lift - Daily motivation - for Android\" href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.liftworldwide.lift\">Android<\/a>) to try and build positive, daily habits into my routine, and I&#8217;m astounded by how rubbish I am at doing positive, simple tasks on a daily basis. And I&#8217;m convinced that &#8220;friction&#8221; is the problem.<\/p>\n<p>In A&#8217; Level physics I learned that the <a title=\"Friction - WikiPedia\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Friction#Static_friction\">coefficient of static friction<\/a>\u00a0(the force required to get a stationary object moving) is often greater than the coefficient of dynamic friction (the force required to accelerate an already-moving object). Once moving, and object is easier to get moving more!<\/p>\n<p>I think that the same is true with people and habits.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the causes of friction that stopped me doing 40 Acts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work &#8211; and being busy and dedicated to my work<\/li>\n<li>Family &#8211; having a feisty and demanding toddler who I love to bits<\/li>\n<li>Travel &#8211; daily habits are hard to keep when you travel or go on holiday and your routines get messed up &#8211; we had a long weekend away just after starting Lent which got me off to a bad start<\/li>\n<li>Weather &#8211; sounds odd, but I think the weather, and the changing seasons, change my behaviour a lot<\/li>\n<li>Distraction &#8211; the dreaded mobile phone and all the many forms of communication that constantly seek our attention in a highly digitally-literate household<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I still have the 40 Acts emails stored up. I may, possibly, still try to work through them and write about them. \u00a0But to do so means removing, or overcoming those friction points.<\/p>\n<p>We shall see.<\/p>\n",
