<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Not so rapid application development</h1></header><main><p>I recently re-launched <a href="http://hasyourbabyarrivedyet.com">hasyourbabyarrivedyet.com</a>, my super, super simple birth announcement service. I&#8217;ve rewritten it in <a href="http://laravel.com">Laravel</a>: a PHP-based rapid application development framework. And one thing I learned is that launching even a super, super simple web application in public is a far from rapid process.</p>
<p>Hasyourbabyarrivedyet.com is basically a big red button that changes the word &#8220;NO&#8221; to the word &#8220;YES&#8221;. Other than that function the app needs user registration, and log in and log out functionality. And yes, that&#8217;s pretty much it.</p>
<p>Except, if you&#8217;re making a thing like this public, search-engine indexable, social-media optimised, responsive/mobile friendly, secure and spam free. If you want it to handle outgoing email well, include analytics and be user friendly. And probably a host of things that I&#8217;ve not considered.</p>
<p>At one point, the app was, to all intents and purposes, functionally complete. Â But my todo list for it looked something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add analytics</li>
<li>Write privacy/cookie policy for cookies and basic terms and conditions</li>
<li>Add welcome notice after login</li>
<li>Add ReCapthca to prevent spam</li>
<li>Configure transactional email (MailGun)</li>
<li>Send email to admin on signup</li>
<li>Explain form fields</li>
<li>Add OpenGraph and other meta data and sort titles</li>
<li>Test in Facebook debugger</li>
<li>Add favicons</li>
<li>Add about page</li>
<li>Configure email forwarding</li>
<li>Add sitemap</li>
<li>Make sure webmaster tools works</li>
<li>Add to uptime and domain monitoring</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>I knew all of these things had to be done, and it didn&#8217;t take me long to rattle through the list, but the process reminded me that rapidly developing an application is one thing. But there&#8217;s so much ancillary stuff that you need to do to make something public on the internet.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be fooled. Tools help developers achieve great things in short spaces of time. But a good launch requires thought, planning and knowledge of quite a few things that go beyond the realms of just coding something.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure I forgot some things too. If I did please let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>And feel free to share the site with any friends you have that are expecting. Being constantly asked &#8220;has your baby arrived yet&#8221; is a bit of a bore. ?</p>
