I didn&#8217;t really want to publish it until I had the full quote, which I managed to acquire this week. I think it&#8217;s still relevant.</p>
<p>All sorts of things are &#8216;speaking&#8217; to me at the moment about life.</p>
<p>Last night we did a bit of TV catchup and saw the jungle episode of the BBC&#8217;s brilliant &#8216;Human Planet&#8217;. And while the programme as a whole was extraordinary what got me was the little &#8216;the making of&#8217; documentary at the end.</p>
<p>For those that missed it they&#8217;d done a section on a tribe of people who, with primitive tools, had built a tree house&#8230;in a 35m-high tree!! The tribesmen climbed to the treetops using not more than sticks and vines and strength and stamina. Yet, in the making-of we see the BBC crew all safety-harnessed up with lines and backup lines, helmets, etc.</p>
<p>At the end they interviewed one of the crew. What had he learned from his visit?</p>
<p>&#8220;I find I judge my own inadequacies against their expertise and knowledge. You know, you come here and you&#8217;ve got boots on in case of snake bites, you&#8217;ve got sun cream on because of the sun. You know, you&#8217;ve got twin safety ropes to make sure if one fails you&#8217;re caught on the other one. And these guys? OK, maybe they have a higher mortality rate, but they&#8217;re much freer in their lifestyle. You know, they&#8217;ll shimmy up and down these trees. I think I&#8217;d much rather lead a fuller, shorter life like they do out here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The impact of a simpler, freer life is clear. How much do we miss out on experiences because of caution, rules, expectations.</p>
<p>Perhaps, sometimes, the risk of &#8216;going ropeless&#8217; is worth it.</p>
