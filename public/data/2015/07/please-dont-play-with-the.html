Raising a child sometimes requires a bit of re-programming of your brain. Inquisitive pre-schoolers cause you to re-evaluate so many of your rules and routines. Things that you&#8217;ve known or done for years, that are programmed into muscle memory or &#8230; whatever the mental equivalent of muscle memory is &#8230; are suddenly questioned at every turn. Things that were sure are dismantled and torn apart. Things that were good and true are suddenly uncertain and relative.</p>
<p>This is happening a lot at the moment, and I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s me or the young explorer we&#8217;ve raised.</p>
<p>Raising a child <strong>could</strong> be really simple. I could just say &#8220;Don&#8217;t do that&#8221; and be done with it.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m trying to be sensitive and allow my child to explore the world and find out some things for himself, while also not imposing upon him the baggage that I&#8217;ve acquired through many years of adult-hood.</p>
<p>And all while making sure that there are some boundaries, that he&#8217;s safe, and that adults are respected.</p>
<p>And sometimes, just sometimes, I want to enter into that child-like inquisitiveness with him, abandon my own rules and see things with open eyes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s exhausting!</p>
<p>And so it is that a simple activity, like trying to plug a hose into a water butt, turns into a mind-bending philosophical monologue where you often end up questioning everything you&#8217;ve ever learned and wondering if you child will one day get horrifically injured in some stupid accident involving a wooden spoon, a bowl of dry rice and a tea towel or something.</p>
<p>Before I write this down, it&#8217;s worth noting that:</p>
<ul>
<li>this is but one minor example of stuff that happens all day long at the moment;</li>
<li>it&#8217;s probably related to something called &#8220;high sensitivity&#8221; which I&#8217;m in the process of writing a blog post about; and</li>
<li>yes, Isaac has seen me plugging a hose into a water butt in the past, so he is only copying something that I do sometimes when watering the garden.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it goes something like this:</p>
<p>Me: &#8220;Please don&#8217;t play with the hose&#8221;</p>
<p>My Brain: &#8220;Why can&#8217;t he play with the hose&#8221;</p>
<p>Me (to my brain): &#8220;Err, well, I don&#8217;t want him to because it doesn&#8217;t really work as a watering-the-garden method, and the water butt isn&#8217;t very full and I don&#8217;t want to waste the water, and he&#8217;ll get wet which will mean I need to change his clothes before tea and he can&#8217;t just play with anything because some things aren&#8217;t toys and he needs to learn that some things are for doing jobs and some things are for playing with and&#8230;look there isn&#8217;t really any one good stand-out reason that I can explain succinctly in a small enough number of words that he won&#8217;t get bored and distracted half way through the sentence, I&#8217;d just rather he didn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>My Brain: &#8220;But he&#8217;s just exploring and experimenting, he&#8217;s not doing anyone or himself and harm, and what&#8217;s a little bit of water between friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>Isaac (pipes up): &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>Me (gently, to Isaac, not my brain): &#8220;What do you want to play with the hose for?&#8221;</p>
<p>My brain: &#8220;Because it&#8217;s interesting and he&#8217;s seen you doing it and he wants to be like you, which is kinda cute, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Isaac: &#8220;I want to fill it up&#8221;</p>
<p>Me: &#8220;Why do you want to fill it up?&#8221;</p>
<p>Isaac: &#8220;So I can squirt it&#8221;</p>
<p>My brain: &#8220;You have to admit, he&#8217;s got some ambition and his problem-solving logic is good?&#8221;</p>
<p>Me (to both): &#8220;Look&#8230;I&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Me (to myself): &#8220;OK&#8230;OK&#8230;what&#8217;s the worst that can happen? He&#8217;ll get a little wet? He&#8217;ll learn that plugging the hose into the water butt doesn&#8217;t really do anything and certainly won&#8217;t &#8216;squirt&#8217;. But more importantly, he&#8217;ll think he can do anything he likes with things in the garden which is really dangerous. Neither my brain nor Isaac is gonna respond well to a straight don&#8217;t-do-it so I need to get creative. Man&#8230;I&#8217;m so tired right now and I&#8217;ve had 74 internal monologues like this today, I don&#8217;t think I can take any more. OK&#8230;here&#8217;s the plan. Distraction. Err. OK.  Go&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Me (to Isaac): &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you play in the sand pit?&#8221;</p>
<p>Isaac: &#8220;But I want to squirt the hose!&#8221;</p>
<p>Me: &#8220;You can have fun in the sand pit. You love the sand pit. Look, here&#8217;s your digger.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Isaac puts the hose down and takes his shorts <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and pants</span> off)</p>
<p>Me (to myself): &#8220;Oh crikey, he&#8217;ll get sand up his bum and in his willy&#8221;</p>
<p>Me: &#8220;Isaac, please put your pants back on&#8221;</p>
<p>Isaac: &#8220;But&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>My brain: &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Me: &#8220;Don&#8217;t&#8230;just DON&#8217;T!!&#8221;</p>
<p>My brain: &#8220;Make it 75&#8221;</p>
