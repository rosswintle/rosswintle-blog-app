<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Some days of normal</h1></header><main><p>Hah. Brilliant. So a good friend of mine posts on Facebook that she is partaking in #21daysofnormal: an attempt to open up the reality of daily life and not hide behind the perfect, filtered life that we probably all post to social media most days.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;glamorous, Instagrammed photos of the little special bits of our lives, which can inadvertently make us feel inadequate or that the rest of our lives don&#8217;t match up&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This sounds like a great idea to me. Imposter syndrome is a thing, and I love Steven Furtick&#8217;s quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The reason we struggle with insecurity is because we compare our behind-the-scenes with everyone elseâ€™s highlight reel&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>(Aside: I learned that quote in Gavin Strange&#8217;s talk/thing at WebDevConf from which another key takeaway was: &#8220;Being crap is OK!&#8221;)</p>
<p>So, while I probably won&#8217;t make 21 days of it, I&#8217;ll try to do a few.</p>
<p>Here is Wintle Towers at 19:06 today. The culmination of a &#8220;pre-school day&#8221; and pre-tidy-up. This is &#8220;peak mess&#8221; today. Nothing has been tidied since the inevitable rush-to-get-out-of-the-house at what would have been 8:30 had it not been for &#8220;I need a poo&#8221; at 8:25.</p>
<p>I should add that said poo was a need of the three year old, not the thirty something year old.</p>
<p>Welcome to normal!</p>
