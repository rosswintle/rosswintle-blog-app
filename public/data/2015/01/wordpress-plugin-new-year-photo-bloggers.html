And I&#8217;m sure that for some of you one of your goals is to take and post a decent photo every day. Perhaps some of you even got new cameras for Christmas?</p>
<h2>Photo of the Day</h2>
<p>Well, if you&#8217;ve set a &#8220;Photo of the day&#8221; resolution, are into self-publishing and have a self-hosted WordPress blog (or can set one up) then I have a little tool that may be really useful. It&#8217;s a plugin I developed called <a title="WP Quick Image plugin on WordPress repository" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-quick-image/">WP Quick Image</a>.</p>
<h2>WP Quick Image</h2>
<p>Rather than explain in words, here&#8217;s a video showing how it works:</p>

<p>And as an added extra, you can use this with Yoast WordPress SEO plugin (or another plugin that creates Facebook Open Graph tags) to share your images to Facebook without needing to upload them to Facebook. Here&#8217;s a (slightly technical) how to:</p>
