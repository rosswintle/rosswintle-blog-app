<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">2015 Goals: Press Ups!</h1></header><main><p>So Christmas and New Year were pretty full-on. Not work-wise, but with lots of family and friends, which has been lovely. But 2015 is upon us! So what&#8217;s new?</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;ve not had time to do any kind of year-in-review type things. But I have thought about some goals for 2015 and I&#8217;ll write about these in the coming days (though, as you&#8217;ll have worked out, I&#8217;m already behind).</p>
<p>The first thing though, I do want to start today, and I&#8217;ve given it the really, really cheesy name &#8220;Press Ups&#8221;, for which I can only apologise. Â Let me explain.</p>
<p>For a while, a few years back, I tried to do a set of WordPress tutorial screencasts. I did four, I think, and never kept them up to date.</p>
<p>But producing short screencasts is much easier with the tools I have at my disposal now, and I do want to build up a library of screencasts again.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve challenged myself to spend, say, 10 minutes each (working!) day doing a really short WordPress screencast showing how to use WordPress, one of its plugins, or perform basic website management tasks.</p>
<p>Why the name &#8220;Press Ups&#8221;? Well, it&#8217;s my/your daily WordPress exercise! Geddit?</p>
<p>I honestly don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll keep it up. I can&#8217;t believe the videos will be very professional. I almost certainly won&#8217;t make it every day, but it seems like a useful thing for me to do, and to share with both my clients and the WordPress community.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not done any branding, but I have managed to set up un-branded social media presences for Press Ups. And if nothing else I have a very cheesy domain name!</p>
<p>Look it up my intro from today on the <a title="Press Ups" href="http://press-ups.com/">Press Ups website</a>, and feel free to <a title="Suggest a Topic - Press Ups" href="http://press-ups.com/suggest/">suggest a tutorial</a> (though I already have a good list of topics to get through).</p>
