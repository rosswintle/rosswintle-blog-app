<p>We did a trip to the Lakes with our good friends the Berry&#8217;s this month.  Both couples enjoy a good walk so we wanted to introduce them to the delights of fell walking in Lakeland.  They live up North now so it was a good way to meet up.</p>
<h3><!--more-->Loughrigg Fell</h3>
<p>We arrived at the friendly and comfortable <a title="Hillsdale B&amp;B - Ambleside" href="http://www.hillsdaleambleside.co.uk/" target="_blank">Hillsdale B&amp;B</a> in Ambleside on Thursday and went straight to work heading up Loughrigg Fell.  Not a particularly spectacular walk, but it was dry and there were some good views.  I was in charge of navigating but I don&#8217;t really like undulating felltops &#8211; it&#8217;s really hard to work out what the features on the map represent.  Another Wainwright ticked off though and a good introduction for the weekend.</p>
<h3>Place Fell</h3>
<p>The next day we drove the Kirkstone Pass to Ullswater, parked up between Glenridding and Patterdale and headed up Place Fell.  This was more like it &#8211; almost twice as high as Loughrigg and commanding stunning views over towards High Street and back towards the Helvellyn Range to the West.</p>

<p>We descended the north-eastern way, circumventing High Dodd (not my choice!) and managing to find a path down from Sleet Fell to Sandwick village.</p>
<p><a href="https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/howtown-hotel-scone-april-2009.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-711" title="Howtown Hotel Scone April 2009" src="https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/howtown-hotel-scone-april-2009-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/howtown-hotel-scone-april-2009-225x300.jpg 225w, https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/howtown-hotel-scone-april-2009-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/howtown-hotel-scone-april-2009.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a>We then took the lakeside path around Hallin Fell to How Town where the How Town hotel awaited.  A very bizarre, upper-class place, with old people who looked like permanent residents, drinking afternoon tea in the plush lounge, while we muddy, sweaty walkers were sent round the back to a small hatch serving drinks.  Excellent drinks.  And excellent scones.  All quite reasonably priced and served to us by a waiter on the front lawn in a very posh-looking tea set.  All quite silly really, but in a very English way.</p>
<p>After an encounter with a man who was very passionate about the fact that Harvey Maps were far better than the Ordnance Survey ones, we headed to the ferry and sailed back to Glenridding.</p>

<p>Probably one of my most favourite walks ever.  Fun, great views, variety of terrain, and with tea and a boat trip too.  Marvellous!</p>
<h3>Grasmere Geocaching</h3>
<p><a href="https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/geocaching-april-2009.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-713" title="Geocaching - April 2009" src="https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/geocaching-april-2009-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/geocaching-april-2009-300x225.jpg 300w, https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/geocaching-april-2009-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/geocaching-april-2009.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>On the Saturday we had a day &#8220;off&#8221; and ambled around Grasmere. Having had a taste of this Geocaching lark, we had some more potential finds ready to go and The Berry&#8217;s kindly took us on a little treasure hunt.</p>
<p>We did a &#8220;multi-cache&#8221; in Grasmere itself, headed out to White Moss Common, and back via lunch on the beach at the Southern edge of Grasmere lake.  WE nearly got caught in a thunder storm towards the end but made it back to the cars with plenty of time to grab some fish and chips.</p>
<p>We really enjoyed this and it inspired us to get a GPS receiver and do some caching of our own.</p>
<h3>That&#8217;s It!</h3>
<p>More Geocaching was done on the Sunday before we left but, for reasons I don&#8217;t remember, I didn&#8217;t take part (it involved a tiny cache find in the busy centre of Ambleside!).  We finished with a quick trip to Aira Force Waterfall and lunch on the edge of Ullswater again.</p>

<p>It had been a great weekend inspiring our good friends and being inspired too.  Let&#8217;s do it again sometime!</p>
