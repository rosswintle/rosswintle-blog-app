<p>In amongst all the technical learning I&#8217;ve been doing there&#8217;s been plenty of other stuff going on that I&#8217;ve not had time to write about.</p>
<h2>Christmas</h2>
<p>We hosted Christmas for the first time this year.  It was quite a success too!</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;d planned the meal well, keeping it simple but tasty.  Hint: smoked salmon on garlic-rubbed bruschetta with a dollop of pesto&#8230;YUM!</li>
<li>Our fears of not finding a Turkey were not met (but we were surprised at how expensive they were).</li>
<li>We learned how not to make stuffing.  We&#8217;ve yet to learn the correct way!</li>
<li>Starting cooking was much easier than finishing it all off.</li>
<li>We learned not to plan to host a big meal with lots of leftovers and then go away for a week!</li>
<li>Washing up is more of a job than the preparation and cooking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, a good experience of cooking a fancy meal for five and we&#8217;d do it again!</p>
<h2>The Cough</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been fighting off my FOURTH attack from the really nasty cold that&#8217;s been going around this year.  I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the same one and I&#8217;ve not been able to fight it off.  The last few months has been really bad for illnesses for everyone.  Even the toughest people I know have had some sort of illness and time off work, and most have been got several times.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re now also in the grip of a really cold snap which can&#8217;t be helping.</p>
<p>Anyway, I had a couple of days of feeling really cold-infected whilst we were down in Devon over Christmas and New Year, and that quickly went away, but I&#8217;m still dealing with the aftermath &#8211; an annoying tickly dry cough.  It&#8217;s almost gone now but has been quite an irritant in the last week and a half.</p>
<h2>Back and Cycling</h2>
<p>Unfortunately all the sitting down I&#8217;ve done as a result of lazing around in comfy chairs and extra-soft mattresses in Devon over Christmas has given me a bad back again (seems to be a normal way for me to start the year).</p>
<p>This along with extra-cold, icy, and dangerous weather, and the need to shuttle various things to work and back, has meant that I&#8217;ve not been cycling much.</p>
<p>This is a bit disappointing for me, as I really wanted to try and keep my fitness up over the winter for a good start in the spring, and I was getting all kitted out to do that!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also annoying because once you&#8217;ve had a bit of time out it&#8217;s even harder to get up the motivation to get going again.</p>
<p>I did manage to cycle-commute once this week, on Thursday.  But to my dismay I found that the council don&#8217;t seem to do much (any) gritting of cycle paths, and there were some fairly treacherous bits of cycling to be done.  So I really need to wait for a thaw.</p>
<p>Today it&#8217;s been sub-zero all day.  Let&#8217;s hope that the forecast for a warmer Saturday is correct!</p>
<p>In any case, I still have a good 2 months of winter left so I need to be disciplined and get some daylight riding in, alongside some trips to the gym, to get fitness up!</p>
<p>Roll on 2009 then!!!</p>
