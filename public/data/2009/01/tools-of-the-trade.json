        "rendered": "<p>Learning all this new software development stuff is all well and good, but at some point you actually have to develop something.\u00a0 And developing a computer program of any size, like any engineering trade, requires some tools and some planning.<\/p>\n<p>One of my main applications of what I&#8217;m learning is to a database that I maintain at work.\u00a0 This is currently running on a Windows server with MS SQL as the database and MS IIS (Internet Information Service?) as the web server.<\/p>\n<p>This is all well and good, but it&#8217;s not an environment I can easily and cheaply re-create for testing and development purposes, and some of my code is not portable between databases.\u00a0 (I&#8217;ve made a good attempt at adding a database abstraction layer, but it&#8217;s not QUITE there).<\/p>\n<p>So, the natural thing to do is to migrate to Unix, Apache and MySQL, which I can freely and easily deploy pretty much anywhere.\u00a0 And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been up to this week.<\/p>\n<h2>I LIKE Windows?<\/h2>\n<p>I do link Unix.\u00a0 It&#8217;s a much better server OS than Windows, in my opinon.\u00a0 But I&#8217;m also a user &#8211; even as a developer &#8211; and Windows IS much more user friendly.<\/p>\n<p>For example, I&#8217;ve been using NotePad++ as my text editor, which has syntax-highlighting, auto-indentation, auto-completion of words, good handling of multiple files, and a whole host of other lovely things.<\/p>\n<p>Moving to Unix means moving to Vi or EMACS.\u00a0 Tools which are great but not simple to learn (do I HAVE to learn to use another tool to do this?!).<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I like vi, in a massochistic sort of way, but not for writing a complex software project!<\/p>\n<h2>Keeping Track<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m also vaguely aware that this sort of project would be good to have under version control (which I won&#8217;t explain here &#8211; ask if you want to know).<\/p>\n<p>I used to use CVS in my old job and it was a great help.\u00a0 If I&#8217;m setting up a development system, making significant code changes, and migrating to a new platform, then a version control system would be a great help.<\/p>\n<h2>Considering My Options<\/h2>\n<p>So I need some of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a nice Unix text editor for my command line\/terminal<\/li>\n<li>a GUI for my Unix system (with a nice GUI text editor)<\/li>\n<li>a version control system<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Asking around, the text editor of choice with Unix boffins is&#8230;vi!\u00a0 But I&#8217;m not happy with that.\u00a0 vim has been suggested as it has syntax-highlighting, split screens, and stuff like that.\u00a0 Maybe it&#8217;s a nice half-way house.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been playing with getting the X Windowing System to work.\u00a0 There&#8217;s a free, open source X server called &#8220;X Ming&#8221; which does the job and works prett seamlessly over ssh tunnels, but I&#8217;ve found setting up the client side (which is actually on the server!) a bit difficult.\u00a0 Too complicated.\u00a0 And I&#8217;d probably only end up using xvim, which would probably only be a three-quarters-way house.<\/p>\n<h2>Sublime Subversion<\/h2>\n<p>Version control has been a boon though!\u00a0 I quickly read the important bits of <a title=\"the subversion book\" href=\"http:\/\/svnbook.red-bean.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">the Subversion book<\/a> and\u00a0 realised what I&#8217;d been missing.\u00a0 My vague rememberance of CVS should have spurred me on sooner &#8211; this is REALLY important stuff!<\/p>\n<p>In minutes (well, OK, hours, but not many) I had a SVN server accessible locally and over SVN and SSH protocols, with my production code on it and with all my development areas, in both Windows and Unix land, using checked-out, version-controlled copies.\u00a0 Woo hoo!!\u00a0 I was genuinely excitied &#8211; in a geeky sort of way.<\/p>\n<h2>Where now?<\/h2>\n<p>Well, I&#8217;m mostly happy with the set up.\u00a0 I&#8217;ll probably miss my Windows editors for a while, but I&#8217;m generally content.<\/p>\n<p>I have a Linux production server, running open-source tools, which I&#8217;ve nearly migrated to.\u00a0 I have easy and safe access to the code from multiple locations.\u00a0 I have a reasonably good text editor, with scope for GUI access in the future.\u00a0 I can bring my code home to develop.\u00a0 And I can easily and cheaply set up a test or development environment if I need to.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a whole world better than the old Microsoft one!\u00a0 And I&#8217;ve learned some good stuff along the way.<\/p>\n<p>Now&#8230;the tools are in place&#8230;time to apply my new HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, W3C DOM, Apache and MySQL skills to the task!<\/p>\n<p>Amazingly, I&#8217;m not feeling very confused by this.\u00a0 Are you?<\/p>\n<p>[polldaddy poll=1264157]<\/p>\n",
