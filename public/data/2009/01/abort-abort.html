Abort!!!</h1></header><main><p>Just had a new experience on the bike&#8230;.cramp!Â  I&#8217;ve been meaning to get out on a lunchtime ride, but the week has been manicly busy, so, with Sally out tonight, I decided to try my well-lit, urban 14-miler again.</p>
<p>I knew it was colder than I was expecting by just at the back door of the office, you could feel the chill.  That was confirmed on stepping outside. Brrrr.  I was mostly prepared for this, but I only had my three-season, three-quarter-length longs on.</p>
<p>About 5 miles in though, and I could feel little twinges in my legs.  Not something I&#8217;ve had before.  Icy little darts of&#8230;not pain&#8230;but tension.  I abandoned the 14-miler and started heading for home.</p>
<p>It was a traffic-light stop that killed me.  I had to wait about a minute or so for it to change and as soon as I&#8217;d clipped back in&#8230;TWANG!!! It went.  My left calf seized up.</p>
<p>I just about made it home without anything else going, but even after some good stretching I&#8217;m not right.</p>
<p>A word of winter warning.  Wrap up well when it&#8217;s freezing, or take the short route home.</p>
<p>Ow.</p>
