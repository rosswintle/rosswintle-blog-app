<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Another Run!</h1></header><main><p>So, not to be beaten after a single run, and slightly concerned about the very slight pain in my knee, I headed to the gym last week for my second run.  Yes, sadly, on a treadmill!</p>
<p>Now, some runners at work have mocked this slightly, calling it things like &#8220;Just bobbing up and down and not really going anywhere&#8221;, and I confess, that&#8217;s exactly what it is.  It&#8217;s not really like running.  But that&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s completely dissimilar too, and with my possibly painful knee I didn&#8217;t want to run 2 miles and have to abort and walk home, so it seemed like the thing to do.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m pleased to say it was a success!  I did get a bit of knee pain, in the left knee, but it wasn&#8217;t too bad and I ran through it and clocked up 5km.  I felt pretty OK afterwards too.</p>
<p>The treadmill was funny.  I mentioned about liking a long stride in my first run, and it was really hard to get that in the gym.  It also seemed to take FOREVER to run 5km.  I can see why people much prefer running outdoors.</p>
<p>But at the same time it was good.  I did the 5km.  I didn&#8217;t get as hot and sweaty as I thought I would.  And I got to watch the highlights of Obama&#8217;s inauguration on the news while I did it.</p>
<p>I now have an odd pain just behind my right knee.  It&#8217;s fading a bit but persisting.  It&#8217;s not holding up the cycling, but I&#8217;m taking it easy, and definitely not running again, until it&#8217;s definitely OK.</p>
<p>The Swindon Half Marathon&#8217;s not quite in sight yet. But maybe I could get used to this running lark after all?!</p>
