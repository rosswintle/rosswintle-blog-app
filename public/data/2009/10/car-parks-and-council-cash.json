That&#8217;s why they have\u00a0<a title=\"Sustainable Travel Plans\" href=\"http:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/roadstransport\/travelplans.htm\" target=\"_blank\">sustainable travel plans<\/a> to &#8216;Keep People Moving&#8217;, and a <a title=\"Swindon Transport Strategy\" href=\"http:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/roadstransport\/roadsandtransport-transportstrategy.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Transport Strategy<\/a> that will &#8216;Work to raise awareness of opportunities for alternatives to driving alone&#8217;. \u00a0Heck&#8230;they even want to be &#8216;<a title=\"Swindon Transport Vision\" href=\"http:\/\/www.swindon.gov.uk\/roadstransport\/transportvision.htm\" target=\"_blank\">the UK&#8217;s number one sustainable community&#8217; by 2030<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>So naturally, when considering how to boost the number of people heading into town they&#8230;err&#8230;encourage people into their cars?! \u00a0Increase congestion and pollution? \u00a0Make getting to town slow and stressful? \u00a0Encourage carbon emissions? \u00a0Forget the health benefits of cycling and walking and the fact that they recently closed a Park and Ride (one that the Swindon News-quoted Christine from Cirencester could have used for example)?<\/p>\n<p>We should be incentivising people to get out of their cars and onto public transport, their feet, or their bicycles. \u00a0We should be reducing bus fares, and providing incentives to do anything but use a car. \u00a0Giving discounts and treats to people who haven&#8217;t used a parking space, not the other way around.<\/p>\n<p>What about, rather than free parking if you spend over \u00a350 like they do in the outlet village, a free bus ticket? \u00a0What about a prize draw that enter with your bus ticket? \u00a0What about a free tea\/coffee or cake for a cyclist? \u00a0Spend \u00a32.80 a time on getting someone to do something good?<\/p>\n<p>The article about parking doesn&#8217;t even seem to suggest that this is a proven way of increasing business. \u00a0Phrases like &#8220;my personal opinion&#8221;, &#8220;I think&#8221; and &#8220;hopefully&#8221; are not the stuff of a well-considered move.<\/p>\n<p>I know that \u00a3155,000 isn&#8217;t a huge chunk of a council&#8217;s budget, and I DO think we should be encouraging people to use our delightful local traders like Iles Jewellers and Great Western Cameras, but spending it on parking seems to be a big step backwards, don&#8217;t you think?<\/p>\n<p><em>P.S. As a little side note, I find it quite amusing that<\/em><a title=\"Swindon Council Cycling Page\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/swicycl\" target=\"_blank\"><em> the Council&#8217;s Cycling page<\/em><\/a><em> lists &#8220;Parking&#8221; and &#8220;Road Closures&#8221; as &#8220;Popular Pages&#8221;.<\/em><\/p>\n",
