<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Plain Posts</h1></header><main><p>Yeah, I know it was quiet for a while, but I seem to be back.  For the time being at least.  I&#8217;ve updated some of the static pages and posted about some recent things, but there&#8217;s a backlog of thoughts to get down too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now equipped with an <a title="Post: Pods and Parcels" href="https://rosswintle.uk/2009/07/16/pods-and-parcels/" target="_self">iPod Touch</a> (which I will write more about soon!), and I have the WordPress app for that, which is great.  It means I can write short, simple posts very easily on the go, or without needing to fire up my laptop or desktop.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not good for rich text!</p>
<p>So, you may see some simple, plain-text postings in the future and they&#8217;re probably posted from my iPod.  I may get the chance to tidy some of them up, post-posting, if you see what I mean, but not always.</p>
<p>And remember, these are mostly badly-scrawled notes to self.  Things I want to record, reflect upon and  look back on at a later date.  I&#8217;m flattered that others take an interest but my intention isn&#8217;t for this to be a popular, flashy, all-singing, all-dancing blog &#8211; please bear that in mind as you read.</p>
<p>Thanks to those who take in interest.  If I don&#8217;t know you&#8217;re reading do post a comment at some point, and enjoy the read!</p>
