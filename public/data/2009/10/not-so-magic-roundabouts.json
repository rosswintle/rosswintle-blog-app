Can you ride normally and comfortably, or you should accelerate or brake in order to prevent or counter a dangerous manoeuvre?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Among other hazards, the book also talks a lot about how it&#8217;s dangerous being ON a roundabout and how drivers coming onto the roundabout as you cycle past the other approaches may not see you on a bike:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The biggest danger to cyclists is on the circulating road as you pass an intermediate entry&#8230;Frequently drivers fail to cede your right of way at these places, sometimes because they haven&#8217;t noticed you.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been paying attention while driving up to and on roundabouts in the last few days, thinking about whether or not I would see a cyclist and how I would respond.<\/p>\n<p>Living in, and learning to drive in Swindon, I consider myself to be a bit of a roundabout expert.\u00a0 Franklin says &#8220;In fact, many motorists themselves fear roundabouts&#8221;&#8230;whereas I take great glee in negotiating the many circular islands of Swindon.\u00a0 So I often approach roundabouts at speed, using my experience to anticipate the movements of those on the roundabout to get onto and across it as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>But reading Cyclecraft has made me aware of the inherent danger of this type of manoeuvre, especially to cyclists!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s fascinating, and it strikes me that it&#8217;s probably more important that drivers understand some of what&#8217;s in Cyclecraft, than it is that cyclists understand it.<\/p>\n<p>I wonder how much bike-awareness is in modern-day driving lessons and tests, and how much there should be.\u00a0 Anyone learn to drive recently and care to comment?<\/p>\n<p>Finally, of course, I love Swindon&#8217;s &#8220;Magic&#8221; Roundabout.\u00a0 But what does Cyclecraft say about it?\u00a0 Simply this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Another, rarer, type of multiple roundabout is where there is a ring of mini-roundabouts around a large roundabout which can be travelled in either direction.\u00a0 These, too, need to be treated with caution.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Mr Franklin, the cyclists of Swindon appreciate your non&#8211;specific reference to their holy grail of gyratory systems&#8230;and <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">all<\/span> your wise experience and advice.<\/p>\n",
