<p><em>[At this point I should say that I&#8217;ve tried to contact both Mr Franklin and his publishers, The Stationary Office, for permission to quote the book, but the online form didn&#8217;t work and the email bounced respectivel.  So, somewhat tentatively, I&#8217;m going to go ahead and just do it.  Mr Franklin, TSO, WordPress.com, if there&#8217;s a problem with this then please contact me and I&#8217;ll happily remove the content.  I&#8217;m hoping that my recommendation to buy this excellent book will cause you to look upon my plagiarism favourably.  Thanks/apologies.]</em></p>
<p>The book (mine is a less-up-to-date versions) explains the problem of dangerous approaches to roundabouts.  This from the section on &#8220;single-lane roundabouts&#8221;, where I experience less difficulty:</p>
<blockquote><p>The greatest danger is that some drivers race a cyclist to the roundabout, cutting sharply across the cyclists path in order to enter.  Drivers often do not realise how great a cyclists speed can be [I love that bit&#8230;&#8221;how great&#8221;!- MR], and as a result there is often insufficient space to complete the overtaking manoeuvre safely, and the cyclist is put at risk&#8230;if there is an [entry] island and a driver still overtakes, it can act as a further hazard by creating a squeeze point.</p></blockquote>
<p>Franklin agrees with the dilemma expressed in my previous post, but has a much better way and less aggressive way of putting it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The difficulty for a cyclist lies in knowing the intentions of a driver behind. Can you ride normally and comfortably, or you should accelerate or brake in order to prevent or counter a dangerous manoeuvre?</p></blockquote>
<p>Among other hazards, the book also talks a lot about how it&#8217;s dangerous being ON a roundabout and how drivers coming onto the roundabout as you cycle past the other approaches may not see you on a bike:</p>
<blockquote><p>The biggest danger to cyclists is on the circulating road as you pass an intermediate entry&#8230;Frequently drivers fail to cede your right of way at these places, sometimes because they haven&#8217;t noticed you.</p></blockquote>
<p>So I&#8217;ve been paying attention while driving up to and on roundabouts in the last few days, thinking about whether or not I would see a cyclist and how I would respond.</p>
<p>Living in, and learning to drive in Swindon, I consider myself to be a bit of a roundabout expert.  Franklin says &#8220;In fact, many motorists themselves fear roundabouts&#8221;&#8230;whereas I take great glee in negotiating the many circular islands of Swindon.  So I often approach roundabouts at speed, using my experience to anticipate the movements of those on the roundabout to get onto and across it as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>But reading Cyclecraft has made me aware of the inherent danger of this type of manoeuvre, especially to cyclists!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fascinating, and it strikes me that it&#8217;s probably more important that drivers understand some of what&#8217;s in Cyclecraft, than it is that cyclists understand it.</p>
<p>I wonder how much bike-awareness is in modern-day driving lessons and tests, and how much there should be.  Anyone learn to drive recently and care to comment?</p>
<p>Finally, of course, I love Swindon&#8217;s &#8220;Magic&#8221; Roundabout.  But what does Cyclecraft say about it?  Simply this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Another, rarer, type of multiple roundabout is where there is a ring of mini-roundabouts around a large roundabout which can be travelled in either direction.  These, too, need to be treated with caution.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr Franklin, the cyclists of Swindon appreciate your non&#8211;specific reference to their holy grail of gyratory systems&#8230;and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">all</span> your wise experience and advice.</p>
