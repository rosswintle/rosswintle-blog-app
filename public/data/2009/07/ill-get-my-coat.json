I already had a nice outdoor waterproof that was quite expensive, but it wasn&#8217;t a cycling fit and it was grey &#8211; not good for standing out from the tarmac.<\/p>\n<p>So I managed to convince my lovely wife that I could spend a similar amount on a cycling jacket, on the basis that it would would be used pretty much every day for probably 3 of the four seasons.<\/p>\n<h3>Why the Windstopper<\/h3>\n<p>The one I had my eye on was the Gore Phantom Windstopper Jacket (2008), in bright red!  Here&#8217;s why:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Gore Windstopper fabric gets rave reviews everywhere and I wanted to give it a go.<\/li>\n<li>Red would make me stand out without looking too silly.<\/li>\n<li>The zip-off arms would make it suitable for, probably, autumn, winter and spring, if not bits of summer too.<\/li>\n<li>Gore&#8217;s Bikewear is generally considered to be top quality &#8211; this is a garment that would last<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s supposedly pretty waterproof as well as windproof, but in any case, not having wind chill would make being damp much less of a problem anyway<\/li>\n<li>Nice, quick-wicking softshell will be far nicer than my existing rubbery laminate waterproof, which gets wet on the inside pretty quickly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It took a bit of research and faffing around to find my size and the right colour at a reasonable price.  If you&#8217;re a XXXXXL or want dull grey or lemon yellow then you&#8217;re fine, but any reasonable sizes and colours are harder to come by. Eventually I visited <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tgstore.net\/\">The Gore Store <\/a>and placed an order.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;ve not been disappointed.<\/p>\n<h3>First Impressions and Fit<\/h3>\n<p>I was initially surprised at how thin and light the jacket was.  But the soft shell felt lovely.  I&#8217;d ordered a small expecting quite a close fit, and it was pretty much perfect; not so tight that I couldn&#8217;t wear something under it, but not so loose that it flaps around in the wind.<\/p>\n<p>I should probably point out here that, sadly, the &#8220;Windstopper&#8221; doesn&#8217;t miraculously <strong>STOP<\/strong> the wind, but it does act as a water-resistant, breathable layer that blocks chilly air, creating a little micro-climate around you.<\/p>\n<h3>Effective and Comfortable<\/h3>\n<p>And I have to say, it&#8217;s extremely effective.  One of the best things I can say about this jacket is that I don&#8217;t notice it&#8217;s there.  It&#8217;s light, comfortable, well-cut.  It really is breathable and doesn&#8217;t get damp, even when cycling far and fast.  Well, OK, maybe a little bit, but the Windstopper really does keep the chill out so that you don&#8217;t notice.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been out in a few downpours in it too and it&#8217;s performed admirably.  It&#8217;s NOT a waterproof, but it does a fine job of trying to keep out water and I&#8217;ve only ever been slightly damp inside after rain on my short commute.  Of course, the jacket dries out quickly too.<\/p>\n<p>I even happen to think it looks pretty cool.  It&#8217;s a sporty fit, and it&#8217;s a practical garment rather than a stylish one, but compared to my cheaper jackets it feels positively trendy.<\/p>\n<h3>Minor Issues<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had it through three seasons now and it&#8217;s been a delight.<\/p>\n<p>I had a little problem with the zip, which was sticky at first but seems to have worn in.  I&#8217;m a little baffled by the reflectives, which are on the arms facing forwards.  I&#8217;d have preferred something more on the back to keep me visible.  And there isn&#8217;t a zip-up pocket.  But these are small things in an otherwise brilliant bit of kit.<\/p>\n<h3>What to wear?<\/h3>\n<p>There are a lot of people who say you should be able to just cycle in your normal clothes, and you can.  But it&#8217;s my opinion that cycle-specific gear is a whole load more practical, safe, and comfortable if you want to ride fast and\/or far.  And this is a great piece of cycle gear that I reckon was money well spent!<\/p>\n",
