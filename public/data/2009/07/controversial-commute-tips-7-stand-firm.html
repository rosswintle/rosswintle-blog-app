<p>This is a tip about cycling character.  And while I would never advocate any form of road-rage, any inciting of road-rage or anything along those lines, I think it&#8217;s important to be confident on the road as a cyclist and to stand your ground a bit.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Confidence is not something that I can give you tips about.  It&#8217;s something that you&#8217;ll grow into as you do more cycling on the roads.  As you grow in confidence perhaps you can start to try some of what I suggest below.</p>
<p>I should probably point out that the things I mention here are my own style of cycling, and you adopt any of my &#8220;tips&#8221; at your own risk&#8230;very much as you adopt cycling in general at your own risk.  And, of course, I defer to the Highway Code and the road laws of the UK in all matters.</p>
<p>My aim, in &#8220;standing firm&#8221;, is to make sure that other road users around me are aware of my presence, and my rights as a cyclist AS I&#8217;m cycling.</p>
<p>I mostly do this by riding the &#8220;primary position&#8221;.  Not all of the time, but when it&#8217;s appropriate.  This means I&#8217;m not hugging the left-hand kerb, but I&#8217;m a couple or three feet from it.</p>
<p>But there are other occasions too.  At junctions and &#8220;pinch points&#8221; &#8211; where the road narrows or lanes merge &#8211; I do a LOT of looking over my shoulder.  Establishing eye contact with the driver behind says &#8220;I&#8217;m here&#8230;I&#8217;m allowed to be here&#8230;please give me room&#8221;.</p>
<p>These techniques should always be combined with obeying the rules of the road and especially with clear signalling well in advance of what you intend to do.</p>
<p>One good example is on my way home there&#8217;s a place where there&#8217;s a nasty sunken drain cover just before a roundabout.</p>

<p>To go over it is horrid.  To go left of it forces you down a narrow gap close to the kerb, to go right of it means, pretty much, cycling in the middle of the road.  So I look behind, check for space, and pull into the middle really early on.  (I tend not to indicate here as I&#8217;m not turning right at the roundabout&#8230;not sure what I should actually be doing?!). Moving out gives me a pretty good line over the roundabout too!</p>
<p>Of course, there are two dangers with the &#8220;Stand Firm&#8221; approach:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The driver ignores you and refuses to give you room</strong>.  I only cycle the primary position, or move out if I know it&#8217;s safe.  If something&#8217;s in my way &#8211; or if I&#8217;m in something&#8217;s way &#8211; then I keep well clear, and with experience you&#8217;ll learn to listen and hear what the vehicle behind you might be about to do.  A revving engine as you approach a roundabout means &#8220;get out the way, I&#8217;m coming through!&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Being annoying</strong>.  This happens far less than you think. Much as a few bad cyclists get the general cycling population a bad press, so a few bad drivers give the driving population a bad press.  Most drivers seem to respond well to cues and signals that I give.
<p>But standing firm must also be tempered with grace.  Give people room, let people through, acknowledge that cars can go faster than you and let them.  A good example: Temporary traffic lights on a country road.  I&#8217;ve reached them first and stopped and a few cars are behind me.  Pulling away first means that they all want to overtake me on a section of road reduced to one lane.  So I just stop and wave them past.  No dangerous overtaking, no annoyed cyclist, no annoyed drivers.  Everyone wins!</li>
</ol>
<p>You&#8217;re allowed to be on the road!  If you&#8217;re confident, and if it&#8217;s safe to do so, make sure that others are aware of that.  But be aware that others are on the road too and sometimes, a little give and take works wonders.</p>
<p>[Update &#8211; after writing this I read <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/ethicallivingblog/2009/jul/11/bike-blog-road-safety">an article written by a 12-year-old</a> who, after some cycle training, &#8220;managed to make [a double decker bus] that was so much bigger than me slow down while I moved across its path&#8221;.  It seems that my approach &#8211; at least the road positioning, signalling and asserting yourself parts &#8211; is advocated as a part of basic training!]</p>
