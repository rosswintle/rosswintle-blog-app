        "rendered": "<p>I don&#8217;t mean to blow my own trumpet here&#8230;or to sound ungrateful.  But something has unexpectedly come into my life that has been quite complicated and caused me to have to explore some new things: a pair of headphones!<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Prize Management Waffle<\/h3>\n<p>I was on a training course last week put on by one of my software suppliers, and each day there was a prize draw.  The first two days the prize was a little iPod shuffle&#8230;something I would have quite appreciated.<\/p>\n<p>But on the final day the prize was some headphones.<\/p>\n<p>To win, you had to write something about how you would use the supplier&#8217;s software to enhance your business, or something like that.  I wrote some buzz-word packed drivel about &#8220;application services&#8221; and &#8220;increased revenue&#8221; and, somehow won (as a side note, I&#8217;m slightly concerned about my ability to use management-speak!).<\/p>\n<h3>What have I won?<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-433\" title=\"Bose Headphones\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/3688579278_056052e4b2_b.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"Bose Headphones\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3688579278_056052e4b2_b.jpg 768w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3688579278_056052e4b2_b-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/>I resisted opening the box on the train on the way home, waiting, instead, until I got home to unbox them, plug them into my iPod, and mosey around the house with them on testing out the &#8216;phones&#8217; (that&#8217;s not in quotes &#8211; it just has two apostrophes) noise-cancelling abilities.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, these weren&#8217;t just any old headphones.  They were <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bose.co.uk\/GB\/en\/home-entertainment\/personal-audio\/headphones\/acoustic-noise-cancelling-headphones\/qc2\/index.jsp\">Bose Quiet Comfort 2, Noise-Cancelleing, over-ear headphones<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>And jolly good they were too.  But not really my thing.  I like music, and appreciate quality in products, but I&#8217;m not really into wearing big &#8220;cans&#8221; in public, and as I don&#8217;t travel much the noise-cancelling properties wouldn&#8217;t be put to much use.<\/p>\n<h3>What to do?<\/h3>\n<p>My initial thoughts were that these were probably worth about \u00a370 or \u00a380 &#8211; a search on Amazon showed them turning up second hand for around this sort of prise &#8211; and that, as I&#8217;d got them for free and didn&#8217;t really need them, I would sell them and give the proceeds to charity.<\/p>\n<p>However, after a few chats with other people who know their hi-fi gear better than I, I discovered that they were worth a whopping \u00a3250 and probably aren&#8217;t the sort of thing that you&#8217;d sell to your mates.<\/p>\n<p>So, these are for a specialist market that I couldn&#8217;t easily reach and selling them on eBay was looking like the best option.<\/p>\n<p>Did I then want to donate the whole \u00a3150 that I was likely to get for them to charity?  Well, that was a quandry, and I&#8217;ve settled on giving some away and keeping some for myself as a treat (more on thsi later).<\/p>\n<h3>eBay<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-432\" title=\"Bose Headphones with Box\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/3687771303_a3168401ac_b.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Bose Headphones with Box\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3687771303_a3168401ac_b.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/3687771303_a3168401ac_b-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>I&#8217;ve never sold on eBay before.  I&#8217;ve bought a couple of things in the past, but I&#8217;m not a big user.  So I took some nice pictures on the dining room table and got cracking with adding my listing.<\/p>\n<p>Only, first, I had to check my PayPal account was still working after years of neglect.  And it was, but I needed to add a valid card and have it upgraded to a &#8220;Premier&#8221; account, which didn&#8217;t seem to cost anything but meant accepting that they would take a slice of anything paid to me.<\/p>\n<p>And then I had to have my eBay account verified.  This involved a weird disembodied voiced phoning my landline and telling me a code that had to be typed back in to the website.<\/p>\n<p>And then I had to check the postage costs.<\/p>\n<p>And I had to decide on an initial price, how many photos to upload, did I want a reserve, where could I ship to, would I offer insurance.<\/p>\n<p>Argh!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve an odd feeling that, once you&#8217;ve done this a few times, it&#8217;s easy.  But it took me most of an evening to list a single item properly.<\/p>\n<p>And it costs too.  Three photos, with a reserve price, cost around \u00a33.50 to list, and they&#8217;ll take 10% of the selling price.  And PayPay will take 2% as well, or something.  Will there be any left for me after all that effort?<\/p>\n<h3>Sitting, waiting, wishing<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s a ten-day listing, so I probably shouldn&#8217;t panic, but as yet I have no bids and an enquiry about how much it would cost to ship to Portugal.<\/p>\n<p>Is this normal?  Is my &#8220;0% positive feedback&#8221; (HEY!  I&#8217;ve never sold anything!!!) not helping?  Have I put the initial bid too high?  Should I have had a lower reserve?  Or a higher one?<\/p>\n<p>We shall wait and see.  I guess that people are bidding on items closer to ending, so next week I can expect a flurry of activity, but in the meantime all is quiet.<\/p>\n<h3>An unexpected treat<\/h3>\n<p>So I&#8217;m not ungrateful, really I&#8217;m not.  And I&#8217;m hoping to spend the proceeds on something that I would rather have won.<\/p>\n<p>Initially I was thinking of an iPod touch, but I worry that this will just make me covet a full-on, ridiculously expensive, iPhone.  If I can&#8217;t use the web broswer and apps wherever I go, is there much point in having them?  It MIGHT help consolidate my current electronic organiser with my portable media player, but I don&#8217;t know how good the organiser functions on the iPod Touch are, and internet opinion seems to be divided.<\/p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s still a possibility, but a better idea would be to upgrade my mobile to a touch-screen, smart phone of some kind.  I really dislike Nokias, can&#8217;t afford &#8211; or rather refuse to afford &#8211; Apple, and so am contemplating Google&#8217;s Android as a platform.  But at what cost I&#8217;ve yet to find out.<\/p>\n<p>So, this small, prize-winning event has unfurled a whole load of other questions and discoveries.  Who&#8217;d have thought that a bit of management speak could cause so much excitement?<\/p>\n",
