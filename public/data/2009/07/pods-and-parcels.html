<p>So my <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2009/07/11/an-unwanted-prize/">unwanted prize</a> has hit its reserve price on eBay, and I&#8217;ve been debating what to with the cash.</p>
<p>My immediate thoughts were to either buy the thing that I would rather have had as a prize in a draw, or to give the cash away.</p>
<p>I shall still give some of the cash away, that&#8217;s my way, but I&#8217;ve also decided that a treat is in order.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h3>A Tricky Treat</h3>
<p>I spent some time doing research.  I originally thought an iPod Touch would be the thing, but then I decided that maybe a mid-range smart phone would be more useful.  But my research didn&#8217;t really turn up a mid-range smart phone.  All the half-decent phones are either  pretty darned expensive or come attached to long, expensive phone tariffs.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even have a particularly long wish list for a smartphone type device:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syncs calendars and contacts with Google&#8217;s services;</li>
<li>Has a decent web browser with Wifi;</li>
<li>Can run <a href="http://laridian.com/">Laridian&#8217;s</a> Bible Software, for taking a Good Book with me;</li>
<li>A nice, intuitive, responsive user interface.</li>
<li>Useful applications to keep my life in order (to-do list, decent note-taking software)</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably more interesting are the things I don&#8217;t care so much for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Camera and multimedia facilities</li>
<li>3G connectivity</li>
<li>Music player</li>
<li>Games</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, I don&#8217;t get device convergance.  Well, I do.   I think it&#8217;s a good idea, but I&#8217;ve not seen it done well.</p>
<p>My current gadget arsenal explains this:</p>
<ul>
<li>My little Sony Ericsson W810i is a great, sturdy, reliable phone with a quick and easy to use user interface.  With Opera Mini it&#8217;s even pretty good for the mobile web.  But &#8211; even though it&#8217;s a Walkman-branded phone, it&#8217;s a lousy media player, and it&#8217;s not an organiser.</li>
<li>My 5th Generation iPod Video is a great media player, but rubbish at doing everything else.</li>
<li>My PalmTungsten (which has had a broken touch-screen for years now) is a great organiser, book reader and note-taker, but again, is rubbish at media and it&#8217;s not a phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe some of these really expensive new devices do do ALL of these things well, but I don&#8217;t want to pay £350+ until I KNOW what I&#8217;m getting.</p>
<h3>Plan&#8230;err&#8230;A?</h3>
<p>So&#8230;I&#8217;ve fallen back to plan A: the iPod Touch.  I THINK it will converge as a media player and organiser.  It will <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/products/sync.html#p=apple">sync with Google</a>, I can get my study bibles on it (only when online currently, but there&#8217;s an offline app in the pipeline).  It will let me browse the web from home and, sometimes, on the move.  And rather than spend an extra £200 on the &#8220;phone&#8221; in &#8220;iPhone&#8221;, my W810 will keep me properly connected when on the go on a £15 tarrif with unlimited 2.5G internet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an odd choice given that media and games are things I don&#8217;t care about, but I reckon I can make good use of it.</p>
<p>And most of all, it will be really nice to finally get to play with the iPod Touch/iPhone interface.  For me, it&#8217;s not just a useful gadget, but a great <span style="text-decoration:underline;">toy</span>&#8230;and just what I would have liked to have won as a prize!</p>
<h3>A Rotten Apple</h3>
<p>Having decided (and got permission) to buy an iTouch, I went online to get a good deal.  Actually, it seems that prices are much of a muchness so, for no real reason other than to try them out, I decided to buy from the Apple Store.</p>
<p>Sadly&#8230;Apple&#8217;s shopping experience isn&#8217;t as good as their user experience.  OK, so, the shop is fine, and the device was dispatched quickly&#8230;I guess I can&#8217;t blame Apple.</p>
<p>But they shipped using UPS.  And UPS seem to have the WORST distribution network of any courier I&#8217;ve come across in the UK.  Our nearest depots are Bristol, Gloucester and Reading&#8230;all about 40 miles away.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, I decided to have this delivered to my home address and, several days later, I&#8217;m still waiting to rendezvous with my new toy, which has been clocking up the miles between Bristol and Swindon.  Despite having seen a UPS van leaving my office on Tuesday morning&#8230;probably carrying my parcel!</p>
<p>I shalln&#8217;t be shopping at the Apple Store again!  I should just have popped to Asda at lunch and bought one.</p>
<p>Oh well.  Hopefully my treat will arrive tomorrow &#8211; expect me to tell you all about it soon!</p>
