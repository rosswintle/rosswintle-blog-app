<p>OK, now a REAL controversial tip.  If you can afford it, buy yourself a decent bike.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Of course, it doesn&#8217;t REALLY matter.  I&#8217;d rather you rode a knackered (but SAFE, of course) old steed than nothing at all.  But a decent, fit-for-purpose, well-maintained bike makes the whole experience so much better.</p>
<p>Type of bike is, I think, important.  I KNOW that mountain bikes are cool status symbols, but you&#8217;ll mostly be riding on tarmac (unless you have, and choose to use, offroad routes), so get a bike that suited to the road &#8211; a road bike, tourer, or hybrid.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never regretted buying a not-quite-bottom-of-the-range road bike &#8211; it&#8217;s improved my commuting experience no end.  I bought it for fitness but I love riding it now and it&#8217;s become the workhorse too.  The curved, drop handlebars allow me to get out of the wind, it&#8217;s light and fast, and it flies up hills.</p>
<p>Get mudguards &#8211; you&#8217;ll be riding in the rain too right?  If you need to take luggage (future tips will show how you can reduce the need to carry stuff), then make sure you&#8217;ve got racks, or the screw holes need to attach them.</p>
<p>At the very least, if you insist on using a mountain bike, get some road tyres.  A friend at work announced with great glee this week, that he&#8217;d swapped his knobbly off-road tyres for slicks and, I think the word &#8220;awesome&#8221; was used.  He pedalled, and he went somewhere &#8211; the difference was dramatic!</p>
<p>If a new bike looks expensive then help might be at hand.  If your employer runs a Cycle-to-Work scheme you can get a bike to ride to work on for almost half price and with a 12-month interest free loan. The <a href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/">CycleScheme Site</a> is pretty handy at explaining this &#8211; check it out!</p>
