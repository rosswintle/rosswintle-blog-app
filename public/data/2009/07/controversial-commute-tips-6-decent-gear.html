<p>Yes, yes, yes.  You can cycle in jeans, T-shirts, skirts (though, see <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/ethicallivingblog/2009/jul/07/cycling-skirts">The Guardian&#8217;s own tips on this</a>), suits&#8230;in fact, some would argue that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Naked_Bike_Ride">clothing is optional</a> for cycling!</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>But as regular readers will know, I think that, like a decent bike, some decent cycle clothing makes the whole experience much nicer.  And here&#8217;s why:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sweat &amp; Changing.  Yes, I&#8217;m fortunate to have showers at my workplace, so I can shower and change when I arrive.  Which is actually pretty good because I sweat quite a lot.  But even a warm glow isn&#8217;t particularly pleasant to be in when you arrive at work, so a change of clothes is usually welcome.  And if you&#8217;re going to change anyway, why not change into/out of some cycle specific clothing.</li>
<li>Comfort.  Cycling involves things like leaning forward and flexing your knees a lot, along with a repetitive up-down motion of your legs, which is not really normal, and everyday clothes aren&#8217;t really cut for that sort of thing. You don&#8217;t wear a jumper when it&#8217;s sunny, or shorts in the snow.  Actually, perhaps you do&#8230;but you get my point.  We&#8217;ve been clever enough to develop different clothes for different seasons and activities.  Cycle-specific clothing is just more comfortable to cycle in.  As for padded pants (my term for cycling shorts)? Well, try them.  They&#8217;re not for everyone, I admit, but I won&#8217;t be going back.</li>
<li>Safety.  It&#8217;s actually the combination of cyclist and driver in me that think this: cyclists should be visible!  Wear something bright so that you stand out from the road.  And when it&#8217;s dark, wear something reflective.  Those lights are great, but they&#8217;re just the start as far as I&#8217;m concerned.</li>
<li>Rain.  You may have noticed the wet stuff that falls from the sky&#8230;it really mucks up a commute.  But don&#8217;t be put off!  With the right kit you can arrive at work with, well, pretty much everything dry but your face.</li>
<li>Wind.  It may seem odd, but I actually prefer cycling in a downpour to cycling in a gale.  Wind can get to you in lots of ways. And my <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2009/07/11/ill-get-my-coat/">Gore Windstopper Jacket</a> has improved my cycling comfort levels a LOT!</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, buying all this gear can be expensive right?</p>
<p>Well, yes.  But relative to running a car?  I mean, we&#8217;ve just had the anniversary of buying our car, which means Insurance (£250), MoT (£120 with a new exhaust), Service (+ cam belt this time round &#8211; £400), and then there&#8217;s Vehicle Excise Duty (£145), depreciation, and consumables (washing, de-icer, washer fluid, etc).  And that&#8217;s before petrol (I reckon I save at least £250 per year).</p>
<p>If you can afford to do all of that, then, not everyone, I know, but most people with a car can surely afford a decent visible, waterproof jacket?</p>
