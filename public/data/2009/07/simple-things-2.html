<h3>Putting out the white bag, and half a black one</h3>
<p>We can now recycle mixed plastics from the kerbside.  Yoghurt pots, meat trays, plastic bags, as well as the palstic bottles we used to.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be better if things didn&#8217;t come packaged in plastic to start with, but it&#8217;s better than landfilling it.</p>
<p>So this week we put out a clear sack with plastics, and just half a black-sack of stuff for landfill.  That&#8217;s two week&#8217;s rubbish in there!!!</p>
<h3>Good, old-fashioned customer service</h3>
<ol>
<li>I constantly rave about Chesterfield&#8217;s, my barbers.  They&#8217;re cheerful, friendly, laid back, chatty &#8211; but not too chatty, keen to help and they do a good job for a good price.  Just passing the place makes me smile.</li>
<li>The car&#8217;s service happened last month.  This month it was time for an MoT.  Here&#8217;s what happened when I booked it in:
<div style="margin-left:40px;">&#8220;Ah, Mr Wintle is it&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yes.  Booked in for an MoT&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Is the car in the top car park sir?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;No, it looked full so I put it in the bottom car park?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Ah, you put it in the top car park last time.&#8221;</div>
<p>He remembered who I was, and where I&#8217;d left the car last time.  Not only that but they did exactly what I asked (if not less), phoned me to keep me informed, and were friendly, helpful and did a good job for a good price.</li>
</ol>
<p>So in a week where there&#8217;s not been much good news, some things, the simple things, are looking pretty good still!</p>
