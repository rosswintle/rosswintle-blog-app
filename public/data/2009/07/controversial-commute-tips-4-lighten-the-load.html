<p>So, there ARE ways to carry a load on a bike.  It&#8217;s an area of constant innovation.  Rucksacks, messenger bags, paniers, baskets, even trailers exist.</p>
<p>But I think the key to an easier commute is to reduce the amount that you have to carry.</p>

<ul>
<li>Leave a lock at work.  Locks are heavy.  If you regularly ride to the same place, leave a lock there.</li>
<li>Store spare clothes.  I&#8217;m fortunate enough to have a locker &#8211; depending on what facilities you have this may or may not be practical, but I leave bigger items of clothing at work overnight, change them regularly but not every day, and I have spares in case I get out of routine (see the next post for more on this).  I have a pair of shoes that stays at work.</li>
<li>Where&#8217;s lunch coming from?  We have a small local supermarket where I stock up on fruit and snacks occasionally.  I bring in my main lunch (sandwich, pasta, salad and so on) each day, but other less perishable items are bought in bulk and stored in my drawer.</li>
<li>Duplicates.  If there&#8217;s something that you take to work often, and if you can afford it, buy a duplicate and leave it there.  I do this with things like hay-fever remedies, and sports shoes.</li>
<p>I used to take paniers, but over time, leaving these things at my destination has meant that all I have to carry are a few smaller bits of clothing, a small lunch, and some small valuables, which all fits easily into a small rucksack.</p>
<p>Bag tips: make sure it&#8217;s waterproof and visible!  I use a rucksack cover in a downpour.  These fold up into a tiny size &#8211; but make sure it&#8217;ll make you visible.  &#8220;<a href="http://www.respro.com/products/urban-commuting/hi-visibility/hiviz_hump/">Humps</a>&#8221; are good for this, they look a bit daft, but I&#8217;d rather look a little silly than get knocked off on a dark, wet night.</p>
