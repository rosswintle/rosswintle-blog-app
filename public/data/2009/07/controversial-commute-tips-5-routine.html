<p>Who said this was easy?  In some ways my <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2009/07/17/controversial-commute-tips-4-lighten-the-load/">last tip</a> about leaving some things at work complicates matters because you need to remember what&#8217;s at work and what isn&#8217;t, what needs changing, and so on.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>At first, I&#8217;d often get this wrong, but over time I&#8217;ve developed a routine.  I know what needs to go in my bag on what days.  Some things stay in my bag.   Some things are changed every day, some are changed every week.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll need a bit of thought, but with practice &#8220;<em>The Routine</em>&#8221; becomes second nature&#8230;until you get an out-of-routine day.  A trip away from the office; a day off on leave, a day working from home.  All of these put you out of step with where things are.</p>
<p>I also recently had a phase of bad Mondays.  Traditionally, Wednesday is my least favourite day of the week (it&#8217;s the furthest point from a weekend), but for a few weeks Mondays were pretty bad.  The things with Monday is lots of weekly things get changed over, and I&#8217;m often thinking too hard about them and forget the daily things.</p>
<p>But establishing a routine is good, will come as you work at it, and makes life easier in the end.</p>
