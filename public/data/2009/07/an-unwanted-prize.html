But something has unexpectedly come into my life that has been quite complicated and caused me to have to explore some new things: a pair of headphones!</p>

<h3>Prize Management Waffle</h3>
<p>I was on a training course last week put on by one of my software suppliers, and each day there was a prize draw.  The first two days the prize was a little iPod shuffle&#8230;something I would have quite appreciated.</p>
<p>But on the final day the prize was some headphones.</p>
<p>To win, you had to write something about how you would use the supplier&#8217;s software to enhance your business, or something like that.  I wrote some buzz-word packed drivel about &#8220;application services&#8221; and &#8220;increased revenue&#8221; and, somehow won (as a side note, I&#8217;m slightly concerned about my ability to use management-speak!).</p>
<h3>What have I won?</h3>

<p>Yes, these weren&#8217;t just any old headphones.  They were <a href="http://www.bose.co.uk/GB/en/home-entertainment/personal-audio/headphones/acoustic-noise-cancelling-headphones/qc2/index.jsp">Bose Quiet Comfort 2, Noise-Cancelleing, over-ear headphones</a>!</p>
<p>And jolly good they were too.  But not really my thing.  I like music, and appreciate quality in products, but I&#8217;m not really into wearing big &#8220;cans&#8221; in public, and as I don&#8217;t travel much the noise-cancelling properties wouldn&#8217;t be put to much use.</p>
<h3>What to do?</h3>
<p>My initial thoughts were that these were probably worth about £70 or £80 &#8211; a search on Amazon showed them turning up second hand for around this sort of prise &#8211; and that, as I&#8217;d got them for free and didn&#8217;t really need them, I would sell them and give the proceeds to charity.</p>
<p>However, after a few chats with other people who know their hi-fi gear better than I, I discovered that they were worth a whopping £250 and probably aren&#8217;t the sort of thing that you&#8217;d sell to your mates.</p>
<p>So, these are for a specialist market that I couldn&#8217;t easily reach and selling them on eBay was looking like the best option.</p>
<p>Did I then want to donate the whole £150 that I was likely to get for them to charity?  Well, that was a quandry, and I&#8217;ve settled on giving some away and keeping some for myself as a treat (more on thsi later).</p>
<h3>eBay</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-432" title="Bose Headphones with Box" src="http://magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/3687771303_a3168401ac_b.jpg?w=300" alt="Bose Headphones with Box" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/3687771303_a3168401ac_b.jpg 1024w, https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/3687771303_a3168401ac_b-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />I&#8217;ve never sold on eBay before.  I&#8217;ve bought a couple of things in the past, but I&#8217;m not a big user.  So I took some nice pictures on the dining room table and got cracking with adding my listing.</p>
<p>Only, first, I had to check my PayPal account was still working after years of neglect.  And it was, but I needed to add a valid card and have it upgraded to a &#8220;Premier&#8221; account, which didn&#8217;t seem to cost anything but meant accepting that they would take a slice of anything paid to me.</p>
<p>And then I had to have my eBay account verified.  This involved a weird disembodied voiced phoning my landline and telling me a code that had to be typed back in to the website.</p>
<p>And then I had to check the postage costs.</p>
<p>And I had to decide on an initial price, how many photos to upload, did I want a reserve, where could I ship to, would I offer insurance.</p>
<p>Argh!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve an odd feeling that, once you&#8217;ve done this a few times, it&#8217;s easy.  But it took me most of an evening to list a single item properly.</p>
<p>And it costs too.  Three photos, with a reserve price, cost around £3.50 to list, and they&#8217;ll take 10% of the selling price.  And PayPay will take 2% as well, or something.  Will there be any left for me after all that effort?</p>
<h3>Sitting, waiting, wishing</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s a ten-day listing, so I probably shouldn&#8217;t panic, but as yet I have no bids and an enquiry about how much it would cost to ship to Portugal.</p>
<p>Is this normal?  Is my &#8220;0% positive feedback&#8221; (HEY!  I&#8217;ve never sold anything!!!) not helping?  Have I put the initial bid too high?  Should I have had a lower reserve?  Or a higher one?</p>
<p>We shall wait and see.  I guess that people are bidding on items closer to ending, so next week I can expect a flurry of activity, but in the meantime all is quiet.</p>
<h3>An unexpected treat</h3>
<p>So I&#8217;m not ungrateful, really I&#8217;m not.  And I&#8217;m hoping to spend the proceeds on something that I would rather have won.</p>
<p>Initially I was thinking of an iPod touch, but I worry that this will just make me covet a full-on, ridiculously expensive, iPhone.  If I can&#8217;t use the web broswer and apps wherever I go, is there much point in having them?  It MIGHT help consolidate my current electronic organiser with my portable media player, but I don&#8217;t know how good the organiser functions on the iPod Touch are, and internet opinion seems to be divided.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s still a possibility, but a better idea would be to upgrade my mobile to a touch-screen, smart phone of some kind.  I really dislike Nokias, can&#8217;t afford &#8211; or rather refuse to afford &#8211; Apple, and so am contemplating Google&#8217;s Android as a platform.  But at what cost I&#8217;ve yet to find out.</p>
<p>So, this small, prize-winning event has unfurled a whole load of other questions and discoveries.  Who&#8217;d have thought that a bit of management speak could cause so much excitement?</p>
