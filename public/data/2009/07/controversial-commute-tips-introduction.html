<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Controversial Commute Tips &#8211; Introduction</h1></header><main><p>Despite being a highly non-confrontational, easy-going kind of chap, who takes the middle ground with cycling, I find myself frequently at odds with lots of other cycling folks.</p>
<p>I mean, I&#8217;m not a mountain biker, I&#8217;m not a long-distance tourer, I&#8217;m not a suit-wearing commuter, I&#8217;m not a triathlete. If anything I&#8217;m closest to being a roadie, yet I don&#8217;t race and I&#8217;m not in a club &#8211; heck I&#8217;ve even got a bike that&#8217;s mostly made of metal, rather than carbon fibre.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>But I am highly pro-cycling, both as a form of fitness and as a form of general transport. I ride to work every day and encourage others out of their cars at every opportunity. Yet I find myself thinking what feel like &#8220;dirty thoughts&#8221;. Things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>cycling is actually quite dangerous sometimes;</li>
<li>I should wear a helmet;</li>
<li>commuting is a big faff;</li>
<li>I&#8217;d rather be seen and safe than look stylish;</li>
<li>I&#8217;d rather be comfortable than look cool;</li>
<li>it would be easier to drive today.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve been cycle commuting my 3.5 miles a day for nearly three years now, and it&#8217;s brilliant and I&#8217;d recommend it to anyone and everyone who lives close enough to their workplace to do it.</p>
<p>But cycling, it turns out, is sometimes &#8211; SOMETIMES &#8211; the opposite of all the things I want it to be, and that the pro-cycling people (including myself) advertise it as being.  It&#8217;s tiring, it makes me angry, it&#8217;s complicated, it&#8217;s hampered by the weather, it&#8217;s dangerous, it&#8217;s expensive&#8230;SOMETIMES!</p>
<p>Some of these things are my own fault and are due to <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2009/03/11/my-kind-of-cycling/">the way that I am as a cyclist</a>, the routes I take, the way that I am as a person. But some are, I believe facts of life as a cycle commuter.</p>
<p>But commuting has got easier over time. I&#8217;ve learnt things, I&#8217;ve got more confident on the roads, I&#8217;ve established a routine, I&#8217;ve bought a better bike and decent gear.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ve not been very good at sustaining series of posts, but I hope to run at least a few entries here detailing some of what I&#8217;ve experienced and learned. It&#8217;ll be an insight into how I organise that 7 miles a day in the saddle, in all weathers, and arrive in the office ready for a days work. And I hope it will be helpful to others.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want this all to be taken negatively, and I hope I don&#8217;t put anyone off &#8211; far from it! I hope to be real about what life on two wheels is like, and to make suggestions that will lighten the load a little.</p>
<p>Controversial? Possibly. But leaving the car at home is always going to go against the grain in this day and age &#8211; perhaps I&#8217;m just used to doing things differently.</p>
