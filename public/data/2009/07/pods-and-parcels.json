even though it&#8217;s a Walkman-branded phone, it&#8217;s a lousy media player, and it&#8217;s not an organiser.<\/li>\n<li>My 5th Generation iPod Video is a great media player, but rubbish at doing everything else.<\/li>\n<li>My PalmTungsten (which has had a broken touch-screen for years now) is a great organiser, book reader and note-taker, but again, is rubbish at media and it&#8217;s not a phone.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Maybe some of these really expensive new devices do do ALL of these things well, but I don&#8217;t want to pay \u00a3350+ until I KNOW what I&#8217;m getting.<\/p>\n<h3>Plan&#8230;err&#8230;A?<\/h3>\n<p>So&#8230;I&#8217;ve fallen back to plan A: the iPod Touch.\u00a0 I THINK it will converge as a media player and organiser.\u00a0 It will <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/mobile\/products\/sync.html#p=apple\">sync with Google<\/a>, I can get my study bibles on it (only when online currently, but there&#8217;s an offline app in the pipeline).\u00a0 It will let me browse the web from home and, sometimes, on the move.\u00a0 And rather than spend an extra \u00a3200 on the &#8220;phone&#8221; in &#8220;iPhone&#8221;, my W810 will keep me properly connected when on the go on a \u00a315 tarrif with unlimited 2.5G internet.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an odd choice given that media and games are things I don&#8217;t care about, but I reckon I can make good use of it.<\/p>\n<p>And most of all, it will be really nice to finally get to play with the iPod Touch\/iPhone interface.\u00a0 For me, it&#8217;s not just a useful gadget, but a great <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">toy<\/span>&#8230;and just what I would have liked to have won as a prize!<\/p>\n<h3>A Rotten Apple<\/h3>\n<p>Having decided (and got permission) to buy an iTouch, I went online to get a good deal.\u00a0 Actually, it seems that prices are much of a muchness so, for no real reason other than to try them out, I decided to buy from the Apple Store.<\/p>\n<p>Sadly&#8230;Apple&#8217;s shopping experience isn&#8217;t as good as their user experience.\u00a0 OK, so, the shop is fine, and the device was dispatched quickly&#8230;I guess I can&#8217;t blame Apple.<\/p>\n<p>But they shipped using UPS.\u00a0 And UPS seem to have the WORST distribution network of any courier I&#8217;ve come across in the UK.\u00a0 Our nearest depots are Bristol, Gloucester and Reading&#8230;all about 40 miles away.<\/p>\n<p>Annoyingly, I decided to have this delivered to my home address and, several days later, I&#8217;m still waiting to rendezvous with my new toy, which has been clocking up the miles between Bristol and Swindon.\u00a0 Despite having seen a UPS van leaving my office on Tuesday morning&#8230;probably carrying my parcel!<\/p>\n<p>I shalln&#8217;t be shopping at the Apple Store again!\u00a0 I should just have popped to Asda at lunch and bought one.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well.\u00a0 Hopefully my treat will arrive tomorrow &#8211; expect me to tell you all about it soon!<\/p>\n",
