There are several things in our house that have gone unmended for a long&#8230;a LONG time. But I&#8217;m finally getting in gear and making them work again.</p>
<p>First off was the grill. We&#8217;ve been without it for more than a year&#8230;mostly because our cooker &#8211; like everything in the house that we bought &#8211; is the cheapest of the cheap and local hardware stores don&#8217;t recognise the model number.</p>
<p>So it was with my metaphorical tail between my metaphorical legs, and with my pen poised to sign a blank cheque, that I called the Hotpoint/Indesit service centre.</p>
<p><!--more-->They were friendly enough but offered two options.  An all-expenses-paid repair for £100 or some fancy guarantee thing where I pay £160 over 10 months and if they can&#8217;t repair it or if it breaks again we get the whole thing replaced.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always sceptical of insurance.  It&#8217;s got to be a profitable business for the insurer, so the odds are actually stacked against the insurer.  And all we wanted was a simple fix for the element or the switch.  But they gave me the hard sell anyway.</p>
<p>&#8220;You not filling me with confidence that you can fix it for £100&#8221;, I told them.  &#8220;Do you have any numbers on how many people end up claiming a new appliance?&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially vague responses about most customers wishing they&#8217;d paid extra were finally not-backed-up with the statistic that over 95% of initial repairs were successful.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it was just a broken handle then I&#8217;d recommend the cheaper option&#8221;, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it was just a broken handle I&#8217;d fix it myself and definitely wouldn&#8217;t be paying £100&#8221;</p>
<p>I paid the £100 and booked the visit.</p>
<p>Within 10 days the helpful engineer had visited, ordered two parts, visited again and fixed a faulty switch pack.  Simple.</p>
<p>Grilled bacon butties all round!!</p>
