<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Moving&#8230;again</h1></header><main><p>Just a wee note to say that, due to various, unnecessarily-complicated technical, social, and financial reasons, this blog will be moving to a new home.</p>
<p>The URL will be the same, so you shouldn&#8217;t notice anything change.Â  If you read by RSS you may notice the feed refreshing and the DNS changes will take a while to propagate.</p>
<p>The new site may also have broken links, images and files &#8211; let me know if you spot anything wrong.</p>
<p>See you over there!</p>
<p>[P.S. If you can see THIS paragraph, then you&#8217;re already reading from the new location&#8230;I believe that if I was ten years younger I would, at this point, say &#8220;Woot!&#8221;]</p>
