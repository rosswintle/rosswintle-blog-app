<p>One of my <a title="Car Park and Council Cash" href="https://rosswintle.uk/2009/10/29/car-parks-and-council-cash/" target="_self">recent criticisms</a> was of the council, who, despite being cash strapped, have thrown a load of money at cheap parking in the town centre.  Not a great way to become &#8216;the UK&#8217;s number one sustainable community&#8217; &#8211; w<span style="background-color:#ffffff;">e should be incentivising people to get out of their cars and onto public transport, their feet, or their bicycles.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">But up to the plate steps <a title="inSwindon" href="http://inSwindon.com/" target="_blank">inSwindon</a> &#8211; &#8216;a Business Improvement District (BID) company, in charge of managing the Town Centre&#8230;mainly financed by our members – the businesses based in the centre of Swindon&#8217;.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">Yes, while the council themselves are making it cheaper to drive into town, the local business in the town centre have teamed up with our local transport companies to provide<a title="inSwindon Free Bus Travel at Christmas" href="http://inswindon.com/index.php/news/latest/147-free-bus-travel.html" target="_blank"> free bus travel</a> on the evenings of <a title="inSwindon Late Night Christmas Shopping" href="http://inswindon.com/index.php/christmas/late-night-thursdays.html" target="_blank">the four late-night Christmas shopping days</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">I&#8217;m sure that both incentives will be good for local business, but I&#8217;m baffled about why the local business are stumping up the cash for the option that&#8217;s better for the town.</span></p>
