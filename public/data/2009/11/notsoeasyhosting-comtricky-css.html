<p>But I&#8217;m currently running&#8230;err&#8230;at least 4 small web-based projects at the moment, so I decided to invest in some web hosting to get some prototype sites actually up onto the &#8216;net.  I&#8217;ll probably host this blog there eventually too, with all the benefits and flexibility that come with hosting your own WordPress install.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Reviews</strong></p>
<p>Now, I have another post in my head titled &#8220;How to do an Internet Review&#8221;; maybe that&#8217;s for another day, but the premise will be that internet reviews of anything are either by people who are so completely in awe of the product that it&#8217;s worth 5 stars, or people who&#8217;ve had a problem and therefore thing it&#8217;s the worst thing in the world and so worth zero stars and lots of use of the words &#8220;suck&#8221;, &#8220;sucks&#8221; and &#8220;sucky&#8221;.  Such reviews have made objectively choosing a host difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Hosting Requirements and Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>My requirements for a web host are basically that I need lots of php, domain name, and MySQL flexibility at low cost and, preferably, on a month-by-month contract while I try things out.  I can see the benefits of having limits on storage and data transfer &#8211; this will put off people who just want to waste server resources and probably make for a speedier service.</p>
<p>I also really wanted a UK-based host &#8211; because it would make for localised support and less trans-atlantic lag, while helping out the UK economy (a LITTLE!!)</p>
<p>With internet reviews being mostly very unhelpful I Tweeted for recommendations and was surprised to only get one.  But the company looked good, met the requirements and allowed me to sign up for a month at a time.</p>
<p><strong>DNS woes</strong></p>
<p>Once up and running I then had to delve into the world of DNS, subdomains, add-on domains, CNAMEs, MX records, virtual hosts, domain transfers, and&#8230;err&#8230;other stuff.  I know about all this, but it&#8217;s been a while since I practically did anything with it, so it took a bit of refreshing.  Plus, you&#8217;re playing with the real live internet when you&#8217;re doing this and I didn&#8217;t want people&#8217;s email and websites going off line, so I was doing things cautiously.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s worked out that I understand things better then the hosting company&#8217;s support team &#8211; who are quick but don&#8217;t seem to really read what I&#8217;ve asked of them and understand my problem.  It&#8217;s been difficult to convince them of what needs to happen, but I think we&#8217;re getting there.  Currently the host does NEARLY all that I need it to, but not quite.  If their support team can turn around adding me a new domain that&#8217;s hosted with them but DNS-managed elsewhere then I&#8217;ll be happy.</p>
<p><strong>CSS complications</strong></p>
<p>With that all sorted I could turn to doing some web-page mock-ups for one of my apps.  I&#8217;ve moved on a bit from when I was <a title="Debugging the Borders" href="https://rosswintle.uk/2009/02/12/debugging-the-borders/" target="_self">Debugging the Borders</a>, but I still find CSS awkward to use.</p>
<p>When I was a software engineer we used to say that the engineering principles were the key skill and that languages were like tools.  What&#8217;s important for a woodworker is knowing how to build things out of wood.  What type of plane or screwdriver you use is almost irrelevant.  And to a well-trained software engineer a new language is like a new type of screwdriver, it&#8217;s a tool that you use to apply the engineering principles and can be learned and applied quickly.</p>
<p>However, as I previously wrote, HTML and CSS aren&#8217;t really programming languages and so don&#8217;t fit with an existing paradigm in my head.  It&#8217;s not just another type of screwdriver &#8211; it requires learning a new set of principles and practices.</p>
<p>In the past I&#8217;ve just applied what little CSS I know in a fairly unstructured fashion.  But what I really need to do is learn CSS from first principles and see it applied by others to get to grips with it.  I need to understand &#8220;non-replaced elements&#8221;, &#8220;block-level layouts&#8221; and &#8220;selectors&#8221; and how these, and other things, fit together in &#8220;the cascade&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the meantime, does anyone know how to left-align text in a centre-aligned box?</p>
