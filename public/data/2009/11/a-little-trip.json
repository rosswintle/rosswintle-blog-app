        "rendered": "<p>Had a trip to a big northern city this week which left me with some thoughts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bad Cyclist\/Good Cyclist Part 1<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On my walk to Swindon station I saw some pretty bad cycling:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>One kid in dark clothes weaving his way up a residential street unlit and showing no recognition of the three or four cars that were also on the road.<\/li>\n<li>Two cyclists committing the offence of riding on the pavement because the road was one-way and they wanted to go the other way.  One unlit, one highly visible.<\/li>\n<li>One high-vis female cyclist cycling up the inside of a queue of traffic, then switching through a tiny gap onto the outside and zooming off.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I can almost understand the young lad on the BMX.  He&#8217;s just a kid: young and reckless.  In some ways it&#8217;s good that he&#8217;s on a bike.  But does he know how dangerous it is to be unseen?<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>But what about the grown-ups in high-vis clothing and lycra doing dangerous and annoying stuff?  Yes, I confess, when I&#8217;m a driver lane splitting annoys me. And as a pedestrian, pavement-cycling annoys me.\u00a0 Perhaps they think that being hi-vis means they&#8217;re allowed to go wherever they like on the road because they&#8217;re safe, but being seen is complementary to being sensible, not a substitute for it.<\/p>\n<p>And what&#8217;s with the cycling on the pavement?  Do they think that because they can&#8217;t go on the road it&#8217;s OK to cycle on the pavement?<\/p>\n<p>Oooh, look, I&#8217;ve gone all <a title=\"The Lycra louts: MPs call for curbs on cyclists who put lives at risk\" href=\"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-1222067\/The-Lycra-louts-MPs-curbs-cyclists-lives-risk.html\" target=\"_blank\">Daily Mail<\/a>!!<\/p>\n<p>The point is that sometimes cyclists do themselves no favours at all.  They should remember that they&#8217;re small and hard to see.  They need to make their actions obvious and predictable to drivers, not behave erratically.  I work on the principle that if I want to be treated like a proper vehicle then I need to behave like one too.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Piracy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While we&#8217;re on the topic of otherwise-law-abiding-citizens exercising their &#8220;rights&#8221; regardless of whether or not it contravenes the law.  Why is it that pleasant, professional, grown-up people, think it&#8217;s OK and normal, if not highly amusing, to commit the crime of piracy?<\/p>\n<p>This week saw some people I know whingeing that their <a title=\"BBC NEWS | Technology | Microsoft disconnects Xbox gamers\" href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/8354166.stm\" target=\"_blank\">X-Boxes got locked out of X-Box live<\/a> because they&#8217;d hacked them to play pirated games.  Of course, piracy is theft and they should think themselves lucky they&#8217;re not in court and quit moaning about it.<\/p>\n<p>Plenty of people who pirate films, TV programmes, music, and software in this country  can actually afford to buy DVDs, CDs, MP3s, etc.  I&#8217;ve been offered stuff in the past and I&#8217;ve really wanted to tell the offere that I don&#8217;t want it because it&#8217;s illegal, but I feel like I&#8217;ll be laughed at, so I just make excuses about not wanting the content.<\/p>\n<p>Why do people do this?\u00a0 Just because you CAN file share, hack your console and pass around sound and video files everyone thinks it&#8217;s a perfectly acceptable thing to do.  Well, it&#8217;s not.\u00a0 They wouldn&#8217;t steal a media player from Currys so why do they steal the media that goes on it?<\/p>\n<p>I feel like the rebel for obeying the law.\u00a0 That&#8217;s not right is it?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bad Cyclist\/Good Cyclist Part 2<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Northern cities are cool places.  My train back was delayed, but it was kinda good to hang out in the station for a bit. In some ways the station environment is full of annoying, rapidly repeating stuff intended for the hurried traveller, but in other ways a busy station is a great place to observe human behaviour and fashion.<\/p>\n<p>There were lots of people on bikes in the city and a lot of them were using the station.  I was particularly eyeing up two customised fixed-wheel bikes.  Unbranded, black, sleek, simple city bikes.  They looked sharp, fast, elegant.  Bike envy?  I don&#8217;t know what you mean.<\/p>\n<p>There was also a short, fat guy in an orange suit.  I&#8217;m not sure that counted as fashion, but he seemed to be expressing the spirit and freedom that seems to be present in big northern cities.\u00a0 I was reminded recently that &#8220;Zeitgeist&#8221; means &#8220;Spirit of the Times&#8221; &#8211; literally &#8220;Time Ghost&#8221;.\u00a0 Perhaps the Germans would call my experience up North one of Platzgeist?<\/p>\n",
