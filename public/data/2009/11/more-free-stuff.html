Yes, not just free buses, but lots of other good free stuff too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing with <a title="DropBox" href="http://dropbox.com" target="_blank">DropBox</a>, which is a really useful and well-implemented tool for synchronising files across computers and sharing them with others.</p>
<p><a title="photoshop.com mobile app for iPhone and iPod Touch" href="http://mobile.photoshop.com/iphone/" target="_blank">Photoshop.com&#8217;s mobile app for iPhone/iPod Touch</a> finally became available in the UK iTunes App Store &#8211; I&#8217;m sure there are other apps for doing quick photo edits, but this is the only one I&#8217;ve seen and it seems good.  I hadn&#8217;t even realised that Photoshop.com existed either, so I&#8217;ve been playing with that too.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the best of all&#8230;free trees!  We&#8217;re getting involved with the BBC&#8217;s <a title="Tree oClock" href="http://bit.ly/treeoclock" target="_blank">Tree o&#8217;Clock</a> record-breaking tree planting attempt on December 5th.  The Great Western Community Forest are planting a load of trees on some land between Swindon and Wroughton, but you can plant your own individual tree as part of the effort too, and <a title="Tree oClock Tree Giveaway" href="http://bit.ly/freetree" target="_blank">they&#8217;re giving them away</a>!</p>
