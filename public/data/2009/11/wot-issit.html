<p>Just found these photos on the camera.  This weird stuff was stuck to our washing line in, probably, mid-autumn.  It appears to be organic, was hard, but could be squashed and oozed slightly when you did.</p>
<p>I can only think it&#8217;s some kind of eggs, but of what creature?  What lays it eggs in such neat lines completely around the supporting structure.  I&#8217;m guessing something thought our washing line was a bit of plant.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
