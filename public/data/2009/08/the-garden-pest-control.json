though it should be pointed out that those we have seen have been HUGE!<\/p>\n<h3>Ants<\/h3>\n<p>We did have some ants last year, but they&#8217;ve multiplied in a big way this year, nesting on the veg patch and munching our lettuce roots as well as causing plenty of lumps on the lawn.<\/p>\n<p>Again, there are Nematodes for these and we&#8217;ve used them with slightly limited success. \u00a0Other strategies of little bait stations and boiling water have helped too, but no one strategy seems to work completely.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps experience will help us out next year.<\/p>\n<p>For now I take some hope in the fact that we have had &#8220;flying ant day&#8221; this year &#8211; or maybe that&#8217;s to come.<\/p>\n<h3>Caterpillars<\/h3>\n<p>Again, not something that was a problem last year, the caterpillars have been probably the worst pest this year. \u00a0Possibly our planting of brassicas (cabbages and broccoli) this year initiated the problem.<\/p>\n<p>It started with small holes nibbled, which led to us finding some small, bright green critters crawling on the underside of leaves.<\/p>\n<p>There is no real defence (except, maybe, attracing as many birds as you can to get them eaten), so we started daily checks and squashings. \u00a0Though it seemed that the more we squashed the more there were. \u00a0We just couldn&#8217;t get rid of them.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_499\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-499\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/dsc00264.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-499\" title=\"Caterpillars\" src=\"http:\/\/magicroundabout.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/07\/dsc00264.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"The Very Hungry Caterpillars\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/dsc00264.jpg 1632w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/dsc00264-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/07\/dsc00264-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-499\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Very Hungry Caterpillars<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Then they start growing and so squashing starts to get on your conscience. \u00a0Killing a large and very squishy caterpillar seems cruel in comparison to the smaller loss of a tiny baby thing. \u00a0The larger ones also seemed to migrate to from the red cabbages to the green broccoli where they were better camoflagued, but then they got brave too and started crawling on the tops of the leaves.<\/p>\n<p>They infested the cabbage hearts and made a huge yucky mess (they seem to make a LOT of poo or something greeny-browny and sludgy).<\/p>\n<p>Yes, these things do turn into beautiful butterflies, but the larval stage of this creature has annoyed us no end.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really remember seeing lots of butterflies &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s one of those things that you only notice once you care about it &#8211; but there&#8217;s been huge numbers of cabbage whites flapping around this year. \u00a0My hopes for less of these things next year are not high.<\/p>\n<h3>Cinquefoil and bindweed<\/h3>\n<p>Already mentioned&#8230;not all of the pests in our garden are animal in nature. \u00a0Fortunately the cinquefoil and bindweed were mostly eradicated from the veg patch when we dug it over and pulled all of the deep roots out. \u00a0There&#8217;s some around the edges but it&#8217;s easy enough to control. \u00a0The same goes for the borders, so it&#8217;s only really the lawn that it&#8217;s tricky to remove it from.<\/p>\n<h3>Next Year?<\/h3>\n<p>This year we&#8217;ve had some new critters: caterpillars and bindweed in particular. \u00a0As we make our garden more suitable for growing, it also seems to become more suitable for some pests.<\/p>\n<p>Next year we hope to see even more growing. \u00a0I desperately hope that that the numbers of our enemies shalln&#8217;t be going the same way.<\/p>\n",
