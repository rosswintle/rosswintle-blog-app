Was this weather related? Part of some natural cycle? Or because we used nematodes?\u00a0 No idea.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s use nematodes again next year and see what happens.<\/p>\n<p>Caterpillars were the new arch enemy and we must find a way to control those on the brassicas and raspberries next year.<\/p>\n<p>The lawn was infested with ants.\u00a0 There are nematodes for ants which we tried but this needs to be planned well in advance really and I wasn&#8217;t sure how effective it really was.\u00a0 Hot water also seemed to do the trick.\u00a0 We didn&#8217;t really have a flying ant day this year, which was weird.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Weeds<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We seem to be getting the Creeping Cinquefoil under control, though I continue to be concerned by its presence in the lawn.\u00a0 Bindweed was new but seemed to be contained and limited in its reach &#8211; so far.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Diseases<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Blight continued to be a problem.\u00a0 It kicked in later on the spuds but did kick in, and got a lot of the tomatoes too.<\/p>\n<p>We also had white rot on onions, which is a more serious issue and very hard to get rid of from the soil.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Good Crops<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Potatoes, chard, perpetual spinach, bulb fennel, cabbages (despite the caterpillars), french beans, sugar snap peas, onions and shallots all did particularly well.\u00a0 We loved the taste of flashy butter oak lettuce, and were overwhelmed with the never ending supply of courgettes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bad Crops<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Carrots and parsnips struggled and we got nothing (again) from any of our squash plants.\u00a0 Squashes have been in pots so far so we&#8217;ll try them in the ground next year.\u00a0 Tomatoes succumbed to blight and didn&#8217;t really ripen.\u00a0 Lettuce was hit and miss.\u00a0 We tried to grow calabrese from seed but the seedlings were demolished one night be slugs.\u00a0 Grrr.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Next Year<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One more bed to dig and we have a full complement of 4.5 beds.\u00a0 There will be some rotation and re-stocking on seeds, but generally it&#8217;s looking in pretty good shape.\u00a0 We looke forward to using what we&#8217;ve learned this year to make next year even better!<\/p>\n",
