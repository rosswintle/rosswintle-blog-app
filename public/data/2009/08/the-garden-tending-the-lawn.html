<p>Actually, it&#8217;s probably not just our lawn&#8217;s fault, it&#8217;s a combination of the weather and our lifestyle.  You see, lawns don&#8217;t just need attention, they need it at very specific times. This has been a real problem lately.  I&#8217;ve needed a couple of dry days for it to dry out before mowing, then I need to treat it (it&#8217;s the only thing we use chemicals on, and it needs it), then I need some rain to water in the treatment.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve not even had the couple of dry days lately!  So it got quite long, which meant it takes longer to dry and takes more effort to cut.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>But cutting it&#8217;s not the only problem.  See, we have creeping weeds and they&#8217;re creeping, increasingly, into the centre of the lawn area.  Normally we&#8217;d dig the cinquefoil up by the roots, but you can&#8217;t do that in the lawn!</p>

<p>And then there&#8217;s the ants, which make big grassless lumps in the middle of the lawn, and then they make more ants.  And then there&#8217;s bindweed, which is starting to creep in amongst the creeping cinqefoil.</p>
<p>And then, just when I do get to do the mowing, what&#8217;s creeping amoungst the longer grasses but a slow worm.  A protected, legless lizard that lives for up to 50 years!  And so I chopped half through it with the strimmer.</p>
<p>Yeah, having a lawn isn&#8217;t so easy sometimes.</p>
