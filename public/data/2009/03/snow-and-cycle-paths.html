<p>First of all I&#8217;d like to announce my frustration at the lack of gritting on the cycle paths of Swindon.  The roads were gritted up to the max and pretty much clear most of the time.  But I didn&#8217;t dare go near the cycle routes because it was just too dangerous.</p>
<p>I emailed the local council, asking why this wasn&#8217;t done and pointing out the particular bit of cycle path that I wanted gritted (this is a busy route used by both cyclists and pedestrains), but to no avail &#8211; even when I chased them up.</p>
<p>Eventually, just as the snow and ice was melting away, there was some grit!</p>

<p>But, sadly, though they managed to grit the slope and the bridge, they neglected the flat bits of the path, which remained treacherous.</p>

<p>I understand that the roads are key infrastructure for our town, and that it&#8217;s important to keep safe.  But one thing that really must happen if more people are to take up cycling, is that these paths need some attention in Winter.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a cycle campaigning point for later in the year!</p>
