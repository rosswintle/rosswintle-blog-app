<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Contemplating my existence</h1></header><main><p>I&#8217;ve been contemplating my presence on Twitter for a while and I&#8217;m at quite an odd juncture with it as, all of a sudden, more people that I know in real life are joining.   I&#8217;ll try to be brief with my thoughts but I think this will turn into a bit of an essay.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2008/02/01/taking-up-twittering-as-facebook-flops/">joined Twitter</a> just over a year ago and when I did so my feeling was very much that Facebook had got too complicated and Twitter would represent a simpler way of keeping tabs on my real friends.</p>
<p>But no one else really joined and Facebook remined the de facto way to see what people were up to.</p>
<p>Twitter remained a minor interest at first, but over time my interest grew.  Factors that contributed to that growth of interest were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding more people with common interests (mostly other cyclists).</li>
<li>Use of <a href="http://search.twitter.com">Twitter&#8217;s search functionality</a>, which gives interesting ways of seeing what people are saying about a given topic.</li>
<li>Interesting uses, like when we had lots of snow and people started using Twitter with <a href="http://www.hashtags.org">Hashtags</a> (like <a href="http://hashtags.org/tag/uksnow">#uksnow</a>) and scripts and maps to do interesting things like track the snow in real time&#8230;</li>
<li>&#8230;or when GMail went down and Twitter became a great way to track what was going on with that and who it was affecting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Heck, even my wife claimed that &#8220;Twitter is useful after all&#8221; when I discovered I was following someone who worked for the Cyclists Touring Club (CTC) and who could help put me in touch with the Swindon Cycle Champion.  Hooray!</p>
<p>Now, I REALLY hope that this doesn&#8217;t offend anyone that I follow (please, debate in the comments below if you think I&#8217;m missing something), but, as time went on, these useful bits and bobs started to make up only a small portion of the stuff I read on Twitter.  Heck, if I&#8217;m honest, I wouldn&#8217;t follow myself &#8211; I&#8217;m far from interesting.</p>
<p>Please, followees, it&#8217;s not that you&#8217;re boring &#8211; far from it, that&#8217;s why I follow &#8211; but it&#8217;s hard to keep up with you all sometimes, and it&#8217;s becoming my opinion that the value that I get from it isn&#8217;t in proportion to the time I put into it.</p>
<p>Now, there is a part of me that thinks that I&#8217;m doing something wrong.  Perhaps there&#8217;s a Twitter client out there that will help me get more value? I mean, I only follow about 40 people and that&#8217;s too much.  Most people seem to have HUNDREDS!  And it baffles me how you would keep up with such numbers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this more deeply lately too, and I think there&#8217;s another problem.  The Social Web, Web 2.0, or whatever you want to call it, is becoming too self-referential.  What do I mean by that?  Well, so much stuff that&#8217;s on the web is about&#8230; the web.  Even I&#8217;m doing it.  Right now!!</p>
<p>People twitter about Twitter and blog about Blogs.  I even read blogs that tell me about useful tools for making my web presence more effective, or for being more efficient at doing stuff online.  Stuff that I wouldn&#8217;t need if I wasn&#8217;t online reading all these blogs&#8230;hmmm.</p>
<p>Yes, sometimes I&#8217;m  is useful and I&#8217;ve discovered lots of really interesting things through social networking, but I coped without all that stuff before and I have a sense that the web actually makes work for me, and then gives me ways to cope with the extra work.</p>
<p>It feels like the volume of &#8220;real stuff&#8221; being talked about on the internet is decreasing.  And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s interesting to me.</p>
<p>Does anyone else get this sense at all?</p>
<p>And so to the last few days &#8211; real friends are joining.  I was going to ask &#8220;Would Twitter with real friends be different?&#8221;, but it seems, I&#8217;m about to find out.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because I have a 9-5, full-time job and Twitter isn&#8217;t a great form of communication for someone like me.  Perhaps it&#8217;s more suited to self-employed, consultancy types, or people who&#8217;s job it is to work with web-based media.  I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>So, go on, convince me to stay!</p>
