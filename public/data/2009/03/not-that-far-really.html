<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Not that far really&#8230;</h1></header><main><p>After February&#8217;s rather poor cycle mileage (mostly due to the snow that I&#8217;ve not written about yet), and with some determination to make a habit of extended commutes and regular &#8220;training&#8221; rides, I&#8217;ve decided to set myself <a title="My Goal over at MyCyclingLog.com" href="http://www.mycyclinglog.com/goal_detail.php?gid=1923" target="_blank">a goal</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to try to cycle 300 miles during the month of March!!</p>
<p>On the one hand, this doesn&#8217;t seem like too much.  It&#8217;s a shade less than ten miles a day &#8211; and my standard commute is over 7 of those!  A few lunchtime rides here and there, some long rides home, and making sure I go out for 40 mins on Saturday and Sunday (or 80 mins on one weekend day).</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&#8217;ve never done more than 250 miles in a month &#8211; and that was in Bike Week in June!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made a good start with 35 miles in just 3 days (I didn&#8217;t cycle on the 1st).  But I suspect it will be hard to keep up.</p>
<h3>A touch of Spring</h3>
<p>Following on from the last post about spring, the weather has been a bit up and down, but today was beautiful for cycling and I grabbed a snap of part of my favourite 8.5 mile route.  Well worth going out of my way for, even if it was a few extra miles:</p>
