<p>I&#8217;ve been a pretty big fan of American, surf-rockers, Switchfoot, for a while now.  Talented songwriting (something I value highly in my music), great music, a variety of styles, and some reflections on politics and faith mixed in for good measure.  I&#8217;m not quite as much of a fan as one friend of mine who declared a gig in London &#8220;the most important event of the year&#8221; (or something similar), but they&#8217;re pretty high up my list.</p>
<p>Anyway, I somehow found out that their frontman, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jonforeman">Jon Foreman</a>, had somehow found time to do some solo stuff.  It seems he made 4 EP&#8217;s, one for each season, and then did a compilation of the best of them called &#8220;Limbs and Branches&#8221;, with a couple of new songs thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s not often I put a CD on and immediately declare that &#8220;I like it&#8221;.  But this is exactly what happened with L&amp;B.  It&#8217;s not even entirely my style &#8211; I like my rock a bit more upbeat.  But Foreman&#8217;s solo efforts show why he&#8217;s the frontman of a highly successful band that&#8217;s crossed from the obscurity of Christian rock, into the American Mainstream.</p>
<p>The songs are art; words and ideas crafted into musical poetry.  The execution is slick.  It&#8217;s well-produced, but not over-produced, retaining a slighly raw edge.  There&#8217;s even a guest appearance from Sarah Masen, who adds some handy female depth and variety to Foreman&#8217;s passionate vocals.</p>
<p>Songs are mostly quite downbeat and there&#8217;s tension and drama, but I find that Foreman, unlike other folk rockers, retains more of a hopeful edge.</p>
<p>Christian references are more prominent than with Switchfoot &#8211; the opening track is based on The Lord&#8217;s Prayer.  This may put some off.  But if you like some mellow, gritty, folk rock storytelling on your shelf, this deserves a look.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you ever wanted to buy me a pretty lavish gift, track down Foreman&#8217;s accoustic guitar, amp and any other kit he used to make this record &#8211; the instrument sings something quite beautiful!!!</p>
<p>Hey, I can dream!</p>
