<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Cycle consumerism</h1></header><main><p>Timmy B posted an excellent comment the other day on my <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2009/03/11/my-kind-of-cycling/">&#8220;My kind of Cycling&#8221;</a> post (thanks Tim!).  To avoid quoting him out of context here&#8217;s the full comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>As I said on Karl’s blog: I can put my hands up to being guilty of dismissing the “other” kinds of cyclists (MTBers, lycra-clad speed demons etc.). I have drunk the Copenhagen Kool-aid, for sure.</p>
<p>There’s definitely a sense of wanting to change the status quo, though; we have car dominance overall in the UK, but within cycling the emphasis in most bike marketing is on MTBs, lycra, lots and lots of *kit*.</p>
<p>I, like quite a few others, would love to see more cycling-as-transportation, for health and traffic congestion reasons. It’s the lack of mainstream emphasis on this that causes us to shout loud, I guess.</p>
<p>Keep on cycling, in whatever form <img decoding="async" class="wp-smiley" src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" /></p>
<p>“Anyone who rides a bike is a friend of mine” — Gary Fisher</p></blockquote>
<p>I like what Tim said and I agree wholeheartedly, but it triggered some more thoughts in my brain.</p>
<p>Now, occasionally I like to play devil&#8217;s advocate somewhat.  These aren&#8217;t ideas that are fully thought through, or even that I agree with, they are questions to stimulate further discussion.</p>
<p>We live in an age where pretty much everything&#8217;s commercialised; where, rightly or wrongly, &#8220;lots of *kit*&#8221; is the norm.  Here&#8217;s some thoughts then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Isn&#8217;t it <span style="text-decoration:underline;">good</span> that we have lots of cycling kit so that people who are gadget-lovers can get a hook into cycling?  Perhaps this is one of the reasons for the boom in mountain biking&#8230;it&#8217;s a chance to acquire more &#8220;cool stuff&#8221;?  A mountain bike appears to be a much greater status symbol than a road bike, a commuter, or a tourer, even though it may be less suited to everyday use.  Why is that?  Because it has more of a gadget factor?</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t we also want identity through our stuff?  As I think Karl&#8217;s post pointed out the other day, we tend to see differences rather than similarities.  But I also think we strive to be different &#8211; to fit in with a particular class or group.  Isn&#8217;t &#8220;a-to-b&#8221; cyclist, or &#8220;chic&#8221; cyclist just another form of cyclist with an associated set of behaviours and paraphernalia? And isn&#8217;t it, again, rightly or wrongly, a group that people are trying to fit themselves into to differentiate themselves from other types of cyclist?</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that the above might be true, what things would you design/invent to encourage more use of the bike as a means of transport.  What marketing might we do to elevate the status of the everyday city/commuter bike?  How do we get to a state where owning something like a <a href="http://www.pashley.co.uk/">Pashley</a> or, for that matter, any sort of bike with panniers and mudguards, is &#8220;mainstream&#8221; and &#8220;cool&#8221;? (I know we think it is, but do others?)</p>
<p>Of course, the aim is to get people cycling whatever their bike is like and whatever they might have in their wardrobe, but I can&#8217;t help thinking that fashion&#8230;&#8221;kit&#8221;&#8230;&#8221;stuff&#8221; helps us get there.</p>
<p>Imagine a Nike Bike.  Or an Apple iBike.  Or celebrity-endorsed cycles?  Hey, I&#8217;m not a marketer&#8230;you&#8217;re ideas are almost certainly better then mine.</p>
<p>Perhaps, in short, the bike needs rebranding?</p>
