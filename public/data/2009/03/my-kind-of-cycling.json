        "rendered": "<p>Well, if I didn&#8217;t offend any of my cycling\/Twitter buddies with my last post, then maybe this one will do it!<\/p>\n<p>Kidding&#8230;well, possibly. \u00a0I don&#8217;t like being controvertial but there&#8217;s a balance that I want to address. \u00a0My aim is simply to put forward a different &#8211; not better, or worse, just different &#8211; point of view and, I hope, to try to get some of us cyclists united, despite our differences.<\/p>\n<p>You see most of the cyclists I seem to have come across online seem to be of the slow, chic, stylish cycling persuasion. \u00a0They promote cycling as a means of getting from A-to-B and they want to help you do it with the minimum of fuss&#8230;and definitely with the minimum of lycra!<\/p>\n<p>And this is a goal which I fully support. \u00a0People should be able to see cycling as a valid means of transport, and if my own cycle campaigning attempts (when they get underway) \u00a0are ever to be effective, I&#8217;ll need to be seen as someone who can hop on a bike at a moment&#8217;s notice and go somewhere, without any fuss.<\/p>\n<p>I DO cycle in my jeans and jumper (note: I probably don&#8217;t look cool but that&#8217;s more to do with my general lack of dress sense). \u00a0I do have a heavy, upright, hybrid bike with paniers that I can use as a workhorse for transport.<\/p>\n<p>But, I&#8217;m a sports cyclist too. I like to cycle fast. \u00a0I also have a light, sprightly bike with drop bars and low rolling resistance so that I can be efficient. \u00a0I like to get my heart pounding as I pull myself up a steep hill. \u00a0I track my rides, set goals, and go out riding purely for the hell of it.<\/p>\n<p>Darn it, I&#8217;m a lycra lout!<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t see being a sports cyclist and an &#8220;a-to-b&#8221; cyclist as being conflicting or contradictory. \u00a0I think they complement each other well. \u00a0The fitness I gain from being sporty makes getting from a-to-b easier!<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve read some stuff lately that&#8217;s made me feel like I&#8217;m inferior for being a sports cyclist. \u00a0Some of the cycle-chic crowd seem to frown upon light bikes with many gears, but when I got my road bike the acceleration and responsiveness were two of the things I quickly grew to love.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also concerned about the bike fashions being promoted. \u00a0Riding around in your everyday garb is fine&#8230;until it gets dark&#8230;or foggy&#8230;or it rains.<\/p>\n<p>A few years back, I nearly crashed my car into a cyclist, side on, who was traversing a roundabout at night, with no lights, wearing dark clothes. \u00a0Ever since, my primary goal when dressing for cycling isn&#8217;t to look cool, but it&#8217;s to be seen! \u00a0And my secondary goal is to be comfortable.<\/p>\n<p>This is possibly less of a problem on the continent. They don&#8217;t have the English weather to contend with, and their better cycling infrastructure makes it much safer to ride at night.<\/p>\n<p>I confess, I love all the Copenhagen and Amsterdam stuff. \u00a0It&#8217;s brilliant, and it&#8217;s great for showing people what everyday cycling could be like. \u00a0I love that cycling can actually have universal appeal. \u00a0And I will use the valuable resources that are onlinefor showcasing cycling chic because they are incredibly cool.<\/p>\n<p>And I also confess that there are probably road cyclists out there who turn thir noses up at people with big, heavy, practical, cool-looking bikes &#8211; I hope you won&#8217;t count me among them.<\/p>\n<p>But for the sake of appearing united as cyclists, I&#8217;d like to see a little more respect for those of us that like to get a bit of speed and sweat on. \u00a0Sometimes we&#8217;re just trying to get from A-to-B too!<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, even, the roadies and the cycle-chic crowd could get together and gang up on the really silly cyclists&#8230;the mountain bikers!!! \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n",
