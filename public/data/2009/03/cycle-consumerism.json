I have drunk the Copenhagen Kool-aid, for sure.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s definitely a sense of wanting to change the status quo, though; we have car dominance overall in the UK, but within cycling the emphasis in most bike marketing is on MTBs, lycra, lots and lots of *kit*.<\/p>\n<p>I, like quite a few others, would love to see more cycling-as-transportation, for health and traffic congestion reasons. It\u2019s the lack of mainstream emphasis on this that causes us to shout loud, I guess.<\/p>\n<p>Keep on cycling, in whatever form <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http:\/\/s.wordpress.com\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnyone who rides a bike is a friend of mine\u201d \u2014 Gary Fisher<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I like what Tim said and I agree wholeheartedly, but it triggered some more thoughts in my brain.<\/p>\n<p>Now, occasionally I like to play devil&#8217;s advocate somewhat.\u00a0 These aren&#8217;t ideas that are fully thought through, or even that I agree with, they are questions to stimulate further discussion.<\/p>\n<p>We live in an age where pretty much everything&#8217;s commercialised; where, rightly or wrongly, &#8220;lots of *kit*&#8221; is the norm.\u00a0 Here&#8217;s some thoughts then:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Isn&#8217;t it <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">good<\/span> that we have lots of cycling kit so that people who are gadget-lovers can get a hook into cycling?\u00a0 Perhaps this is one of the reasons for the boom in mountain biking&#8230;it&#8217;s a chance to acquire more &#8220;cool stuff&#8221;?\u00a0 A mountain bike appears to be a much greater status symbol than a road bike, a commuter, or a tourer, even though it may be less suited to everyday use.\u00a0 Why is that?\u00a0 Because it has more of a gadget factor?<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t we also want identity through our stuff?\u00a0 As I think Karl&#8217;s post pointed out the other day, we tend to see differences rather than similarities.\u00a0 But I also think we strive to be different &#8211; to fit in with a particular class or group.\u00a0 Isn&#8217;t &#8220;a-to-b&#8221; cyclist, or &#8220;chic&#8221; cyclist just another form of cyclist with an associated set of behaviours and paraphernalia? And isn&#8217;t it, again, rightly or wrongly, a group that people are trying to fit themselves into to differentiate themselves from other types of cyclist?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Given that the above might be true, what things would you design\/invent to encourage more use of the bike as a means of transport.\u00a0 What marketing might we do to elevate the status of the everyday city\/commuter bike?\u00a0 How do we get to a state where owning something like a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pashley.co.uk\/\">Pashley<\/a> or, for that matter, any sort of bike with panniers and mudguards, is &#8220;mainstream&#8221; and &#8220;cool&#8221;? (I know we think it is, but do others?)<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the aim is to get people cycling whatever their bike is like and whatever they might have in their wardrobe, but I can&#8217;t help thinking that fashion&#8230;&#8221;kit&#8221;&#8230;&#8221;stuff&#8221; helps us get there.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine a Nike Bike.\u00a0 Or an Apple iBike.\u00a0 Or celebrity-endorsed cycles?\u00a0 Hey, I&#8217;m not a marketer&#8230;you&#8217;re ideas are almost certainly better then mine.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, in short, the bike needs rebranding?<\/p>\n",
