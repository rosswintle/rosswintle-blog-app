I&#8217;ve left out much detail but if you think any of what I&#8217;ve said is inappropriate then let me know and I&#8217;ll remove it.]</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s Been on My Mind</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to write about cycle helmets for ages but recent events have brought to the fore my want to share what I think.</p>
<p>A friend of mine was knocked off his bike and landed on his head, crushing a vertebrae.  His helmet was severely damaged &#8211; his skull was intact.</p>
<p>This has obviously made me think hard about cycling and helmet-wearing and I&#8217;ve been trying to crystallise my thoughts.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m obviously a keen cyclist, and I read lots on the internet, Twitter, and other people&#8217;s blogs, about:</p>
<ul>
<li>pros and cons of wearing a helmet;</li>
<li>pros and cons of helmet legislation;</li>
<li>anecdotes about helmet wearing/not-wearing;</li>
<li>pros and cons of websites/blogs/people that talk about the pros and cons of wearing a helmet;</li>
</ul>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p>For those who don&#8217;t move in cycling circles, the safety benefits of cycle helmets are far from proven and they may even make injuries from an accident WORSE!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all explained, far better than I could ever explain it, on the <a title="CycleHelmets.org" href="http://www.cyclehelmets.org/" target="_blank">Cycle Helmets Site</a>.</p>
<h3>Lidlessness</h3>
<p>Anyway, other people seem to get very passionate about helmet wearing.  Most people, and cycling organisations, I&#8217;ve come across are &#8220;pro-helmet-choice&#8221;, or &#8220;anti-helmet-legislation&#8221;.  They are keen to educate people about the myth that a helmet makes you safer.</p>
<p>What strikes me is that the balance seems to be a bit out.  People who are pro-helmet-choice come across as being anti-helmet, even though some of them wear helmets.  Some of what I read also paints those who don&#8217;t know about the inconclusive bike helmet science as being a bit daft.</p>
<p>This annoys me somewhat as I used to be someone who thought that a helmet was obviously going to help protect you in a fall and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s stupid to think that way.</p>
<h3>Out with it!</h3>
<p>So, where am I at with the whole cycle helmet thing?  Well:</p>
<ol>
<li>I instinctively feel that I SHOULD wear one.  The thought of my head hitting tarmac at speed doesn&#8217;t fill me with joyous expectation.  I&#8217;d like my head to be protected.</li>
<li>I read the current science and research as being inconclusive.  I&#8217;ve not read it all in depth, but it seems to say that if I fall one way a helmet will protect me, and if I fall another way, a helmet will make my injuries worse.  There appears to be no right or wrong.</li>
<li>So&#8230;I wear a helmet for all my cycling.</li>
<li>I am &#8220;pro-helmet-choice&#8221; &#8211; I am against making cycle helmet wearing compulsory as I believe that this would put people off cycling (this seems to be fairly well proven by statistics).</li>
<li>I am very much pro-cycling.  The benefits of cycling far outweigh the risks, and the risks clearly decrease as more people cycle.  (See <a title="CTC's Safety in Numbers Campaign" href="http://www.ctc.org.uk/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=5225" target="_blank">CTC&#8217;s Safety in Numbers report</a>)</li>
<li>I&#8217;m also pro- other cycle safety measures: training people to ride on the road; better cycle infrastructure; use of lights, colours and reflectives to make sure you&#8217;re seen; and riding confidently and learning to anticipate driver movements.  How&#8217;s about we reduce the risk of falling or being hit in the first place?</li>
</ol>
<p>There are other aspects of this discussion, that I actually don&#8217;t feel I can answer, or even that they&#8217;re particularly important, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I ride more dangerously, and take more risks because I&#8217;m wearing a helmet?</li>
<li>Do vehicle drivers give me less room because I wear a helmet&#8230;and lycra&#8230;and reflectives!?!</li>
<li>Are there better solutions to protecting your head whilst on a bike?  Is there a different helmet design that could be used?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recent Events</h3>
<p>What happened to my friend has really brought home the whole cycling safety and helmets issue.  I no longer have just statistics, studies and reports, I have a real person, that I know, who has had a week in hospital, is wearing a brace, and who will have 6 to 8 weeks of not being able to do much at all, and probably a lengthly period of recouperation after that.</p>
<p>The studies say that wearing a helmet may increase the damage done in a nasty accident.  But it may also save your life.</p>
<p>My common sense says that in a minor accident my head will probably be better off with a helmet.</p>
<p>And my personal experience is of a person who seems to have been spared injury because of a helmet.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that people have information and make a choice about helmet wearing.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that we offer people training on cycling on the road, build decent cycle lanes and infrastructure, and encourage more people onto bikes.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that we all, when driving vehicles, give room to cyclists and take extra care to look out for them. And DON&#8217;T pass them at any sort of junction&#8230;especially a roundabout!</p>
<p>In the meantime, I pray for my friend and his family, and I continue to wear my polystyrene &#8220;lid&#8221;.</p>
<p>What do you think?  Would the inconclusive facts change your mind about helmets? Would the experience of my friend change your opinion?  Or would it reinforce your existing opinion?</p>
