<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Cycling Incidents Part 2</h1></header><main><p>Yes, sometimes, I confess, I&#8217;m in the wrong as a cyclist.  I&#8217;m human, I&#8217;m imperfect, I mess up.  I hope that you&#8217;ll welcome me with open arms to your society.</p>
<p>But sometimes, I&#8217;m just pootling along, and someone comes along and does something crazy.<!--more--></p>
<p>In fact, there tends to be days when this happens a lot.  In my head I&#8217;m usually thinking &#8220;Is it National &#8216;Drive like a looney and don&#8217;t indicate&#8217; Day??&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m quite placid, so bad driving rarely drives me to anger.  There have been about four occasions when I&#8217;ve wanted to chase someone down and explain how dangerous what they just did was.  Twice with buses &#8211; in a place where there&#8217;s a bus lane too!</p>
<p>Sadly, I&#8217;ve never been quick enough.</p>
<p>And tonight was no exception.  Cycling home, on a normal road, doing a reasonable speed, I&#8217;m suddenly blown away by a huge orange vehicle overtaking me at speed, and leaving me very little room whatsoever.  It&#8217;s hard to say because you never remember accurately thing from the heat of the moment, but I reckon that if I&#8217;d have swerved in the draft from the vehicle I&#8217;d have been off.</p>
<p>My immediate reaction was to slow and curse, to get my bearings.  But I quite quickly made my mind up to give chase.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t make it.  But the vehicle was quite distinctive.  It was the mobile library!</p>
<p>I went mobile-library hunting, assuming that it had gone to park up at the West Swindon library, but couldn&#8217;t find it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written a letter.  I hope it was polite and educational.  I suspect it was a lapse of concentration or just a rush to get home, but it could, with another few inches, have been my life.  You should always give lots of room to a cyclist.  If you&#8217;re driving a BIG vehicle, you should be even more careful!!!</p>
<p>Earlier today I was in a meeting with someone from the council about Travel Plans (that&#8217;ll be in another post).  I would like to think that the council would be setting the standard for road safety, and I hope that my input will be taken seriously and positively.</p>
