        "rendered": "<p>[Prologue: At least one regular reader will know who&#8217;s involved in what I&#8217;m about to write. I&#8217;ve left out much detail but if you think any of what I&#8217;ve said is inappropriate then let me know and I&#8217;ll remove it.]<\/p>\n<h3>It&#8217;s Been on My Mind<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to write about cycle helmets for ages but recent events have brought to the fore my want to share what I think.<\/p>\n<p>A friend of mine was knocked off his bike and landed on his head, crushing a vertebrae.\u00a0 His helmet was severely damaged &#8211; his skull was intact.<\/p>\n<p>This has obviously made me think hard about cycling and helmet-wearing and I&#8217;ve been trying to crystallise my thoughts.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Background<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m obviously a keen cyclist, and I read lots on the internet, Twitter, and other people&#8217;s blogs, about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>pros and cons of wearing a helmet;<\/li>\n<li>pros and cons of helmet legislation;<\/li>\n<li>anecdotes about helmet wearing\/not-wearing;<\/li>\n<li>pros and cons of websites\/blogs\/people that talk about the pros and cons of wearing a helmet;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You get the idea.<\/p>\n<p>For those who don&#8217;t move in cycling circles, the safety benefits of cycle helmets are far from proven and they may even make injuries from an accident WORSE!<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all explained, far better than I could ever explain it, on the <a title=\"CycleHelmets.org\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cyclehelmets.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Cycle Helmets Site<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Lidlessness<\/h3>\n<p>Anyway, other people seem to get very passionate about helmet wearing. \u00a0Most people, and cycling organisations, I&#8217;ve come across are &#8220;pro-helmet-choice&#8221;, or &#8220;anti-helmet-legislation&#8221;. \u00a0They are keen to educate people about the myth that a helmet makes you safer.<\/p>\n<p>What strikes me is that the balance seems to be a bit out.\u00a0 People who are pro-helmet-choice come across as being anti-helmet, even though some of them wear helmets.\u00a0 Some of what I read also paints those who don&#8217;t know about the inconclusive bike helmet science as being a bit daft.<\/p>\n<p>This annoys me somewhat as I used to be someone who thought that a helmet was obviously going to help protect you in a fall and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s stupid to think that way.<\/p>\n<h3>Out with it!<\/h3>\n<p>So, where am I at with the whole cycle helmet thing?\u00a0 Well:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I instinctively feel that I SHOULD wear one.\u00a0 The thought of my head hitting tarmac at speed doesn&#8217;t fill me with joyous expectation.\u00a0 I&#8217;d like my head to be protected.<\/li>\n<li>I read the current science and research as being inconclusive.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve not read it all in depth, but it seems to say that if I fall one way a helmet will protect me, and if I fall another way, a helmet will make my injuries worse.\u00a0 There appears to be no right or wrong.<\/li>\n<li>So&#8230;I wear a helmet for all my cycling.<\/li>\n<li>I am &#8220;pro-helmet-choice&#8221; &#8211; I am against making cycle helmet wearing compulsory as I believe that this would put people off cycling (this seems to be fairly well proven by statistics).<\/li>\n<li>I am very much pro-cycling.\u00a0 The benefits of cycling far outweigh the risks, and the risks clearly decrease as more people cycle.\u00a0 (See <a title=\"CTC's Safety in Numbers Campaign\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ctc.org.uk\/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=5225\" target=\"_blank\">CTC&#8217;s Safety in Numbers report<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>I&#8217;m also pro- other cycle safety measures: training people to ride on the road; better cycle infrastructure; use of lights, colours and reflectives to make sure you&#8217;re seen; and riding confidently and learning to anticipate driver movements.\u00a0 How&#8217;s about we reduce the risk of falling or being hit in the first place?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>There are other aspects of this discussion, that I actually don&#8217;t feel I can answer, or even that they&#8217;re particularly important, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do I ride more dangerously, and take more risks because I&#8217;m wearing a helmet?<\/li>\n<li>Do vehicle drivers give me less room because I wear a helmet&#8230;and lycra&#8230;and reflectives!?!<\/li>\n<li>Are there better solutions to protecting your head whilst on a bike?\u00a0 Is there a different helmet design that could be used?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Recent Events<\/h3>\n<p>What happened to my friend has really brought home the whole cycling safety and helmets issue.\u00a0 I no longer have just statistics, studies and reports, I have a real person, that I know, who has had a week in hospital, is wearing a brace, and who will have 6 to 8 weeks of not being able to do much at all, and probably a lengthly period of recouperation after that.<\/p>\n<p>The studies say that wearing a helmet may increase the damage done in a nasty accident.\u00a0 But it may also save your life.<\/p>\n<p>My common sense says that in a minor accident my head will probably be better off with a helmet.<\/p>\n<p>And my personal experience is of a person who seems to have been spared injury because of a helmet.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that people have information and make a choice about helmet wearing.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that we offer people training on cycling on the road, build decent cycle lanes and infrastructure, and encourage more people onto bikes.<\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important that we all, when driving vehicles, give room to cyclists and take extra care to look out for them. And DON&#8217;T pass them at any sort of junction&#8230;especially a roundabout!<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, I pray for my friend and his family, and I continue to wear my polystyrene &#8220;lid&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>What do you think?\u00a0 Would the inconclusive facts change your mind about helmets? Would the experience of my friend change your opinion?\u00a0 Or would it reinforce your existing opinion?<\/p>\n",
