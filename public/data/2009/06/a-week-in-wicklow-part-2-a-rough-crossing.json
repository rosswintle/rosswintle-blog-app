        "rendered": "<h3>An Early Start<\/h3>\n<p>It was an early start on the first Saturday.  Holidays shouldn&#8217;t start so early, but as my sister said, it meant that we didn&#8217;t just spend the whole day travelling, and we got there with some hours to relax and find our way around before bedtime.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>We were crossing from Fishguard to Rosslare on the Ferry with our little car.  We toyed with doing Rail-Sail, which worked out pretty cheap, but by the time you&#8217;ve taken into account hiring a car at the other end and the inflexibility of having to carry all your luggage, the ferry wasn&#8217;t too bad in terms of value.<\/p>\n<h3>On and on<\/h3>\n<p>The M4 goes on much longer than I thought.  And Wales goes on much further than that!  I know that this is a generalisation, but people drive crazy in Wales &#8211; they go much faster than mandatory speed limits, even where these are explicitly for safety reasons.<\/p>\n<p>Traffic was very quiet so early in the morning and we arrived nice and early.  Ports aren&#8217;t great places to have to spend a couple of hours, but we waited around at Fishguard, enjoying a cuppa and a pastry, and passing the time with a game of cribbage (which we&#8217;ve recently discovered).<\/p>\n<h3>Food for thought<\/h3>\n<p>Eventually we got going.  The crossing &#8211; on the &#8220;express&#8221; ferry &#8211; was good (actually, in hindsight and with the experience of the crossing back, it wasn&#8217;t THAT good) but we both felt sea sick &#8211; which has never happened to me before.  At first we wondered if we were hungry, so we ordered some nice-looking pies, but nether of us could face eating more than half of it.  We resorted to standing on deck, and wishing it would be over quickly.<\/p>\n<p>We were on time into Rosslare.  We disembarked and had a quick and easy, journey to Blackditch &#8211; our home for the week &#8211; via the surprisingly-large town of Arklow.  The good old Irish supermarket &#8220;Supa Value&#8221; is still here but, further down the road was evidence that Tesco is taking over this country too.  Food is EXPENSIVE here &#8211; the weak pound contributes, but even so, the number of Euros we were paying was high!!!<\/p>\n<h3>Cottages and Games<\/h3>\n<p>Blackditch turned out to be less of a village and more an un-signed collection of houses.  We drove passed at first but eventually worked out where we needed to be and we were welcomed by our landlord for the week.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shamrockcottages.co.uk\/properties\/wicklow\/wicklow-1\/\">The cottage<\/a> we stayed in was lovely and the pictures on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shamrockcottages.co.uk\/\">Shamrock Cottages<\/a> website didn&#8217;t do it justice.  We were expecting much smaller bedrooms, but the whole place was much bigger than we expected.<\/p>\n<p>The weather was fine and we sat outside and had a restful afternoon.  The evening was spent playing my new, birthday-present card game, Munchkin: A possibly slightly over-complicated parody of fantasy role-playing games, which is fun but, we thing, more fun with 3 or more players.<\/p>\n<p>After an early morning we had an early night and were looking forward to exploring County Wicklow in the days to come.<\/p>\n",
