<p>The commute TO work was pretty treacherous with lots of black ice.  But I managed to stay &#8220;rubber side down&#8221; as they say.  It was also VERY cold and I was numb even through my winter SealSkins AND thermal inners.</p>
<p>Things had improved by evening time and, despite the darkness, I put in a fairly useful 9 urban miles or so.  And I felt pretty strong too!</p>
<p>You know, I might have said this a thousand times before but I just LOVE cycling.  I think I&#8217;m the sort of person that thrives on intense exercise, so that sways my opinion, but I feel so much better in so many ways for having put a few miles in.</p>
