It\u2019s pretty simple as I see it:<\/p>\n<p>1) There are bad (narrow) integrated cycle lanes. These are generally too narrow as to be dangerous (the car thinks that everything that\u2019s not the cycle lane is theirs).<br \/>\n2) There are integrated cycle lanes in silly places that cars are allowed to park in (wishing I had photos of Uxbridge Road in Shepherds Bush, London, to demonstrate this)<br \/>\n3) There are good integrated cycle lanes<br \/>\n4) There are (at least) two types of cyclist.<br \/>\na) those that can usefully and safely use segregated cycle lanes\/shared pedestrain paths &#8211; usually people who want to easily and safely get from A to B, or families on outings<br \/>\nb) those serious MTB\u2019ers or road bike riders who aren\u2019t going anywhere, but who want to ride fast and hard &#8211; it\u2019s usually not appropriate for these people (I include myself among them) to be on a segregated lane with other, slower, cyclists.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore:<br \/>\n&#8211; Integrated cycle lanes are good if they\u2019re well designed, which is not always the case; badly designed cycle lanes do treat cyclists badly.<br \/>\n&#8211; Segregated cycle lanes are good, but not for everyone<br \/>\n&#8211; Cyclists should be allowed to use or not use special cycle lanes as they see fit. If they choose not to use them it\u2019s at the risk of the cyclist.<\/p>\n<p>Is any of that debatable?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The response from the blog author goes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Looking at much of the provision we have, I\u2019d say no: local authorities <em>generally<\/em> go for option 1.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>To which I think:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Hah!  Agreed.  <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"http:\/\/karlmccracken.sweat365.com\/wp-includes\/images\/smilies\/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\"-)\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Many cycle lanes are token gestures to cyclists rather than being of any real benefit. My home town (Swindon) has some good segregated lanes shared with pedestrians, which I use on my daily commute, and some good shared bus lanes that let cyclists take some nice quiet shortcuts. But the on-road stuff may as well not be there.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe I\u2019ll try and get some photos &#8211; once the snow has gone and we can see the lines again.<\/p>\n<p>The debate, in my opinion, needs to be how we get from a state where cycling is for the minority and therefore funding is low, to a state where cycling is popular, and funding increases\u2026<\/p>\n<p>or possibly:<\/p>\n<p>from a state where funding is low and so cycling is for the minority, to a state where funding increases, raising popularity.<\/p>\n<p>Chicken?  Egg?<\/p>\n<p>Hmm\u2026<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There&#8217;s also some interesting <a title=\"cycle-related Bad Science\" href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/Kco1\">cycle-related &#8220;Bad Science&#8221;<\/a> in the Guardian today.<\/p>\n<p>As for me, I&#8217;ve not been on the bike this week due to the snow&#8230;but that&#8217;s a whole other story.<\/p>\n",
