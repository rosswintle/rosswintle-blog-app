<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Debugging the Borders</h1></header><main><p>Sadly, this is not a gardening post and has nothing to do with insects or plants&#8230;though you&#8217;d be forgiven for thinking it was.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually a learning-web-development skills post and one which is really just a rant to say &#8220;CCS&#8230;.what the?!&#8221;</p>
<p>See&#8230;for those of you that don&#8217;t know, the appearance of most of the web pages you see is controlled by little files called &#8220;cascading style sheets&#8221; &#8211; CSS for short. Â These little bits of code say things like:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">&#8220;That table has a 3 pixel border and a blue background&#8221;</p>
<p>and:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">&#8220;That text over there is green and bold and extra small&#8221;</p>
<p>or even:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">&#8220;That thing over there should be in a box 200 pixels wide, 100 tall, with a picture as a backgound and it should be offset by 50 pixels from the top of the page&#8221;</p>
<p>And it should be really simple, but you know what. Â I&#8217;ve written high-integrity, safety-critical software for aircraft. Â I wrote the basics of a Window-based GUI in Pascal when at college (well&#8230;sort of). Â I know languages that are procedural and functional, imperative and declarative. Â I&#8217;ve written everything from assembler to Prolog. Â I have a degree in computer science from a highly respectable university. Â (note: if you want to employ me then leave a comment and I&#8217;ll get back to you! ðŸ˜‰ )</p>
<p>But nothing&#8230;NOTHING I&#8217;ve ever come across is as unpredictable, complicated, difficult to get right, and downright confusing as this CSS stuff.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent quite a while now trying to work out how to get a table to look just like it should. Â I think the final solution was &#8220;border-collapse: collapse&#8221;, but man, it was tough to find.</p>
<p>I take my hat off to those web developers that actually understand this. Â Pray tell&#8230;how did you learn to write proper CSS-based web pages??? Â Self teaching doesn&#8217;t seem to be an option. Â Or do you have a good book?</p>
