<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Pre-cycle campaigning note</h1></header><main><p>I&#8217;m part way through writing a post about my thoughts on taking up cycle campaigning (whatever that might be), but some things have come up today that I want to note more immediately.</p>
<p>First off, <a title="link to post" href="http://bit.ly/1UKMeN">here&#8217;s a post</a> from a guy I&#8217;ve recently come across, which:</p>
<ul>
<li>contains some great cycling photos!</li>
<li>poses an interesting question about cycle lanes.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve commented with some of my own thoughts, copied here for reference:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Are dedicated bike lanes protecting you from cagers or treating cyclists as 2nd class road users?</em></p>
<p>I don’t really get why people debate this.  It’s pretty simple as I see it:</p>
<p>1) There are bad (narrow) integrated cycle lanes. These are generally too narrow as to be dangerous (the car thinks that everything that’s not the cycle lane is theirs).<br />
2) There are integrated cycle lanes in silly places that cars are allowed to park in (wishing I had photos of Uxbridge Road in Shepherds Bush, London, to demonstrate this)<br />
3) There are good integrated cycle lanes<br />
4) There are (at least) two types of cyclist.<br />
a) those that can usefully and safely use segregated cycle lanes/shared pedestrain paths &#8211; usually people who want to easily and safely get from A to B, or families on outings<br />
b) those serious MTB’ers or road bike riders who aren’t going anywhere, but who want to ride fast and hard &#8211; it’s usually not appropriate for these people (I include myself among them) to be on a segregated lane with other, slower, cyclists.</p>
<p>Therefore:<br />
&#8211; Integrated cycle lanes are good if they’re well designed, which is not always the case; badly designed cycle lanes do treat cyclists badly.<br />
&#8211; Segregated cycle lanes are good, but not for everyone<br />
&#8211; Cyclists should be allowed to use or not use special cycle lanes as they see fit. If they choose not to use them it’s at the risk of the cyclist.</p>
<p>Is any of that debatable?</p></blockquote>
<p>The response from the blog author goes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking at much of the provision we have, I’d say no: local authorities <em>generally</em> go for option 1.</p></blockquote>
<p>To which I think:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hah!  Agreed.  <img decoding="async" class="wp-smiley" src="http://karlmccracken.sweat365.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt="-)" /></p>
<p>Many cycle lanes are token gestures to cyclists rather than being of any real benefit. My home town (Swindon) has some good segregated lanes shared with pedestrians, which I use on my daily commute, and some good shared bus lanes that let cyclists take some nice quiet shortcuts. But the on-road stuff may as well not be there.</p>
<p>Maybe I’ll try and get some photos &#8211; once the snow has gone and we can see the lines again.</p>
<p>The debate, in my opinion, needs to be how we get from a state where cycling is for the minority and therefore funding is low, to a state where cycling is popular, and funding increases…</p>
<p>or possibly:</p>
<p>from a state where funding is low and so cycling is for the minority, to a state where funding increases, raising popularity.</p>
<p>Chicken?  Egg?</p>
<p>Hmm…</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s also some interesting <a title="cycle-related Bad Science" href="http://bit.ly/Kco1">cycle-related &#8220;Bad Science&#8221;</a> in the Guardian today.</p>
<p>As for me, I&#8217;ve not been on the bike this week due to the snow&#8230;but that&#8217;s a whole other story.</p>
