<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">The Dangers of Snow</h1></header><main><p>There&#8217;s been a few more hits and even a comment lately, which suggests new readers.  Hello!!!</p>
<p>I will, at some point write some &#8220;pages&#8221; that explain a bit about me and why this blog is here&#8230;watch this space.</p>
<p>In the meantime, one of the reasons I started writing stuff down was to track various health things that were going on.  Not really personal stuff&#8230;of course!  But, I guess this blog is really about things I&#8217;m learning.  The tag line contines to be true &#8220;Discovering new things in an old home&#8221;.  And so I&#8217;m slowly learning how to keep my body from failing under the various strains of things like stress and cycling.</p>
<p>Now, Sally, my wife, pointed out the other day that I&#8217;d not written anything about the huge amount of snow that we&#8217;ve had lately.  Truth is, I&#8217;m not that interested in it (though there is a post in my head about the cool ways that people have used the internet and social networking during the snow time).</p>
<p>But I have discovered one of the dangers of snow!  And it&#8217;s caused me an injury.</p>
<p>Some facts about the snow:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s made me stop exercising, not just cycling, but generally, I&#8217;ve been moving around less.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s getting quite dangerous to walk on round here.  Not that it&#8217;s hard-packed ice, it&#8217;s not nice, and as I drove (yeah, I&#8217;ve been driving to work&#8230;bad form I know!) out of my street this morning, people were choosing to walk on the well-gritted road rather than the pavement.</li>
<li>There have been <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3453039.stm">some articles in the press about clearing paths of snow</a>, but I quite like the idea of communities pulling together with their spades to clear the paths and make them safe to walk on.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, attempting to set a precedent, I went out with my spade on Sunday and cleared the path and two parking spaces outside our house.</p>
<p>Sadly, this sudden exertion seems to have brought on some back pain.</p>
<p>Actually, I think it&#8217;s a combination of doing nothing, sudden exertion, and then doing nothing again.  I actually spent most of Sunday afternoon slumped in a chair with the laptop typing out a huge long essay on &#8220;How to read the Bible&#8221; and I&#8217;m sure that did me no good either.  In fact, <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2009/01/10/coughing-my-way-into-the-new-year/">the last time I did my back in</a> I&#8217;d spent too much time slumped in comfy furniture.</p>
<p>My back is an on-and-off source of trouble.  I think I know what causes it and I have long periods of being pain free between minor incidents.  But I was thinking last night about the fact that I&#8217;m probably somewhere between a fifth and quarter of the way through my working life and if bad posture is occasionally a problem now, I really need to get it sorted out in the long term, or I&#8217;ll end up seizing up entirely!</p>
