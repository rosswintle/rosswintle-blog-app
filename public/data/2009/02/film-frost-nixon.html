<p>First off, the seats in Cineworld are rubbish and uncomfortable -must make a mental note to use the Empire instead.</p>
<p>As we took our uncomfortable seat we didn&#8217;t really know what to expect of the film either.  Sal&#8217;s much better at the history side of things than I am but we&#8217;re both a bit vague on Watergate and the Nixon (and post-Nixon) era.  So we were hoping the film was self explanatory.</p>
<p>Which it was! A fairly intense introduction gave you an idea of the events that lead up to Nixon&#8217;s resignation and you were set to be introduced to Frost.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what genre of film this was meant to be.  It&#8217;s part documentary, mostly drama, but you wonder how much is historical and how much has been made up to make it a good story.  The factual &#8220;whatever happened to&#8230;&#8221; bits at the end of the suggest it leans more towards fact than fiction, but it&#8217;s such a dramatic story that you are left wondering.</p>
<p>But given that I thought the film was excellent.  The 2 hours flew by and I was on the edge of my seat at times, and I was taken on a roller coaster of emotions as Frost&#8217;s plans, and the big interview, teeter on the edge.</p>
<p>It was well acted and scripted, though I felt there were some cheesy editorial moments.  There are some nice little touches that hold the film together &#8211; thankfully these are obvious enough  for a dunce like me to spot and engage with &#8211; though they were possibly a little too obvious.</p>
<p>The other little niggle was that I recognised some of the actors but really couldn&#8217;t place them.  I spent most of the film asking myself &#8220;What the heck has that guy been in?&#8221;</p>
<p>I should probably try and draw some moral point from the story.  But I can&#8217;t.  The characters are fantastic and the portrayal of Nixon was particularly fascinating.  I was left wondering if he was good or bad.  Clever, or too clever.  Had his power corrupted him beyond redemption?  Or did the interview change him for the better?</p>
<p>Well worth seeing!</p>
