<p>Another trip to the gym tonight.  The country has ground to a halt today with something like the most snow we&#8217;ve had for 18 years, so cycling was out, but a free evening gave us a chance to get some exercise in.</p>
<p>I continued my running, with another 5km on the treadmill.  Slightly slower than last time, but I was using gradients rather than just on the flat, so that&#8217;s OK, and I mostly felt fine afterwards.</p>
<p>But as soon as I stopped my left calf cramped up again.  It&#8217;s not as bad as <a title="Link to previous blog post about cramp" href="https://rosswintle.uk/2009/01/29/abort-abort/">last time</a>, but I suspect that the reason is the same &#8211; not hydrating myself enough.  Must get into the habit of drinking LOTS of water at work rather than just the odd coffee here and there.</p>
<p>Still, given the weather I won&#8217;t be cycling again for another couple of days, so maybe rest is on the cards.</p>
