        "rendered": "<p>We haven&#8217;t been ot the cinema for ages, so a free evening on Friday was a chance to use some free tickets we&#8217;d acquired.\u00a0 After a bit of debate and looking up times we headed to Cineworld to see Frost-Nixon.<\/p>\n<p>First off, the seats in Cineworld are rubbish and uncomfortable -must make a mental note to use the Empire instead.<\/p>\n<p>As we took our uncomfortable seat we didn&#8217;t really know what to expect of the film either.\u00a0 Sal&#8217;s much better at the history side of things than I am but we&#8217;re both a bit vague on Watergate and the Nixon (and post-Nixon) era.\u00a0 So we were hoping the film was self explanatory.<\/p>\n<p>Which it was! A fairly intense introduction gave you an idea of the events that lead up to Nixon&#8217;s resignation and you were set to be introduced to Frost.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what genre of film this was meant to be.\u00a0 It&#8217;s part documentary, mostly drama, but you wonder how much is historical and how much has been made up to make it a good story.\u00a0 The factual &#8220;whatever happened to&#8230;&#8221; bits at the end of the suggest it leans more towards fact than fiction, but it&#8217;s such a dramatic story that you are left wondering.<\/p>\n<p>But given that I thought the film was excellent.\u00a0 The 2 hours flew by and I was on the edge of my seat at times, and I was taken on a roller coaster of emotions as Frost&#8217;s plans, and the big interview, teeter on the edge.<\/p>\n<p>It was well acted and scripted, though I felt there were some cheesy editorial moments.\u00a0 There are some nice little touches that hold the film together &#8211; thankfully these are obvious enough\u00a0 for a dunce like me to spot and engage with &#8211; though they were possibly a little too obvious.<\/p>\n<p>The other little niggle was that I recognised some of the actors but really couldn&#8217;t place them.\u00a0 I spent most of the film asking myself &#8220;What the heck has that guy been in?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I should probably try and draw some moral point from the story.\u00a0 But I can&#8217;t.\u00a0 The characters are fantastic and the portrayal of Nixon was particularly fascinating.\u00a0 I was left wondering if he was good or bad.\u00a0 Clever, or too clever.\u00a0 Had his power corrupted him beyond redemption?\u00a0 Or did the interview change him for the better?<\/p>\n<p>Well worth seeing!<\/p>\n",
