<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">A month and a half</h1></header><main><p>It&#8217;s been a LONG time since I got time to post.  Well, there has been time, but I&#8217;ve been putting writing aside to achieve some other things.  Life is like that!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some of what we&#8217;ve been up to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Martyn Joseph and Stewart Henderson</li>
<li>Aberystwyth</li>
<li>Talgarth, Crickhowell, Table Mountain and Pen Cerrig-calch</li>
<li>Worship leading</li>
<li>Walking weekend in Salcombe</li>
<li>Youth and Discipleship academy</li>
<li>The Lakes (including Loughrigg Fell and Place Fell)</li>
<li>Preaching</li>
<li>Decorating the bedroom</li>
</ul>
<p>I could write a whole post about each but would probably NEVER catch up.  Needless to say it&#8217;s been a busy few weeks.  There have been times when I&#8217;ve been completely run down, when looking forward there has seemed no end to the things to do.  There has been difficult sacrifice and some tough prioritisation.  But it&#8217;s finally turned a corner and I&#8217;m feeling like there&#8217;s some free time ahead.</p>
<p>I hope that this post marks a kind of watershed and that I&#8217;ll be back into writing again soon.  Which is good, because, even when life&#8217;s quiet, life is exciting.</p>
