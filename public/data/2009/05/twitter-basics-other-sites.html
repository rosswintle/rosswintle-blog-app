<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Twitter Basics: Other Sites</h1></header><main><p><em>[I&#8217;m finally trying to complete my &#8220;Twitter Basics&#8221; series (try looking for <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/tag/twitter/">posts with the tag &#8220;twitter&#8221;</a>)by posting a couple of backdated posts&#8230;in fact, the world has moved on so quickly that some of this series is already out of date&#8230;never mind]</em></p>
<p>I mentioned before, in the introduction, that one of the things that makes Twitter powerful/useful is that there is lots of public information.  If you say something, that something is out there on the &#8216;net.  That can be a scary thought, but the availability of all this information can be quite handy.  &#8220;Tweets&#8221; can be processed by other tools in order to produce information about what&#8217;s going on in the world&#8230;right now!</p>
<h3>Twitter Search</h3>
<p>This is the obvious place to start and I have already mentioned it.  It&#8217;s now incorporated into the main Twitter Web Page, but is also available separately at <a title="Twitter Search" href="http://search.twitter.com/" target="_blank">http://search.twitter.com/</a></p>
<p>Here you can search the whole world&#8217;s public Tweets to find out what people are saying about a topic.  You can also use advanced searches to find:</p>
<ul>
<li>messages to or from or about a particular user (not including direct messages, which are private);</li>
<li>messages from near where you are;</li>
<li>messages from specified dates;</li>
</ul>
<p>The search site (and the Twitter home page) also list current &#8220;trends&#8221; &#8211; these are topics or hashtags that have been used the most recently.  For example, when Michael Jackson died, he quickly made it into the trends list.</p>
<p>Sometimes Trends can be a bit silly and/or self-referential.  For example, if I see &#8220;purple pigeons&#8221; on the trends list and decide to set my status to &#8220;Why is purple pigeons trending?&#8221;, then I will contribute to the worldwide &#8220;purple pigeons&#8221; discussion and continue the trend.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s weird.</p>
<h3>Hashtags</h3>
<p>Again, these have already been mentioned here.  Hashtags can be tracked at <a title="Hashtags" href="http://www.hashtags.org/" target="_blank">http://www.hashtags.org/</a></p>
<p>You can track a particular tag by going straight to <span style="color:#0000ff;">http://www.hashtags.org/tag/&lt;tagname&gt;</span> (replace &lt;tagname&gt; with whatever tag you&#8217;re interested in)</p>
<p>Hashtags shows you more than just the tagged Tweets, as Twitter search does.</p>
<h3>Friends</h3>
<p>The most useful tool I had come across for seeing my Friends/Followers was TweetWheel, but it seems to have gone.  A similar tool called <a title="FriendWheel" href="http://thomas-fletcher.com/friendwheel/twitter" target="_blank">FriendWheel</a> now seems to exist though.  Give that a go!</p>
<h3>Trends</h3>
<p>There are lots of Trend visualisation tools.  Try:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="TwitterFall" href="http://twitterfall.com/" target="_blank">TwitterFall</a> &#8211; a cascade of Tweets matching a search or Trend in real time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>There are various sites that give Twitter user statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="TweetStats" href="http://tweetstats.com/" target="_blank">TweetStats</a> shows stats on a per-user basis</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pretty</h3>
<p>My favourite pretty-but-pointless tool is <a title="Twistori" href="http://twistori.com/" target="_blank">Twistori</a>, a colourful, scrolling list of what people love, hate, think, believe, feel and wish.  I could sit and stare at it for hours.</p>
<h3>MORE&#8230;</h3>
<p>This is really just a tiny set of the web-based tools that are around to manipulate the information in Twitter &#8211; they are the ones that I&#8217;ve found most useful as a fairly basic-level Twitterer.</p>
<p>If you want to dig around and see what else is out there then head over the the<a title="Twitter Fan Wiki - Web Apps" href="http://twitter.pbworks.com/WebApps" target="_blank"> list of web applications on the Twitter Fan Wiki</a>, or to <a title="TwitDom" href="http://twitdom.com/" target="_blank">TwitDom</a>.twitt</p>
