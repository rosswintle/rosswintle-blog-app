<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Follow my revelation about rush hour last week, I decided that this week, when carrying my precious laptop between work and home, I would do something I&#8217;ve been meaning to for ages and get the bus.</p>
<p>Buses, to me, seem to be one of those thing that have an inner circle.  They&#8217;re like a cult.  If you don&#8217;t understand them then you feel left out and like you&#8217;ll never be a part.  (Probably a lot like cycling, and church!) And it took me some amount of overcoming my fears to find myself at a bus stop, awaiting the number 8, 54 or 55.</p>
<p>You have to know the routes, and the fares.  You have to have the right change.  And, most importantly, you have to know when to get off.</p>
<p>But, actually, it wasn&#8217;t all that bad at all.  It helped that the drivers were much more helpful than in London (I should point out that I LIKE the bus system in London!!), happily advising on which fare to buy.  And it helped that I&#8217;ve come to know West Swindon quite well &#8211; though why the buses take such a circuitous route I&#8217;ll never know.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t get stuck in traffic, I got to sit and read a book and chill out for 20 mins.  It was probably a bit slower than cycling and driving, and there&#8217;s the unknown wait time to be included, but I enjoyed that.  I abanodoned myself to the fact that I was at the mercy of the system and actually had a good time.</p>
<p>And, you know what, I&#8217;ll do it again!  I have joined the cult of bus!</p>
<p>P.S. I&#8217;m almost a bus spotter in Swindon.  I think it&#8217;s quite cute that Thamesdown Transport name all their buses things like &#8220;Sultan&#8221;, &#8220;Lightning&#8221;, &#8220;St Agatha&#8221;, and Hercules (<a href="http://www.thamesdown-transport.co.uk/latest/scripts/fleet_pub.asp">list here</a>, if you&#8217;re really interested), and I should probably be keeping a list of those that I have seen&#8230;BUT, I should point out, I most definitely am not!</p>
