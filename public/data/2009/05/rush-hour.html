<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Rush hour</h1></header><main><p>I confess, I&#8217;ve been using the car a bit lately.  There are a few circumstances under which this happens and they&#8217;re less to do with weather than you might think.</p>
<p>In fact, the main time I use the car is when I need to transport my laptop backwards and forward between work and home.  But there are other cases too where using the car is, I&#8217;m afraid to say, more convenient and quicker.</p>
<p>At least one of those reasons is not a reason at all.  I suspect two of them are.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough of my self-induced guilt trip.  Today I had the car, and I was forced to drive through West Swindon in rush hour and I realise that I&#8217;ve stepped over a line. A line where my cycle commute is so ingrained that it feels more natural than driving to and from work.  Being in a traffic jam feels truly alien, incrediby frustrating and just generally horrid.</p>
<p>The difference is subtle.  I&#8217;ve always known in my head that cycling is better, but today there was something more emotional and heartfelt, something more emotional about driving.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s taken a surprisingly long time to achieve this &#8211; probably mostly because I&#8217;ve avoided rush hour on most occasions I&#8217;ve commuted by car.</p>
<p>Today, I felt liberated from the car.</p>
<p>Now, how to convince others to join me?</p>
