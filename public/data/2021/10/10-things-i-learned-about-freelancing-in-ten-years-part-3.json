        "rendered": "\n<p>So I&#8217;ve had my last official day as a freelancer. There are still some loose ends to tie up but I really ought to close out my thoughts on freelancing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also read <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-1\/\">part 1<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-2\/\">part 2<\/a> if you missed them. I&#8217;ve already given you 10 things, so here are some bonus experiences. What can I say? It all got a bit out of hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"11-business-vs-personal-branding\">11. Business vs Personal branding<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started out I had no idea what &#8220;Oikos&#8221; &#8211; my business &#8211; would become. And I was nervous about being just myself. That didn&#8217;t seem right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I set up the business with a business name and worked under that. &#8220;Oikos&#8221; was the brand and it had some ideas and principles behind it. And maybe one day it would be more than just me. That was the main reason I avoided being &#8220;Ross Wintle&#8221; as a brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, though, my personal reputation seemed to become more important. As I started doing some public speaking and taking part in conferences and community events and forums, it was me that was well know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, over time, I realised that I didn&#8217;t want to grow and become more than just me. I was quite happy to not have the stress of directly employing other people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I kinda switched back to being &#8220;Ross Wintle&#8221; a bit more. Oikos was still the face of the business and the legal entity that clients dealt with, but I focussed much more on just being me, because that was really what Oikos was selling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was important to have the limited company for various reasons that are well documented elsewhere. And I don&#8217;t think I have an opinion one way or another on what you should be. It&#8217;s YOUR business, and the key is to understand the pros and cons of personal vs business branding. And know that it&#8217;s OK to change too&#8230; you can scale back on one and focus on the other if that&#8217;s what you need to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"12-you-get-freedom-you-lose-freedom\">12. You get freedom \u2013 you lose freedom<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of the big sell of Freelance life is the freedom that you get. And there IS a lot of freedom in freelancing. It&#8217;s a huge privilege actually: to have skills that allow you to work remotely doing something you enjoy in your own place and in your own time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But (and maybe this is just because of how my brain works) freelancing is a bit of a lifestyle. It can consume you. It occupies your thoughts and time when you&#8217;re not doing it. And this actually takes away some freedom too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure some people can switch off better than I can, but I found it hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of my rationale for taking a full-time role recently was that both of my kids are now at school and I don&#8217;t need as much flexibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with the full time rule I get to switch off. I get to the end of the day and I don&#8217;t have to work any more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s taking time to adjust &#8211; to train my brain that I don&#8217;t need to be thinking about work right now. But I can stop thinking about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"13-it-s-not-for-everyone\">13. It\u2019s not for everyone<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of hype around freelancing and many of the messages are that &#8220;Anyone can do it&#8221;, &#8220;You can achieve your dreams&#8221;, &#8220;Do what you love&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also see a lot of people struggling. And some that probably shouldn&#8217;t have started their freelance\/startup\/founder journey. So here&#8217;s some things that I believe about freelancing:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>You have to be very motivated &#8211; you won&#8217;t get by without a good work ethic.<\/li><li>You need to be good (or willing to get good) at a whole load of other things in addition to whatever it is you do for a living (communication, organisation, marketing, etc)<\/li><li>You probably need some kind of financial buffer to get started.<\/li><li>You actually need to have a service or product that people want to pay decent money for.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have no money, no specialist thing that you&#8217;re good at, and you&#8217;re not willing to throw yourself into things then I don&#8217;t believe that just &#8220;following your dream&#8221; is enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"14-curiosity-is-a-superpower\">14. Curiosity is a superpower<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another trait that I think is really helpful is curiosity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Aside: &#8220;Curious&#8221; is my favourite word. I love the double meaning of &#8220;unusual&#8221; and &#8220;inquisitive&#8221;. I think both are highly undervalued traits. So to wrap them up in a single word is ACE!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I think about this I think about some of the things I&#8217;ve had to be curious about in my freelancing that aren&#8217;t my core competency of coding:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Data protection and GDPR<\/li><li>Video and audio production<\/li><li>SEO and social media<\/li><li>Bookkeeping and accounting<\/li><li>Insurance<\/li><li>Writing<\/li><li>Business planning<\/li><li>Coffee brewing (kinda half-joking here)<\/li><li>Psychology (habits, mental health, productivity)<\/li><li>Software, hardward and other tools<\/li><li>Project management<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Being curious isn&#8217;t <em>required<\/em>. You can pay other people to do some of these things for you. You can try to ignore them. But I reckon that if you&#8217;re willing to spend time going down some of these rabbit holes on your own you&#8217;ll broaden your knowledge and this will make you a more useful freelancer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent a lot of time advising my clients on some of these things that weren&#8217;t only ancillary to MY business, but to THEIR business\/organisation too. My knowledge made me more valuable to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"15-be-a-jack-of-all-trades-but-a-master-of-one\">15. Be a jack of all trades, but a master of one<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all of this stuff &#8211; broadening your horizons, being curious and learning lots being to your advantage &#8211; I believe it still pays to have a focus. I tried to sell myself too broadly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to help small organisations, but it was the bigger ones that paid the bills. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to do back-end work, but it was the front-end work that paid the bills. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to use my flexibility to work on side projects and build passive income, but it was the paid project work that paid the bills. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to offer hosting and support services, but these were often a distraction from the project work. I tried to do both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, I was overwhelmed with wanting to be and do everything. And this meant I wasn&#8217;t as effective at serving my clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should probably have chosen to be a back-end consultant who worked full time on a single project at a time for a big client, did no hosting, and worked minimally on my side projects in my spare time. I&#8217;d have made more money, been less stressed, and&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hang on&#8230; wait&#8230; this sounds like having a full time job? And this is what I&#8217;m experiencing right now!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you see where I ended up?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-summary\">In summary<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You might thing I&#8217;m saying don&#8217;t freelance because it&#8217;s hard, and you need to be a special kind of person, and you&#8217;ll burn out. It&#8217;s entirely possibly that I just wasn&#8217;t very good at it and should have stuck to employment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No. I&#8217;ve used the flexibility of freelancing for 10 years and it&#8217;s served me really well, especially with a young family in my care too. It was totally the right thing for me to do. But I am saying: it&#8217;s not a golden goose or a silver bullet. It&#8217;s not for everyone. It&#8217;s sold as a dream that everyone should aspire to, but honestly, I don&#8217;t think it is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be really convenient and a great way to broaden your skills, make a name for yourself, and escape corporate culture or the apparent drudgery of employment. But you need to be sure it&#8217;s what you really want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And despite all the hyped-up positive of many business owners, remember that it&#8217;s OK to try it and not like it. It&#8217;s OK to stop being a freelancer too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope this helps you in your own journey.<\/p>\n",
