<p>I recently saw a Tweet by a runner called Peter Sagal who outlined his &#8220;Rules of Twitter&#8221;.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In response to narrowly spread demand, here are my Rules of Twitter. Note that each was learned by violating it repeatedly over the years, so don&#8217;t bother going back in my feed to find contradictions… trust me, I know.</p><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/petersagal/status/1452698959974129669">Peter Sagal</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>I love his rules:</p>



<ol><li>You will and have regretted many tweets. You will never regret not tweeting.</li><li>Is it intended to delight, inform or amuse? Then go ahead. If not, don&#8217;t.</li><li>Never argue with anybody about anything. Really.</li><li>…..except pizza, whether hot dogs are sandwiches, and old movies/TV shows.</li><li>Don&#8217;t say anything about a piece of current art/writing/culture you wouldn&#8217;t say to the face of the person who created it.</li><li>Never promote any info or news unless it comes from a trust to tell you which door the tiger is behind. source you would</li><li>The only useful purpose of having a bigger platform a than other people is to use it to benefit those other people, so boost and recommend widely.</li><li>Resist the common urge to engage with the one critic rather than the many fans.</li><li>Never, ever insult anyone personally. Mockery is fine, as long as it aimed upwards.</li><li>To survive on the veldt, humans evolved to crave sugars and fats and to get energized by anger and fear. We don&#8217;t live on the veldt anymore. Refrain from feeding obsolete hungers.</li></ol>



<p>And I know that I have some unwritten rules of my own.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve had enough bad interactions on social media (and really, I acknowledge my privilege and it&#8217;s not very many at all, but it&#8217;s enough) to have learned some lessons. And I&#8217;ve spent enough time scrolling and curating my feed into a happy and useful place that I think there&#8217;s some wisdom here. So here&#8217;s how I use Twitter.</p>



<ol><li>Disable trends. Focus on your own timeline. Don&#8217;t get distracted by the algorithm. I use <a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-twitter/illmpnnkeobcgnnjghammeohfjpjoljp">Better Twitter</a>.</li><li>Learn when something is a fact and when something is an opinion. Always ask if you can put &#8220;IMO&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;I think that&#8230;&#8221; in front of your &#8220;fact&#8221;. There&#8217;s a world of difference between &#8220;Avocados are horrid&#8221; and &#8220;I think that Avocados are horrid&#8221;.</li><li>Related: Not everyone&#8217;s brain thinks the same way. Your shitpost might be insulting to someone that doesn&#8217;t &#8211; or just plain isn&#8217;t able to &#8211; get it. Kindness always wins.</li><li>Following is not a two-way thing. I don&#8217;t have to follow back. I don&#8217;t have to follow you at all. I reserve the right to unfollow at any point.</li><li>Mute judiciously: Learn to recognise when a topic is causing anxiety or anger and eliminate it. Mute people. Mute keywords. You won&#8217;t miss those Tweets. I honestly look at my mute list and think &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t read Tweets with that in? Ah well. ?‍♂️&#8221;</li><li>Never argue with anybody about anything. Really.</li><li>If you must engage with something controversial, asking questions is always better than stating opinions. &#8220;Why do you think that?&#8221; is a great start. But mostly, never argue with anybody.</li><li>Not Tweeting about a topic doesn&#8217;t say anything about my opinion on that topic.</li><li>Avoid topics that can&#8217;t be effectively discussed in Tweets. Recognise when something has nuance and either don&#8217;t mention it, or find a better way to discuss it.</li><li>Researching before retweeting. Even if you agree with or like a message, make sure it&#8217;s correct before sharing it.</li><li>Say nice things. Share what your friends make and do. Kindness is free. You have an unlimited reserve of it if you look inside of you.</li></ol>
