<p>So I&#8217;ve had my last official day as a freelancer. There are still some loose ends to tie up but I really ought to close out my thoughts on freelancing.</p>



<p>You can also read <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2021/08/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-1/">part 1</a> and <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2021/08/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-2/">part 2</a> if you missed them. I&#8217;ve already given you 10 things, so here are some bonus experiences. What can I say? It all got a bit out of hand.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="11-business-vs-personal-branding">11. Business vs Personal branding</h2>



<p>When I started out I had no idea what &#8220;Oikos&#8221; &#8211; my business &#8211; would become. And I was nervous about being just myself. That didn&#8217;t seem right.</p>



<p>So I set up the business with a business name and worked under that. &#8220;Oikos&#8221; was the brand and it had some ideas and principles behind it. And maybe one day it would be more than just me. That was the main reason I avoided being &#8220;Ross Wintle&#8221; as a brand.</p>



<p>Over time, though, my personal reputation seemed to become more important. As I started doing some public speaking and taking part in conferences and community events and forums, it was me that was well know.</p>



<p>And also, over time, I realised that I didn&#8217;t want to grow and become more than just me. I was quite happy to not have the stress of directly employing other people.</p>



<p>So I kinda switched back to being &#8220;Ross Wintle&#8221; a bit more. Oikos was still the face of the business and the legal entity that clients dealt with, but I focussed much more on just being me, because that was really what Oikos was selling.</p>



<p>It was important to have the limited company for various reasons that are well documented elsewhere. And I don&#8217;t think I have an opinion one way or another on what you should be. It&#8217;s YOUR business, and the key is to understand the pros and cons of personal vs business branding. And know that it&#8217;s OK to change too&#8230; you can scale back on one and focus on the other if that&#8217;s what you need to do.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="12-you-get-freedom-you-lose-freedom">12. You get freedom – you lose freedom</h2>



<p>A lot of the big sell of Freelance life is the freedom that you get. And there IS a lot of freedom in freelancing. It&#8217;s a huge privilege actually: to have skills that allow you to work remotely doing something you enjoy in your own place and in your own time.</p>



<p>But (and maybe this is just because of how my brain works) freelancing is a bit of a lifestyle. It can consume you. It occupies your thoughts and time when you&#8217;re not doing it. And this actually takes away some freedom too.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure some people can switch off better than I can, but I found it hard.</p>



<p>Part of my rationale for taking a full-time role recently was that both of my kids are now at school and I don&#8217;t need as much flexibility.</p>



<p>And with the full time rule I get to switch off. I get to the end of the day and I don&#8217;t have to work any more.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s taking time to adjust &#8211; to train my brain that I don&#8217;t need to be thinking about work right now. But I can stop thinking about it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="13-it-s-not-for-everyone">13. It’s not for everyone</h2>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot of hype around freelancing and many of the messages are that &#8220;Anyone can do it&#8221;, &#8220;You can achieve your dreams&#8221;, &#8220;Do what you love&#8221;.</p>



<p>But I also see a lot of people struggling. And some that probably shouldn&#8217;t have started their freelance/startup/founder journey. So here&#8217;s some things that I believe about freelancing:</p>



<ul><li>You have to be very motivated &#8211; you won&#8217;t get by without a good work ethic.</li><li>You need to be good (or willing to get good) at a whole load of other things in addition to whatever it is you do for a living (communication, organisation, marketing, etc)</li><li>You probably need some kind of financial buffer to get started.</li><li>You actually need to have a service or product that people want to pay decent money for.</li></ul>



<p>If you have no money, no specialist thing that you&#8217;re good at, and you&#8217;re not willing to throw yourself into things then I don&#8217;t believe that just &#8220;following your dream&#8221; is enough.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="14-curiosity-is-a-superpower">14. Curiosity is a superpower</h2>



<p>Another trait that I think is really helpful is curiosity.</p>



<p>(Aside: &#8220;Curious&#8221; is my favourite word. I love the double meaning of &#8220;unusual&#8221; and &#8220;inquisitive&#8221;. I think both are highly undervalued traits. So to wrap them up in a single word is ACE!)</p>



<p>As I think about this I think about some of the things I&#8217;ve had to be curious about in my freelancing that aren&#8217;t my core competency of coding:</p>



<ul><li>Data protection and GDPR</li><li>Video and audio production</li><li>SEO and social media</li><li>Bookkeeping and accounting</li><li>Insurance</li><li>Writing</li><li>Business planning</li><li>Coffee brewing (kinda half-joking here)</li><li>Psychology (habits, mental health, productivity)</li><li>Software, hardward and other tools</li><li>Project management</li></ul>



<p>Being curious isn&#8217;t <em>required</em>. You can pay other people to do some of these things for you. You can try to ignore them. But I reckon that if you&#8217;re willing to spend time going down some of these rabbit holes on your own you&#8217;ll broaden your knowledge and this will make you a more useful freelancer.</p>



<p>I spent a lot of time advising my clients on some of these things that weren&#8217;t only ancillary to MY business, but to THEIR business/organisation too. My knowledge made me more valuable to them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="15-be-a-jack-of-all-trades-but-a-master-of-one">15. Be a jack of all trades, but a master of one</h2>



<p>Despite all of this stuff &#8211; broadening your horizons, being curious and learning lots being to your advantage &#8211; I believe it still pays to have a focus. I tried to sell myself too broadly.</p>



<p>I wanted to help small organisations, but it was the bigger ones that paid the bills. I tried to do both.</p>



<p>I wanted to do back-end work, but it was the front-end work that paid the bills. I tried to do both.</p>



<p>I wanted to use my flexibility to work on side projects and build passive income, but it was the paid project work that paid the bills. I tried to do both.</p>



<p>I wanted to offer hosting and support services, but these were often a distraction from the project work. I tried to do both.</p>



<p>Looking back, I was overwhelmed with wanting to be and do everything. And this meant I wasn&#8217;t as effective at serving my clients.</p>



<p>I should probably have chosen to be a back-end consultant who worked full time on a single project at a time for a big client, did no hosting, and worked minimally on my side projects in my spare time. I&#8217;d have made more money, been less stressed, and&#8230;</p>



<p>Hang on&#8230; wait&#8230; this sounds like having a full time job? And this is what I&#8217;m experiencing right now!</p>



<p>Can you see where I ended up?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="in-summary">In summary</h2>



<p>You might thing I&#8217;m saying don&#8217;t freelance because it&#8217;s hard, and you need to be a special kind of person, and you&#8217;ll burn out. It&#8217;s entirely possibly that I just wasn&#8217;t very good at it and should have stuck to employment.</p>



<p>No. I&#8217;ve used the flexibility of freelancing for 10 years and it&#8217;s served me really well, especially with a young family in my care too. It was totally the right thing for me to do. But I am saying: it&#8217;s not a golden goose or a silver bullet. It&#8217;s not for everyone. It&#8217;s sold as a dream that everyone should aspire to, but honestly, I don&#8217;t think it is.</p>



<p>It can be really convenient and a great way to broaden your skills, make a name for yourself, and escape corporate culture or the apparent drudgery of employment. But you need to be sure it&#8217;s what you really want.</p>



<p>And despite all the hyped-up positive of many business owners, remember that it&#8217;s OK to try it and not like it. It&#8217;s OK to stop being a freelancer too.</p>



<p>I hope this helps you in your own journey.</p>
