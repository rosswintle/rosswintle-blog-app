<p>Today I visited a local &#8220;Electric Vehicle Roadshow&#8221; where you could get information about eBikes, eCars, eMotorbikes, and stuff from people who sold them and owners clubs and so on.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve long had the idea that our next car might be electric. Our current 13-year-old 1.8l petrol midi-MPV has been a superbly-reliable asset to our family life. But it&#8217;s getting old and tired (despite only 85,000 miles on it).</p>



<p>The idea is that instead of one medium-sized car that we use for everything, we could get a small electric for getting round town and for longer trips where we&#8217;re not taking much luggage. Then for bigger or longer holidays we&#8217;ll just rent a bigger car. There&#8217;s no point owning a particular car because you need it&#8217;s size two or three times a year.</p>



<p>But for an electric car, charging is an issue. We don&#8217;t have a drive or garage. We have on-street parking. So if we wanted to charge something, we&#8217;d have to somehow park outside our house, and then run a cable out across the pavement!</p>



<p>But today, I think I was tipped over the edge with a realisation.</p>



<p>I was chatting with a chap about range and different battery capacities. He asked:</p>



<p>&#8220;What sort of mileage do yo do?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, if we use the car a lot in a week it&#8217;s probably 30 miles.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;30 miles a day?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No. 30 miles a WEEK.&#8221;</p>



<p>HAaaaaaaannnnng on a mo.</p>



<p>Even the small electric cars have a range of 120 miles. So even if we were busy and using the car a lot, we&#8217;ll charge it about once a month (assuming charge holds well).</p>



<p>For some reason I had it in my head that we&#8217;d be charging this thing every other day. But the truth is that we go for days at a time without using our car. So driving to, say, a relative&#8217;s house and charging overnight every now and then, or finding a fast charger near a cafe occasionally. These are viable solutions.</p>



<p>Suddenly the big blocker seems to have gone.</p>



<p>NOW&#8230;</p>



<p>Electric cars are still expensive. There&#8217;s an second-hand market now, which is good. And maybe that would work for us. But there&#8217;s possibly a question of: &#8220;If you&#8217;re only doing 30 miles a week, will it pay for itself? Is it good value?&#8221;</p>



<p>You might even be thinking &#8220;Why own a car at all?&#8221; and the answer really is convenience and the lack of a decent car club. Seriously, if I could borrow a car from a shared pool when I needed one I&#8217;d be on it like a shot. </p>



<p>So I don&#8217;t think &#8220;will it save us money&#8221; is a relevant question on it&#8217;s own. We don&#8217;t own a car because it&#8217;s cheap. We own a car because it gives us very flexible travel options. And anyway, currently we keep a 1.8l petrol car on the go. £100&#8217;s in vehicle duty. £100&#8217;s in servicing. And we only use it&#8217;s size and power a few times a year. Mostly it&#8217;s wasted. It THAT good value?</p>



<p>If this is wrong thinking then let me know. Really do!</p>



<p>Anyway, now I&#8217;m properly looking and researching and I&#8217;m likely to become a complete EV bore. So look forward to that!</p>
