<p>I&#8217;m reading <a href="https://twitter.com/eatwholegrain">Tom Greenwood</a>&#8216;s book <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/sustainable-web-design">Sustainable Web Design</a> and, interestingly, my main takeaways aren&#8217;t technical web design/development things. They are around:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Business/strategy &#8211; how there may (or may not) be benefit in positioning yourself as a sustainable web designer/developer.</li><li>UX &#8211; there are some nuggets around user journeys that I&#8217;d not considered before. Reducing page loads is good!</li><li>Spaceflight (!) &#8211; as an aviation geek and wannabe engineer I&#8217;m fascinated by space flight tech, and there&#8217;s some interesting stuff about the emissions from SpaceX&#8217;s Starlink satellite launches.</li></ul>



<p>I&#8217;ve often wondered about carbon emissions of spaceflight and satellite deployment, but apparently a SpaceX Starlink launch is &#8220;roughly equivalent to 5 full passenger planes journeying from London to Sydney&#8221; and &#8220;a fraction of what it would take to build physical infrastructure&#8221;.</p>



<p>This stat is from The Smithsonian via <a href="https://wholegraindigital.com/curiously-green/issue-2/">Wholegrain&#8217;s newsletter</a> and it looks like it&#8217;s actually ONLY the fuel burning cost, so includes none of the embodied energy in the vehicle (energy used to make the rocket and fuel).</p>



<p>I have to wonder how much energy is needed to make liquid oxygen and create and move around these colossal metal structures.</p>



<p>(Aside: I have so many questions about the use of super-cold liquid fuels in rockets!)</p>



<p>The other thing from the book that terrified me is the thought that so much of the UK&#8217;s internet backbone is in Docklands and could be flooded. If we lost a good proportion of our internet backbone I dread to think what would happen. Supply chains would collapse. My work would disappear overnight. Etc, etc. I&#8217;m sure there are backups and backups of backups for critical stuff like this but even so. Plus, the flooding map of London&#8230; ARGH!</p>



<p>I close with this quote from the book&#8217;s conclusion:</p>



<p>&#8220;There is no downside to a sustainable web, and creating it isn’t fundamentally difficult. In fact, it’s one of the most tangible and achievable steps in the zero-carbon revolution we’re embarking on.&#8221;</p>
