If you want to understand why, see thing number 7<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you didn&#8217;t already: <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/08\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-with-ten-days-to-go-part-1\/\">read part 1<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-invest-in-tools-but-only-those-you-actually-need\">6. Invest in tools (but only those you actually need)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a job like mine you spend may hours at a desk, working at a computer, using a mouse and keyboard, looking at a screen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a hobby.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in the same way that a builder or decorator will spend good money buying decent power tools, I learned to see the things on my desk as my tools. And that they were worth spending extra on so that they were reliable, fast, powerful, and long-lasting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BUT\u2026 you don\u2019t need to go over the top. I see so much \u201cdesk\/setup porn\u201d and it frustrates me because I\u2019m sure so much of this is not actually what many peoples\u2019 desks look like when they work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reckon that only people with really tidy, fancy, expensive setups will share them. You don\u2019t see the less-fancy desks of many, many people who are busy and who are tucked away in the corner of ordinary bedrooms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, invest in good tools, but don\u2019t go overboard just because of what you see on Instagram or what the person who made that expensive video course had. You can waste an awful lot of money on things you don&#8217;t need too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-estimating-isn-t-that-hard-managing-scope-creep-is\">7. Estimating isn\u2019t THAT hard. Managing scope creep is.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I got pretty good at estimating how long it would take to do things I\u2019d been asked to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the things I hadn\u2019t been asked to do that were tricky.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8-freelancers-help-each-other\">8. Freelancers help each other<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019d think people running similar businesses would compete heavily against each other. And I\u2019m sure there are places where this happens. But in general I\u2019ve found freelancers and agency owners to be incredibly helpful and collaborative and supportive of each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess if you run a business you know what it\u2019s like to run a business. If you\u2019re a web developer, you know what it\u2019s like to be a web developer. You understand the struggles. And any reasonable person is going to have empathy and be supportive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, I was amazed at how much cheering on there was, and I like to think I did my bit sharing, mentoring, encouraging and cheering others on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9-niching-is-helpful-at-least-it-was-for-me\">9. Niching is helpful (at least, it was for me!)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s debate about operating your business in a niche, be it in an industry sector or geographic location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I, personally, found it very helpful to have a sector that I worked in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got referrals within that sector. I built up an understanding of the needs of the sector. I attended sector-specific events and joined sector-specific Slack and Facebook groups. I built up a personal profile and contacts in that sector. It meant I could focus a bit, and be especially interested in what my clients were doing, AND be extra helpful when work did come in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"10-people-are-everything\">10. People are EVERYTHING<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, you will work FOR people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will work WITH people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People may work for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will use the things you make (or, if you get it wrong, they may choose not to).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will send you work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People will review your work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to be good at people stuff. You have to have empathy. You have to be good at communication. You have to be able to listen. And sometimes lead or take charge of a situation (even when it doesn\u2019t feel like your job to).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\u2019t just be a tech freelancer. People are always at the heart of every project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-part-three\">In part three&#8230;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This got really out of hand didn&#8217;t it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m still gonna write more. Here are some teasers:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Business vs Personal branding<\/li><li>You get freedom &#8211; you lose freedom<\/li><li>It\u2019s not for everyone<\/li><li>Curiosity is the superpower<\/li><li>Be a jack of all trades, but a master of one<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can go and <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2021\/10\/10-things-i-learned-about-freelancing-in-ten-years-part-3\/\">read that now<\/a>!<\/p>\n",
