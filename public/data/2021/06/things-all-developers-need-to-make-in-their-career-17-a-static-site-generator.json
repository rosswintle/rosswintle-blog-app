        "rendered": "\n<p>There&#8217;s a sort-of-joke that there&#8217;s a bunch of things that all developers are supposed to code from scratch at some point in their career. A blog. A to-do list app. The &#8220;canonical&#8221; applications. And one of these is a static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve actually never built any of these things from scratch. But while making <a href=\"https:\/\/turbo-admin.com\/\">Turbo Admin<\/a> I wanted to make a really simple landing page. I wanted to use TailwindCSS, because I can work quickly with that and use <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindui.com\">TailwindUI<\/a>. And to use Tailwind properly you kinda need to have &#8220;components&#8221;, or at least &#8220;template partials&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I kinda needed a way to do &#8220;HTML includes&#8221;. Which is a thing that doesn&#8217;t exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I put the feelers out for a SUPER simple solution for doing this. Ideally I wanted to avoid a huge <code>node_modules<\/code> folder, and a tool that would at some point require me to downgrade node by three versions just to update a CSS class or change a hyperlink.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Responses to this were:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>FlightPHP &#8211; Micro-framework. Does routing, but not static output. via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BinaryMoon\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a>.<\/li><li>The <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/objects-in-space\/considering-a-static-site-tool-learn-gulp-2fd5f9821fc4\">Gulp-only approach<\/a> &#8211; Needs Gulp. Will probably break at some point. Also via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BinaryMoon\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a>.<\/li><li>Jekyll &#8211; Tried it before. Didn&#8217;t like it. Got confused by all the Ruby stuff. Also via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BinaryMoon\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a>.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/codekitapp.com\/help\/kit\/\">CodeKit<\/a> &#8211; Looks good, but needs CodeKit. ALSO via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BinaryMoon\">Ben Gilbanks<\/a>.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.11ty.dev\/\">11ty<\/a> &#8211; Which looks awesome but starts with <code>npm install<\/code>, and then I looked at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.11ty.dev\/docs\/resources\/\">the docs<\/a> and was overwhelmed. So big nope. via Pretty Much Everyone Else.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/mozilla.github.io\/nunjucks\/\">Nunjucks<\/a> &#8211; Which is a &#8220;a more sophisticated templating engine for JavaScript&#8221;, which meets neither my requirement for something super-simple, nor my desire to avoid JavaScript in the build. It probably needs something like Gulp as well. via <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/richard_bell\">Richard Bell<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dogwonder\">Rich Holman<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I started to think: &#8220;Hang on a minute. This is a basic function of PHP isn&#8217;t it? This is just <code>&lt;?php include('some_partial.php') ?&gt;<\/code>. Can&#8217;t I just run PHP on the command line to transform files? I&#8217;ll probably have PHP installed forever anyway, and it&#8217;s very unlikely to break. Is PHP not the magic I need?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/edwario\/status\/1393275855829274625\">Scott Edward Carver<\/a> backed me up: &#8220;I sometimes use a build process which runs php files in the root directory, outputs to an .html of the same name&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>YES SCOTT!!!! THANK YOU!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ryangjchandler\">Ryan Chandler<\/a> (who is literally one of the most helpful and prolific people on the PHP internet) then chipped in with: <code>extract($data); include __DIR__.'\/path\/to\/view.php; \/\/ ;)<\/code><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out Ryan has built a quick-and-dirty vanilla-PHP-based static site generator script in the past. He called his <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ryangjchandler\/mink\">Mink<\/a>, and describes it as: &#8220;It&#8217;s disgusting really. Using globals, you can only call <code>extend()<\/code> at the very end of a template file. You have to define the name of a slot in the <code>stop<\/code> function.&#8221; And he says it&#8217;s &#8220;for educational purposes (obvs)&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it turns out that while Ryan was trying to find where he had a lefotver copy of this script so I could see it, I was already building something VERY similar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, yeah, I guess it is &#8220;disgusting&#8221;. But it works a charm and totally fulfills my criteria:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Super-simple<\/li><li>Constraints that I&#8217;m 100% happy with<\/li><li>Ability to extend a layout template of your choosing, and pass data to it<\/li><li>Ability to include partials and pass data to them<\/li><li>Ability to have &#8220;environment variables&#8221;<\/li><li>Simple build process<\/li><li>Minimal dependencies<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I COULD wrap this up in a fancy command line with <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel-zero.com\/\">Laravel Zero<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/erikaheidi\">Erika Heidi<\/a>&#8216;s <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/minicli\/minicli\">Mini CLI<\/a>. But I don&#8217;t need to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I COULD make this a PHP composer-installable package. But why should I?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m probably not going to update it. It&#8217;s a &#8220;finished&#8221; piece of software as far as I&#8217;m concerned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s unlikely to stop working in the near future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s keep it REALLY simple. Like I did with <a href=\"https:\/\/peekobot.github.io\/peekobot\/\">Peekobot<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just 160-odd lines of PHP in a Gist:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d\">https:\/\/gist.github.com\/rosswintle\/c1f466250879e1281afe1bab72bed65d<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take it. Download it. Use it. Modify it. Make it do what YOU need it to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined with the new <a href=\"https:\/\/tailwindcss.com\/docs\/installation#using-tailwind-cli\">TailwindCSS CLI<\/a> tool, I can now have simple, static sites, with almost-zero-dependency build processes! Amazing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, I guess I built a static site generator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now&#8230;what&#8217;s next. Todo app?<\/p>\n",
