<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A simple key/value store for static apps</h2>



<p>This idea has been bouncing around for a while. Is there some way I can enhance my <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2024/02/a-manifesto-for-small-static-web-apps/">simple static web apps</a> with a simple, secure key-value store with a REST API? Lots of ideas for how to do this have been put forward, but it&#8217;s probably a simple Laravel app that I need to build and deploy.</p>
