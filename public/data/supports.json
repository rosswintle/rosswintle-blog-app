Sometimes this is through donations or sponsorship, and sometimes this is through paying for products that they make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I list them here so that you can try them out and support them too, and to inspire and encourage you to use your money to say you appreciate peoples&#8217; work and the value they create, and to make the things you love sustainable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of my sponsorships have wound down, and others have moved to more formal commercial setups where their work is supported through commercial endeavour. These are now listed on the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/uses\/\">Uses&#8230;<\/a> page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this feels a bit light right now, but hopefully it will ramp up again in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">People and projects<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/johnbillion\">John Blackbourn<\/a> &#8211; who makes free tools and plugins for WordPress that I use a LOT<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Products and companies<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mostly moved to the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/uses\/\">Uses&#8230;<\/a> page<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I support good journalism by paying for a digital subscription to <a href=\"https:\/\/theguardian.com\/\">The Guardian<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/darkroomespresso.com\/\">Darkroom Espresso<\/a> is a local coffee shop run by my friend Steve. Steve is humble, brave, friendly and an awesome barista. And he lets me work from his place a lot. I really want his business to thrive so I buy coffee and supplies from him whenever I can.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Previous support<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My donations and subscriptions get reviewed from time to time. Here are some people and things that I used to support and that you may want to&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/worknotes.co.uk\/\">WorkNotes<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/community.independent.work\/\">Independent Work<\/a> community &#8211; because Dave Smyth does such great work here<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.doingitforthekids.net\/\">Doing It for the Kids<\/a> &#8211; to thank Frankie for the huge amount of work she puts into curating this community of freelancing parents<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/micro.blog\/\">Micro.blog<\/a> &#8211; I did the Kickstarter for Manton&#8217;s IndieWeb Micro.blog project and had a paid account for a long time. It&#8217;s a great little platform and I love the concept behind it, but it never really got traction with me. Perhaps I&#8217;ll be back one day.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/\">Smashing Magazine<\/a> &#8211; I supported Smashing Magazine for a long while as a member. But I&#8217;m off exploring other lands now. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/membership\/\">Membership<\/a> is still worthwhile and recommended if you&#8217;re more design-focussed than I am. But the content isn&#8217;t for me right now.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sponsors\/zuzana-kunckova\">Zuzana Kunckova<\/a>&nbsp;\u2013 for her important work on the inclusive&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.larabelles.com\/\">Larabelles<\/a>&nbsp;community.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigorangeheart.org\/\">A Big Orange Heart<\/a>&nbsp;(was WP&amp;UP) \u2013 Dan and the team\u2019s work on mental health for remote workers seems so needed and valuable<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/calebporzio\">Caleb Porzio<\/a> &#8211; for <a href=\"https:\/\/laravel-livewire.com\/\">Livewire<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/alpinejs\/alpine\">AlpineJS<\/a> and everything else (I now support him buy buying his commercial products)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, if I&#8217;ve helped you in some way and you want to support ME then you can <a href=\"https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/magicroundabout\">buy me a coffee<\/a> &#8211; it will genuinely put a smile on my face!
