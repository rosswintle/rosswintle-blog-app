Having new gear (the <a href=\"http:\/\/wintle.blogspot.com\/2008\/07\/race-blades-tm.html\">race blades<\/a> and heart-rate monitor &#8211; review to come) has inspired me a bit and fitness has been getting up along with my mileage.<\/p>\n<p>Fuzzy just had a good clean, but needs a couple of repairs after I took a fall in the rain not long ago, and <a href=\"http:\/\/wintle.blogspot.com\/2008\/07\/green-cross-code.html\">crashed into a girl<\/a> the other day.  He continues to be my trusty steed and probably my third love in the world!<\/p>\n<p>Of course, with the warm weather and long days, cycling is highly enjoyable at the moment.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Garden<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Not getting as much attention as it should but doing well.  We continue to <a href=\"http:\/\/wintle.blogspot.com\/2008\/06\/shopping-beer-andslugs.html\">fight slugs<\/a> (beer traps have become less effective but we&#8217;ve taking to night-tie garden trips to kill them and are now using certified &#8220;Growing Success&#8221; stuff to keep them at bay) and harvest strwaberries.  The strawberries have had no attention but have cropped first and delivered lots of tasty fruit already.  Excellent!<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the garden a couple of weeks ago:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/ross.wintle\/MagicRoundaboutsAndPaddedPants\/photo?authkey=AnBieCY4GSw#5213668242023697682\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SFqrpJaOzRI\/AAAAAAAACnc\/3sTxSgyutuI\/s400\/IMG_0741.JPG\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\">The potatoes, in the foreground, continue to grow well, and the onions are looking good too:<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/ross.wintle\/MagicRoundaboutsAndPaddedPants\/photo?authkey=AnBieCY4GSw#5213668367105254866\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/ross.wintle\/SFqrwbX_5dI\/AAAAAAAACns\/XvRqxu9E0YY\/s400\/IMG_0743.JPG\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">General<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Generally we&#8217;re pretty well.

And there&#8217;s lots of exciting news from friends with babies being born, people going off to become vicars\/ministers.<\/p>\n<p>I also led worship for the first time last week, which was very exciting.  For those that don&#8217;t know what this means, I basically led the music for a church service; I picked the songs, did a little bit of arranging, made sure everyone knew what they were doing, organised the rehersal and introduced and led the songs themselves.  It&#8217;s important that this wasn&#8217;t something great that I did, I love my God and it was all about getting other people to connect with Him and show their adoration for Him.  But it was an important event for me too, so I mention it here state that it went well and that I enjoyed it, and then I leave it.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><br \/>Life is good!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",
