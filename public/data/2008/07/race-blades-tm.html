<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Race Blades (TM)</h1></header><main><div style="text-align:left;">There is much dispute in the cycling community about the quality of German manufacturer SKS&#8217; Race Blades.  After my sister gave me some <a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/">Wiggle</a> vouchers for my birthday (thanks Sarah), I have now bought some and so thought I ought to chip in to the debate.</div>
<p>First of all, for those not in the know, what are Race Blades?  Well, they are clip-on mud guards for road bikes that do not require eyelets to screw into or clearance between the brake calipers and the tyres.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an all weather commuter (and rapidly becoming an all-weather trainer too) and Fuzzy, my Felt Road Bike, doesn&#8217;t have either eyelets or mudguard clearance.  So when I got him I kitted him out with some &#8220;Crud Catcher&#8221; type mud guards.  Not ideal and pretty uncool for a sleek, speed machine:</p>

<p>I tried to re-create this photo with the Race Blades but got the bike (and the weather) the wrong way round and I can&#8217;t be bothered to do another&#8230;here he is with the new kit:</p>

<p>Nice!  Let&#8217;s see some close ups:</p>

<p>So they look good.  But how do they perform?</p>
<p>Opinions vary a lot, I&#8217;ve seen claims that:</p>
<ul>
<li>they fall off at the slightest lump in the road;</li>
<li>they stay on through all conditions;</li>
<li>they&#8217;re fine for keeping you dry but shouldn&#8217;t be used in groups as the person behind will get drenched;</li>
<li>they&#8217;re useless in heavy rain but OK for a light sprinkling;</li>
<li>they&#8217;re not as good as real mudguards for keeping you dry;</li>
<li>they&#8217;re a perfectly good replacement for normal guards and a very clever invention.</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess I&#8217;ve had mine for two or three weeks now, through a fairly wet July and a couple of hundred miles of all-weather commuting and I will hereafter join with those who sing their praises!</p>
<p>They were easy to fit and I used the &#8220;temporary fittings&#8221; so I could easily take them off if I didn&#8217;t like them.  However, the rubber fittings you see in the photo have done me proud, holding the fenders on with little movement through some of Swindon&#8217;s roughest roads.  The extra fittings for blade-style front forks are clever too, allowing secure attachment to oddly shaped aero forks, and they come with &#8220;permanent&#8221; fixings in the form of some cable-ties too.</p>
<p>Riding with them is fine and you hardly notice them there.  There is an occasional squeak when you go over a bump and the blade rubs on the tyre, but a little careful alignment (by tweaking the position of the fittings slightly) mostly fixes this.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a pretty wet July so far and so they&#8217;ve had plenty of rain to cope with and I must say, they do a great job!  I&#8217;ve not had any spray come up at me and, unlike the previous crud catchers, the front blade follows the wheel, protecting me even on corners.  I have no experience of group riding so can&#8217;t make any claim about the guy behind me getting drenched.  I might have to go with the pro&#8217;s with their experience of that, however, glancing back, I can&#8217;t see much spray coming up at all!</p>
<p>My only complaint so far is that you can bash them when track-standing.  You need to be careful to keep your foot out of the way when turning the front wheel a lot.  Somehow the difference is only a few centimeters, but it is a BIG difference.  Even so, when I have knocked the in this way, they&#8217;ve stayed on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really pleased with my blades.  If you&#8217;re thinking of buying some I would heartily recommend them.</p>
<p>Now where&#8217;s those permanent fixings?</p>
