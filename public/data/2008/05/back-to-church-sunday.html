<p>One of the structures that we have at our church is the Church Meeting.  This happens every other month, and we had one last night.</p>
<p>One item on the agenda was an initiative called &#8216;Back to Church Sunday&#8217;.  This is a Sunday in September that has been picked out as a day to invite people that used to go to church back to church.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what I think of this.  Surely every Sunday is potentially a &#8220;Back to Church&#8221; Sunday, or a &#8220;Go to Church for the First Time&#8221; Sunday.  And I think I&#8217;d rather have ongoing encouragement to invite friends along than only be encouraged to do it on a specific day.  Churches should ALWAYS be open for people to come back to.</p>
<p>Also, what will the service be like?  I&#8217;m expecting it to be &#8220;special&#8221;, which doesn&#8217;t seem right because what if the people we invite come back the next Sunday and find it&#8217;s different?</p>
<p>It IS a good initiative &#8211; as you can see, it&#8217;s already got me thinking about how open our church is to newcomers, and what I can do to try get better at asking people along.  I will support it and try to join in.  And maybe doing a one off event like this will kick-start something bigger and ongoing.</p>
<p>But I think we need more than just one day for this&#8230;it should be an ongoing part of our Christian lives.</p>
