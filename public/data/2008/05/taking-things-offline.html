<p>Other things are just more important right now so focus has shifted slightly.  Not even learning songs, hardly playing guitar.  Investing in more stuff offline is the key at the moment.</p>
<p>I will catch up at some point.  Apologies for the break.  Follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/magicroundabout">Twitter</a> if you want some shorter, more frequent updates!</p>
