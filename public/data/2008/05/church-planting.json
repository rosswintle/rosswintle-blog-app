Well, now I can mention some more, though I will have to remain a bit vague for reasons that will become clear.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Introduction<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Sally and I are, possibly\/probably, going to be involved in a church plant in a new part of Swindon that isn&#8217;t yet built.   It&#8217;s very exciting, but a little bit scary and unknown.  This message will probably be the first of many on the topic.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">History and Background<\/span><\/p>\n<p>When we first moved to Swindon we searched around a bit for a church that was our style and found Upper Stratton Baptist Church (USBC).  It wasn&#8217;t massively local, being a couple of miles away, but it felt like the right place to be.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after committing to being at USBC, we joined a small group.  For the uninitiated, a small group is, well, just that.  Where the typical Sunday church service has many people and is lead from the front, a small group is a group of around 10-12 people who meet together during the week.  Small groups, or house groups, or cell groups as they are sometimes known, enable people to connect at a deeper level, get to know each other better, share their experiences, learn from each other and pray for each other.  It&#8217;s just a more personal way of meeting together as Christians.<\/p>\n<p>Almost immediately we felt that our house group was important.  Sally and I had a sense that this small group could be a little church of its own, and that maybe our small group leader might one day start a new, house-based church.  Some would refer to this as a &#8220;church plant&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The problem was&#8230;where??? There are plenty of churches in Swindon, and no shortage of them in the area that our small group meets in.  So we dismissed it.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Gentle Revelations<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It turns out that there&#8217;s a new development in Swindon going on.   A group of churches in the area have been praying about the development for years, and, now that it&#8217;s starting to happen, they&#8217;re looking to have a Christian presence there.<\/p>\n<p>Our small group leader feels called (and there a lots of signs that its the right thing to do) to move into the area and be forming a Christian presence in the community from very early on.  And it looks like the small group might be involved quite closely in this.<\/p>\n<p>Some will find it odd that God appears to &#8220;speak&#8221; or to &#8220;lead&#8221; people to a particular course of action.  I believe that this does happen.  But I&#8217;ve really never seen the messages so loud and clear as they are for this.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Mission<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>So, here&#8217;s the Mission, if you choose to accept it: help our small group leader establish a Christian presence in this new development from the word go, and work to build community, welcome people to the area, and show those moving in a huge amount of love by serving them, being generous, and accepting them as friends and neighbours.<\/p>\n<p>Any group of Christians will probably become known as a &#8220;church&#8221;, but we&#8217;re hesitant to define what that means for us just yet, and we certainly have no plans for a building.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/span><br \/>\nOur Involvement<\/span><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the story so far in very brief form.  I could say lots about how the churches of Swindon have been working together in wonderful ways, how funding hasn&#8217;t been an issue, and how people we didn&#8217;t expect to have been incredibly encouraging about the whole thing.  It really is too good to be true.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also been other things going on that have really brought our small group together in the last few weeks.  We&#8217;re a very tight knit community who get on really well together and are all very excited about being a part of the new community.<\/p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s our involvement?<\/p>\n<p>Well, we&#8217;ve obviously been supporting and praying for the team as this is a massive change for them, and quite a big risk.  But we&#8217;ve also been considering our own involvement.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m normally practical, working through issues and thinking things through thoroughly before committing to them.  But in this case, everything in me says &#8220;well of course we&#8217;re going to be a part of it&#8221;.  When our small group leader told us what she was up to, we already knew, and I think we already knew that we would be a part of it too.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re both hugely excited and want to be involved in as much of a capacity as we can.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not all simple though.  We&#8217;ve had to ask ourselves if we&#8217;re doing this because we think God is calling us to, or because we just want to be part of a new exciting church that lots of our close friends are in too.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re wondering just how we can be involved in a community-building project when, at present, we&#8217;re unable to actually move into the area.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also recently become aware of the practicalities. There&#8217;s always politics when a group of people are involved in change and this is no exception.  There will be some real challenges along the way.<\/p>\n<p>Though God&#8217;s call seems clear to us&#8230;we have to be sure that we&#8217;re following God&#8217;s call for us as we proceed.<\/p>\n<p>To put it another way, some good friends of ours are waiting for a definite call from God before they commit to being involved.  We&#8217;re the opposite, waiting to see if God calls us NOT to be involved.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">What happens now?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Well, we don&#8217;t really know.  Things are happening extremely quickly, but they are also being revealed a little at a time.  We had a really good meeting with the small group the other night to discuss what the &#8220;shared values&#8221; of the new &#8220;church&#8221; might be (worthy of a whole blog post of its own), and we&#8217;re all praying, asking God questions, looking for answers, wisdom, guidance in faith that they will come.<\/p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t give too much detail in a public forum, but I&#8217;m hoping to be able to post bits and pieces about what&#8217;s going on here; to record the process that we go through, but also in the hope that those reading may be able to support us.<\/p>\n<p>I will try to use as little church jargon as possible, though such a thing is hard when you&#8217;re writing about such a topic.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s obviously something that could be quite a big change of direction for us and consume a lot of our time.  As I said before, it&#8217;s exciting and scary stepping into the unknown in faith.  I hope to be able to share some pretty exciting stuff here as time goes on.<\/p>\n<p>Eeek!<\/p>\n",
