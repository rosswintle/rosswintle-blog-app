<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Garden Progress</h1></header><main><p>Still way behind on the blog (I have lots of back-dated posts to write up), but it&#8217;s just not a priority right now.</p>
<p>I did want to quickly give an update on the garden, as this is something that IS taking up a lot of our time and IS a priority.</p>
<p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/ross.wintle/SB8ZN-CqRdI/AAAAAAAACWI/tdUt3JVdtNU/s400/DSC00100.JPG"><img decoding="async" style="float:right;cursor:pointer;width:258px;height:344px;margin:0 0 10px 10px;" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/ross.wintle/SB8ZN-CqRdI/AAAAAAAACWI/tdUt3JVdtNU/s400/DSC00100.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />We now have three rows of potatoes growing and three rows of onions, with a fourth of each planted.  We&#8217;re fighting the weeds off a bit at the moment too and I suspect that this will be a daily activity over the summer.</p>
<p>The spuds are awesome.  These photos were taken about a week ago, but now that they&#8217;ve got leaves above ground they&#8217;re growing at a phenomenal rate.  You can see the difference from day to day.  It&#8217;s quite incredible and exciting.</p>
<p>While they&#8217;ve been growing we&#8217;ve been clearing more weeds and Sally&#8217;s been planting Leeks, Celery and Tomatoes under plastic indoors.  These came up REALLY quickly but are not yet strong and established plants that we can plant outside.</p>
<p>The digging and weeding has been hard and slow work but we are getting there.  The photos below show you what we&#8217;re dealing with.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the whole plot:</p>

<p>So, it&#8217;s hard work but rewarding, and on a sunny 27 degree day like today, not really what you want to be doing for several hours.</p>
