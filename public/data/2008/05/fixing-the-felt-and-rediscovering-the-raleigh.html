<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Fixing the Felt and Rediscovering the Raleigh</h1></header><main><p>One of my favourite films is Pixar&#8217;s Toy Story&#8230;the first all-CGI feature-length movie, and a very cool buddy story.  I&#8217;m assuming knowledge of the story here so please forgive me if you&#8217;ve not seen it (and GO see it!).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m having a bit of a Toy Story moment.  My old Raleigh bike (who I&#8217;ve taken to calling &#8220;Walter&#8221;) hasn&#8217;t been used much lately.  When Fuzzy (my road bike) came along he was so superior in so many ways that Walter got a bit forgotten about.  Walter is, if you like, my &#8220;Woody&#8221;, and Fuzzy is my &#8220;Buzz Lightyear&#8221;.</p>
<p>But this week, Fuzzy got a flat.  Not on the road, he got cut up by some glass on the garden path.  Still, it was a busy week and I didn&#8217;t have the time to get it fixed proper.  So I took to riding the Raleigh to work for a couple of days.</p>
<p>And, you know what, he&#8217;s not so bad after all.  He&#8217;s a work horse.  Solid.  Dependable.  A bit rough around the edges, but he&#8217;s there when I need him.  OK, so he&#8217;s a bit uncool, but he&#8217;s done more than 1500 miles in 18 months.  When Fuzzy has problems, I&#8217;ll need Walter.</p>
<p>And so to fixing the flat.  This should be bicycle maintenance 101.  It&#8217;s the first thing you learn to do right?  It&#8217;s EASY.  A kid could do it.</p>
<p>So can I just say&#8230;a kid could NOT do it with a road bike!  Those things are so darn fiddly, the beading&#8217;s so tight.  It&#8217;s really hard!</p>
<p>Anyway, I fixed the flat mid-week but found a half-inch gash in the front tyre where the glass had got through so I bought two new tyres (700-25 Continental Gatorskins if you must know) and fitted them both today.  That&#8217;s three tyre changes in a week &#8211; I&#8217;m getting pretty good at them now despite the difficulty level!  Yet to give them a good ride but will be interesting to see how the bike handles with different rubber.</p>
<p>Fuzzy also got a good and much needed clean, degrease and lube today.  The Raleigh is the workhorse, but the Felt is my slick, lean, fast machine and he still gets much more attention.</p>
<p>To infinity and beyond anyone?</p>
