<p>But there were downsides too&#8230;.weeds!!!  In that garden my enemy was Himalayan Balsam.  A hollow, spineless plant.  Not hugely ugly but lacking character.  Shallow roots and hollow stems that snapped with a chilling crack.  I loathed it and relished pulling it from the ground.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;re clearing our vegetable patch in the new house.  It&#8217;s bank holiday weekend and we&#8217;re behind with planting so we had a long day of digging today.  And I have two new least favourite plants.</p>
<p>One is Creeping Buttercup.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buttercups&#8221;, you say, &#8220;how quaint!&#8221;.</p>
<p>NO&#8230;how HORRID.  A low, pervasive, ground-creeping plant with deep roots that&#8217;s taken over most of our vegetable patch.  It&#8217;s the bain of my gardening life.  It&#8217;s one redeeming feature is that the roots spread down and not out, so it&#8217;s easy to pull them up without having to dispose of great clods of earth at the same time.</p>
<p>The other is the dandelion.  We now have a lawn, but it&#8217;s in a bit of a state, and with our energies going into the veg patch, it might not see some attention for a while.  And the dandelions are taking over.</p>
<p>From a distance they look quite nice.  The view from the kitchen window is almost meadow like with a thin carpet of yellow flowers blooming.  But closer inspection shows them for what they are&#8230;nasty, evil, deep-rooted, zombies of flowers with jagged leaves and spiny petals.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna get rid of them.  I don&#8217;t know how but I will.</p>
<p>Pictures of the job at hand will follow soon!</p>
