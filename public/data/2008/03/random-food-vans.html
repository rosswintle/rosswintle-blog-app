<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Random Food Vans</h1></header><main><p>In a vague nod to my newest reader (I think I have two regulars now!), and fellow, though far superior blogger, here&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m cheekily going to title: &#8220;Things Dave probably misses about England #541: Random food vans&#8221;.  Or possibly Beyond Random Food Vans!</p>
<p>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery so I hope he doesn&#8217;t mind! ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>What is the English obsession with selling junk food at all hours in unlikely places?  As I drove back from the N.E.C. today, via my lovely Grandma&#8217;s for a cuppa, I noticed a Kebab van on the edge of a small town called Malmesbury (famous for it&#8217;s Naked Gardeners).  I think it was in this layby here:</p>
<p>[googlemaps http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Malmesbury,+Wiltshire&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;s=AARTsJojaaoN-iacqTpehAEMs3OdvQFehA&amp;ll=51.585803,-2.089237&amp;spn=0.001167,0.00228&amp;z=18&amp;output=embed&amp;w=425&amp;h=350]</p>
<p>If the link to Google Maps works you should be able to zoom out and see that this is on a quiet road with&#8230;err&#8230;no houses near it at all.  I imagine that quaint, antique-shoppy Malmesbury&#8217;s market for kebabs is pretty small and most passing cars won&#8217;t know there&#8217;s greasy food and cheap coffee in polystyrene cups available until they&#8217;re passed the damn thing and well on their way to Tetbury anyway.</p>
<p>Can they make ANY money at all?</p>
<p>And yet &#8211; someone had stopped to buy one!</p>
<p>Who? And why?</p>
