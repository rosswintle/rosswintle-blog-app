<p>We recently got three in this way that I&#8217;ll just give a little write up of.  I&#8217;m not the best music reviewer, but here are my thoughts.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Amy Winehouse: Back to Black</span></p>
<p>I confess that it was Sally that wanted a Winehouse album, not me, and so I&#8217;ve not heard it much.  I also confess that I&#8217;m strangely prejudiced against Winehouse&#8217;s music because of what I hear about her in the news.</p>
<p>I was surprised, therefore, to find myself thinking that her songs, music and voice were all very good.  Certainly not what I&#8217;d normally listen to, but pretty cool stuff none the less.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll maybe write more when I&#8217;ve heard the album some more.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler: Private Investigations &#8211; The Best Of</span></p>
<p>Sally and I went to the cinema a while back and an advert for this &#8220;Best Of&#8221; came on.  At the end of the advert we turned to each other and at the same time said, sheepishly, &#8220;I&#8217;d quite like to get that&#8221;.</p>
<p>And so we have a classic Dad-rock album.  A load of tunes that we mostly already know really well but never realised were by Dire Straits.  Some awesome guitar solos, some classic lyrics, and a great variety of music too, from upbeat rock and roll through blues, to some lilting ballads, but all done with great style and a very high level of musical skill.</p>
<p>Oddly, it gets boring quite quickly, but we&#8217;re glad to have it in our collection.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Newton Faulkner: Hand Built By Robots</span></p>
<p>We&#8217;re not really very up-to-date with new band and artists.  For some reason that neihter of us could pin down, we  wanted to give Newton Faulkner a try.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;re glad we did!</p>
<p>Mostly low-key, bluesy, indie guitar music, there&#8217;s a lot of variety on this album.  It reminds me, at times, of plently of other artists &#8211; from the swinging accoustic guitar and laid-back melodies of Jack Johnson, to the cheeky pop-rap of Barenaked Ladies.</p>
<p>The album meanders slightly and seems a bit aimless at times, but it&#8217;s a good, summery, feel-good pop record.</p>
