<p>After a hint from a friend of ours who came for dinner a while back, we decided to finally put proper locks on our bathroom doors.  Well, not locks, but little sliding latches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy&#8221;, I thought.  Jusy buy &#8217;em, from B&amp;Q, fix one bit to the door and another bit to the frame and Bob&#8217;s your uncle!</p>
<p>Not so!  Did you know that there are two types of simple sliding latch?  I didn&#8217;t!</p>
<p>The first one went on fine.  More fluke than anything.</p>
<p>I got the first bit of the second one on and then suddenly realised that it was not going to work.  I had to go and buy another latch of a slightly different type!</p>
<p>A quick explanation.  It all depends on which side of the door you&#8217;re on.  From one side a door closes agains the frame.  I&#8217;ll call this the &#8220;outside&#8221; of the door.  When the door is closed it sits behind a chunk of wood.  In this case you can use a latch which slides into a hole in the frame.  Like this&#8230;</p>

So you have to have a raised &#8220;hole&#8221; for the latch to fit into.  Like this&#8230;</p>

It all makes perfect sense now but why didn&#8217;t we think of it before?  How am I supposed to know that there&#8217;s two different sorts of latch.</p>
<p>I believe this is what people call &#8220;trial and error&#8221;.  I sense there may be more of this ahead!</p>
