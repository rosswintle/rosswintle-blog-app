This is like admitting to enjoying watching &#8220;Spice World&#8221; (oh come on, it was worth it just for the fake bus jumping over Tower Bridge &#8220;Speed&#8221;-style).  Yes, this was on TV.  Yes, we recorded it.  And yes, we actually sat and watched it.  And, heck, it was FUN!</p>
<p>This is a cheesy, 90&#8217;s, American movie about teenage schoolgirls&#8230; BUT!!!!!  It has it&#8217;s tongue firmly in it&#8217;s cheek and is more than what you might think it to be.</p>
<p>Alicia Silverstone very cleverly plays a very kooky and spoilt American school girl who&#8217;s rich daddy buys her everything she could ever want.  Lots happens but, basically, for me this was the story of her finding out that there&#8217;s more to life than the American Consumerist Dream.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a great film but it&#8217;s funny and entertaining with some great one-liners.  Am I ashamed I watched it?  Hell yeah!  But I&#8217;m a little bit proud that I did too!</p>
