I enjoy the challenge of learning them, and I&#8217;m a bit of a show off at heart (have you noticed?)  so I&#8217;d rather learn something that makes people go &#8220;You know ALL the words to that?&#8221;.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a couple of these on my list &#8211; Nothing Ever Happens turned out to be one!  And here&#8217;s another &#8211; Counting Crows&#8217; &#8220;Mr Jones&#8221;.</p>
<p>I discovered Counting Crows a bit later than my contemporaries.  Their debut was, I believe, released in the 90&#8217;s but I only found them through Sally&#8217;s record collection a couple of years back.  And they&#8217;re awesome!</p>
<p>A friend of mine who is a very good musician, and who&#8217;s musical opinion I very much respect, has Counting Crows&#8217; &#8220;August and Everything After&#8221; album on his list of top albums of the 90&#8217;s, and I really do agree &#8211; it&#8217;s an album I&#8217;ve listened to again and again and again and never grown bored of.  In fact, I keep finding more and more intricacies to keep me interested.  For example, the song &#8220;Anna Begins&#8221; was usually skipped over at first, but it&#8217;s a true gem that I choose to listen to now.</p>
<p>Anyway &#8211; Mr Jones is a great song.  A poem set to music.  It&#8217;s rousing, thoughtful, interesting, and dynamic.  But it&#8217;s a complicated one.  I HAVE already learned all the words.  I will probably not be able to get them in the right order.  I know that the music contains d-minor&#8217;s &#8211; my least favourite chord.  But it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to learn.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m falling a bit behind again.  This is week 10, so I&#8217;ve skipped 3 songs.  But never mind.  So I really only have until Tuesday to learn this!  Eeek!</p>
