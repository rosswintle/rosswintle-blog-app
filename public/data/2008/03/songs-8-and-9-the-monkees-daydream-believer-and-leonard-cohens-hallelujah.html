<p>I struggled with &#8220;<a href="http://wintle.blogspot.com/2008/03/song-7-mr-jones.html">Mr Jone</a><a href="http://wintle.blogspot.com/2008/03/song-7-mr-jones.html">s</a>&#8220;, not with the words, as you might have expected, but with the rhythm.  Singing and playing this song at the same time is really hard.  So I know all the words, and I know all the music, but I can&#8217;t do both at the same time!</p>
<p>Last week was Song 8 and I had a go at learning The Monkees &#8220;Daydream Believer&#8221;.  Another piece that I know all the words to already and so it should just be a case of committing the chords to memory, but again, rhythm got me stuck.  This really isn&#8217;t a guitar song&#8230;at least, not without some major re-arrangement.  So I gave up quite quickly.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve even memorised the chords.  Consider this dropped from the list!</p>
<p>And so I approached song 9.  Leornard Cohen&#8217;s &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221;, which has been covered by many people in many different ways.  I&#8217;m attempting a fairly standard take of it on the accoustic guitar.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d been simultaneously looking forward to and dreading this one.  When I mentioned it to Sally she expressed some doubt about it &#8211; it sounded to her like quite a complicated piece.  But I reckoned the chords weren&#8217;t too difficult (I&#8217;m sufficiently musical that I can tell a complicated chord sequence).  But any song that&#8217;s really a melancholy piano piece that will have to be carefully picked on the guitar is gonna be a bit hard.</p>
<p>So I was delighted to find it not all that hard at all.  OK, so I don&#8217;t do it justice &#8211; it&#8217;s a beautiful song and I play it clumsily &#8211; but I can play C, F, G, Em and Am, and get between them, pretty OK.  I&#8217;ve still got some words to learn but most of them are there.  And it&#8217;s been a real joy to do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m away on holiday next week so the next song may have to wait.  I&#8217;m well behind but have nearly 10 under my belt.  That&#8217;s 10 songs more than I knew by heart three months ago!  Yay!</p>
