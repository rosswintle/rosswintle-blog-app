<p>I can&#8217;t even remember why Deep Blue Something&#8217;s &#8220;Breakfast at Tiffany&#8217;s&#8221; became popular.  It has very little going for it.  It contains no more than three guitar chords.  The words are&#8230;well, they make sense but why you&#8217;d write it I don&#8217;t know.  And it&#8217;s just cheesy jangly guitar pop.</p>
<p>Yet, I&#8217;m sure many many people know it, so it&#8217;s on my list.  Its also ridiculously easy to play, I already know the words, and it&#8217;s another one that I&#8217;ve tried to learn before, so it&#8217;s just a case of cementing the chords in my head.  Should be an easy one to fit into a busy week.</p>
