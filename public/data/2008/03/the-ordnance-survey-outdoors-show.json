We mostly went because Sally was working on the National Trust stand and she got me a free &#8220;VIP&#8221; ticket.<\/p>\n<p>It was an interesting day with many contrasts.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I got lots of free stuff.  And I bought some expensive technical clothing.<\/li>\n<li>I felt inspired about the Great Outdoors. Yet I felt sad at the trashiness and commercialisation of it all.<\/li>\n<li>I had a fun and interesting day.  I had a long and tiring day.<\/li>\n<li>I could have stayed for many hours.  But I was kinda done and wanted to go home after two or three.<\/li>\n<li>There were some really neat and simple inventions for the outdoors enthusiast.  And there was Ford trying to sell big 4&#215;4&#8217;s.<\/li>\n<li>It was an outdoors show.  It was primarily indoors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>See what I mean?<\/p>\n<p>It was interesting to see how much was on offer.  Holidays, courses, bikes, canoes, volunteering, cars, careers, clothing, gadgets and so on.  I confess that we&#8217;re sucked in slightly to the commercial aspect, but we do also love the outdoors and there are plenty of people trying to make walking\/hiking\/cycling\/etc. accessible and take out some of the difficulties that the Joe Bloggs on the street might have.<\/p>\n<p>I enjoyed it.  But I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d have paid \u00a312 or \u00a316 quid to go + fuel + \u00a38 parking.  Maybe next year I&#8217;ll volunteer to help on the National Trust stand, get in for free, have a good couple of hours to look around and encourage people to give a little back to nature as well as just taking from it.<\/p>\n",
