<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Washing tip!</h1></header><main><p>One of my purposes of this blog is to write down things that I learn so that:</p>
<p>1) I can remember them.<br />2) I can share them with others.</p>
<p>Now, the following may be obvious to some.  It is to me, now that I&#8217;ve messed up!  It&#8217;s a little fact about washing clothes.</p>
<p>IF you have clothes with Velcro fastenings, make sure that the Velcro fastening is closed before you wash said articles with other items of clothing&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;or you&#8217;ll get large bundles of stuck together clothes&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;and you&#8217;ll have to very carefully pull them apart.</p>
<p>(It seems so obvious now!)</p>
