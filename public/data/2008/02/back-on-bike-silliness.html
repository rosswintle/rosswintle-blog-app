<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Back-on-Bike Silliness</h1></header><main><p>Yes, after my big back recovery (not quite there yet but an awful lot better!), it was back on the bike today (too wet for Fuzzy but took the Raleigh &#8211; which I&#8217;m thinking of calling &#8220;Walter&#8221; &#8211; to work).</p>
<p>My routine for cycling is quite complicated.  I need to get all the right things to the right places. This means I:</p>
<p>1) Wake up<br />2) Have breakfast and stuff and put cycling gear on.<br />3) Pack clean clothes (underwear and shirt) &#8211; my jumper and jeans/trousers having previously been taken there and stored in a locker.<br />4) Remember to pack gadgets (phones, organiser, etc) in bag.<br />5) Remember to pack security pass in bag.<br />6) Remember to take keys.<br />7) Pack lunch/snacks in bag.<br />8) Get keys, wallet and change from my &#8220;home&#8221; jeans.<br />9) Get bike from shed.<br />10) Put helmet, gloves, shoes, jacket, etc on.<br />11) Go to work.</p>
<p>Then&#8230;at work:<br />1) Lock bike<br />2) Put lights in bag<br />3) Put computer in bag<br />4) Put saddle pack in bag<br />5) Take helmet and gloves off<br />6) Enter office.<br />7) Shower and change, taking trousers and jumper out of the locker and replacing them with bike stuff.<br />8) Remembering to take keys and computer into the office.</p>
<p>And then reverse the whole process when I get home.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not simple and, inevitably, goes wrong occasionally.  Usually something simple like leaving my keys in my jeans or putting my lights in the wrong place when I get to the office.  It&#8217;s such a complicated routine that the slightest little thing throws me and risks the whole thing imploding a mess of clothing, gadgets and bike stuff.</p>
<p>Today, I made a slightly more embarassing boo boo, which I blame fairly an squarely on not having done the routine for a week&#8230;I forgot to pack a shirt!!!  Which left me with the tricky dilemma of choosing between wearing a jumper with no shirt underneath &#8211; and hoping nobody notices.  Or wearing a long-sleeved, and not particularly attractive-looking, orange and black cycle jersey all day under the jumper &#8211; and hoping nobody notices.</p>
<p>What would YOU do?</p>
