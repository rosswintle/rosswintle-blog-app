<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Honestly!!!</h1></header><main><p>This is a story about something that I did and I don&#8217;t like that it&#8217;s a story about what I did because it makes me appear big.  I don&#8217;t record it to make me appear big, I record it to express my sheer exasperation with other people&#8217;s dishonesty, and the fact that the world EXPECTS dishonesty from me &#8211; it has become the acceptable norm and is actively encouraged and it bothers me&#8230;a lot!</p>
<p>There&#8217;s this lovely girl at work who works in the canteen.  She&#8217;s not been there long and she mostly just clears up after us and takes the money.  But she&#8217;s not so good at taking the money.  She doesn&#8217;t really know how much things cost (which, to her credit, is not really her fault &#8211; most of us customers don&#8217;t know how much things cost either!), and she doesn&#8217;t seem very good at the money handling bit.</p>
<p>The other day I passed her a ten pound note and she accidentally gave me back the ten pound note AND my change.  She, in effect, paid me to eat at the canteen!</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ve had reason to relate this story to some of my colleagues recently, and every time people have said &#8220;I hope you kept it&#8221; or &#8220;You didn&#8217;t give it back did you?&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well, of course I did.  I wanted to pay for my lunch.  Bless her, she&#8217;s made a mistake, which I&#8217;ve noticed, and I&#8217;m not gonna have her getting into trouble because the till&#8217;s down at the end of the day because I deliberately accepted more change than I was supposed to get!</p>
<p>Yet, I&#8217;m made to feel belittled and silly for doing the right thing.  People are astonished that I&#8217;m honest.  Why is this?</p>
<p>I remember what the Bible says about this: &#8220;even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed&#8221;.</p>
