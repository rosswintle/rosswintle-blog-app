<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Song 4: R.E.M.&#039;s &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;</h1></header><main><p>So, finally, here we are at song 4.  I&#8217;ve been a bit lazy about it (it&#8217;s week 7, I think), but, frankly, I&#8217;ve had more important things to do.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve chosen this one because I mostly know it already &#8211; I just need to firm the words up in my head, get the order right, and learn the chords for the bridge and chorus (the verse is just C and D &#8211; with D played as a C shape starting on fret 3).</p>
<p>For reference the verse lines are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mott the Hoople&#8230;</li>
<li>Andy Kaufman&#8230;</li>
<li>Monopoly 21&#8230;</li>
<li>Mr Fred Blassie&#8230;</li>
<li>Let&#8217;s play Twister&#8230;</li>
<li>I&#8217;ll see you in heaven&#8230;</li>
<li>[Chorus&#8230;losing touch]</li>
<li>Moses went walking&#8230;</li>
<li>Newton got beaned&#8230;</li>
<li>Egypt was troubled&#8230;</li>
<li>Mr Charles Darwin&#8230;</li>
<li>[Chorus&#8230;having fun]</li>
<li>Here&#8217;s a little agit&#8230;</li>
<li>Here&#8217;s a little ghost&#8230;</li>
<li>Here&#8217;s a truck stop&#8230;</li>
<li>Mr Andy Kaufman&#8217;s&#8230;</li>
<li>[Chorus&#8230;losing touch]</li>
<li>Lots of &#8220;If you believe&#8221;&#8216;s&#8230;.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Hey, never noticed the chorus varies&#8230;weird what happens when you see something written down!)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good guitar song.  Easily recognisable, easy to play, but I find it quite hard to sing right.  I think it&#8217;s a bit high for my voice.  Not that I can sing anything properly anyway.</p>
<p>4 days to do it (changeover day is Tuesday) and then pick something more complicated for next week.</p>
<p>P.S. I&#8217;ve given up stating what key things are in &#8211; this would be a useful thing for an index of my songs I&#8217;ve learned, just to trigger the memory a little, but I don&#8217;t really understand which of the chords in the song is the key and, with Song 3, I got it wrong anyway &#8216;cos it needs to be played with a capo on fret 5.  Oops!</p>
