<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Online Cycling Tools</h1></header><main><p>I think I&#8217;ve mentioned online route planners before.  I&#8217;m re-investigating them at the moment &#8211; amazing how quickly things move on.</p>
<p>I currently log routes on <a href="http://www.bikely.com">Bikely.</a> It&#8217;s fast, easy to use, does nice maps with commentary, and shows elevation profiles.</p>
<p>I just looked again at <a href="http://www.mapmyride.com">MapMyRide</a> but it&#8217;s slow, full of adverts, and though it gives you a map it doesn&#8217;t give you a way to step through the route &#8211; not that I could make out anyway.</p>
<p>Though, my new favourite is the <a href="http://www.bikeroutetoaster.com">BikeRouteToaster</a>.  It&#8217;s VERY fast, does good elevation profiles and cue sheets (literally, &#8220;Turn left at Thomas Street&#8221;), and seems to have the easiest route editing functions.  The only problem being that it&#8217;s a bit clunky and lacks some simple things, like having a &#8220;home&#8221; &#8211; you have to zoom in about 8 times at the start of every route.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sticking with Bikely for now, but may convert to the Toaster if they can improve it just a TINY bit more!</p>
