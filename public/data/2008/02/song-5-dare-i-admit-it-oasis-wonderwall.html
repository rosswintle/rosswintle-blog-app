It&#8217;s the quintessential, moany, groany Oasis track that all sing-along guitarists should know how to play.  Yet, at the same time, I&#8217;m a bit embarrassed about it.</p>
<p>It provokes a reaction in me that&#8217;s more &#8220;Oh yeah&#8230;Wonderwall&#8230;.how predictable&#8221; rather than &#8220;YES!  Wonderwall MUST be on the list&#8221;.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s a good one to learn.  I THINK the difficulty will be more with the rhythm than the chords (which I don&#8217;t think are that difficult) or the words (which I, and anyone pretty much any English person my age, will already know).</p>
<p>Or perhaps I&#8217;ll learn to play it Mike Flowers&#8217; Pops style?  Now there&#8217;s a thought!</p>
