        "rendered": "<p>This is a follow up to the post about praying for good health.<\/p>\n<p>Last Sunday our church had a &#8220;Healing and Wholeness&#8221; service.  They do this a couple of times a year and the idea is that we believe God wishes, in some cases, to heal us, and, in all cases, to bring us wholeness.<\/p>\n<p>And so I had Sally and one of the Elders pray for me in person.<\/p>\n<p>Talking about being prayed for is weird, mostly because spiritual things aren&#8217;t easy to describe in words.  In some cases you don&#8217;t feel anything when you&#8217;re being prayed for.  In other cases you will get a sense of peace, or happiness.  Sometimes there is a physical sensation of some sort.  And at other times more unusual things happen &#8211; for example, I&#8217;ve seen people fall over, semi-conscious, kinda like shutting down physically so that God can work on the spiritual stuff &#8211; forced meditation I guess!<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, in this case not much seemed to happen.  Does that mean that nothing has actually happened?  No! Not really.  I believe that whenever we speak to God something happens &#8211; he hears us, understands us, and though we may not see, hear, or feel the effects, we have made a request and had it heard.  A bit like sending a letter to Santa &#8211; nothing happens when you send the letter, but you will (eventually, if you&#8217;re a good boy\/girl) get some kind of response!<\/p>\n<p>And on that Sunday certain things started moving.  Later, at home, I prayed and had my own little conversation with God.  Again, it&#8217;s hard to explain how but I felt that God &#8220;spoke&#8221; to me &#8211; not in words as such, but a message arrived in my mind or my spirit or something &#8211; and he said that I could &#8220;start thinking again&#8221;.  Certain things, in my head, have kinda been on hold while all this illness and injury has been ongoing.  God was telling me that I could take those things off hold.<\/p>\n<p>That was a bit odd as I didn&#8217;t feel any dramatic improvement at that point.<\/p>\n<p>However &#8211; in the morning, on Monday, I felt like a different person!  Really, overnight the pain had gone from being a painful, broken, sort of pain, to being a tired, weary, will-be-better-soon sort of pain.  Psychologically I felt MUCH stronger too.  It really was a remarkable change &#8211; I suddenly felt like me again.  Oh, and I was really hungry!!  My appetite increased substantially!<\/p>\n<p>Following that I&#8217;ve had a steady week &#8211; the pain has come and gone a bit, but it&#8217;s not felt harsh and difficult, it&#8217;s continued to feel like recovery rather than injury.  I&#8217;ve been laughing, smiling, joking, and enjoying myself.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not about to enter into a discourse on the nature of prayer and answers to prayer here &#8211; maybe another time &#8211; I just want to record my experience and give thanks for it.  I&#8217;m happy for people to dismiss this as coincidence, or psychology, or a perfectly normal physical recovery.  But I know that something slightly more than that has happened.  As William Temple once said: &#8220;When I pray, coincidences happen, and when I don&#8217;t, they don&#8217;t.&#8221;<\/p>\n",
