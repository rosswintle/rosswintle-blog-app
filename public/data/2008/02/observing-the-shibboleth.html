So I&#8217;m doing some catching up and messing around.  Here&#8217;s a little video I like. It&#8217;s a time-lapse of people looking at the &#8220;Shibboleth&#8221; exhibit at the Tate Modern, in December 2007.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m usually more interested with people&#8217;s reactions to the Turbine Hall exhibits, than to the exhibits themselves. I like this video because there&#8217;s so much going on. Most people slowly progress along the crack in the floor.  But the group on the right refuse to budge as their tour guide conducts a detailed explanation.  And old lady stops to take a deeper look.  The gallery employee in the red jacket ambles up and down. I wonder what else there is to spot?</p>
