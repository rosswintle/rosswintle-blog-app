I wish.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>But I think that it&#8217;s important to promote cycling, make people realise that you don&#8217;t have to fire up your car to do that short journey. \u00a0I&#8217;m aware that not everyone can commute by bike like I can, and that if you have children or luggage then it&#8217;s not really an available option. \u00a0But there are LOTS of journeys that could be done by bike, and there are lots of good reasons to do them by bike!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>This process has been a real challenge to my faith. \u00a0Cycling isn&#8217;t the only good news I believe I have to share. \u00a0I&#8217;m willing to become renowned in my workplace for being a cyclist? \u00a0Am I willing to become renowned for being a follower of Jesus? \u00a0That&#8217;s a whole world more scary.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Somehow, talking about faith is awkward and embarassing. \u00a0Our culture isn&#8217;t one where we talk much about beliefs, especially if they are controversial. \u00a0Talking about cycling, or what music you like, or what football team you support is OK. \u00a0But I wonder what would happen if I decided that I needed to be, not a Lance Armstrong, but a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Billy_Graham\">Billy Graham<\/a>; telling people not about two-wheels, but about hope and joy and goodness. \u00a0What would the reaction be? \u00a0Would it even be acceptable? \u00a0Could I use my sports and social club to help promote a prayer group or to advertise church services and events?<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I just don&#8217;t know, and, at the moment, I don&#8217;t really know how to start finding out. \u00a0But I should take courage (ah&#8230;that&#8217;s where en<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">courage<\/span>ment comes from);\u00a0I&#8217;ve now been an evangelist, it wasn&#8217;t that scary, it got mixed reactions, but the whole cycle challenge experience has given me a new confidence to talk, not just about cycling, but about my faith too.<\/div>\n",
