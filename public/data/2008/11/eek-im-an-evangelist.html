<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Eek &#8211; I&#039;m an evangelist!</h1></header><main><p>I don&#8217;t really like the word &#8220;Evangelist&#8221;.  It conjurs up visions of shouty men in the middle of town telling people that they&#8217;re all going to hell at the tops of their voices.  Either that or suit-wearing professional speakers who hold big Christian rallys in stadiums.  Not me at all, and, despite my strong Christian faith, I don&#8217;t consider myself much of an evangelist.</p>
<div></div>
<div>However, the word originates in Greek and its original meaning is that of a &#8220;bringer of good news&#8221;, and the word is also used to denote someone who is enthusiastic about a cause.  And that&#8217;s what I was for a few weeks earlier this year!</div>
<div></div>
<div>A man called <a href="http://getmorepeoplecycling.com/">Tom</a> launched a thing called the &#8220;<a href="http://www.swindoncyclechallenge.org.uk/">Swindon Cycle Challenge</a>&#8220;.  This was a friendly competition, with lots of prizes, that got companies across Swindon trying to get their staff riding bicycles.  As a slight aside, I thought that this was a GREAT way to promote cycling.  The organisation provided lots of promotional material and incentives for people, as well as having a good webstie, updated often, with associated email updates too.  They did everything but provide the bikes!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Anyway, as a member of the little sports and social committee at work I took it upon myself to promote this within my office.  I truly became a cycling evangelist!</div>
<div></div>
<div>It was pretty hard work.  I had to do a lot of haggling and persuading.  Some people thought I was a bit weird and there were lots of excuses that people gave for not getting out and riding a mile or for 10 minutes on a bike, despite the offer of free cinema tickets, cycle accessories, and entry into prize draws for those that did!</div>
<div></div>
<div>I was even referred to as &#8220;Swindon&#8217;s answer to Lance Armstrong&#8221;.  Hah! I wish.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But I think that it&#8217;s important to promote cycling, make people realise that you don&#8217;t have to fire up your car to do that short journey.  I&#8217;m aware that not everyone can commute by bike like I can, and that if you have children or luggage then it&#8217;s not really an available option.  But there are LOTS of journeys that could be done by bike, and there are lots of good reasons to do them by bike!</div>
<div></div>
<div>This process has been a real challenge to my faith.  Cycling isn&#8217;t the only good news I believe I have to share.  I&#8217;m willing to become renowned in my workplace for being a cyclist?  Am I willing to become renowned for being a follower of Jesus?  That&#8217;s a whole world more scary.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Somehow, talking about faith is awkward and embarassing.  Our culture isn&#8217;t one where we talk much about beliefs, especially if they are controversial.  Talking about cycling, or what music you like, or what football team you support is OK.  But I wonder what would happen if I decided that I needed to be, not a Lance Armstrong, but a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Graham">Billy Graham</a>; telling people not about two-wheels, but about hope and joy and goodness.  What would the reaction be?  Would it even be acceptable?  Could I use my sports and social club to help promote a prayer group or to advertise church services and events?</div>
<div></div>
<div>I just don&#8217;t know, and, at the moment, I don&#8217;t really know how to start finding out.  But I should take courage (ah&#8230;that&#8217;s where en<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;">courage</span>ment comes from); I&#8217;ve now been an evangelist, it wasn&#8217;t that scary, it got mixed reactions, but the whole cycle challenge experience has given me a new confidence to talk, not just about cycling, but about my faith too.</div>
