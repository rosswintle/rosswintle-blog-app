<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Proverbs for our Times</h1></header><main><p>Here are some wise sayings that seem quite relevant given the current credit crunch:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone, for they will surely sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Don&#8217;t guarantee to pay someone else&#8217;s debt.<span class="sup"></span>If you don&#8217;t have the money,you might lose your bed.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>And here is some ancient wisdom that would seem to apply to our current binge-drinking culture:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes? </p>
<p><span class="sup"></span>Those who linger over wine, who go to sample bowls of mixed wine. </p>
<p><span class="sup"></span>Do not gaze at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly!<span class="sup"> </span> In the end it bites like a snake and poisons like a viper.<span class="sup"></span> Your eyes will see strange sights and your mind imagine confusing things.<span class="sup"></span> You will be like one sleeping on the high seas, lying on top of the rigging.</p>
<p><span class="sup"></span>&#8216;They hit me,&#8217; you will say, &#8216;but I&#8217;m not hurt! They beat me, but I don&#8217;t feel it! When will I wake up so I can find another drink?&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This advice, all highly relevant in our world today, is straight from the Bible, from the book of Proverbs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing, both that wisdom from thousands of years ago is still relevant today, and that human nature has moved on so little in that time.</p>
