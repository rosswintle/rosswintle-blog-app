<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Software Updates</span></p>
<p>It seems that whenever I turn my computer on at the moment, about half of the software needs to auto-update.  Pidgin (IM client), Firefox (and extensions), Anti-Virus, Adobe Reader and Flash, Windows, iTunes&#8230;it&#8217;s incessant!  And it means that it&#8217;s about half an hour from pushing the on button to being able to do anything useful.</p>
<p>Of course, I could disable all the auto-updates.  What I&#8217;d really like is to be able to click a button that says &#8220;update all my software now&#8221; and run all the updates at once at a time that is convenient to me.</p>
<p>The auto-update problem is only made worse by my second annoyance.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Progress Bars</p>
<p></span>We did a module in my computer science degree about Human-Computer Interaction.  In it we were told that a progress bar should tell you three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>How much work has been done.</li>
<li>How much work is left.</li>
<li>How quickly the work is progressing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some status bars used to achieve this.  Actually, the best ones were usually multi-progress bars that showed how far a job involving lots of smaller jobs had got.  One bar showed overall progress and the other showed progress of the smaller sub-tasks.  Linux installs were always pretty good for this sort of thing.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve not seen a progress bar that does any of the above three things for years now.  I see progress bars that do all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>start again from zero once they reach 100%</li>
<li>advance at unsteady rates</li>
<li>stop for a long time at a certain percentage and then suddenly leap</li>
<li>advance at a steady rate but then the work is not complete when they reach 100%</li>
</ul>
<p>And what&#8217;s really bad is that we now take this for granted.  I mean, what if your car&#8217;s petrol gague suddenly dropped from 3/4 full to 1/8 full?  Or if your washing machine showed it was on the last rinse when really it was still doing the pre-wash?  Would we accept that?</p>
<p>We should be telling our software installer vendors that this is unacceptable.  I&#8217;ve wasted many hours staring at progress bars that are telling me a job is nearly done when it&#8217;s really far from completion.  I&#8217;ve been late home and I&#8217;ve been late to bed because of such things.  I bet you could do analysis that shows that businesses are losing millions of man-hours while people wait for things to complete in this way.</p>
<p>We need progress on progress bars!  Who will stand and join with me to reclaim our %-complete&#8217;s and make them what they once were?<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"></span></p>
