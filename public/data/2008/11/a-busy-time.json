So we&#8217;ve not been at home much.  Weekday evenings have been busy as well.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s been going on:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Getting rid of the rats<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We finally think we&#8217;ve tackled the rat problem.  A while ago the man from the council came out again with his boss &#8211; the head of Pest Control &#8211; for a second opinion.  He worked out that the rats were probably getting in from the old &#8220;Stink Pipe&#8221;.  The vent connected to the sewer.  This isn&#8217;t used as a vent any more, as a new pipe had been put on the side of the house, but the it hasn&#8217;t been blocked up.  This gives the rats a free run from the sewer up the wall cavity to our loft.<\/p>\n<p>So, we hacked a hole in the side of the old back wall (which has been knocked through into the extension) and shoved a load of chicken wire into the cavity.  I&#8217;m sure that we have heard the odd scratching since, but there&#8217;s very little sign of rat activity anywhere and this has been the case for a while now.<\/p>\n<p>Problem is that rats have now started to take refuge in our compost bin.<\/p>\n<p>AARRGRGHHH!!!!<\/p>\n<p>In the mean time the last one to die has stopped smelling and we now have a plague of flies again.  Hopefully out last!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Ikea<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also been having furniture fun.  Try to follow this.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re borrowing some furniture from my sister, who is waiting to sell a house so that she can buy a house.  When she moves in to the new, bigger house we can give her &#8220;loaned&#8221; furniture back.  At that point we&#8217;ll need basically a whole bedroom suite, including a bed and wardrobes.  We&#8217;d also promised a sofa to a friend of ours in Bristol.  So whenever we were going to go to Ikea (in Bristol) to buy the bedroom furniture, we were going to hire a van and take the sofa on the same trip.<\/p>\n<p>However, we found the ideal piece of furniture to replace the sofa in a sale.  So we bought that and had to expedite the sofa-taking trip.  As we had the van we figured we may as well pop to Ikea as well.<\/p>\n<p>Now, our last experience of Ikea was not good.  I mean NOT good.  It was horrible and we got only about half of what we went for.  So we were psyching ourselves up for this trip.<\/p>\n<p>It turned out not so bad and we got about a 90% hit rate.  Unfortunately this meant that the two main bits of furniture (bed and wardrobe) were incomplete.  We had a head- and foot-board for the bed but no sides, and the wardrobe lacks some drawer fronts.<\/p>\n<p>So on our trip round the country we stopped off at Ikea Leeds to pick up some bed sides (which were crammed into the car next to a gracious Sally for several hundred miles), but the drawer fronts aren&#8217;t due in the country at all for about 6 weeks.<\/p>\n<p>What we have learned along the way is that Ikea&#8217;s phone service is pretty good.  You can do automated stock checks and, if something&#8217;s out of stock, you can get the store to text you when it comes back in stock!  Rather clever really.<\/p>\n",
