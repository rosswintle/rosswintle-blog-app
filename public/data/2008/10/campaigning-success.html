Changing the world isn&#8217;t easy, but organisations like Tearfund, Christian Aid, and Oxfam provide plenty of good resources to help us badger big businesses, and make our views known to our MPs.</p>
<p>Sometimes this feels futile.  If lucky you get a standard letter or email back to your campaigning message and, though we see some token gestures to some of the issues that we raise, it&#8217;s rare that the things that we ask for are actually implemented in full.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of campaigning going on lately regarding a piece of legislation called the climate change bill.  This is going to commit our country to major reductions in carbon emissions.  I&#8217;ve written to several members of parliament and sent postcards and emails about this issue because I really believe that it&#8217;s something we need to do &#8211; and sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>So I was heartened today to read this Guardian article about how, not only has the government included the full emissions reductions in the bill, but it&#8217;s decided to incorporate shipping and aviation emissions as well.  This is exactly what I and many other people have been campaigning for.</p>
<p>I particularly like Thom Yorke&#8217;s encouragement that &#8220;it came about simply because hundreds of thousands of people on the ground hassled their MP, who in turn hassled the government. Amazing.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, if you care about something, find an organisation that can help you campaign about it, and get writing.  Sometimes it really does work!</p>
