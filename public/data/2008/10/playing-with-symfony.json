Most of this will probably mean nothing to any of you and for that I make absolutely no apology whatsoever.<\/p>\n<p>This whole post is a bit of a brag, but it&#8217;s writing up what&#8217;s been an intriguing afternoon\/evening for me too.<\/p>\n<p>I have a pretty strong background in Software Engineering, but I&#8217;m a bit behind with the times.  I don&#8217;t really know much about how people go about developing applications these days.  It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been meaning to get to grips with for a while.  Today I&#8217;ve been playing a bit with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.symfony-project.org\/\">Symfony<\/a> &#8211; a PHP-based web development framework, with the aim of re-writing the database using a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Symfony.  If you really care I&#8217;m using an installation of MoWes on a USB stick to keep this all portable so I can develop from work or home.  Thanks must go to those on Twitter who have thrown some of these technologies my way.<\/p>\n<p>Web-based applications seem to be the way of things at the moment (unless you&#8217;re doing hard-core coding for things like OS&#8217;s or embedded systems, which I&#8217;m not).  And all the little projects I can either get my hands on, or dream up, are all web-apps that would benefit from a rapid-application development (RAD) type approach.<\/p>\n<p>This has sort-of been happening a bit at work as I look after a database with a web-based front-end.  This is currently written in PHP, outputting static HTML (i.e. no JavaScript) but when I wrote it I tried to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>abstract the database operations;<\/li>\n<li>separate the data model and the presentation so that the code didn&#8217;t need to be updated when new fields got added, deleted, etc.;<\/li>\n<li>create some generic code for those things that remained the same for all pages (cookies\/authentication, standard menus, banners, etc).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit clunky but it works well and the time spent coding the abstractions has saved me a lot of time with subsequent modifications.<\/p>\n<p>So it was a surprise to find that most of what I&#8217;ve done, or tried to do, fits with the principles on which application frameworks are based (see the Fundamental Concepts section of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.symfony-project.org\/book\/1_1\/01-Introducing-Symfony\">Symfony book<\/a> I&#8217;m reading).  The terminology is all a bit much to take in in one go, but essentially I was doing things right.<\/p>\n<p>Or is it a surprise?  My computing teachers were always keen to teach us good principles like abstraction, and I&#8217;ve always held that my fundamentals are good.  So maybe it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that learning to use Symfony is quick and easy.  I&#8217;m working my way through the tutorial, but without a lot of time it could easily leak from my head.<\/p>\n<p>Possibly more techie posts like this to come as I learn more.  Or maybe I&#8217;ll have rewritten the database before I get a chance to write again.  That&#8217;ll depend on how good all this new technolgoy really is!<\/p>\n",
