<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;">An Almost-Accident</span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;"><br /></span></div>
<div>The week before we left for holiday I nearly had a nasty accident.  There&#8217;s a bit of my ride to work where I head downhill on a cycle path which then meets the corner of a road (if you&#8217;re really interested it&#8217;s <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=51.555493,-1.8231&amp;spn=0.001156,0.002057&amp;t=h&amp;z=19">here on the corner of Affleck Close</a>).  There&#8217;s not much traffic on this road and I&#8217;m always careful descending the shared cycle-pedestrian path because there are sometimes other pedestrians and cyclists.  But once I&#8217;ve hit the road I&#8217;m generally pulling away pretty quickly.</div>
<div></div>
<div>On this particular day, a woman in a car was heading towards me (east, if you&#8217;re looking at the map), and she decided to turn right (south), seemingly without seeing me.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I don&#8217;t want to relate this story just to have a go at the woman &#8211; though I should add that I was wearing my long-sleeved, flourescent yellow waterproof jacket, it was morning daylight, and I was QUITE visible thank you very much &#8211; no, these things happen.</div>
<div></div>
<div>What was interesting was the reactions.</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>The woman&#8217;s reaction in the car was to stop.  When actually, the best thing she could have done was accelerate away as quickly as possible and get out of my way.</li>
<li>My brain quite quickly made up its mind that I might not stop in time and I was fully prepared, not for a big crash, but to gently tumble into the side of the car.</li>
<li>Fuzzy (my bike, for those not yet in the know), even with brakes really-hard on, refused to be thrown sideways into a skid.  He just wants to keep moving forwards.  I did just about managed to lock up the rear wheel but it&#8217;s a LOT of effort.</li>
<li>We did manage to avoid each other &#8211; but the womans face said &#8220;What are you doing???&#8221;.  Indeed.</li>
</ol>
<div>Yes, accidents happen.  This one, fortunately, did not.  But I was left with a thumping heart and the feeling that, in an emergency, your brain can process a huge amount of information incredibly quickly.</div>
<div></div>
<div>And sometimes that&#8217;s a very good thing!</div>
<div></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;">Strains, Chains and Velomobiles</span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;"><br /></span></div>
<div>Actually nothing to do with chains, but it sounded good and pedals doesn&#8217;t really rhyme with much.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Well, OK, it rhymes with &#8220;medals&#8221; but that&#8217;s about all.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Anyway, during <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/2008/08/small-improvements.html">my PB 35 mile ride to Cholsey</a> a few weeks ago I was fighting against an odd pain in the right side of my stomach.</div>
<div></div>
<div>After this ride I had quite persistent niggles with my right hamstring and in my back.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I wasn&#8217;t sure if these were related.  I&#8217;m still not.  But it did get me doing some thinking about my riding position.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Position is all important on a bike because the repetetive, strenuous motion amplifies any minor problem.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I looked at a few things.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Was I pedalling equally with both legs? No.  So let&#8217;s do some work on balancing that out.</li>
<li>Is my saddle straight?  Yes, and it&#8217;s at a good height too.  But I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m sat on it straight.  Maybe I sag to one side a little?  Have to think about my position there too.</li>
<li>What about my feet?  Well, my cleats (the clips on the bottom of cycling shoes that clip into &#8220;clipless&#8221; pedals), weren&#8217;t in the same position on both feet &#8211; so I&#8217;ve adjusted them, and replaced the cleats at the same time.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Will all this make a difference?  It&#8217;s hard to say right now as I&#8217;ve not done a longer ride for a while.  It will be interesting to see how things are now.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Of course, in the background the stretching and strength work that I don&#8217;t do enough of will have to continue too, and as the nights draw in perhaps I&#8217;ll get more opportunity to do that.  Then, come next spring, I&#8217;ll be REALLY fit and ready to go!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Maybe.</div>
