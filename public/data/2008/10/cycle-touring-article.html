<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Cycle Touring Article</h1></header><main><p>This is a completely blatent note to self.  But it deserves a note on why I have to make it.</p>
<p>I have an article on the web.  I want to save a reference to it but the site isn&#8217;t one I&#8217;m following with Google Reader via its RSS/Atom feed.  Normally I&#8217;d spot the article on Reader and &#8220;Star&#8221; it to remind me about it being useful.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there are tools out there that allow me to usefully save links to pages that are of interest.  But what/where are they?  Any tips gratefully received.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here&#8217;s a useful article on Cycle Touring for beginners that I spotted.  Cycle touring is something I&#8217;ve dreamed of since getting into cycling and, while it&#8217;s not something I expect to be doing in the near future, I hope to give it a go one day.<br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><br /><a href="http://www.everydaycycling.com/edc/news/WiseWords/20080902_wise_words_preparing_for_a_tour.aspx">Here it is then: Preparing for a Cycle Tour</a><br /></span></p>
