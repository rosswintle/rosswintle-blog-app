<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Notebook</p>
<p></span>Recorded while we were on holiday, this charming love story didn&#8217;t really impress me.  It was a simple couple-meet, couple-torn-apart, couple-get-back together story<span style="font-weight:bold;">, </span>wrapped up as an old man reading the story to his wife who&#8217;s suffering from dementia and amnesia.  Touching and cute, but for me, ultimately lacking in a special something.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">An Inconvenient Truth</p>
<p></span>We got this out of the library to watch now that Sally is involved in climate change projects.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good documentary, mostly based around a lecture given by Al Gore.  It&#8217;s a well-made documentary film with good graphics explaining the science and facts, and Gore is a great speaker.  An hour long lecture on climate change could easily be dull, but I was far from bored and found the whole thing informative and challenging.</p>
<p>In fact, I found it quite scary. It&#8217;ll certainly get me rethinking my own impact on the climate.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"></span></p>
