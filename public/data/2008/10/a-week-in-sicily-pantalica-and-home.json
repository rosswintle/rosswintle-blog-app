We stopped off next to a shallow pool on the way, for some lunch. \u00a0This really could have been a film set or something, it was almost unreal in its purity and beauty.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\">On returning to the car we set out to find some other, less spectacular Necropoli nearby, which were also quite spectacular. \u00a0Tombs, dwellings and even churches carved out of the rock amongst breathtaking scenery.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\">This place is mentioned in the Rough Guide, and is even one of the listed top 30 things to see\/do while there, but you could so easily pass it by. \u00a0&#8220;Who want&#8217;s to go and see a load of tombs?&#8221;, but this place is a true gem!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\"><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTVY1Nc6zI\/AAAAAAAAEM0\/geK80LITvPQ\/s400\/IMG_1384.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTVY1Nc6zI\/AAAAAAAAEM0\/geK80LITvPQ\/s400\/IMG_1384.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:300px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Palazzolo Acreide<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Leaving the Pantalica area we checked the Rough Guide to see what else was nearby, and decided to call in at a place called Palazzolo Acreide. \u00a0This small town has a great Archaelogical park. \u00a0It&#8217;s at the top of a fairly big hill, so we recommend taking the car up to the top if you can.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>This place is mostly well-preserved Greek tombs, dwellings and temples. \u00a0But it brings things slightly more to life because it&#8217;s all layed out as a small village. \u00a0You are almost transported back in time and you can imagine ancient people wandering around, meeting together and heading to worship. \u00a0It feels like a place with community, rather than just a random collection of ancient buildings and artifacts.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTVkJYt8TI\/AAAAAAAAENU\/Or5dSypWi20\/s400\/IMG_1390.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTVkJYt8TI\/AAAAAAAAENU\/Or5dSypWi20\/s400\/IMG_1390.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:300px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div>And the highlight of this place was the greek theatre. \u00a0Marvellously intact, with an entrace hallway, tunnels to walk through to your seats, and bits of the staging and set still on show.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Dinner back in Noto rounded off our day. \u00a0We found a reasonably good restaurant but the service was a bit brusque. \u00a0Never mind.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Sunday and Home<\/span><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Sunday was a real day of rest as we packed and prepared to head home. \u00a0Mostly spent around the hotel it was a good chance to chill out. \u00a0We blew a load of money on a last meal in the hotel which was GREAT! \u00a0I mean, it was one of the best meals I&#8217;ve EVER had. \u00a0If you&#8217;re in the area and not staying at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.masseriadegliulivi.com\/\">Masseria degli Ulivi<\/a>, then at least go and eat there!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Monday was heading home day. \u00a0The SatNav took us on a VERY weird route to the airport and failed completely to find us a petrol station. \u00a0The small scratches to the car went unnoticed. \u00a0And we were amused by the presence of a large number of older English people on our plane, who&#8217;d obviously all booked with the same tour operator. \u00a0Hearing one of them ordering &#8220;Four cappucino americanos&#8221; made me feel that I&#8217;d done quite well with my Italian, and my order of &#8220;Due cappucini e una panina&#8221; felt quite authentic in comparison.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The English baggage collection was surprisingly swift and collecting the car from the car park was a doddle. \u00a0Re-learning driving on the left was interesting and my brain was well confused for a while, especially at junctions and when we hit the motorway. \u00a0But I quickly got back into it.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>A great holiday, with a little stressful day surrounded by some amazing places and food. \u00a0Summing up the holiday was mostly done in my first post. \u00a0Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/week-in-sicily-introduction.html\">the highlights<\/a> there.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I leave you with one thing that confused and amused us. \u00a0Now, my Italian isn&#8217;t great, by any means, but I can mostly get by with at least reading signs and notices. \u00a0This bottle baffled though,<br \/>\n as the best translation I could do of &#8220;Con il suo gusto morbido e delicato&#8230;&#8221; was &#8220;With the delicate taste of death&#8230;&#8221;<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWCzxrYfI\/AAAAAAAAEPA\/77ITc8XwifM\/s400\/IMG_1418.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWCzxrYfI\/AAAAAAAAEPA\/77ITc8XwifM\/s400\/IMG_1418.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:300px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Perhaps someone else knows better?<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Note: Google claims that &#8220;morbido&#8221; means &#8220;delicate&#8221;. \u00a0Hey &#8211; easy mistake to make!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWPlkYSiI\/AAAAAAAAEP4\/RYn57H9BtYE\/s400\/IMG_1436.JPG\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.ggpht.com\/__353xnCqQbI\/SPTWPlkYSiI\/AAAAAAAAEP4\/RYn57H9BtYE\/s400\/IMG_1436.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width:400px;height:300px;margin:0 auto 10px;\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n",
