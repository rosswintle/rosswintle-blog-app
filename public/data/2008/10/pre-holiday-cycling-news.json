No. \u00a0So let&#8217;s do some work on balancing that out.<\/li>\n<li>Is my saddle straight? \u00a0Yes, and it&#8217;s at a good height too. \u00a0But I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m sat on it straight. \u00a0Maybe I sag to one side a little? \u00a0Have to think about my position there too.<\/li>\n<li>What about my feet? \u00a0Well, my cleats (the clips on the bottom of cycling shoes that clip into &#8220;clipless&#8221; pedals), weren&#8217;t in the same position on both feet &#8211; so I&#8217;ve adjusted them, and replaced the cleats at the same time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Will all this make a difference? \u00a0It&#8217;s hard to say right now as I&#8217;ve not done a longer ride for a while. \u00a0It will be interesting to see how things are now.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Of course, in the background the stretching and strength work that I don&#8217;t do enough of will have to continue too, and as the nights draw in perhaps I&#8217;ll get more opportunity to do that. \u00a0Then, come next spring, I&#8217;ll be REALLY fit and ready to go!<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Maybe.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",
