        "rendered": "<p>I&#8217;m a cyclist &#8211; you can probably tell that &#8211; and I love all sports of different kinds.  But there&#8217;s one that I&#8217;ve never got on with&#8230;running!  It knackers my kness and every time I try to take it up I have to give up quite quickly because I&#8217;m in pain.<\/p>\n<p>So instead, I tend to run by proxy.  I know so many people who are really into running, and I engage with other runners by talking about&#8230;err&#8230;other runners.  I&#8217;m a middle man in the running circles of Swindon.<\/p>\n<p>So, with today being the Swindon Half Marathon, my duty was not as a runner, but as a supporter.<\/p>\n<p>It was a beautiful day for it &#8211; if anything too hot &#8211; and Sally and I pedalled out on our bikes to a fine spot on the course where we would see people running out (at about 3 miles) and back in (at about 9 miles) from the same place.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m not really sure what to do as a running-race supporter, or how to cheer people on.  We clapped a lot.  In fact, we clapped almost non-stop for about 3 hours!  And we called people&#8217;s names and shouted things like &#8220;Well done&#8221; and &#8220;Keep Going&#8221;, but it all feels a bit lame.<\/p>\n<p>The hard core runners seem to view this as a distraction, and they keep focussed on the road ahead, barely acknowledging your presence.  The ones at the back seem to appreciate it more, and occasionally engage in some banter.  When I told one friend &#8220;Keep going!  You&#8217;re doing well!&#8221; he shouted back &#8220;No I&#8217;m not!&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>So, I hope we helped some people along.<\/p>\n<p>It was quite inspiring too.  This was a small race of only around 1500 people, but it seemed to be a LOT from where we were standing.  My sister and her boyfriend are pretty quick but there were a surprisingly large number of people running at a similar pace.  It all made me think that surely running 13 miles is something that I could do.<\/p>\n<p>One friend of mine called back &#8220;Your turn next year Wintle!&#8221; as he ran past.  Perhaps he&#8217;s right.  Perhaps I should try again, take it easy, build up slowly and have a go at running with the aim of running next year&#8217;s Swindon Half.<\/p>\n<p>Hmmm&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>To finish, I pay my respect to those I know who ran.  I&#8217;m hugley impressed by their commitment and effort.  Sarah, Guy, Dave, Carol, James, Mike, Stevo, Ray&#8230;well done!<\/p>\n",
