<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Moving home</h1></header><main><p>Dear very small readership</p>
<p>The long and short of this (well, the short of it) is that I&#8217;m going to move by blog away from Google&#8217;s Blogger to WordPress in the near future.  This will mean that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The URL will remain the same.</li>
<li>EXCEPT&#8230;if you read a feed this will probably be at a new URL (probably <a href="https://rosswintle.uk/feed/">https://rosswintle.uk/feed/</a>).  As this is a new feed you may initially see posts that you&#8217;ve already seen.</li>
<li>There will be a new look &#8211; which may change again in the near future.  (I&#8217;m working on a Magic Roundabout, road-sign styled theme.  But my graphic design skills aren&#8217;t much good and I don&#8217;t really have the time!  We&#8217;ll see).</li>
<li>You may need a new login to submit comments.  I&#8217;m reviewing how to play this one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apologies for the inconvenience.  A detailed explanation (the long of it) is below.</p>
<p>I actually first started Blogging several years ago &#8211; I was an &#8220;early adopter&#8221; if you like.  I made a few posts and then gave up &#8211; partly out of embarassment.</p>
<p>Last year my writing took off, partly as a form of therapy during a difficult time of life, partly as a way to track and report what was going on with me health wise, and it&#8217;s just bumbled on since then.  Regular readers will know that it&#8217;s mostly notes to self that I hope will be informative/interesting to others, and I hope that my writing will continue in that form.</p>
<p>And alongside this I&#8217;m a big fan off Google&#8217;s online services.  I know that some think they&#8217;re evil, but things like GMail and Google Reader are so feature-rich and easy to use&#8230;and growing in features too&#8230;that I&#8217;m hooked.</p>
<div></div>
<div>The one service that, in my opinion, hasn&#8217;t kept up and that suffers from being Google&#8217;s, is Blogger &#8211; the software that publishes this blog.  Specific niggles would be:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Pages are big and take long to download</li>
<li>Templates are tricky to edit (even for a relative expert like me!)</li>
<li>Photos from URLs are a nightmare to add and integration with Google&#8217;s own Picasaweb and the competitor&#8217;s Flickr is non-existent.</li>
</ul>
<div>I&#8217;ve recently started hosting my own, private journal over at WordPress.com and it&#8217;s REALLY impressed me.  It&#8217;s fast, it uses good, open standards, it&#8217;s got a great dashboard (and an even better one with v2.7 which is awesome!) and it&#8217;s being developed at quite a rate of knots.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So shifting &#8220;Magic Roundabouts&#8230;&#8221; is a no-brainer for me.  There&#8217;s a little work to do, but WordPress even imports from Blogger &#8211; comments, users and all.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There MAY in fact be two shifts.  I&#8217;m contemplating where to host but want to move quick.  In all cases, I&#8217;ll keep you posted.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Thanks for reading and for bearing with us during non-essential maintenance.</div>
