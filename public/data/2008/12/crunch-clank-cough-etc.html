<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Crunch, Clank, Cough, etc</h1></header><main><p>Both Fuzzy and I have been ill of late.  I&#8217;ve had the same cold (I think) three times now and still feel like I&#8217;m fighting it off.  There seems to be a lot of nasty bugs around this winter.</p>
<div></div>
<div>And Fuzzy &#8211; the poor bike &#8211; started, well, it started with the odd clank and crunch that I thought was coming from the bottom bracket (where the axle of the pedals go through the frame), but as time went on:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>it seemed to get worse; and </li>
<li>I worked out it was coming from the rear axle.</li>
</ol>
<div>Bizarrely, it was worse when I applied the brakes and even made the noise when I was freewheeling (that&#8217;s how I worked out it wasn&#8217;t the bottom bracket).</div>
<div></div>
<div>Anyway, he&#8217;s been to the shop now and they&#8217;re replaced a cone and the bearings in the rear axle.  I&#8217;ve yet to take him out &#8216;cos I&#8217;ve been driving, because I&#8217;ve wanted to rest and fight my bugs off.  But in the next few days I should get a ride and start building up the fitness again after three weeks off.</div>
