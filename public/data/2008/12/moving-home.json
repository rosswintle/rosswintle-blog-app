This will mean that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The URL will remain the same.<\/li>\n<li>EXCEPT&#8230;if you read a feed this will probably be at a new URL (probably <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/feed\/\">https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/feed\/<\/a>).  As this is a new feed you may initially see posts that you&#8217;ve already seen.<\/li>\n<li>There will be a new look &#8211; which may change again in the near future.  (I&#8217;m working on a Magic Roundabout, road-sign styled theme.  But my graphic design skills aren&#8217;t much good and I don&#8217;t really have the time!  We&#8217;ll see).<\/li>\n<li>You may need a new login to submit comments.  I&#8217;m reviewing how to play this one.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Apologies for the inconvenience.  A detailed explanation (the long of it) is below.<\/p>\n<p>I actually first started Blogging several years ago &#8211; I was an &#8220;early adopter&#8221; if you like.  I made a few posts and then gave up &#8211; partly out of embarassment.<\/p>\n<p>Last year my writing took off, partly as a form of therapy during a difficult time of life, partly as a way to track and report what was going on with me health wise, and it&#8217;s just bumbled on since then.  Regular readers will know that it&#8217;s mostly notes to self that I hope will be informative\/interesting to others, and I hope that my writing will continue in that form.<\/p>\n<p>And alongside this I&#8217;m a big fan off Google&#8217;s online services. \u00a0I know that some think they&#8217;re evil, but things like GMail and Google Reader are so feature-rich and easy to use&#8230;and growing in features too&#8230;that I&#8217;m hooked.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>The one service that, in my opinion, hasn&#8217;t kept up and that suffers from being Google&#8217;s, is Blogger &#8211; the software that publishes this blog. \u00a0Specific niggles would be:<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Pages are big and take long to download<\/li>\n<li>Templates are tricky to edit (even for a relative expert like me!)<\/li>\n<li>Photos from URLs are a nightmare to add and integration with Google&#8217;s own Picasaweb and the competitor&#8217;s Flickr is non-existent.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div>I&#8217;ve recently started hosting my own, private journal over at WordPress.com and it&#8217;s REALLY impressed me. \u00a0It&#8217;s fast, it uses good, open standards, it&#8217;s got a great dashboard (and an even better one with v2.7 which is awesome!) and it&#8217;s being developed at quite a rate of knots.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>So shifting &#8220;Magic Roundabouts&#8230;&#8221; is a no-brainer for me. \u00a0There&#8217;s a little work to do, but WordPress even imports from Blogger &#8211; comments, users and all.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>There MAY in fact be two shifts. \u00a0I&#8217;m contemplating where to host but want to move quick. \u00a0In all cases, I&#8217;ll keep you posted.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Thanks for reading and for bearing with us during non-essential maintenance.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n",
