<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Maybe not so bad afterall</h1></header><main><p>OK, so I was learning JavaScript from a JavaScript cookbook, which probably isn&#8217;t the best way.  It&#8217;s still a nasty language but a quick couple of hours with a decent reference book (the O&#8217;Reilly JavaScript Pocket Reference) and it&#8217;s all making a lot more sense, BUT, I might add, I still think it&#8217;s a bit of a daft language.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also finding that though it&#8217;s quite powerful (&#8220;powerful&#8221; languages are usually flexible, and therefore complex, &#8220;helpful&#8221; and prone to unpredictable behaviour), you have to write a lot of code to do something very simple.</p>
<p>For example, one thing I want to do is create a new row in a table.  I can do this by calling the &#8220;insertRow&#8221; method of a table element.  But I then have to call the insertCell method of the row element to create all the cells.  And I then need to append some HTML or text into each cell (even if it&#8217;s just a &amp;nbsp;)  to make the cells appear to look right.  What a faff!</p>
<p>I suppose I want all things though.  A simple language with predictable behaviour, but one in which I don&#8217;t have to write much code to do what I want.</p>
<p>Yes&#8230;now if someone can just create that my life will be complete!</p>
