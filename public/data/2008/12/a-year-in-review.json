&#8211; an idea which hasn&#8217;t taken off in a big way but which is still milling around.\u00a0 My old friend and ex-colleague <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/04\/24\/a-tribute-to-peter-amey\/\">Peter Amey<\/a> lost his long fight against cancer.\u00a0 And we had a go at <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/04\/24\/freecycling\/\">Freecycling<\/a> some of our stuff &#8211; which turned out to be a joy!<\/p>\n<p><strong>May<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well into Spring and with summer coming we had to get some serious work in on the garden, <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/05\/03\/my-new-least-favourite-plants\/\">fighting off the weeds<\/a>\u00a0and generally <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/05\/11\/garden-progress\/\">making the vegetable patch useful<\/a> for growing vegetables in.\u00a0 We also discovered that we might, at some point, be involved in a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/05\/04\/church-planting\/\">missional church plant<\/a>!\u00a0 This is slowly becoming reality but in God&#8217;s time, not ours!<\/p>\n<p><strong>June<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The summer was a bit of a wash out from what I remember, but we had glorious weather for <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/06\/01\/the-week-in-summary\/\">M and A&#8217;s Wedding<\/a> with a fantastic reception at the Four Pillars\u00a0Hotel.\u00a0 We started <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/06\/13\/shopping-beer-and-slugs\/\">waging war against the slugs<\/a> and we <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/06\/14\/having-a-wii\/\">bought a Wii <\/a>(which I posted some <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/11\/02\/the-wii\/\">more detailed comments <\/a>on later in the year) and a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/11\/08\/getting-wii-fit\/\">Wii Fit<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>July<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This was a good cycling month.\u00a0 Well, it started badly by <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/07\/01\/the-green-cross-code\/\">crashing into a schoolgirl<\/a>, but I was subsequently inspired with new cycling gadgets (<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/07\/12\/race-blades-tm\/\">Race Blades<\/a> and a <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/08\/06\/garmin-forerunner-50-heart-rate-monitor\/\">Garmin Heart Rate Monitor<\/a>),\u00a0the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/07\/17\/lots-of-bike-news\/\">Swindon Cycle Challenge<\/a>\u00a0(which I was quite <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/11\/07\/eek-im-an-evangelist\/\">an evangelist <\/a>for)\u00a0and the long, warm days.\u00a0 We had a week&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/08\/28\/holidays-part-1-a-holiday-in-northern-ireland\/\">holiday in Northern Ireland<\/a>\u00a0and, amazingly, stuff seemed to actually be growing in our garden.\u00a0 Finally, internet search engine Cuil was lanched and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/07\/28\/how-cuil\/\">I\u00a0did my best at putting it through its paces<\/a> on behalf of the world.\u00a0 This was a good month!<\/p>\n<p><strong>August<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Was WET.\u00a0 Which presented it&#8217;s own <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/08\/20\/wet-weather\/\">set of cycling problems<\/a>, but I found a dry day on which to do <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/08\/23\/small-improvements\/\">my longest bike ride so far<\/a>\u00a0and Sally spent 10 days away at the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/08\/26\/a-visit-to-yomac\/\">YOMAC Residential<\/a>\u00a0&#8211; the start of something good as running YOMAC is now part of her job!<\/p>\n<p><strong>September<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/09\/03\/google-chrome\/\">Google launched Chrome<\/a>.\u00a0 We started <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/09\/08\/the-harvest\/\">harvesting<\/a> from the garden.\u00a0 We took up <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/09\/30\/dancing\/\">latin and ballroom dance classes<\/a> (well, we did that in the summer but I only just got around to writing about it), and we had a fantastic <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/09\/30\/on-the-leftagain\/\">holiday in Sicily<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>October<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Looks like I spent most of October writing up our holiday to Sicily!\u00a0 But there were lots more new things too.\u00a0 We somehow found time to cheer on our friends in the <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/12\/clapped-out\/\">Swindon Half Marathon<\/a>, I started to try <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/15\/playing-with-symfony\/\">learning web development methods <\/a>(and I still am).\u00a0 I took up <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/16\/new-gamenew-dangers\/\">a dangerous new sport<\/a>.\u00a0 And <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/10\/19\/discipleship-academy-and-soulspace\/\">Discipleship Academy and Soul Space<\/a> had inspiring starts at church.\u00a0 I also took up leading music in church, but I don&#8217;t seem to have written anything about it here.<\/p>\n<p><strong>November<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Was busy and I didn&#8217;t get to write much.\u00a0 But busy is good!\u00a0 We finally seemed to <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/11\/19\/a-busy-time\/\">find the source of the rats, we did a grand tour of the north and had &#8220;fun&#8221; at Ikea<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>December<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Nights drew in and with colds and busy times at work we weren&#8217;t up to much.\u00a0 I found time to <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/12\/21\/a-successful-move\/\">move the blog<\/a> to its new home and get <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2008\/12\/21\/spin-spin-spin-the-wheel-of-fortune\/\">intrigued by roulette<\/a> at my work Christmas party.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Looking back<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So, what a year!\u00a0 It&#8217;s not felt like we&#8217;ve done much.\u00a0 The garden was neglected, we didn&#8217;t do as much house decorating as we would have liked, but looking back, we&#8217;ve done a heck of a lot!\u00a0 God has been at work, healing me back in February and\u00a0leading us towards new bits of work and new involvement in our community, and we thank God for working in our lives.<\/p>\n<p>Our hopes next year are for another year of being settled in Swindon and of good health, especially for me.\u00a0 We hope that the Church Plant will take off and that that will be something we&#8217;re a part of.\u00a0 We hope for another successful harvest (after another load of hard work).\u00a0 We hope that we&#8217;ll get our bedroom decorated, and clear out a load of stuff from the house at the same time.\u00a0 We hope that, in this time of difficulty for business, we&#8217;ll both be putting our trust in our God and not in our jobs or our money or our posessions.\u00a0 And above all, we pray that God will, again, be a part of our lives in 2009.<\/p>\n",
