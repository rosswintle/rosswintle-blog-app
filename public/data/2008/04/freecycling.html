<p>Freecycling is a term used for giving old stuff away.  Internet groups exist, usually for a given location, such as a town.  People post on these groups messages to say &#8220;I&#8217;m giving something away&#8221; and others respond to the group with &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll have that please&#8221;, and then they come round and get it from you.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great way to re-use and recycle unwanted, and in some cases, broken, stuff.</p>
<p>I was a little sceptical though.  Did I want strangers coming to my house?  What sort of quality would the goods on offer be?  Won&#8217;t people just grab things and sell them on eBay or take them to car boot sales?</p>
<p>But I have to say that we&#8217;ve had some really good experiences.  We&#8217;ve given away a few things, which has been a simple process and not at all scary having random visitors.  Plus, we&#8217;ve acquired a blackboard.  You can&#8217;t BUY a blackboard anywhere, so Sally posted a &#8220;Wanted&#8221; message, and some lovely people were throwing out a child&#8217;s easel, which they stripped the plastic frame off, cleaned up, and gave to us.  It&#8217;s probably only worth a few quid but the people were lovely and helpful and we not have something that we wanted&#8230;.for free!</p>
<p>We have a box full of stuff that we&#8217;re going to give away in this way.  It&#8217;s GREAT!</p>
