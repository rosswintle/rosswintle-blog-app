Other things have just been more inportant of late.  BUT &#8211; the songs are back on my list this week and this is a special!</p>
<p>A while ago a friend of ours who&#8217;s heading out to Kenya on a mission trip this summer, asked if I&#8217;d like to be an act in their fundraising &#8220;Stars in their Eyes&#8221; night.  Well, that&#8217;s not actually how it happened, but anyway, myself and three other guys decided that we would be The Beatles for one night only.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve left it a bit late really &#8211; the show is on Saturday evening &#8211; but we&#8217;ve just met up and had a run through the song, and I think we&#8217;ll just about have an act.</p>
<p>Bizarrely, I don&#8217;t really know many Beatles&#8217; songs.  I mean, I don&#8217;t know them well.  I know lots of the songs but do I know the words?  Apparently not.  Bit of choruses and bridges but not a whole song.</p>
<p>So this has become song 10, and may well put me back on track.  I didn&#8217;t really learn the last three very well so I may have some revisiting to do.</p>
<p>A big &#8220;well done&#8221;, then, for getting us organised and actually picking the song, and a big cheer for Lydia, who&#8217;s faithfully following God&#8217;s call to service &#8211; may her fun night be truly blessed.</p>
