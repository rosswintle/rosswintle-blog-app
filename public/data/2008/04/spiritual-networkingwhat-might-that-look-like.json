Or is there something more?<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re looking at how to get something like this going on a small scale.  Google Groups, Yahoo Groups, a shared Blog, a closed Facebook Group and various other suggestions have been put forward, but I think we just have to choose one and go for it and see what happens!<\/p>\n",
