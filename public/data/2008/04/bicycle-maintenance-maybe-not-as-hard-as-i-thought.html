I asked questions on internet forums.  I read books and magazines.  And when it came to getting Fuzzy home I generally thought I knew what I was doing&#8230;and I was well prepared for a LOT of time and effort doing maintenance.</p>
<p>My first few rides, having fallen off, were tentative, and followed by a close inspection of parts.  But as time has gone on I&#8217;ve become less precious and Fuzzy&#8217;s not had much maintenance for a while now.</p>
<p>I kinda feel bad about this.  But also, he doesn&#8217;t really need it!  He&#8217;s a bit grubby, but he&#8217;s well lubricated, the brakes are still strong and the transmission is smooth as silk still.</p>
<p>The key, it seems, it making sure he&#8217;s looked after when he&#8217;s wet.  The books and forums all said to pay lots of attention to the chain, and to wipe down when you&#8217;ve been out in the rain.  And sure enough, this seems to have kept the bike in good nick.</p>
<p>I really MUST spend some time doing some proper cleaning and maintenance at some point but for now it seems that little and often is the key, and it&#8217;s much less work than I thought it would be.</p>
