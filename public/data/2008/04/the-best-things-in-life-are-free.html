<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">The Best Things in Life are Free</h1></header><main><p>This was going to be a humorous, <a href="http://www.fatcyclist.com">Fat-Cyclist</a>-Style list of the best feelings in the world, but for reasons that I can&#8217;t really bring myself to mention, I&#8217;ve decided just to write about the feeling that prompted the post in the first place.</p>
<p>With the longer days and the arrival of British Summer Time I&#8217;ve been doing my longer routes to and from work.  Which has been nice.</p>
<p>But you know what.  There&#8217;s one really great feeling that you get when doing a circular route, and that&#8217;s the feeling of turning 90 or more degrees, out of an uphill road with a headwind, onto a downhill road with a tailwind.  It&#8217;s a truly glorious feeling and it makes me very happy indeed!</p>
