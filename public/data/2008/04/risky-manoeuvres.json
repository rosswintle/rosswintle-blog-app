        "rendered": "<p>I&#8217;m beind with updates again, including a big write up of our holiday exploits.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a busy week, and with a 15 hour day at work on Wednesday, I was due a few late morning in, so I&#8217;ve been making use of my longer, 8.5 mile commute to work.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had two little incidents that are worth writing up.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday I did something a bit silly.  I was frustrated following a tractor that was doing about 12mph on a single track road.  It&#8217;s was slightly downhill and the wind was behind me so I should have been able to do a steady 25mph, if not more.  There were three cars backed up behind it and I was following behind them.  I saw that the road was getting a bit wider, so I nipped up the outside of the cars and went for it to get past the tractor.<\/p>\n<p>It was only when I pulled alongside that I noticed the road wasn&#8217;t too good at the edges.  So here I am, on the road bike, riding over rough and unpredictable ground, with a great big tractor about 4 feet to my left.<\/p>\n<p>It seemed like a good idea at the time, but looking back on it I really scared myself.  One wrong move and I was under a tractor wheel.  I&#8217;ll be more careful next time.<\/p>\n<p>So if Thursday&#8217;s ride in had something that could have damaged me physically, today&#8217;s ride home presented an overtaking opportunity that could have dented my pride.  I read an article a while ago (that I can&#8217;t find now) about overtaking, and how you need to be careful &#8216;cos if the person you pass is better than you they&#8217;ll hunt you down and get you back &#8211; to your shame!<\/p>\n<p>And so, a mile or so into my 5.5 miles home, I catch up with a woman on a road bike.  She has pretty strong looking legs, a nice bike with a ridiculously small cassette (that&#8217;s the rear gears), some semi-pro-looking, sponsored bike wear and jersey pockets stuffed full of stuff.  All of which says &#8220;I&#8217;m on a long ride and quite capable of outpacing you for a long time&#8221;.  But she was doing about 15mph up a slight incline &#8211; where I&#8217;d be doing 19 or 20!<\/p>\n<p>What do you?  Is it polite to breeze past in my relatively-amateur-looking gear on my commute home?  It seems like an insult.  And if I do pass is she going to hunt me down and breeze effortlessly past me shouting that I should try harder?  Should I wave?  Say &#8220;hi&#8221;?  Ring my bell?  All compounded by that fact that she&#8217;s a woman and any form of communication could be misinterpreted.<\/p>\n<p>AARRGHH!!!!!<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, just like with the tractor, I decided to go for it.  I sped up.  I got past.  I maintained my extra pace for as long as my tired legs would let me.   I looked back.  And she was nowhere to be seen.<\/p>\n<p>Result!<\/p>\n<p>In fact, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bikeradar.com\/news\/article\/humour-a-passing-score-12522\">FatCyclist&#8217;s overtaking point system<\/a> I reckon I got 6 points for passing one cyclist!  Though I&#8217;m not sure if the shaved legs points count for a woman.<\/p>\n<p>So, body and pride intact after 2 risky manoeuvres &#8211; it&#8217;s been a good week&#8217;s cycling!<\/p>\n",
