<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Getting Old</h1></header><main><p>It&#8217;s official&#8230;I&#8217;m getting old.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the evidence:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Exhibit A:  Gardening is a major preoccupation.</span></p>
<p>Had you not noticed?  Yes, my thoughts are consumed with when I&#8217;ll next be able to mow the lawn, how to keep weeds at bay, when to harvest the potatoes, when to feed, what the best way is to kill slugs, what the weather will be and so on.  It takes up a lot of time and energy.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s great fun and highly rewarding!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Exhibit B: We talk with our friends about mortgages and interest rates.</span></p>
<p>A natural thing to do as a homeowner!  But it happens so naturally.  You just suddenly stop and realise that you&#8217;ve been using phrases like &#8220;overpayment fund&#8221; and &#8220;fixed rate&#8221; and talking about things that will happen in 20 years time.</p>
<p>Sad and scary.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Exhibit C: Holidays</span></p>
<p>Our choice of holiday destination seems to have gone awry.  We went on holiday to Northern Ireland.  And enjoyed it.  Need I say more?</p>
<p>Well I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>We were fascinated by The Giant&#8217;s Causeway.</li>
<li>We visited National Trust properties at the drop of a hat.</li>
<li>We visited an RSPB outpost and spent and hour watching puffins through binoculars.</li>
<li>We and had an interesting tour of an Uncle and Aunt&#8217;s garden on the way home.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Exhibit D: Food</span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a fussy eater (maybe that is a sign of getting old too?), but it&#8217;s slightly concerning that we get excited about things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>New potatoes</li>
<li>Sweet potatoes</li>
<li>Dried cranberries</li>
<li>Mixed nuts and seeds</li>
<li>Granary bread</li>
<li>Muesli</li>
</ul>
<p>while shunning, with a righteous indignation, any mention of McDonalds, KFC and Pizza Hut.</p>
<p>I still love a good curry though!!!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there are many other things that would put Sally and I into a more &#8220;mature&#8221; demographic, not the least of which is my greying hair.  But we both fight to retain our inner youth and we have great fun flitting between youthfulness and grown-up-ness.  May that be the way for many years to come.</p>
