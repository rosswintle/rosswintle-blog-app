The cycling has been going really well of late and I put in a record 254 miles in July.  I&#8217;m not injured and I&#8217;m feeling strong and fit, which is great!</p>
<p>August, though, for various, non-cycling-related reasons has prompted lots of shorter rides and I&#8217;ve mostly just been doing my standard commutes.  We&#8217;re two thirds in and I&#8217;ve only done 89 miles.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve also been thinking about mixing up my exercise a bit.  I bailed out of a long ride the other day due to being totally soaked through, and Sally and I went for a game of squash instead, which was pretty fun!  And just yesterday I went to the gym for the first time in a long time to do some rowing (man, I hate those machines, but it&#8217;s very good for me), cross training and resistance work (weights machines).</p>
<p>My ride in this morning felt pretty good, so maybe this will be a new way to get even more of a boost!</p>
<p>Though I have to say, there&#8217;s still nothing like a good, long ride on a nice day and when I am getting out for 10 miles or more it&#8217;s always with a lot of happiness!</p>
