<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Domain Settings</h1></header><main><p>Quick note for any regular readers (I think there might be two of you!), I&#8217;ve been playing with some technical jiggery-pokery (DNS sub-domain/CNAME entries to be exact) and have managed to make Blogger look like it&#8217;s on my own domain.  Woo hoo!</p>
<p>So, hopefully, regardless of where it&#8217;s hosted (this MAY be under review), my blog should now always be at https://rosswintle.uk/</p>
<p>Not just a pretty face eh?</p>
