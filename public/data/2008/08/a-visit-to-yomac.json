I had to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>get to know everyone, despite only being there for just over 24 hours;<\/li>\n<li>help out with some of the work;<\/li>\n<li>try desperately NOT to chip in too much (the project is led by the youth with adults just facilitating);<\/li>\n<li>find my way around the campsite and bothey;<\/li>\n<li>stay out of people&#8217;s way where necessary;<\/li>\n<li>learn the in-jokes and find my way around some of the more difficult aspects of communication and relationships that go on in any 10-day residential with hugely diverse people;<\/li>\n<li>find some quality time with Sally;<\/li>\n<li>and, of course, I wanted to feel like I&#8217;d left my mark, been myself and made a difference.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It was a bit of a mental, physical and emotional juggling and it left me pretty tired.<\/p>\n<p>But, what I saw while there was a hugely diverse group of young people aged 14-19 with a huge passion for educating people about climate change, working their socks of and contributing all sorts of wonderful gifts and talents to the cause.<\/p>\n<p>There were actors, artists, scientists, IT &#8220;geeks&#8221;, vegans and meat-eaters, nature lovers and city-slickers, people who love camping and people who hate it.  They were from all over the country and haven&#8217;t spent much time together but they got on like a really good team.  They were bright and understood not only climate change issues but a whole variety of other political issues.<\/p>\n<p>I was really very impressed with the young people.  The news may portray the bad things about our youth: knife crime, grafitti, yobs and hoodies; but the opposite end of that scale is people like the ones I met on Saturday: talented, hard working, committed, fun, intelligent teenagers who want to make a positive impact on the world in which they live.<\/p>\n<p>Go YOMAC!<\/p>\n",
