<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Behind with the Times</h1></header><main><p>This is a bit of an unstructured brain-dump of where certain techie things are in my head right now.</p>
<p>I wrote about<a href="http://wintle.blogspot.com/2008/02/taking-up-twittering-as-facebook-flops.html"> my use of Twitter </a>a while back.  One of the boons of this has been watching the inspiring little comments of an old Bathonian friend of mine.</p>
<p>My friend (I won&#8217;t name him unless he reads this and decides he would like me to) is&#8230;well&#8230;I don&#8217;t really know what he does now.  I think he used to work for the Institute of Physics or something, as a web designer, and he seems to have continued in a similar line of work.  And now, in the absence of anyone else, he&#8217;s my personal guru for all things web design, Web 2.0, blogs, social networking and so on.  I guess he inspires my inner-geek.</p>
<p>And I do have a part of me that thrives on this stuff.  I love the interesting ways that people make innovative use of technology to achieve useful, and sometimes beautiful things.  Here are some other little web-based things that I&#8217;ve come across since following this person:</p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a> &#8211; great way to discover new music<br />&#8211; <a href="http://www.mycyclinglog.com">mycyclinglog.com</a> &#8211; my current bike logger<br />&#8211; <a href="http://identi.ca">identi.ca</a> &#8211; open alternative to Twitter<br />&#8211; <a href="http://ping.fm">ping.fm</a> &#8211; update multiple statuses/micro-blogs from one place<br />&#8211; <a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a> &#8211; a rediscovery of the old alternative web-browser</p>
<p>But not just those practical things.  My curiosity about the way people are using the web to communicate and interact has been roused.  I&#8217;m intrigued how people are creating web sites that are simple, functional and well-designed.  Things not only of purpose but of beauty.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m feeling behind and afraid though.  I barely know Java and have heard only rumours of Ajax, let alone other &#8220;next big things&#8221;.  I&#8217;ve been toying with client-side scripting, servlets, application frameworks, but not digging deep.  I have an excellent grounding in Computer Science and an inquisitive mind, but there&#8217;s so much to learn and I don&#8217;t have time enough to invest to satisfy my curiosity, let alone learn anything of much use.  And where would I start?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid because of security, the nature of my online identity. I&#8217;m generally very open, as readers of this blog would know, but there&#8217;s stuff that I don&#8217;t want out there on the internet (mostly about other people and work, but sometimes about me).  Can I throw myself into the online world of sharing so much with so many in safety?  Do I want <a href="http://www.brightkite.com">BrightKite.com</a> telling everyone where I am all the time?</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s the issue of time.  My feed list in <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> continues to grow and reading, as well as writing, is a chore.  Could I read the Twitter entries of more than about 20 people and have a real life too?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also uncertain about who to take on the journey with me.  In many ways I&#8217;m a long way ahead of my peers and I&#8217;d love to be able to introduce others to my personal world of customised web sites, RSS and Atom feeds, alternative browsers and web presence because I think these things are useful tools.  But would they get it?  How confusing is it to a non techie?  There are so many places to be with new networks and tools appearing all the time. If I can barely keep up, how will they?</p>
<p>I think the web is an exciting, fun, and hugely creative place to be at the moment.  Yet it&#8217;s a big place.  A scary place.  A confusing place.  An ever-changing and unknown place.</p>
<p>My online interaction with the friend I mentioned above is a fine example of how the web can bring together people with a common cause or interest.  It can be a very negative place, but it can be inspiring and friendly too.  With my friend&#8217;s help I hope to continue to be a part of this strange world, and to introduce others to it, and maybe, one day, to be responsible for a small part of it.</p>
