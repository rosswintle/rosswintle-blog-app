But last year my health wasn&#8217;t great.  I had a heavy, clunky, cheap bike.<\/p>\n<p>Since then I&#8217;ve acquired Fuzzy (or possibly, Fuzzy acquired me &#8211; I can never quite tell), who&#8217;s lighter, more aerodynamic, with higher gearing and great climbing capability.  I&#8217;ve been riding further and faster far more often and should generally be a lot fitter.<\/p>\n<p>I was to my slight surprise then that I managed to do the ride today just 0.4 mph faster than last time!<\/p>\n<p>And thus, I must offer my excuses, for there are senses in which this wasn&#8217;t a controlled comparison.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I had the heart rate monitor on and, though I spent nearly an hour over my defined aerobic zone, I was very aware of not pushing too hard.  Last time I would just have been going flat out to the limit of my ability.<\/li>\n<li>There was a lesser tailwind.  I remember there being a strong westerly last time.  There was a slight south-westerly breeze today.<\/li>\n<li>I went to the gym on Wednesday and played squash on Friday &#8211; it was quite frantic, and so I was probably a bit tired and low on energy.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Err..that&#8217;s probably it!  I wish I could think of more.<\/p>\n<p>Still, I did about a mile and a half more this time around, still got in under 2 hours, and averaged 18.1 for the whole 2 hours (with one 5-minute break to stretch and eat a banana).<\/p>\n<p>It was a GLORIOUS day for it, and I passed a bunch of guys on better bikes, who were cycling to Pangbourne &#8211; a little further than I was going, but my pace was significantly faster!<\/p>\n<p>I felt a little woozy afterwards, despite taking in a whole water-bottle full of Rego, and my legs were pretty tired, so I feel like I&#8217;ve pushed myself pretty hard.  I don&#8217;t really do leisurely.<\/p>\n<p>It was fun and I had a great day with my Uncle, Aunt and Cousin once I arrived and then caught the train back home.<\/p>\n<p>Must try it again sometime &#8211; only I&#8217;m quite quickly running out of summer!!!  Eeek!<\/p>\n",
