<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">A Visit to YOMAC</h1></header><main><p>Sally has been away this week at a residential camp for young people from all over the country involved in climate change projects.  I don&#8217;t explain it very well so check out http://www.youmeandtheclimate.org/ for a better explanation.</p>
<p>I popped down for the weekend to help out, see what was going on, and, yes, to spend some time with my lovely wife.</p>
<p>It was a difficult couple of days.  I had to:</p>
<ul>
<li>get to know everyone, despite only being there for just over 24 hours;</li>
<li>help out with some of the work;</li>
<li>try desperately NOT to chip in too much (the project is led by the youth with adults just facilitating);</li>
<li>find my way around the campsite and bothey;</li>
<li>stay out of people&#8217;s way where necessary;</li>
<li>learn the in-jokes and find my way around some of the more difficult aspects of communication and relationships that go on in any 10-day residential with hugely diverse people;</li>
<li>find some quality time with Sally;</li>
<li>and, of course, I wanted to feel like I&#8217;d left my mark, been myself and made a difference.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a bit of a mental, physical and emotional juggling and it left me pretty tired.</p>
<p>But, what I saw while there was a hugely diverse group of young people aged 14-19 with a huge passion for educating people about climate change, working their socks of and contributing all sorts of wonderful gifts and talents to the cause.</p>
<p>There were actors, artists, scientists, IT &#8220;geeks&#8221;, vegans and meat-eaters, nature lovers and city-slickers, people who love camping and people who hate it.  They were from all over the country and haven&#8217;t spent much time together but they got on like a really good team.  They were bright and understood not only climate change issues but a whole variety of other political issues.</p>
<p>I was really very impressed with the young people.  The news may portray the bad things about our youth: knife crime, grafitti, yobs and hoodies; but the opposite end of that scale is people like the ones I met on Saturday: talented, hard working, committed, fun, intelligent teenagers who want to make a positive impact on the world in which they live.</p>
<p>Go YOMAC!</p>
