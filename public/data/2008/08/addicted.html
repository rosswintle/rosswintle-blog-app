<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Addicted?</h1></header><main><p>Cycle mileage has been down of late as recent posts have explained.  But, in Sally&#8217;s absence, I&#8217;ve lined up a 34 mile ride to visit my Uncle in Cholsey (route something akin to <a href="http://www.bikely.com/maps/bike-path/Broad-Street-to-Cholsey">this</a> ) and I&#8217;m REALLY excited about it!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just put some a new front tyre on because some shards of glass hid ripped through my Continental Ultra Gator Duraskin (great, mostly slick tyres with heaps of grip, but, evidently, not THAT puncture proof).  I&#8217;ve tightened my brakes.  The weather is going to be perfect.  And the anticipation is building!</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be my longest ride for a while &#8211; in fact, it&#8217;ll be my longest ride ever.  The longest being the last time I did this route <a href="http://wintle.blogspot.com/2007/08/to-cholsey.html">almost exactly a year ago</a>!</p>
<p>I have better legs, lungs and heart, a better bike, and I should hopefully be up for beating my previous time of just under 2 hours.</p>
<p>Game on!!!!</p>
