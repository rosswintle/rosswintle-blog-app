<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Wet weather</h1></header><main><p>Another, fairly dull, cycling-related post I&#8217;m afraid.  More on the garden, slugs, harvesting, music and other stuff to come when I have some time.  If that&#8217;s not a tempting proposition that&#8217;ll make you bookmark my blog then I don&#8217;t know what will.  Hey, I lead an exciting life!!! ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been pretty wet lately.  And pretty unpredictably wet.  (&#8220;Welcome to England&#8221; I hear you cry&#8230;indeed!)  This has caused me some interesting problems like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I pack my wet weather gear when it&#8217;s looking dry?</li>
<li>Do I leave the office when it&#8217;s raining, or wait for it to clear up?</li>
<li>Do I don my wet weather gear, if I have it, before doing my commute?</li>
<li>How do I manage the problem of wet kit when I&#8217;ve been caught out and had a soaking?</li>
</ul>
<p>Inspiring stuff&#8230;I know!  (&#8220;Yawn&#8221;)</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve been thinking about expanding my wet weather wardrobe.  But in which direction?</p>
<p>Mostly my top-half is fine.  I have a waterproof cycling jacket (but, oh for a <a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/p/Cycle/7/Gore_Countdown_II_Waterproof_Jacket/5360030061/">Gore-TexÂ®PacliteÂ®Shell</a> &#8211; anyone care to donate me Â£130?), and your head just gets wet, that&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>The problem is shoes, socks, shorts and overtrousers.  My overtrousers aren&#8217;t cycling-specific and send water straight down into my shoes or over-shoes.  Without them my shorts get sodden and I&#8217;d still get wet shoes.  This might not be a bad thing if I had spare shorts.  My summer gloves also get soaked and I don&#8217;t have spares.  The upshot of all this is that I&#8217;ve been getting wet, and my kit hasn&#8217;t had time to dry out.</p>
<p>And decent wet-weather kit isn&#8217;t cheap.  So what do I invest in?  Do I go for spare shorts?  Or proper over trousers?  Do I get a second pair of gloves, or put up with them as they&#8217;re not too bad to wear when wet.  What about waterproof socks?  Shoes?  3/4 length overshorts?</p>
<p>Hmm&#8230;</p>
<p>I claim that cycling is great in lots of ways, but kitting yourself out can be an expensive chore!</p>
