<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Dancing</h1></header><main><p>Earlier this year we took up Lating and Ballroom classes.  We&#8217;ve just started it again, so I thought I ought to write a bit about it.</p>
<div></div>
<div>Sally told a male colleague of hers at work today that we were going.  &#8220;He must be very tolerant&#8221;, came the response.  It&#8217;s funny the responses you get about dancing.  And I confess, I usually do go reluctantly because it&#8217;s something that Sally loves doing.  I also, almost always come away from the class feeling great, happy, and like I&#8217;ve had some real fun.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The image of latin and ballroom has been greatly helped by the BBC&#8217;s brilliant &#8220;Strictly Come Dancing&#8221;, where celebrities partner up with professional dancers to learn, in a matter of weeks, what most dancers learn in years.  It&#8217;s great entertainment, and has introduced many people, who would not have otherwise come across dancing as a social activity, to it &#8211; myself included.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Our classes are run by a bubbly, excitable, intelligent and patient teacher called Alison in a small village hall near Swindon.  When we started up earlier in the year we did a 10-week beginners course, and we learned the basics of the following dances:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Waltz</li>
<li>Social Foxtrot</li>
<li>Cha Cha Cha</li>
<li>Rhumba</li>
<li>Rock and Roll</li>
<li>Quickstep</li>
</ul>
<div>It&#8217;s quite amazing how much we cover in an hours lesson and we often leave with brains full of stuff that we&#8217;re determined to remember for next week.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Practice at home is hard, and we rarely actually do any social dancing.  But it&#8217;s great fun, and when we have been to disco&#8217;s or weddings and we&#8217;ve had the chance to use our &#8220;moves&#8221;, it&#8217;s been good.  Though there is a bit of me that cringes slightly because, we&#8217;re not REALLY good, and we probably look like we&#8217;re mediocre and trying hard&#8230;which we are&#8230;but something about that feels more embarassing that not dancing at all.  Oh well.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So today we started up the &#8220;Improvers&#8221; class with mostly a refresher of what we learned earlier in the year.</div>
<div></div>
<div>My legs hurt, my shoulders hurt, and I&#8217;ll probably be ridiculed by some (but not all) of my colleagues at work about it.  But you know what?  It was GREAT fun!</div>
