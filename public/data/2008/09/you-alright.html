<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">You alright?</h1></header><main><p>Some will know of my occasional anti-Englishness.  Sometimes our over-politeness causes huge complications.</p>
<div></div>
<div>My classic example being the &#8220;Do you want the last &#8230;.?&#8221; question, which actually means &#8220;I want the last &#8230;. ?&#8221;.  Why don&#8217;t we just say what we mean?</div>
<div></div>
<div>This has been bugging me a bit lately with people who use phrases like &#8220;How ya doin&#8217;?&#8221; and &#8220;Alright&#8221; as a brief greeting.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Normally this happens in a situation where, by the time you&#8217;ve said &#8220;Fine thanks, how are you?&#8221;, the person you&#8217;ve just passed in the corridor is too far away for a proper conversation to begin.  But if I just say &#8220;Fine thanks&#8221;, I feel that I&#8217;ve not taken an interest in how the other person is doing.  They&#8217;ve asked me, it would be polite to ask them back?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Answering &#8220;Alright?&#8221; with &#8220;Alright?&#8221; doesn&#8217;t seem to make much sense. But if we&#8217;re treating the initial &#8220;Alright?&#8221; as a greeting then I guess that&#8217;s&#8230;for want of a better word&#8230;alright?</div>
<div></div>
<div>I prefer to use peoples&#8217; names.  &#8220;Hello&#8221; by itself doesn&#8217;t work for me.  But &#8220;Hi James&#8221; or &#8220;Morning Paul&#8221; has a higher value &#8211; it implies that you know something about them, even if it&#8217;s just their name.  It shows that I know who they are!  And it encourages me to learn people&#8217;s names.</div>
<div></div>
<div>OK, OK, maybe I just think too much.  But I think this is important.  We can take a little piece of communication and use it for something more useful.  What if I don&#8217;t just know someone&#8217;s name, but I know that they&#8217;re little baby girl is in hospital.  Then my &#8220;Hi James&#8221; can become compassionate: &#8220;Hey James, how&#8217;s your girl?&#8221;.  Then suddenly we&#8217;re having a real conversation.</div>
<div></div>
<div>That would be more than alright with me!</div>
