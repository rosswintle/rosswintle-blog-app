<div>We returned yesterday from a week&#8217;s holiday in Sicily.  This has given me LOTS to write about, from a guide to the things we got up to in Sicily, some advice on using a Satellite Navigation system on the continent, some lessons in Sicilan culture and driving, and some thoughts on how incredibly difficult it must be to learn English.</div>
<div>Whether or not I find time to write all this up is another matter.</div>
<div>Oh, and we&#8217;ve had 2 more rats.  They won&#8217;t go away, they won&#8217;t stop coming in, and it&#8217;s becoming quite a serious problem now.  I wonder how much house-diagnosis I can do before I have to rip up the kitchen floor.</div>
