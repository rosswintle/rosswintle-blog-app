<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Cycling Corollorys</h1></header><main><p>My cycling activities seem to be governed by sods law.  Here is a list of how I think the rule applies to cycling.</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>The speed a cyclist attains is inversely proportional to the effort put in.  In the last couple of days I&#8217;ve done three rides.  Monday I flew without even trying.  Tuesday I went for it and was about 40 seconds slower.  Today I took it easy and enjoyed the ride and came in 20 seconds quicker than Tuesday.  How come???</li>
<li>The probability of acquiring a puncture increases with the reciprocol of the distance being travelled.  I.e. the further you go the less likely you are to get a flat.  This makes no sense at all but the evidence speaks for itself; my first puncture I got whilst pushing my bike up the garden path; my second on a short errand into town.</li>
<li>The chance of rain increases infinitely when you don&#8217;t have your waterproofs.  Need I say more?</li>
<li>Headwind speed increases exponentially with tiredness.</li>
<li>Someone always lights a bonfire at the top of a hill about 15 minutes before you arrive at the summit.</li>
</ol>
<div>I&#8217;m sure there are many more.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Grrrr.</div>
