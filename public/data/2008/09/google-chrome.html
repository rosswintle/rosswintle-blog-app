<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Google Chrome</h1></header><main><p>The Internet (and, indeed, the press in general) has been alive with talk of Google Chrome.  As always, I won&#8217;t have much to add to the masses of stuff that&#8217;s already been written, but here&#8217;s how Chrome has been for me.</p>
<div></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;">Hearing about it</span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;"><br /></span></div>
<div>Heck, it was only yesterday but it seems so long ago!  I guess I originally heard about it from my desktop alerts, or on one of the Blogs I follow on Google reader.  It all started when<a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/#"> a 38-page cartoon</a> explaining how Chrome came about and some of the design philosophy behind it (quite techie stuff!) was &#8220;accidentally&#8221; released before its scheduled time.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I confess, I put off reading this until it was all over the internet, at which point I thought&#8230;oh, well, go on then.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I was quite impressed with the ideas they were putting forward!  And started to get excited about an imminent download!</div>
<div></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;">First Impressions</span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;"><br /></span></div>
<div>I got to download quite late on Tuesday, so didn&#8217;t get to play much.  A second look on Wednesday has left me actually very impressed!</div>
<div></div>
<div>1) It&#8217;s fast.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There have been numerous benchmarks put forward but I use the global-standard, what-does-Ross-think test, and it rates as fast.  Seriously, my qualitative opinion is that it&#8217;s quicker then IE and Firefox for most of what I do.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The only real test I&#8217;ve done is where I have a page with a very large table that&#8217;s basically a dump of an entire database.  This took around 7 seconds on Firefox 3.  Chrome rendered it in less than 3 seconds!  Wow!</div>
<div></div>
<div>2) It&#8217;s neat.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Like most Google stuff, it just works!  Even version 0.2 works with pretty much everything I&#8217;ve thrown it at.  I just had some struggles with the &#8220;New&#8221; Faceboook, but that&#8217;s about it.  Flash, Javascript, Java, it all just seems to work.  Not bad for an early Beta.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There&#8217;s some really neat features that will please everyone, like the drag-and-drop tabs, the smart location bar, the quick dial.  OK, you can get some of these with Opera or with Extensions to Firefox, but they&#8217;re here and they&#8217;re nice.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There&#8217;s also stuff to appeal to techies.  A separate process viewer, ability to kill individual tabs&#8217; processes, DOM inspector and JavaScript debugger.  All pretty neat.</div>
<div></div>
<div>3) It&#8217;s simple</div>
<div></div>
<div>The UI is typically Google &#8211; clean and clever.  I like it.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Things it doesn&#8217;t have that I like?</div>
<div></div>
<div>I immediately missed mouse gestures, that Opera invented and that are copied with Firefox extensions.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I miss my Twitter client plug in &#8220;Twitterfox&#8221; &#8211; there are other Twitter clients, but running this inside my broswer keeps everything in one place.</div>
<div></div>
<div>And I was immediately baffled as to why Google&#8217;s browser didn&#8217;t make use of my online Google bookmarks.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But that&#8217;s about it!</div>
<div></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;">Privacy Issues</span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;"><br /></span></div>
<div>I noticed this myself before I spotted it circulating on the Internet.  The original EULA (User Agreement) contained a section which basically gave Google the right to use whatever you looked at or uploaded using Chrome.  It said this:</div>
<div></div>

<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse:collapse;font-family:Helvetica;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse:collapse;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:'times new roman';"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;">Scary!  I stopped using it at that point and questioned my commitment to Google&#8217;s services.</span></span></span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse:collapse;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:'times new roman';"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><br /></span></span></span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse:collapse;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:'times new roman';"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;">Fortunately, common sense has prevailed.  When I got to downloading it at home tonight the same section of the EULA simply said:</span></span></span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse:collapse;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:'times new roman';"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><br /></span></span></span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse:collapse;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:arial;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;">&#8220;You </span></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse:separate;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:arial;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style:italic;">retain copyright and any other rights that you already hold in Content that you submit, post or display on or through the Services</span>.&#8221;</span></span></span></span></span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;"><br /></span></div>
<div>A quick and interesting about turn.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Reading comments from Bloggers on this did get me thinking about how much data I trust Google with.  Some think we shouldn&#8217;t be paranoid about it, they just use it for targetting adverts at you.  Others think that we&#8217;re doing a mis-service to mankind as a whole when we give Google anything.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;m not quite sure where I stand on this.  I give a lot of data to Google because I find their services REALLY useful (and growing more so by the week!).  If someone else develops a better integrated set of apps I&#8217;ll go use that, but, to my knowledge, they haven&#8217;t.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Sainsbury&#8217;s get a lot of data from me because I like shopping there.  Is that a bad thing?</div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;m actually quite precious about security, especially online, and being a techie who&#8217;s aware of the risks makes me more so, but I&#8217;m also educated enough to know how to stop bad things happening&#8230;I think.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Anyone care to correct my view of privacy?  I&#8217;m open to hearing why Google are &#8220;evil&#8221;?</div>
<div></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;">Summary</span></div>
<div></div>
<div>This is a<br />
n early v0.2 Beta.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Wow!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Gimme the real thing soon please.  I like it a lot!</div>
