All prompted by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/t1mmyb\">t1mmyb<\/a>&#8216;s little note on Twitter the other day.<\/p>\n<p>I started out using Google Docs for tracking my times in a simple online spreadsheet.  This was OK but when it started getting big and unmanagable I started looking for something better, and decided to stick with www.bikejournal.com.  It&#8217;s a bit clunky but did a good job.<\/p>\n<p>But Tim pointed me at www.mycyclinglog.com.  A fab site which is slick, fast, looks nice and does some interesting things.  It also allows you to have a &#8220;badge&#8221; that you can stick on your blog (look right and down), it integrates with Facebook, and has RSS feeds.  I love it and I was an almost instant convert.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, in an odd kind of way, it&#8217;s reinvigorated my waning passion for cycling.  Tracking your times makes you want to improve your times!  Perhaps having them on public display will make me want to do that all the more!!<\/p>\n",
