These have been half written for ages now, and I have a few other notes that need writing to completion before publishing.  I&#8217;ve been surprised to have almost an entire week of free evenings and an almost free weekend, so it&#8217;s good catching up time&#8230;expect more backdated posts.</p>
<p>The question then is, how do I get regular time to write this thing?</p>
