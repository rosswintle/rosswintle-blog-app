I&#8217;d been asked to play guitar and so was part of a pretty good music team that was highly enjoyable to play with.  But one of the other benefits of being &#8220;up front&#8221; at a wedding is you can see the faces of the bride and groom as they say their vows &#8211; and they were ecstatic!!!<\/p>\n<p>The reception was at the Four Pillars Hotel in the Cotswold Water Park &#8211; a really swanky new place in a great location and way above your typical Hilton-type place.  The food was great and the band in the evening were awesome.<\/p>\n<p>A very special day!<\/p>\n<p>Just a shame I did my back in larking around with the lads&#8230;oops.<\/p>\n",
