Shopping is always interesting as we both have our little things we&#8217;re passionate about.  Fair trade, free range, recycled, compostable, organic, low-energy, locally sourced, etc.  And we&#8217;re fortunate enough to a) have the choice to buy these things b) be able to afford them!  So our shopping bill is probably quite high for a two-person household.</p>
<p>We also seem to buy a LOT of cereals!  I eat a combination of muesli, crunchy oat cereal and corn flakes for breakfast, and I snack on cereal bars during the day (either bought, or all-natural, home-made from&#8230;oats, muesli, seeds, dried fruit, honey, egg whites, and apple juice &#8211; recipe available on request).  Cereals also last a long time so we stock up whenever we&#8217;re in the shops.  I reckon about a third of our trolley load was cereals!  Maybe I&#8217;m addicted to oats?</p>
<p>We were also astonished to find cheap beer.  I mean CHEAP beer.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been using up some old, past-its-sell-by-date lager in beer traps to get the slugs in our garden (highly effective I might add!).  But we&#8217;ve run out, so I bought some Sainsbury&#8217;s &#8220;Basics&#8221; bitter.  For&#8230;wait for it&#8230;97p for 4 cans!!!</p>
<p>This is cheaper than coke!  It&#8217;s probably cheaper than bottled water.  I&#8217;ve heard about such beer on the news, but to actually see it in the shops is astounding.</p>
<p>Sally turned the cheap-beer thing into something light-hearted though by commenting that, because we&#8217;ve switched from lager to bitter, &#8220;we&#8217;ll probably catch the older, fatter slugs with beards now&#8221;.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll wait and see!</p>
