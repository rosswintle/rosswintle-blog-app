<p>At work I had a couple of days when all the things that annoy me came all at once.  You know, badly run meetings, poor organisation and communication, demanding people who think that the world revolves around them, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But the week has ended on a high with the wedding of a couple of friends of ours, which was incredibly joyful and fun!  I&#8217;d been asked to play guitar and so was part of a pretty good music team that was highly enjoyable to play with.  But one of the other benefits of being &#8220;up front&#8221; at a wedding is you can see the faces of the bride and groom as they say their vows &#8211; and they were ecstatic!!!</p>
<p>The reception was at the Four Pillars Hotel in the Cotswold Water Park &#8211; a really swanky new place in a great location and way above your typical Hilton-type place.  The food was great and the band in the evening were awesome.</p>
<p>A very special day!</p>
<p>Just a shame I did my back in larking around with the lads&#8230;oops.</p>
