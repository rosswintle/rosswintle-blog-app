<p>This was a problem when we first moved in and we initially fixed it by buying a new hose and doing it up really tight.  So I was a little disappointed to find it leaking again.</p>
<p>I mentioned this on the phone to my dad who said, quite cryptically, &#8220;wrap some PTFE tape around the thread&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s poly-terta-flouro-ethalene&#8221; (or something).</p>
<p>Oh well, I&#8217;ll look it up I thought.</p>
<p>Turns out it&#8217;s a minor miracle.  Why don&#8217;t people tell you things like this at school?  How are you supposed to find out?</p>
<p>Just wrap it (CLOCKWISE&#8230;to go with the thread) round the thread a few times, and screw the connector back on.  Drips gone!</p>
