Mostly joyful with the marriage of two good friends in London and good time spent with our old London church family.<\/p>\n<p>On Saturday I woke up feeling very tired and like I was fighting something off.  I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d make it through the wedding ceremony, but did , and was then prayed for and, praise the LORD, felt a whole load better.<\/p>\n<p>My back got better later in the week, and then has been suddenly and worryingly worse again today.  The pain has stopped being muscular and now feels like a sharp, nerve-type pain.  I was literally in tears with pain earlier.<\/p>\n<p>But time with the St Simons church family is always time of being inspired and challenged.  The focus of the weekend for me was putting God first.   I had some amazing conversations about this with people, heard amazing stories about how people have put God first, listened to God and followed what he&#8217;s telling them to do.  People who seem to have discovered (or are discovering) that when you really put God first, the other things sort themselves out.<\/p>\n<p>Even the sermon this morning, from the first chapter of the book of Jonah, was about putting aside &#8220;idols&#8221; to do what God wants us to do.  It was a real theme.<\/p>\n<p>I could write lots but God was very present this weekend.  I&#8217;m inspired to pray more, to listen to God more, to talk more openly about what God is doing, and about my faith.  The people of St Simon&#8217;s are so outward focussed, so keen to share what God is doing (and he&#8217;s doing lots).  I take courage from that.  And I&#8217;ve had some good times of prayer with others this weekend where the LORD has already spoken.<\/p>\n<p>So despite my physical ailments, lots to give thanks for.  I feel joyful despite my pain.  I have plenty of theological meat to chew on (anyone want to study the book of James with me?).  I have lots to get on and do too.<\/p>\n<p>The LORD is good and I pray today for J &amp; A who got married, that he will bless them with each other as much as I have been blessed with my own, beautiful, loving wife.<\/p>\n",
