I picked a tricky one to start but it&#8217;s mostly nailed. The trick will be remembering it in a week or so&#8217;s time.</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s been a bit of a nightmare with busy evenings, rats, water leaks, a trip to Leeds for work, the wedding at the weekend, and health problems, so I&#8217;ve picked an easy one &#8211; Angels.</p>
<p>I already know this song, won&#8217;t really need to learn the words (maybe a few), and I&#8217;ve tried to learn it before.  The only real thing to do is learn the chords properly.  A sure fire crowd-pleaser though don&#8217;t ya think?</p>
