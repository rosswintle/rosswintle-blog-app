<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">By Swindon, what a fantastic place?!</h1></header><main><p>One of the reason that we don&#8217;t like Swindon much is it doesn&#8217;t have much character or history or culture.  Or so we thought!</p>
<p>We were eating out the other night and ended up &#8211; for what reason I can&#8217;t remember &#8211; looking up Swindon on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swindon">Wikipaedia</a>.  Turns out it has some quite impressive claims as a town!</p>
<p>Swindon has a few &#8220;firsts&#8221;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Of course the Magic Roundabout was the first and, as far as I know, still is the only &#8220;multi-mini&#8221; roundabout!</li>
<li>The first recorded railway refreshment rooms</li>
<li>The UK&#8217;s first lending library</li>
</ul>
<p>It holds some records:</p>
<ul>
<li>More people have joined the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare_Krishna" title="Hare Krishna">Hare Krishna</a> movement in Swindon than in any other English town.</li>
<li>In May 2007 Swindon had the highest percentage of households with broadband internet access.</li>
</ul>
<p>And it has some claims on being the perfect town:</p>
<ul>
<li>The health system set up at the railway works was used as a blueprint for the NHS.</li>
<li>Apparently The Times recently listed Swindon as one of the top 20 places to buy a property in Britain.</li>
<li>&#8220;Swindon is considered to be an almost exact microcosm of the whole United Kingdom in its demographic make-up&#8221;</li>
<li>In 2007 an insurance company reported Swindon to be the second safest place to live in the UK!</li>
</ul>
<p>However, despite all those amazing things, our feelings about the town are summed up in this little factoid:</p>
<p>The father of The Nice Family (a caricature of a strictly disciplined, dull family) in Channel 4&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolutely" title="Absolutely">Absolutely</a>&#8221; exclaims &#8220;By Swindon, this is an inspiring tale!&#8221; during a particularly boring presentation by a travelling salesman.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Swindon!&#8221; &#8211; now there&#8217;s an exclamation that I might have to adopt!!</p>
