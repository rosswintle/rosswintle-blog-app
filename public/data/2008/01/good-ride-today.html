Not bad going.  Must get out and train more often &#8211; I loved it! ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it was a bit of a test of some new clothing too.  I got some &#8220;Seal Skinz&#8221; waterproof and windproof gloves.  Brilliant!  Not as breathable as I&#8217;d been lead to believe but my hands weren&#8217;t soggy.  The key thing was windproofing.  My hands were VERY warm &#8211; even more so than when I wear ski gloves.  It really is the wind that gets you cold.</p>
