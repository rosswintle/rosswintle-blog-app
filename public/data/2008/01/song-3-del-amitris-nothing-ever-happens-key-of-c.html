I&#8217;ve also done a bit of rehearsing Song 1 to bed it into my brain a bit.</p>
<p>This week Sally has challenged me to learn &#8220;Nothing Ever Happens&#8221; by Del Amitri.  I&#8217;m not even convinced that this is a well known, sing-along pop song.  But the chorus is pretty rousing, so worth a go.  I&#8217;ve downloaded from iTunes and the music and words are in one of my books.</p>
<p>At the end of this weel I&#8217;ll have covered three classes of song:</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficult music and difficult words (Fairytale of New York);</li>
<li>Difficult music and easy words (Angels&#8230;well, the chords were easy but I had to do more work to learn them than the words, which were already firmly in my head);</li>
<li>and Easy music and difficult words (Nothing Ever Happens)</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, this week is like memorising poetry.  Sally doesn&#8217;t make life easy!  Chords are C, F, Am, G, with a few others in the musical bridge.</p>
<p>Sally has pledged to learn to play along on the mandolin, which will make it more fun.  Perhaps I should make her learn the words too?</p>
