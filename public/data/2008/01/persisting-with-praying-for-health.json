        "rendered": "<p>Last year was a very difficult year for me, health-wise.  Read elsewhere if you don&#8217;t know why.<\/p>\n<p>I know that sometimes I&#8217;ve overreacted, I know that there are plenty of people with much worse things wrong with them.   But I&#8217;ve had more than my fair share of annoying, niggling, painful, exhausting, frustrating things that have kept me from feeling like myself and doing the things I love doing and feel called to do.<\/p>\n<p>As a Christian, one of the big things I have to deal with is the issue of suffering.  If I&#8217;m doing my best to please God and follow Jesus, why do I get persistent failures of health?  Why does God let this happen.  Why doesn&#8217;t God do something about it?<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no simple way to explain why suffering happens.  We just live in a world where things do go wrong &#8211; mostly it&#8217;s our own fault!  But I believe that God tries to use those difficult times and brings good out of them.<\/p>\n<p>Most of what I&#8217;ve been through is, as someone recently stated, &#8220;just stuff&#8221;.  Some of it&#8217;s caused by my own behaviour (e.g. bad posture, or cycling too hard and fast).  Some of it is just being ill &#8211; we get bugs, we fight them off, it happens!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned a lot through the last year.  God really has used it for good.  I&#8217;ve learned how I cope with illness.  How I don&#8217;t like to stop but I NEED to sometimes, and that&#8217;s OK, people don&#8217;t mind (in fact, they positively encourage it!).  I&#8217;ve learned to recognise and deal with stress.  I&#8217;ve learned about some physiology and a lot of psychology too!  It&#8217;s not been wasted suffering.<\/p>\n<p>But I am very frustrated with it and so I&#8217;m taking action.  I&#8217;m going to ask God if he WILL intervene and help me get better.  I think I&#8217;ve had enough and I want to be myself again, and I&#8217;m going to get some good people around me really, persistently, praying for good health for me.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, people have been praying all through the year, and I&#8217;ve had various &#8220;breakthroughs&#8221; as people have done so.  I believe that God does sometime heal miraculously.  I know that most of the time he doesn&#8217;t.  But I&#8217;m going to go and ask him and see what he thinks or says about it.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m not going to stop when I&#8217;m better, I&#8217;m going to get these people to keep praying that I stay well once I am well.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t a sermon on suffering or healing &#8211; I&#8217;m not qualified for that sort of thing.  It&#8217;s a statement about my beliefs and intentions.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get praying properly, let&#8217;s go and nag God a bit, and see what happens!<\/p>\n",
