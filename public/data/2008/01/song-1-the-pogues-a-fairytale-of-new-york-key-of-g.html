I&#8217;m almost embarassed to write anything because I&#8217;ll be writing my resignation post before I know it.  Still&#8230;let&#8217;s give it a go.</p>
<p>Week 1 of the new year&#8217;s challenge.  Learn a popular song every week for a year.</p>
<p>There were various discussions about which to do first, but I&#8217;ve decided on Sally&#8217;s suggestion of The Pogues&#8217; &#8220;A Fairytale of New York&#8221;.  Pretty simple music, mostly Gs, Ds and As with a few Bm&#8217;s, but with some interesting words.  It helps that the words kind of tell a story as it&#8217;s easier to remember.</p>
<p>The choice of a male/female duet may probe interesting too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve actually spent more time trying to learn the words than the music.  That will have to change.  The problem is that it&#8217;s one of those songs that I&#8217;ve heard a million time and I think I know some of the words from what they sound like.  e.g. I always thought the chorus bit was:</p>
<p>&#8220;The wise and the unwise singing (something) were singing going (something)&#8221;</p>
<p>when it&#8217;s actually</p>
<p>&#8220;The boys of the NYPD choir were singing Galway Bay&#8221;</p>
<p>which makes a LOT more sense.</p>
<p>In other &#8220;52 songs&#8221; news, I&#8217;ve using technology to help me!  I&#8217;ve started downloading some popular tracks from iTunes at 79p each.  I&#8217;m going to create a &#8220;52 songs&#8221; playlist to help me along, and I have a folder for keeping the tabs (guitar chord music) in.</p>
<p>Anyway&#8230;off to learn the music!  Report back &#8211; and a new song! &#8211; at the end of the week.</p>
