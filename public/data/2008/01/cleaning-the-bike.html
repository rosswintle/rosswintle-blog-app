<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Cleaning the bike</h1></header><main><p>I got a chain cleaning box for Christmas (thanks Sarah and Guy!) and I&#8217;ve invested in some proper bike cleaning brushes so gave the cheap hybird a good clean over (with the help of Cycling Plus&#8217; Winter Cycling Guide recommendations!), and replaced the front brake pads before heading back to work tomorrow.  A job well done, even if I STILL have black hands a few hours later.</p>
<p>There was a LOT of crap on my chain and cassette (the cogs) and the deep clean has really made a difference.  Well worth the investment in both cost and time.  And getting into a cleaning routine should help me keep the bikes in good nick and running smoothly.</p>
<p>Still awaiting the new bike though&#8230;should be here soon!!</p>
