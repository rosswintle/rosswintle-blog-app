The general mess and clutter was.</p>
<p>Now, Sally has put a LOT of work into the painting.  Her approach is very much little bits here and there whenever time permits.  Whereas mine is to book some serious time out and do a load in one big go.  And so, with great glee, we have taken a weekend off and finished off (mostly) the front room&#8217;s facelift:</p>

We appreciate that it won&#8217;t be to everyone&#8217;s taste, but we like it a LOT!</p>
