Decided not to go to stag weekend until tomorrow.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Saturday 28th April <\/span>&#8211; slept well and woke feeling fine and popped to town to get stuff to take to stag weekend, got home, felt VERY weak, collapsed in tears and cried on-and-off, controllably, for around two hours.   Decided not to go to stag day but then stressed a lot about whether Sally should go.  Eventually she decided she wouldn&#8217;t.  Went to BBQ in evening.  Very low all day, very tired, dazed and confused but no more crying.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Sunday 29th April<\/span> &#8211; slept well, fine again for most of the day, went for long bike ride and to church, ended the day feeling low and like crying again but didn&#8217;t.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Monday 30th April<\/span> &#8211; slept OK, felt VERY tired and pushed through it, started feeling better about 4pm and had a good, if tired, evening.

Felt good most of the day but boss replied and implored me to take time off.
