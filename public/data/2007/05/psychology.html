<p>After several very good days of feeling pretty normal I had a very frustrating day on Monday (it involved 2 printers, one powerpoint document, and lots of paper and ink).</p>
<p>I suspect that this was just a normal frustrating day but I started to get all knotted up inside again and lost my appetite.  Was this another attack of the nasty blues?  Or was it just a bad day that my brain blew out of all proportion?</p>
<p>I find that psychology is now kicking in.  I&#8217;m now especially sensitive to how and feel.  When I get low I start to analyse why that is, and I probably start to worry too &#8211; which, of course, only makes things worse.</p>
<p>Only time will tell.  In the meantime I&#8217;ve been to the doctor who will take a blood test but otherwise thinks I&#8217;m probably OK, and should be returning to work tomorrow!  Well, if the boss will let me.</p>
