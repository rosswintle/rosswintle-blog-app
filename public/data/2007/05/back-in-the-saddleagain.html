<p>I felt really sluggish but put in a fantastic time for my trip to work.  Proof that I really am getting a much higher base-level of fitness and strength.</p>
<p>This afternoon I did 16 miles on my way home in under an hour, including a big hill.  I was pretty pleased.  Knees mostly OK but my back was aching in a strange way.  Alright now though.</p>
