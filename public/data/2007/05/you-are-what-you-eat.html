<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">You are what you eat!</h1></header><main><p>Catching up with the BBC guy training for his 120 mile cycle ride.  There&#8217;s some really useful comments on sports nutrition posted to the article&#8230;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/606/F7183578?thread=4104305">see here</a>.  I particularly like the fact that there&#8217;s a website called <a href="http://www.flapjackrecipe.com/">flapjackrecipe.com</a>! ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some of my experience with eating proper for sport.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Discovering Nutrition!</span></p>
<p>My first encounter with basic sports nutrition was when I used to play lunchtime 5-a-side when I&#8217;d hit the &#8220;brick wall&#8221; after about half an hour.  Then I noticed that if I ate lunch early, BEFORE I played, I was OK.  So I took to doing that.  I also discovered flapjack then&#8230;if I didn&#8217;t have time to eat lunch before a I went out to play a big slab of oats always did the trick.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Upping the workload</span></p>
<p>Then I moved to Swindon and started cycling to work.  Only 4 miles each way but boy, I was hungry as a horse all day!  I started munching cereal bars, which I guess are glorified flapjacks with lots of additives.  They really fill a whole though and don&#8217;t seem to be that unhealthy or&#8230;like some &#8220;energy foods&#8221;&#8230;all that disgusting.  I also have a big bowl of oaty cereal before I go out.  Porridge, frankly, sucks!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Long rides and recovery</span></p>
<p>I also notice that after a long ride I really need something to recover.  My body craves various things at that point but basically I just cram as much sugar and water in as I can.  Apple Lucozade is particularly yummy and not too sweet.  Apparently you need to get a mix of carbs, fat and protein.  But hey, I&#8217;m still learning.</p>
<p>Key facts seem to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>eat little and often</li>
<li>keep carbs up</li>
<li>take good food (oats, bananas, etc) when you&#8217;re out exercising</li>
<li>have regular intake of water</li>
<li>make sure you eat well to recover too</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, you really are what you eat and if you start feeling really hungry because you&#8217;re exercising more do take some advice on it.  Just cramming more won&#8217;t necessarily help.</p>
