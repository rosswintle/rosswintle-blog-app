There&#8217;s some really useful comments on sports nutrition posted to the article&#8230;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/dna\/606\/F7183578?thread=4104305\">see here<\/a>.  I particularly like the fact that there&#8217;s a website called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flapjackrecipe.com\/\">flapjackrecipe.com<\/a>! \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s some of my experience with eating proper for sport.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Discovering Nutrition!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>My first encounter with basic sports nutrition was when I used to play lunchtime 5-a-side when I&#8217;d hit the &#8220;brick wall&#8221; after about half an hour.  Then I noticed that if I ate lunch early, BEFORE I played, I was OK.  So I took to doing that.  I also discovered flapjack then&#8230;if I didn&#8217;t have time to eat lunch before a I went out to play a big slab of oats always did the trick.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Upping the workload<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Then I moved to Swindon and started cycling to work.  Only 4 miles each way but boy, I was hungry as a horse all day!  I started munching cereal bars, which I guess are glorified flapjacks with lots of additives.  They really fill a whole though and don&#8217;t seem to be that unhealthy or&#8230;like some &#8220;energy foods&#8221;&#8230;all that disgusting.  I also have a big bowl of oaty cereal before I go out.  Porridge, frankly, sucks!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Long rides and recovery<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I also notice that after a long ride I really need something to recover.  My body craves various things at that point but basically I just cram as much sugar and water in as I can.  Apple Lucozade is particularly yummy and not too sweet.  Apparently you need to get a mix of carbs, fat and protein.  But hey, I&#8217;m still learning.<\/p>\n<p>Key facts seem to be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>eat little and often<\/li>\n<li>keep carbs up<\/li>\n<li>take good food (oats, bananas, etc) when you&#8217;re out exercising<\/li>\n<li>have regular intake of water<\/li>\n<li>make sure you eat well to recover too<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In this case, you really are what you eat and if you start feeling really hungry because you&#8217;re exercising more do take some advice on it.  Just cramming more won&#8217;t necessarily help.<\/p>\n",
