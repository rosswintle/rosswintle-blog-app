<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">General Saturday Stuff</h1></header><main><p>After the marathon bike post, a bit about today, which has been nice.</p>
<p>I cycled 25.5 miles out to Cricklade and back, the long way.  A very nice route and mostly with the tailwind on the way back in.  Took just over an hour and a half averaging nearly 17 mph.  My best moment was doing 22.6 in a 20 mile-per-hour zone.  Probably not something to be proud of but it made me smile!</p>
<p>This afternoon I was a bit wiped out.  Felt quite dizzy and light-headed for most of it.  I think I<br />overdo it when I go out cycling on my own.</p>
<p>I heard from an old friend who sounds very serious and grown up now.  That was nice.  Did some gardening, and then generally relaxed.  Something I&#8217;m learning more about how to do these days.</p>
<p>Blimey &#8211; what a mundane post.  I&#8217;m turning into a dull-as-dishwater, serial blogger.  ARRGHH!!!  Why did I feel the need to write that?  No idea.  Ho hum.</p>
