<p>One of them, I think, flew into the window.  I went to look and he was peering up at me!  I then tried to take a photo, scared him off, and he went and flew away&#8230;.straight into the dustbin!  Poor fella.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a real priviledge having the birds so visible in our garden.  I hope we didn&#8217;t scare them too much.</p>
<p>Will there be another brood in the summer?!</p>
