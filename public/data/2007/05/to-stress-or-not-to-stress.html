<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">To stress or not to stress&#8230;</h1></header><main><p>So, I got signed off of work on Tuesday and have had a few days forgetting about everything at home.  It&#8217;s now Friday and last weekend seems a long time ago.</p>
<p>The doctors can&#8217;t get me an apppointment until the 14th (it was about 2 weeks away when I booked it), so I popped into the NHS drop-in clinic today and the nurse there didn&#8217;t have much to say.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s very much wait and see at the moment.  I&#8217;m VERY grateful to my boss for the time off and the rest.  But I feel like a bit of a fraud now.  It was all very real on Saturday but now I wonder if there was some overreaction.  Certainly at the time it was very scary being so out of control of my emotions, and I was just physically and mentally and emotionally exhausted in a way I&#8217;ve not been before.  I guess we can only wait and see.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned some things in the meantime, which I&#8217;ll try to write up at some point but for now, I&#8217;m doing OK.</p>
