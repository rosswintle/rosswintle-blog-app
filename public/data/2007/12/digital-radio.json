        "rendered": "<p>We&#8217;ve been toying with the idea of digital radio for a while.  We listen to the radio quite a lot and it&#8217;s been annoying us that we get bad reception in the new house.<\/p>\n<p>But DAB radio&#8217;s are expensive and we&#8217;ve questioned the value.  Several of our friends have them though &#8211; a surprising number in fact! &#8211; and with moving out of London meaning we get less access to stations like XFM that we like, we decided to look into them a bit more closely.<\/p>\n<p>I, with my techie hat on, was looking for features.  We like the &#8220;live pause and rewind&#8221; on our Sky+ box, and I was hoping to get that functionality in the radio too &#8211; should be simple enough you would think.  I also wanted to be able to plug an iPod into it &#8211; preferable through a line-in socket.  Sally, with her aesthetics hat on (we&#8217;re a good team) wouldn&#8217;t let me get a cheap, plastic-looking one &#8211; preferring the slightly vintage look of the Pure and Robert&#8217;s models.<\/p>\n<p>We tested the water by getting a cheap (\u00a335) Roberts clock radio.  A lot of our listening is done in bed as we attempt to wake up, so this seemed like a good way to try it out.  And&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I was astonished!<\/p>\n<p>I thought we&#8217;d get poor reception, with it constantly breaking up.  But, no.  DAB, here in Swindon at least, is crystal clear.  We get a good range of stations.  The sound quality is excellent.  And the radios are incredibly easy to use &#8211; I don&#8217;t say that lightly by the way, but you literally plug it in and it works with barely a button press.<\/p>\n<p>We were SO impressed that we almost immediately went to Amazon and spent a lot more money on a Pure Evoke 1S for the kitchen.  Which is equally easy to use, crystal clear, well built, has most of the technical features I wanted (not live pause and rewind &#8211; surprisingly few models had this!), and looks the business.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d happily evangelise DAB radio to anyone.  If you&#8217;re thinking you have reason to switch &#8211; do it!<\/p>\n<p>I still think the receivers aren&#8217;t particularly good value but in this case I&#8217;m happy to pay the premium for being a fairly-early adopter.  Perhaps prices will come down as take-up increases?  Or maybe the signal is sufficiently poor on other places to limit its take up.  I guess only time will tell.<\/p>\n",
