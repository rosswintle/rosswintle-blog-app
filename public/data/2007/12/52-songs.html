<p>Our friend Simon had his 30th birthday on 2nd December and he had a really fun party in York that we attended.  He&#8217;s a musician and has lots of musical friends, so part of the party was there was a PA and some musical instruments set up and a thrown-together band that played some well known party songs.</p>
<p>This was MOST entertaining, particularly the random, unrehearsed singalong at the end of the evening.</p>
<p>It gave me the (crazy, stupid) idea of having a new years resolution to learn a popular song each week.  I&#8217;ve been playing guitar for about 8 years now and don&#8217;t know many pop songs by heart, this would be a good way to learn.</p>
<p>Anyway, I never really thought I&#8217;d do it.  But Sally&#8217;s gone and bought me some chord books of pop songs for Christmas, so I guess I have to.</p>
<p>I doubt I&#8217;ll make one per week, but I&#8217;ll start a new thread here and maybe use it to keep people posted on how I&#8217;m getting on (if at all).  Maybe this is a good way to be accountable and have people suggest songs too.  If you&#8217;re one of my limited readership, feel free to post comments or email me suggestions/ideas.</p>
<p>Thoughts turn to what the first few songs might be.  &#8220;Love me do&#8221; by the Beatles is a good choice as it REALLY is three chords and has simple words. Though Robbie Williams&#8217; &#8220;Angels&#8221; may also be a good start as I sort-of learnt it before.  Or maybe a Christmas song&#8230;especially as I&#8217;ve been playing LOTS on Christmas Carol services at church of late.</p>
<p>An update sometime soon&#8230;I hope.</p>
