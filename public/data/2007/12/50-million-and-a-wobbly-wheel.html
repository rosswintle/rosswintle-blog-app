<p>Two quick things.  One is that there&#8217;s this competition going on where four projects have the chance to win £50 million of lottery money in a public vote.  One of the projects is being put forward by Sustrans (a sustainable transport organisation) to improve walking and cycling paths, including the National Cycle Network, across the country.</p>
<p>Of course, I have a vested interest in this, being a cyclist, but I also think that it&#8217;s the only nationwide project, the others are all specific to one place.  Yes, they&#8217;re all great projects, but the best use of public money is surely to improve access to cycle routes?</p>
<p>Some cyclists are very much against this, assuming that, if there are designated cycle routes, then we&#8217;ll be forced to use them (and they&#8217;re not very good for serious mountain biking or road riding as they&#8217;re mostly paths used for leisure rides and shared with pedestrians), but the National Cycle Network is a great way for a beginner cyclist to discover longer rides, and was very much part of my catching of the cycling bug!</p>
<p>So, if you don&#8217;t know about it, or don&#8217;t really care which project gets the money, I DO!  So please vote for Sustrans.

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">My Wobbly Wheels</p>
<p></span>In other, more personal cycle-related news, my rear wheel is wobbling again.  I thought I&#8217;d done a grand job of repairing the broken spokes, but it seems to still be uneven and, when I hit about 25 mph, it starts to shake me around a bit.</p>
<p>But what to do?  I&#8217;ve had a good go at truing up but without expensive tools it&#8217;ll never be perfect.  Should I buy a new wheel?  Hmm&#8230;<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"></span></p>
