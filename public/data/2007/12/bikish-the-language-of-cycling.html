Cycling, like many other hobbies, has a language of its own, and experienced participants use it freely without really thinking about poor beginner like me who don&#8217;t know their cranksets from their cassettes and their bar ends from their bottom brackets.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been looking into new bikes and doing some maintenance so I&#8217;ve been struggling myself.  The component manufacturers don&#8217;t help by naming equipment in the same sort of way that car manufacturers give names to cars.  How am I supposed to know the difference between Sora, Tiagra, Ultegra, 105, Dura Ace and so on, easily, without having to research it all the time?  Surely there&#8217;s an easier way?</p>
<p>And sometimes things are known by different names.  I still haven&#8217;t worked out if a crank is different from a crankset, or a chain different from a chainset.  There&#8217;s subtle differences between hubs and axles, and it&#8217;s not clear whether I can replace just one, or just the other, or if I always need to replace both.  There&#8217;s seat stays and seat posts, which are very different.  It&#8217;s all very confusing!</p>
<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s a useful article that has helped me a little.</p>

<p>My original intention for this post was to list some cycling terminology that I&#8217;ve learned the meaning of and try to keep that up to date, but that&#8217;s a bit of a waste of time as there are plenty of resources out there that have already done it.  If you&#8217;re reading this on the internet then look it up on Google, Wikipedia, or your information source of choice.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;m continuing my learning.</p>
