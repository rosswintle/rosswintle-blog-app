<p>Hard to believe, but, today I cycled in proper rain for the first time in AGES.  It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve tried out my day-glo waterproof in real rain and I first posted about that on October 3rd.  OK, I did have a week off driving to work (why was that??? can&#8217;t remember now), but it kinda helps prove the point.</p>
<p>Anyway, the waterproof proved to be very much so but I got very soggy bottoms and socks and shoes.  Riding home in wet gear isn&#8217;t fun.  Must remember waterproof over-trousers and over-shoes next time.</p>
<p>I have a bit of a backlog of posts to write but not much time at the moment.  Hopefully I&#8217;ll get to catch up soon.  Sally&#8217;s not so well tonight so she&#8217;s gone to bed early and I get a little time that I wouldn&#8217;t normally have.  Bless her.</p>
