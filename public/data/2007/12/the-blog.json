        "rendered": "<div>I&#8217;ve been considering the purpose of this Blog lately<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<div>It&#8217;s really only &#8220;notes to self&#8221; and yet, I started it after being inspired by other people, who were writing interesting stuff&#8230;or at least stuff about what they were up to that was of interest to me. It&#8217;s stuff that I&#8217;d like good friends to be able to see, but not stuff that I want the whole world to see.<\/div>\n<p>Truth is that, though there&#8217;s an element of pride in having a set of hopefully interesting\/funny \/useful notes that others can read, I&#8217;m slightly embarassed about it.  Some people recently heard that I had a Blog and all questioned with surprise&#8230;&#8221;you have a blog???&#8221;.  In opening it up to the world, I open myself to the critical eye of the world.<\/p>\n<p>I originally set up my Blog such that people had to be approved as readers.  However, I recently &#8220;imported&#8221; my Blog into my Facebook &#8220;notes&#8221; application &#8211; which meant that people could easily be updated when I post something new, and I really value having RSS feeds of other people&#8217;s Blogs as it makes it easier to stay up to date.  Both of these required me to open up my Blogger RSS feed, which I can only do by opening up the whole Blog to the world.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m nervous about this.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t mind people that I know are nice and won&#8217;t make silly comments reading and commenting but I don&#8217;t think I want everyone to see.  There&#8217;s a security risk in there, and, though I&#8217;m careful about what I write and I make sure I set my Blog up so that search engines aren&#8217;t informed about my posts, I don&#8217;t want all of what I write searchable by Google and so on.<\/p>\n<p>This, though, poses some challenges.<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, I don&#8217;t currently have a way to only allow RSS access to a select group.  I&#8217;ve tried importing my notes into a WordPress setup, but this doesn&#8217;t seem to allow secure RSS feeds either (if such things exist). <\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also pride in knowing who&#8217;s reading too.  I don&#8217;t want to think I&#8217;m big because the world can read my musings and hopefully be entertained by them.  But having control of who can see means I&#8217;m retaining control and I become aware of how popular I am (or am not).  That could work either way.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m challenged about what I&#8217;m writing too.  Why am I nervous about the world seeing it?  Do I not believe it?  Do I not think it&#8217;s interesting\/useful\/funny?  Am I not prepared to stand by what I&#8217;ve written and be identified with it?<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m a bit confused about what to do at the moment.  I think I&#8217;ve turned public access off, but it may be on and off for a while, while I work out what to do.<\/p>\n<p>If anyone IS reading (I know at least one person is), I&#8217;d appreciate your comments and thoughts.<\/p>\n",
