<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">The Blog</h1></header><main><div>I&#8217;ve been considering the purpose of this Blog lately</div>
<p></p>
<div>It&#8217;s really only &#8220;notes to self&#8221; and yet, I started it after being inspired by other people, who were writing interesting stuff&#8230;or at least stuff about what they were up to that was of interest to me. It&#8217;s stuff that I&#8217;d like good friends to be able to see, but not stuff that I want the whole world to see.</div>
<p>Truth is that, though there&#8217;s an element of pride in having a set of hopefully interesting/funny /useful notes that others can read, I&#8217;m slightly embarassed about it.  Some people recently heard that I had a Blog and all questioned with surprise&#8230;&#8221;you have a blog???&#8221;.  In opening it up to the world, I open myself to the critical eye of the world.</p>
<p>I originally set up my Blog such that people had to be approved as readers.  However, I recently &#8220;imported&#8221; my Blog into my Facebook &#8220;notes&#8221; application &#8211; which meant that people could easily be updated when I post something new, and I really value having RSS feeds of other people&#8217;s Blogs as it makes it easier to stay up to date.  Both of these required me to open up my Blogger RSS feed, which I can only do by opening up the whole Blog to the world.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m nervous about this.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind people that I know are nice and won&#8217;t make silly comments reading and commenting but I don&#8217;t think I want everyone to see.  There&#8217;s a security risk in there, and, though I&#8217;m careful about what I write and I make sure I set my Blog up so that search engines aren&#8217;t informed about my posts, I don&#8217;t want all of what I write searchable by Google and so on.</p>
<p>This, though, poses some challenges.</p>
<p>Firstly, I don&#8217;t currently have a way to only allow RSS access to a select group.  I&#8217;ve tried importing my notes into a WordPress setup, but this doesn&#8217;t seem to allow secure RSS feeds either (if such things exist). </p>
<p>There&#8217;s also pride in knowing who&#8217;s reading too.  I don&#8217;t want to think I&#8217;m big because the world can read my musings and hopefully be entertained by them.  But having control of who can see means I&#8217;m retaining control and I become aware of how popular I am (or am not).  That could work either way.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m challenged about what I&#8217;m writing too.  Why am I nervous about the world seeing it?  Do I not believe it?  Do I not think it&#8217;s interesting/useful/funny?  Am I not prepared to stand by what I&#8217;ve written and be identified with it?</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m a bit confused about what to do at the moment.  I think I&#8217;ve turned public access off, but it may be on and off for a while, while I work out what to do.</p>
<p>If anyone IS reading (I know at least one person is), I&#8217;d appreciate your comments and thoughts.</p>
