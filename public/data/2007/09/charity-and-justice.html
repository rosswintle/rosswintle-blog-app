<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Charity and Justice</h1></header><main><p>I&#8217;d like to post a link to <a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/life_article.php?id=7472">this article about Charity and Justice</a>.  Relevant Magazine doesn&#8217;t always hit the mark (more below) but this article explains an important difference between what the author calls &#8220;charity&#8221; (giving to help people in need) and &#8220;justice&#8221; (trying to fix the things that make charity needed).  It&#8217;s worth reading, thinking about, and taking action on.</p>
<p>Having spoken at some length about &#8220;Christian&#8221; media in my Greenbelt post, I now mention Relevant Magazine again.  Relevant is a very-American media company who are publishing a couple of magazines, some books and resources, and a website, mostly aimed at a Christian audience but, as with Greenbelt, you could get lots from it if you weren&#8217;t following God in any kind of way.</p>
<p>Sometimes it misses the mark totally, but if you ignore the American-ness, the vast amounts of advertising (someone&#8217;s got to pay to make these things happen), and some of the less useful articles, there&#8217;s some useful, interesting, thought-provoking, and sometimes challenging stuff in there.</p>
<p>I hope this article was in one of those categories.</p>
