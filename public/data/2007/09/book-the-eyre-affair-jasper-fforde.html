<p>One result of which is that, after about 6 months of on-and-off reading, I&#8217;ve finally finished a book!</p>
<p>The Eyre Affair is a cleverly comic, extremely eccentric romp through time space and reality.  I&#8217;m sure I missed out on a lot of gags by not being familiar with some of the literary classics on which it&#8217;s quite heavily based (Bronte and Shakespear getting lots of mentions), but I still found it amusing and entertaining.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clever in the sense that the book mashes together reality and fiction.  It&#8217;s set in Swindon, but it&#8217;s not quite the Swindon we know&#8230;or the United Kingdom that we know, for that matter.  Names, places, events, often sound familiar, but have been taken into a slightly-alternative reality. This skipping between reality and fiction is also a topic of the book.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not very good at reading, and it took so long that I&#8217;m sure I missed out on some meta-narratives, and was not able to appreciate the intricacies of the book.  But it was still a very entertaining read.</p>
<p>Would I read it again? Or the next book in the series?  Possibly, but I was troubled throughout by the fact that I wasn&#8217;t quite getting it all because of my lack of literary knowledge, so I certainly won&#8217;t go straight to the library.  Recommend for the quirky, clever, and well-read reader.</p>
