The sun was shining down and making the web glisten so I thought I&#8217;d try and catch it on, err, well not film exactly, but you know what I mean.</p>
<p>The reason I&#8217;m a bit fanatical about spiders is that&#8230;well&#8230;they&#8217;re just amazing.  They have these 8 legs and they build this super-strong web thing with stuff that they naturally produce to catch their food.  The co-ordination required to spin a web is phenomenal, combined with their apparent ability to fly between high places to put up the initial outer structure of the web.  Watching it happen is just incredible.</p>
<p>I am someone who believes in God and, though I don&#8217;t believe the literal 7-day creation, I do believe that God created the natural world around us, and when I see something like a spider spinning a web I can only watch in awe at the detail and intricacy with which God made things.</p>
