        "rendered": "<p>This book was recommended as a good read on prayer but didn&#8217;t live up to expectations.<\/p>\n<p>Before I wrote these notes on it I did some searching and it&#8217;s hard to find a bad review of the book.  And I have to say that, despite the slow start to it, the book did grow on me as I read it, and it did inspire me to pray more and differently.  But it was with relief that I finished it.  It was just REALLY hard going.<\/p>\n<p>This is probably more a reflection on me than on the book.  Let me explain&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Much as my writing is very long and waffly, I like my reading to be concise and to the point.  I like stories and illustrations, but they should help make the point rather than clog up the book and make it slow going and repetitive.  Plus, I read non-fiction books like this slowly and carefully, taking everything in, underlining what&#8217;s important, so I don&#8217;t need the same point to be made several times.<\/p>\n<p>You can probably work out that I thought that this book was too heavy on anecdotes, too light on simple, to-the-point theology, and too repetitive.  The book IS a meandering journey rather than a write up of the destination.  It&#8217;s a discussion rather than a sermon.<\/p>\n<p>In a book like this it is sometimes important to reinforce a point but, particularly in the early chapters, I found Yancey going round in circles without making much real progress.  After reading about a third of it I wondered what I was going to get from it other than lots of questions and fairly stock answers.<\/p>\n<p>I found later chapters were a bit more practical and inspiring and Yancey&#8217;s honesty and openness about his struggles with prayer really make the book.  By the end I has the feeling that he has somehow gained some mastery of the topic and he had managed to share it with me.  I just wish it hadn&#8217;t taken him so many words to do it.<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t find many points to disagree on, though Yancey&#8217;s theology is obviously very open.  He&#8217;s not afraid to tackle the difficult questions, and not afraid to leave you without a firm answer either.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to see an edited version distilling his findings into a much shorter work.  But worth reading if you have the time.<\/p>\n",
