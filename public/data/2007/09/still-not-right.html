<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Still not right!!!</h1></header><main><p>It&#8217;s been nearly a month now since I was up all night being sick&#8230;the &#8220;flu-like virus&#8221; has mostly gone away but, as anyone who&#8217;s been watching my Facebook status will tell you, I still have the odd bad day.  Tonight has been a particularly bad evening with me collapsing in bed and feeling like I&#8217;m right back at square one.</p>
<p>The doctor doesn&#8217;t seem surprised and a little bit of web research (dangerous as you could probably self-diagnose pretty much anything) shows that &#8220;post viral fatigue&#8221; is not uncommon and can last a long time.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s very frustrating.  I&#8217;ve been surprised at how much my life is defined by physical activity.  I miss my cycling and I&#8217;m unable to do much that&#8217;s strenuous at all.  I tried cycling yesterday, about 4 miles worth at a very slow pace.  Perhaps that what&#8217;s killed me off this evening?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s stressing me out a bit as we&#8217;re buying the house&#8230;probably real soon now&#8230;and I won&#8217;t be up to much packing and cleaning and shifting big boxes around.  Plus, I don&#8217;t know what the future holds &#8211; I guess I&#8217;ll slowly recover but if there is something more long-term wrong with me, is taking on a mortgage such a good thing?</p>
<p>Only time will tell I guess.  In the meantime we press on with our plans in faith that God will stop us if we&#8217;re doing the wrong thing.</p>
