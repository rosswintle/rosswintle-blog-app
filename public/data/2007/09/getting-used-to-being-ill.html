<p>The last two weeks, since getting back from Greenbelt, have been one physical problem after another.  Starting with what appeared to be food poisoning or a stomach bug of some sort, morphing into a &#8220;flu-like virus&#8221; which has kept me in bed for most of this week, and then, having finally recovered from that, I did my back in, to the extent that I could hardly move last night (and I almost certainly shouldn&#8217;t be using a computer right now).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been sick, aching, tired, emotionally drained and now in a huge amount of pain, for nearly two weeks.  Add this to the couple of weeks I had off earlier in the year for my stress/depression (I&#8217;ll write a &#8220;whatever happened to post at some point&#8221;), and it&#8217;s been a pretty bad year for me health-wise.</p>
<p>Yet, there are positives to take from all of this.  When I first started having my flu-like symptoms I said to Sally &#8220;I&#8217;m not very good at being ill&#8221;.  By which I meant that, my response to being unwell isn&#8217;t always very good.  I feel like I give up quite easily, but in reality I think I push myself too hard when I&#8217;m ill.  I&#8217;m NOT good at stopping and resting and doing nothing.  I feel guilty about not being at work and so I throw myself back into it too quickly.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve been learning about these things.  I started to recover last weekend and took up too much too quickly and the bug came back to get me as a result.  So I had a whole week off, and even when I started to feel myself again I made use of the doctor&#8217;s sick note and rested.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned to leave alone things that need doing around the house (it&#8217;s a bit of a tip at the moment but I don&#8217;t care!!!).  I&#8217;ve learned the pleasure of sitting still and reading a book.  I&#8217;ve learned not to feel guilty about not being at work &#8211; the world continues to turn even when I&#8217;m sat in bed doing nothing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve prayed a lot, I&#8217;ve chilled out a lot.  Sally&#8217;s been fantastic, as have others who have rallied round to help me out.  It&#8217;s taken a long time but I do think it&#8217;s nearly over and I&#8217;m looking forward to carrying on normally, but with a few lessons learned.</p>
