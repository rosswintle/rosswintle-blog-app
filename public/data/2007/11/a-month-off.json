        "rendered": "<p>Phew, I&#8217;m finally back in the land of the living.  Where have I been?  Here&#8217;s my excuses for not writing for a month&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Moving House<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Well, the house exchange and completion went through.  We got the keys to our new house on October 5th.  Sally was away for the weekend and I&#8217;d been banned from moving in until she got home, so I got on with the job of cleaning and tidying the old place.  We moved in proper on the Monday.<\/p>\n<p>The house is great but a little rough around the edges.  Lots of bits of DIY\/building that seem to have been finished in a hurry.  But it&#8217;s ours, it has three bedrooms, a huge garden and it&#8217;s in a great location.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, we&#8217;ve had to clean up and get out of the old rented house too.  Phew.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">No Broadband<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Moving house means setting up a new phone line and having our Internet connection set up.  This meant several weeks without Broadband.  Quite a nice experience really.  We get so much more &#8220;real&#8221; stuff done without Google and Facebook and Blogger.  We didn&#8217;t really miss it at all.  Of course, now it&#8217;s back we&#8217;re back in the habit of making good use of our &#8220;always on&#8221; pipe to the universe.<\/p>\n<p>A note about providers&#8230;we were with Zen Internet, who provide excellent service, but at a cost.  Our up-to-8Mb connection was costing \u00a317 per month with a 2GB usage limit.  So after some debate and research we decided to KEEP Sky TV and take Sky Broadband and Sky Talk (phone calls) too.  Much as I dislike having hundreds of TV channels that I never watch.  This appealed because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sky Talk costs nothing and gives free evening and weekend calls.<\/li>\n<li>Sky Broadband is \u00a35 for up-to-8Mb with a 40GB usage limit.<\/li>\n<li>Sky + (Sky&#8217;s hard-disk based TV recording system), now has no monthly subscription cost.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sky+ turns out to be awesome! VERY high quality recorded TV that you set up from the on-screen TV guide.  You just find the programme and tell it to record.  It&#8217;ll record a whole series of the same programme.  And you can pause and rewind live TV too.  I understand how the technology works, and I&#8217;m STILL very impressed.  Good technology, well implemented, is hard to find these days.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Holiday<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We decided, shortly after the house move, to take a week&#8217;s holiday.  My In-Law&#8217;s were off to Spain for a few nights and asked if we wanted to house-sit.  With a free weeks&#8217; holiday on the edge of Dartmoor being offered we couldn&#8217;t really refuse and it turned out to be just what we needed.  We&#8217;ve just got back from this week off and we&#8217;re well relaxed and trying to summon up the mental effort required to get back to work tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>We also popped to London on Friday for a couple of friends of ours who were having an engagement party.  We&#8217;re VERY excited that they&#8217;re getting married and the party was really great.<\/p>\n<p>Returning to London is an odd experience.  We drive in thinking that it&#8217;s horrid, busy, noisy, etc, but after a couple of hours re-uniting with good friends we miss it.  Of course, we&#8217;ve made good friends here in Swindon too, but we&#8217;re really still getting to know people and it&#8217;s not the same as connecting with people that you&#8217;ve known inside-out for many years.  There are things about London as a city that we miss, but mostly it&#8217;s the people.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Finally&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><\/span>So, yes, after all that  we&#8217;re in the new house, broadband is back, and we&#8217;re not on holiday any more.  I probably have some catching up to do.  I keep having &#8220;I must write about that&#8221; moments, but can&#8217;t remember what any of them are now.  If they&#8217;re that important then they&#8217;ll come back to me I&#8217;m sure.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/p>\n",
