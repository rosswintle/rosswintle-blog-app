<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Finding purpose</h1></header><main><p>So, it&#8217;s been a long year.  It&#8217;s been a hard year.  I&#8217;ve been ill a lot.  I&#8217;ve not achieved very much of what I thought I would.  I enjoy physical activity and I&#8217;ve not managed to do much.</p>
<p>On the up side we have bought a house and very much settled in Swindon, into our jobs, and into our church.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve now had a period of feeling well for a while.  Things finally seem to be fixed.  So I&#8217;m taking stock, looking around and thinking &#8220;Phew, OK, so that&#8217;s over&#8230;what now?&#8221;</p>
<p>To help with that process I&#8217;m re-reading a book that&#8217;s quite well known in Christian circles called &#8220;The Purpose Driven Life&#8221;.  It&#8217;s written by famous American church leader who does lots of &#8220;purpose driven&#8221; stuff.  It&#8217;s a very American book &#8211; though I can&#8217;t really explain why.  But if you can see through the American Evangelical-isms it&#8217;s a good book.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just what I need right now.  It&#8217;s taking a very beaten and battered soul inside of me, and taking it back to the basics of my faith.  Why am I here?  What on Earth am I doing?  How do I find God in all of this?  And what does he want me to be doing with my life.</p>
<p>Hopefully I&#8217;ll be reporting back sometime&#8230;watch this space.</p>
