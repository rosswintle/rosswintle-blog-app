<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">I can do it!</h1></header><main><p>A new thread starts.  Having bought a house I&#8217;m learning something else new &#8211; DIY!  Sally bought me a book as a gift called &#8220;You Can Do It!&#8221;  (It&#8217;s a B&amp;Q book and B&amp;Q&#8217;s advertising slogan used to be &#8220;You can do it when you B&amp;Q it!&#8221;).  This thread will be the ups and down, ins and outs, successes, failures, and lessons learned, of learning to do DIY.</p>
<p>Which starts here with the question &#8220;Why does no one teach us this stuff?&#8221;.  I remember painting and stuff as a kid but DIY should be handed down to us somehow.  I&#8217;ve lived in rented houses since I was 18 and so all my DIY and decorating has been done for me.  I haven&#8217;t got a clue about filling, sanding, wallpapering, plumbing, electrics, lighting, interior design, building, plastering etc.  There&#8217;s so much to know!  And so much can go wrong.</p>
<p>I hope my readers can learn something from my mistakes.</p>
<p>And, for those of you who know, I&#8217;ve already learned my u-bend lesson!!!  Won&#8217;t be doing that again.</p>
