<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Form vs Function</h1></header><main><p>Why is it that things that perform a job well always look stupid? This seems to be especially true of sports wear.</p>
<p>Why is it that the best way to keep warm on my bike in winter is to wear skin-tight, fleecy-lined tights?</p>
<p>Why is bright yellow seemingly the best colour to wear if you want to be seen on the roads in the daytime?</p>
<p>When are they going to invent some head protection that looks compact and stylish (this probably does exist but is not in my price range).</p>
<p>Where can I get some overshoes that don&#8217;t make my feet look like they belong to a large black alien.</p>
<p>And of course, wearing all these things together simply make a person look ridiculous.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been experiencing this strange law of nature recently as I&#8217;ve been acquiring and wearing more winter kit for my commute.  And I&#8217;m sure it holds true for more than just cycling kit.  I bet runners (Sarah?) have the same feelings about vests and shorts and so on &#8211; I bet the stuff that keeps you cool and comfortable in summer and warm and safe in winter looks really weird.</p>
<p>So as winter goes on and I wrap up more and more I expect more and more jibes about how silly I look.  Well let it be said that I don&#8217;t care!  I may look daft, but I&#8217;m warm, dry, fast, fit, safe and comfortable.  So there!!!</p>
