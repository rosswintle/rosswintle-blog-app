Look them up on an image search if you want the real thing!]</p>
<p>&#8220;Maaaarketing&#8230;&#8221; said an alien on Radio 4&#8217;s &#8220;The Now Show&#8221; some time last year&#8230;he was amused by the fact that humans bottled water and sold it at extortionate cost to one another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, this is amusing.  Marketing &#8211; hahahaha&#8221;.</p>
<p>Which pretty much sums up my understanding of the topic.</p>
<p>The issue of &#8220;corporate re-blanding&#8221; has been bothering me for a while.  A certain company quite close to my heart has recently scrapped its well-known logo and put in its place the name of the company, written in a bold, sans serif font, in a variety of colours&#8230;which is exactly what a similar company had done a couple of years beforehand.</p>
<p>But why?  Why scrap an image that&#8217;s recognised around the world and replace it with the same thing that everyone else is doing?</p>
<p>Some examples.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Welcome Break</span> &#8211; you&#8217;ve all stopped on the motorway services and experienced the wonders of their toilets.  They used to have a nice old fashioned picture of a swan coming in to land above their name.</p>
<p>I never quite got the swan thing.  Presumably swans like a gigantic fried breakfast halfway through their migration or something (do swans migrate?), but it was recognisable and kinda homely&#8230;welcoming.   So what&#8217;s with the new &#8220;logo&#8221;, which basically looks like this&#8230;</p>
<table style="width:154px;height:25px;">

<p>This one particularly irritates me because <span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:arial;"><span style="color:rgb(0,102,0);">NOW</span><span style="color:rgb(204,102,204);">THEY</span><span style="color:rgb(0,102,0);">WRITE</span><span style="color:rgb(204,102,204);">EVERYTHING</span><span style="color:rgb(0,102,0);">IN</span><span style="color:rgb(204,102,204);">BOLD </span><span style="color:rgb(0,102,0);">UPPERCASE</span><span style="color:rgb(204,102,204);">SANS-SERIF</span><span style="color:rgb(0,102,0);">AND</span><span style="color:rgb(204,102,204);">ITS</span><span style="color:rgb(0,102,0);">REALLY</span><span style="color:rgb(204,102,204);">HARD</span><span style="color:rgb(0,102,0);">TO</span><span style="color:rgb(204,102,204);">READ</span><span style="color:rgb(0,102,0);">AND</span><span style="color:rgb(204,102,204);">IT</span><span style="color:rgb(0,102,0);">SOUNDS</span><span style="color:rgb(204,102,204);">LIKE</span><span style="color:rgb(0,102,0);">THEY&#8217;RE </span><span style="color:rgb(204,102,204);">SHOUTING</span><span style="color:rgb(0,102,0);">AT</span><span style="color:rgb(204,102,204);">YOU</span></span>.  Not actually very welcoming at all.<br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight:bold;">Marks and Spencer</span>:  Wow &#8211; I realise that I&#8217;ve not seen the name in full for a while now. Yes, they&#8217;re doing it on the high street too!  The old, angular logo was just a name and a magic little ampersand, presented on two lines in a nice shade of green.  But it was a well-recognised name.<span style="text-decoration:underline;"></p>
<p></span>However, M&amp;S have actually changed a lot.  They used to be seen as a stuffy old supermarket that only sold its own brand food to old people, but for many that view has changed.  Their new logo is modern and reflects that change but I&#8217;m still left wondering if they could have come up with something more unique than their initials in a curvy black and greeny-yellow&#8230;this is not just any logo, it&#8217;s a smooth, sophisticated, trips-off-your tongue logo&#8230;my cheap imitation is simply something like:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:180%;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">M<span style="color:rgb(51,153,153);">&amp;</span>S</span></span></div>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"></p>
<p></span>The Co-op.  Possibly another story of a stuffy old shop modernising &#8211; the old logo&#8217;s loopy, lowercase, blue letters laid out in a square formation, firmly reminding me of shopping with my granny.  Like M&amp;S I like what the Co-operative are doing but surely they&#8217;re just jumping on a bandwagon with the new look&#8230;which isn&#8217;t far off something like&#8230;</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:rgb(0,0,153);font-size:180%;"><span style="font-family:verdana;">The</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:arial;">co-operative</span></span></div>
<p>Even charities are at it&#8230;internation Christian development agency, Tearfund, had their name in two fonts &#8211; with and without serifs, two colours &#8211; deep green and clean white, two weights &#8211; normal and bold, with a nice dandelion head in an orange box next to it.  But even charities modernise and we now have nothing more than&#8230;</p>

<p>(I should point out that the &#8220;t&#8221; should be cross-shaped with no curly bottom.  This is probably important, but I don&#8217;t have a standard font that looks like that!)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a silly thing to have a rant about but what bugs me is that all the skill and creativity seems to have gone from marketing.  Let&#8217;s just take a company name, optionally abbreviate it in some way, pick a modern typeface, and choose a couple of colours.  Anyone could do it?  Couldn&#8217;t they?<br />If I had the time I could write a computer program to randomly re-brand company names in this way.  And people get paid a fortune to do it?</p>
<p>So&#8230;to any marketing people out there&#8230;what&#8217;s stopping me?</p>
