They were wrapped up safely in rucksacks but it was so wet that they filled with water anyway and they never came back to life.</p>
<p>So, after phoning the insurance people and a bit of research, we&#8217;ve bought a new digital camera.  We&#8217;ve bought a Canon Ixus 70 because:</p>
<ol>
<li>We&#8217;ve had a Canon before, they&#8217;re well built (but not waterproof) and we know how to use them</li>
<li>It&#8217;s pocket-sized but has a 3x optical zoom and all the features we need.</li>
<li>We&#8217;d hoped for a fully-manual mode but there are hard to find on compact cameras.  You can manually adjust the ISO setting, but there&#8217;s no aperture or time priority.  But then no other camera we looked at had those either.</li>
<li>The flash on our old Canon SureShot A80 was horrible, but this one, in testing, seems to have been improved.</li>
<li>We chose the Ixus 70 over the Ixus 75 mostly because it has a smaller screen and therefore better battery life.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall we&#8217;re happy with the purchase.  It&#8217;s small, takes good snaps, the battery lasts long enough (though I don&#8217;t like having a rechargable &#8211; our old one just took standard AA batteries).  It&#8217;s all we expected really.  I guess, to the untrained eye, digital cameras are much of a muchness and though the Ixus 70 is nothing extraordinary, it is a well-built and easy to use camera.</p>
<p>It has one feature that I particularly like though &#8211; it does time-lapse filming!  You can only set it to take a picture every 1 second or two seconds, and it kills the battery pretty quickly, but I&#8217;ve had some fun playing around with it and it gives interesting results.  It has prompted a bit of a fascination with life-at-high-speed.</p>
<p>I first started playing around with this after a day&#8217;s working from home.  Here&#8217;s a bit of me at the laptop &#8211; it&#8217;s quite boring but I had no other subject to try it out on:</p>
<p>For a laugh I tried moving really slowly to see what would happen when speeded back up again.  This has a strange stop-motion animation effect and makes me laugh every time:</p>
<p>I wonder what sort of life-observation could be had with this.  Look out for speeded-up naturewatch movies next spring!</p>
