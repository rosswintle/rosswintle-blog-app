I finally forked out and bought some SPD &#8220;clipless&#8221; Pedals (<a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/ProductDetail.aspx?Cat=cycle&amp;ProdID=4000000481">Shimano M424&#8217;s</a>) and some cycling shoes (<a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/ProductDetail.aspx?Cat=cycle&amp;ProdID=5360019594&amp;N=Specialized%20BG%20Taho%20Mens%20MTB%20Shoes">Specialized Tahos</a>).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very happy with them now but I learned a few lessons along the way.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Replacing pedals</span></p>
<p>The man in the shop caused some confusion about which way the pedals were threaded.  He suggested the intuitive method (you&#8217;d expect them to be threaded so that they tighten when you pedal) but it doesn&#8217;t work like that.  For reference the RIGHT pedal has a NORMAL thread and the LEFT pedal is backwards.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Unclipping yourself</p>
<p></span>I was initially a bit scared of falling off so I went for a ride up and down the alleyway at the back.  Where I learned that I tend to fall off to the left.  So though my brain decided that, because I&#8217;m right footed, I should unclip my right foot first, that also turns out to be counter-intuitive.  Actually, it does make sense if you think about it harder: I use my right foot to &#8220;lead&#8221; when I start pedalling, PLUS, when I stop I normally have the kerb on my left.  So when I stop I naturally remove my left foot and put it down, and I lean left to make that happen.</p>
<p>So, with pedals replaced, brain correctly programmed to unclip left-foot-first, I set out on a short ride and managed not to fall off at all!</p>
<p>My thighs hurt today though &#8211; the action of applying force for the full &#8220;cycle&#8221; of the crank means that you use other muscles&#8230;so more training may be required before I get fully up to speed.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll watch the speeds with interest!<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"></span></p>
