This room is the home of an exercise class called &#8220;RPM&#8221; (TM), which is what most people would call a &#8220;spinning&#8221; class.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been to this class once before a few months ago &#8211; but Sally and I both went along last night.  Her first time, my second.</p>
<p>In theory &#8211; because I like cycling &#8211; this should be my ideal workout.  45 minutes of intense cycling, to the beat of a good selection of music, with simulated time trials, hill climbs, and interval training.</p>
<p>Yet, though Sally really enjoyed it and felt great afterwards, I don&#8217;t like it.  Most people come out of it tired but energised and feeling good.  But, as I did the first time I went, I came out feeling rubbish, and I&#8217;ve still feel pretty rubbish nearly 24 hours later.</p>
<p>Theories for not liking RPM:</p>
<ol>
<li>I naturally push myself when exercising so having someone else shouting at me to push myself harder still just makes me overdo it.</li>
<li>I generally don&#8217;t like people telling me what to do when I think I know what I&#8217;m doing anyway.</li>
<li>The heat!  I sweat a LOT so being in a crowded room full of people all working at near-maximum power output is quite uncomfortable for me and my body loses a lot of fluid &#8211; maybe that&#8217;s not good for me.</li>
<li>Perhaps I&#8217;m just not used to pushing myself that hard and how it feels afterwards.  Perhaps I&#8217;m worrying about nothing.  Perhaps I should just make sure I eat and drink enough beforehand, and have a proper recovery time afterwards.</li>
</ol>
<p>I WILL go again.  I was particularly tired yesterday so maybe it was just a bad day to do it.  But overall I&#8217;d much rather be outside &#8211; even in the rain.  Having the countryside whizzing passed, clocking up real miles, wind keeping you cool with real hill climbs and no one shouting at me to &#8220;TURN IT UP!!!&#8221;.  Much nicer.</p>
