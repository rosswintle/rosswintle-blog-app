<p>Sadly, as we went on holiday for a week it got a bit neglected and dropped lots of leaves.  With some TLC, lots of water and the sunniest place in the house there are lots of new buds forming.  I&#8217;m worried about the fact that we&#8217;ve got hard water though &#8211; it&#8217;s not supposed to like that.  Hmm&#8230;</p>
