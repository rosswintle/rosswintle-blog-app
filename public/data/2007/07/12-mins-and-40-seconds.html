<p>Yesterday I set a new personal best for my ride home from work of 13 minutes and 49 seconds, thanks to a new route from my friend Mike and a strong tailwind.</p>
<p>Today I smashed that, doing 12 minutes and 40 seconds!  Thanks today to a slight tailwind and some nice traffic lights!</p>
<p>I may as well throw my cycle computer away now as I&#8217;ll never beat that.</p>
<p>Of course, if I want something to aspire to then there&#8217;s my sister&#8217;s friend who just cycled<br /> John O&#8217;Groats to LAnds End in 7 days.  SEVEN DAYS!!!!
