My excuse: the weather&#8217;s been awful this summer with LOTS of rain. But it&#8217;s finally getting better, so it&#8217;s time to get out and trying to build up the distances again.</p>
<p>Last night managed a measly-but-hilly 13.3 miles out to Wanborough (towards Uffington) and back in just over 45 mins, averaging about 17.3mph.  I played squash before the ride and by the time I finished I was pretty knackered but felt good!  My knees were OK, I felt pretty strong throughout, and my cycling shoes and clipless pedals made it a joy to do.  There were times of riding on the flat at 24mph that just felt really good!</p>
<p>Oh, and I stopped for a while to rescue a little dog who was running around all over a main road too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m encouraged about this short evening ride, but I do need to get the distances up.  Let&#8217;s hope for lots more good weather!</p>
