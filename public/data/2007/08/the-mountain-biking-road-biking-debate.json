        "rendered": "<p><!-- Converted from text\/rtf format -->For my birthday, back in June, my sister and her boyfriend offered to take me on a &#8220;Mountain Biking Experience&#8221;.  As someone who&#8217;s got quite into road cycling, but who also loves the great outdoors, mountain biking really appeals, however, you have to have a decent mountain bike before you can even start, and my cheap hybrid really isn&#8217;t up to the job.<\/p>\n<p>So the idea was that they&#8217;d borrow a decent bike from someone, kit me up, and take me out onto some proper off-road terrain.<\/p>\n<p>This weekend, the moment came for the experience!  And I had a wail of a time.  The weather was great, and Sarah, Guy and another friend called Dave, took me out and around a hilly forest near Bracknell.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/album.php?aid=10718&amp;id=561521789\">Photos here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now, as I&#8217;ve got into cycling on my cheap bike, I&#8217;ve been thinking that I might spend some decent money (if Sally will let me) and buy myself a decent machine at some point. Which raises the question &#8211; what sort of bike would I buy?<\/p>\n<p>At one end of the spectrum is a road bike.  The narrow, slick tyres, aerodynamic riding position, and high gearing, all making it easy to travel long and fast.  At the other end is a mountain bike.  I&#8217;ve been recommended against full suspension (looks like more trouble than it&#8217;s worth), so I&#8217;d get front-shocks, a wide range of gearing, an upright riding position, and some big chunky tyres.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there are points along that spectrum.  Cyclocross bikes are racing bikes with a small amount of off-roadness built in &#8211; carbon forks to absorb vibration and less-skinny, and slightly chunky tyres.  Hybrids are basically mountain bike frames with large, narrow wheels.  Or you could do your own customisations, or have two sets of wheels?<\/p>\n<p>A big dilemma.  Of course, the best solution is two decent bikes &#8211; one road, one off-road.  But I don&#8217;t really see this happening. So what do I do?<\/p>\n<p>The mountain biking experience has helped move this decision along somewhat.  Much as I enjoyed it, it&#8217;s a fun, occasional leisure activity.  Road biking is something I can easily do around here during the week, and I can do a longer ride at weekends without having to go anywhere.  It&#8217;s my day-to-day fitness training activity, rather than an occasional fun day out.  I think I&#8217;d get much more mileage out of a road bike and would use it much more often.  And I can always hire a mountain bike should I want to.<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;now it&#8217;s just a case of saving the money and finding the right machine!<\/p>\n",
