<p>I do sometimes question my own sanity, and I ask myself how I would respond if someone asked me why I did it.  I reckon I could get between 10 and 20 good reasons&#8230;so here goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>It improves my strength.</li>
<li>It improves my fitness.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m likely to live longer.</li>
<li>It takes a car off the road (reduces congestion).</li>
<li>It&#8217;s less polluting.</li>
<li>I breathe in less pollution.</li>
<li>It reduces the need for parking.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s cheaper.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s less stressful (I&#8217;d much rather cycle in the rain than sit in a traffic jam).</li>
<li>It wakes me up.</li>
<li>It burns calories (OK, so I take them in again by eating more!).</li>
<li>It makes me feel good.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s fun (in a strange way).</li>
</ol>
<p>13 without much thinking!  There must be more&#8230;</p>
