I hope to occasionally jot down what I think of books, films, maybe music here.  Not reviews, but reminders to me of what the thing was about and what I thought of it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just finished reading &#8220;Velvet Elvis: Repainting the Christian Faith&#8221;, kindly loaned to me by a friend.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a book about&#8230;well, I&#8217;m not sure what.  It&#8217;s a general overview of what the author &#8211; the &#8220;pastor&#8221; of a large, fairly liberal church in Michigan &#8211; thinks about Christianity I suppose.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a controversial book for some.  I agreed with most of it but had problems with some things.  I&#8217;ll just give a very quick overview of the chapters (or &#8220;movements&#8221; as he calls them).  Forgive any use of church jargon that you don&#8217;t understand, it&#8217;s hard to talk about these things in a brief way without using words that either mean nothing or are loaded with meaning.</p>
<p>The chapters have names, not numbers, and are as follows:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Jump </span>is about the building blocks of faith.  He touches on &#8220;creeds&#8221; (statements of faith) and explains how they are useful but need to be flexible (like springs, not bricks), and why it&#8217;s OK to have questions and why joy is important.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Yoke</span> is about different teachings, truth, and how it&#8217;s important to interpret the Bible.  By this he means both understanding what the writings would have meant to their original audience 2000 years ago, and in terms of re-applying what is said to our culture today.  His biblical, historical and cultural knowledge shines through the whole book and is very interesting.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">True</span>. I suspect this is a controversial chapter and I found it difficult myself &#8211; especially his notion of finding truth around us.  I agree that you can find elements of truth outside of what&#8217;s written in the Bible but he seems to think that, if it seems OK to you then you can call it truth.  I&#8217;m a bit more fundamental in that I think there is an ultimate truth to find, and that you can find things that are &#8220;good&#8221; outside of that truth, but not all the &#8220;good&#8221; things are &#8220;true&#8221;, or indeed helpful.  I do agree that we are too inflexible with our beliefs and application of truth and that this is bad, but I found Bell to be too soft with the general notion of truth itself.</p>
<p>Other bits of this chapter were good with stuff about how God is everywhere but we don&#8217;t always recognise it, and about taking our faith with us into our whole lives&#8230;good stuff!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Tassels</span> is about being real with ourselves and healing of the soul.  There&#8217;s some of Rob Bell&#8217;s story of how he came to lead this huge church and then have a bit of a breakdown and what that all meant for him and how God helped him through it.  He explains how we also need to go through a similar process sometimes.  Pretty nitty-gritty stuff that&#8217;s easy to read and hard to actually be real with, but full of great truth.  Includes a great section about the sabbath!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Dust </span>is about &#8220;discipleship&#8221;; that is, being called by and following in the teachings and life of Jesus.  Again, lots of historical and cultural background make some very interesting reading but other then a good feeling about being chosen, I didn&#8217;t feel it challenged me much.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">New</span> is about grace and the process of being &#8220;made new&#8221; which happens when we believe in Jesus.  Essentially about how we get forgiven for &#8220;sin&#8221; (the wrong stuff we&#8217;ve done)<br />and how, if we believe in Jesus, this happens by what God has done and not by anything that we do.  It&#8217;s about being who we were meant to be and making the world more like it was meant to be.  There&#8217;s a call to action in there somewhere and a challenge to be people who &#8220;bring heaven to earth&#8221;.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Good</span> continues the theme talking about renewal and how heaven isn&#8217;t somewhere that we will be going, but rather somewhere that the earth will one day be.  It&#8217;s coming here, rather than we&#8217;re going there.  Rob Bell&#8217;s real frustration seems to come out here as he talks about what the &#8220;church&#8221; should be.  This is what it&#8217;s all about.  Creeds, teachings, truth, healing of the soul, discipleship, grace, all leading to us &#8211; people that follow Jesus &#8211; being people who lead a life of serving God and serving others in order to bring the goodness of heaven to earth.  Phew.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the book.  It was a good and easy read.  Rob Bell writes in a very conversational style and obviously is a very knowledgeable and wise man.  I&#8217;d love to read more of his explaining of the Bible and the Jewish culture and traditions.</p>
<p>A few things I didn&#8217;t like &#8211; aside from where I didn&#8217;t necessarily agree with him.</p>
<p>I think he overuses metaphor.  Bricks, tassels, velvet Elvises, superpastors, tour guides.  It peters out after a while but at the start he really overdoes it, stretching the analogies further than the springs on his trampoline.</p>
<p>And I think he&#8217;s not challenging enough.  He makes some good points but, as I said before, a warm feeling is about all I got.  Maybe it&#8217;s the conversational tone?  It made me want to think about things, not to actually change them.</p>
<p>The overall feeling I&#8217;m left with is that he should be writing a different book.  Perhaps if he focussed more on the history and less on the philosophy I&#8217;d find him a better read?  But then, if he did that he&#8217;d be writing a completely different book.  And I think I quite liked the book.  But I might need a second read to be sure.  Martin, can I borrow it a bit longer???</p>
