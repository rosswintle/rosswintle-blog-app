<p>To celebrate I did 13.75 miles round the hills of Wroughton and Chiseldon.  A good hilly ride that I did with a really fit friend and actually managed to keep up!</p>
<p>This week I&#8217;ve discovered <a href="http://www.quickcup.co.uk/">a funky kettle</a> that heats water on demand in a few seconds.  Genius.  I&#8217;m forever switching the kettle on, walking off and then forgetting about it (repeat three times before ACTUALLY making a cup of coffee).  It&#8217;s expensive but I reckon it&#8217;d pay for itself quickly (the manufacturer says 2 years) and save loads of energy too!</p>
<p>I also discovered <a href="http://www.bikely.com">Bikely.com</a> further to my post about <a href="http://wintle.blogspot.com/2007/06/route-planning-news.html">route planning</a>, Bikely is now my favourite way of doing cycle routes.  It gives gradient profiles, allows you to share routes, downloads routes so that you can do fly-throughs in Google Earth.  The only thing it doesn&#8217;t really do is give you a decent map of a long route.  You can get a crib sheet with vague directions but I would want to do a long ride on roads that I don&#8217;t know with just that.  Recommended!</p>
