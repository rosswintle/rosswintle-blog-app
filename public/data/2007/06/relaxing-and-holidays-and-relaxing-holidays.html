<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Relaxing and Holidays and Relaxing Holidays</h1></header><main><div>Saturday &#8211; the end of our week in Cornwall.  And what a lovely time we&#8217;ve had.  We&#8217;re travelling back via Devon to visit Sally&#8217;s folks and we are staying over with them.</p>
<p>This holiday marks an important change for me.  I normally think of myself as not being very good at holidays.  I normally find it hard to relax and want to go home after a few days.  But this week has been really easy and I&#8217;ve enjoyed it a lot&#8230;so much so that I wanted to stay.  In fact, I think I could have stayed for another whole week!!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really know why this is but I&#8217;ll certainly be making a mental note that I like longer holidays from now on.</div>
