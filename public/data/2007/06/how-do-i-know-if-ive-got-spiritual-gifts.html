SHAPE is an acronym, standing for &#8220;Spritual Gifts, Heart, Abilities, Personality, Experiences&#8221;.  It&#8217;s intended to help you look at those five things, think a bit about what things you have that fit into those categories, and work out what things you might be able to do well in serving God.</p>
<p>The Spiritual Gifts bit was first and, as you might expect, raised the most questions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear from the Bible, more so in the New Testament, but also in the Old, that God gives particular &#8220;gifts&#8221; or abilities to people and he does this &#8220;by his spirit&#8221;&#8230;that is, those abilities are specifically given by God in a &#8220;supernatural&#8221; kind of way.</p>
<p>From my point of view, gifts of the spirit fall into two categories:</p>
<p>1) things that are always obviously of God when they happen, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>healing</li>
<li>prophecy (speaking God&#8217;s thoughts to groups of people)</li>
<li>words of knowledge (when God tells you something &#8211; like prophecy but different)</li>
<li>miracles</li>
<li>tongues/languages and interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will call these the &#8220;difficult gifts&#8221; &#8211; because it&#8217;s more difficult to believe that we have them, and requires more faith to use them&#8230;I think.</p>
<p>2) things that might be of God but you can never be sure, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>music</li>
<li>administration</li>
<li>hospitality</li>
<li>wisdom</li>
<li>teaching</li>
<li>leadership</li>
</ul>
<p>I specifically draw a line here between the &#8220;difficult&#8221; gifts and the &#8220;non-difficult&#8221; gifts because this is the main thing I want to speak about.</div>
<p></p>
<div> </div>
<p>In my experience the &#8220;difficult&#8221; spiritual gifts are less commonly found. I know lots of people who seem to be blessed by God with real ability in music, hospitality, and teaching. I know few prophets, healers and miracle workers.</p>
<p>Yet it doesn&#8217;t make sense to me that God would distribute the gifts unevenly.  In fact, because he&#8217;s such an awesome God who should choose to reveal himself and his thoughts to his people, I would expect to see MORE healers and prophets than the easier things.</p>
<div> </div>
<p></p>
<div>Which makes me wonder if maybe there are lots of people that are healers, prophets, miracle workers, etc that don&#8217;t know if they have those gifts?  And if this is the case, how do we nurture these gifts in people?  How should the church encourage people to &#8220;seek the greater gifts&#8221; as the bible says?  How do we know if we have the difficult gifts if we don&#8217;t have opportunities to try and use them?  How shall we go about discovering who our prophets and healers are?</p>
<p>This is really the main thing I&#8217;ve learned from the SHAPE course.  That we should be praying and asking God for the difficult gifts &#8211; he tells us to do this.  But how practically should we be trying out these things if we think that God has given them to us?</div>
