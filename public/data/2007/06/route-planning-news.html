<p>However, I found a few new things today that make it better for route planning.</p>
<ol>
<li>It now has an &#8220;Avoid Highways&#8221; option, for those of you that don&#8217;t want to cycle on motorways!</li>
<li>It now lets you go &#8220;via&#8221; somewhere&#8230;though this isn&#8217;t entirely clear.  You can set a destination and then click &#8220;Add destination&#8221; button to go somewhere else.  Though you can drag and drop your destinations around to re-order them.  You can also use the syntax &#8220;to:destination&#8221; to add more destinations.  e.g.  &#8220;from:Swindon to:Marlborough to:Bath&#8221;</li>
</ol>
