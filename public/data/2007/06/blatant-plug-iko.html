<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Blatant Plug: Iko</h1></header><main><p>I&#8217;d like to recommend a band.  A band who don&#8217;t quite have the status of &#8220;next big thing&#8221; but who, in my opinion, thoroughly deserve it.  A band who, as far as I can tell, have been on the verge of being &#8220;big&#8221; for about 5 years.</p>
<p>I recommend them not because the lead singer and guitarist is an old friend of a friend, but because I think they&#8217;re music and songwriting is fantastic, and because I think they have a really unique sound that should be appreciated by more people.</p>
<p>I appreciate that music is subjective.  You may hate them.  But please try them out?  They are Iko and they&#8217;ve just released a little video of their recent tour of Denmark.  They live at http://www.ikomusic.com and http://www.myspace.com/ikomusic</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
