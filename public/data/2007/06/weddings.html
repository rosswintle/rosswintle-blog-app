<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Weddings</h1></header><main><div>Yesterday was the wedding of some good friends of ours.  A brilliant day, great church service, good worship, very much a wedding where God was present.  A real sense of two becoming one and a change of status in their relationship.</p>
<p>It was interesting going to a Christian wedding with a mixed bunch of people (some who would prefess a faith in Jesus and others who wouldn&#8217;t).  It made me wonder what other people make of Christian weddings.</p>
<p>I always find Christian weddings special.  It&#8217;s not just a spoken commitment with a bit of ritual wrapped around it.  The parts of the typical English wedding ceremony are all very meaningful to Christians; from the opening words of the vicar, the songs, the ceremony itself, the prayers, through to the final blessing at the end.</p>
<p>The marriage is centered on the vows and the commitments made in them, and it usually marks a very deep change in the couple&#8217;s status.  Often they have abstained from sex before marriage, and probably haven&#8217;t lived together.  And, of course, there is the real sense of celebration of the bride and groom as individuals, and as a newly formed couple.</p>
<p>Whereas, admittedly not all of them, but most church weddings of non-Christian people, I find a bit false.  It&#8217;s odd to hear people speaking and singing things that they don&#8217;t necessarily believe, and  I find it odd when the party afterwards is made more important than the marriage itself.   This is not a sensation that has been exclusive to my Christian life.  I went to a church wedding of some friends even before I started finding out about God and it just felt awkward.</p>
<p>Yet I find myself wondering what other people make of it all.  Do people who don&#8217;t follow the Christian faith find Weddings of believers different to weddings of non-believers?  Does it seem &#8220;special&#8221; to them?  Does it seem more meaningful?  I wonder what our worship looks like from the outside?</p>
<p>Of course, I don&#8217;t wish to devalue the marriage of people who don&#8217;t follow Christ.  The commitment of marriage is incredibly special and I support it, uphold it, and respect it however it is done.  I would much rather people get married, if it&#8217;s the right thing for them to do, than not get married!</p>
<p>But as a little windows into the lives and rituals of believers, I wonder how these ceremonies look and feel to others, what effect it has on them, and what we might be able to learn from their experiences.</div>
