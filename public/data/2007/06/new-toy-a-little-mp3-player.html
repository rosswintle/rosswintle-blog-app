I&#8217;m not over the top in this respect, but I like it when technology can improve my life or do something useful.  So when I buy new &#8220;toys&#8221;, I&#8217;ve generally thought quite hard about it.</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t intend to start making this a &#8220;Gadget Review Blog&#8221;, but when I buy new &#8220;toys&#8221; I&#8217;ll try and say why I bought them and what I think about them in the hope that my thoughts benefit someone else &#8211; or myself at a later date.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Why buy a little MP3 player?</span></p>
<p>The background to this is that, after much deliberation, I bought a big-proper 30GB Apple iPod about a year ago.  I&#8217;m very pleased with this and it&#8217;s good for long journeys, by train or car, or to give me a day&#8217;s tunes at work.  But, despite being almost miraculously small for what it does, it&#8217;s too big and too fragile to be used when walking, cycling (on quiet roads only of course), or when at the gym.</p>
<p>So, for a while I&#8217;ve been thinking about a cheap, ultra-small, solid-state music player to go alongside it.  For the less-technical, solid-state means that it has no moving parts.  Given that I like iTunes (for reasons I won&#8217;t go into here), an iPod Shuffle seems like the obvious choice &#8211; as it will easily sync to an iTunes playlist (or smart playlist).  It took a while to come around to the idea of a player without a screen, but I can see how it fulfills the need to just shove something in your pocket full of your favourite tunes, and go.  So a Shuffle has been on my shopping list for a while.</p>
<p>THEN, I discovered <a href="http://ita.sourceforge.net/">iTunes Agent</a>, which is a far-from perfect piece of software, but one which allows you to sync non-Apple devices with iTunes.  This opens up the possibilities a bit more.</p>
<p>Originally I sync&#8217;ed my Sony Ericsson Walkman mobile phone with it, and took that to the gym a few times.  However, the controls on the walkman phone aren&#8217;t great (they get locked out by the phone&#8217;s &#8220;auto-lock&#8221; feature) but then I found the Creative &#8220;Stone&#8221;.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Stone&#8221; is Creative&#8217;s equivalent of the iPod Shuffle.  It&#8217;s got 1GB capacity, no display, simple controls and ~8 hours battery life.  At around Â£23, it&#8217;s about half the price of an iPod Shuffle!  Bargain.</p>
<p>So I got one.  Here it is with headphones, close up, and next to some chewing gum for scale!</p>

<p>Looks pretty.  Looks TINY!!! But does it do the job?</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m happy to say that yes, it does.  It&#8217;s easy to use, sounds good and does everything that it says it does.  I&#8217;ve not had the battery run out on me yet.  It feels sturdy and has survived many hours in my pocket already without much damage.</p>
<p>I could only pick out three odd things, though these are more observations than annoyances.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">It can only be charged from a USB port</span>.  It comes with a short mini-USB cable to do this, but other charging options would be nice. Having said that, charging is quick and the battery lasts a good while, particularly as it&#8217;s not a device I&#8217;ll use for LONG periods of time.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">It takes a while to start up</span>.  When you turns it on there&#8217;s about 20 seconds of silence before it does anything.  My guess is that it&#8217;s scanning the files that you&#8217;ve loaded onto it. Fortunately it only does this after a total shutdown.  You can happily pause and restart music and it will only turn completely off if you leave it paused for a long time.</li>
<li>Unlike the iPod Shuffle, <span style="font-weight:bold;">it doesn&#8217;t have a &#8220;hold&#8221; switch</span> &#8211; used to &#8220;lock&#8221; the controls so that you don&#8217;t make accidental <a href="void(0)"><span></span></a>button presses when the thing is in your pocket.  However, this isn&#8217;t a problem as the buttons are very nicely set up so that they need too much force to press accidentally, but not so much that you can&#8217;t easily use the controls.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, I like my &#8220;Stone&#8221; and I&#8217;m glad I bought it.  It serves a simple purpose and will make many a trip to the gym with me.  I&#8217;d recommend it to someone that wants a simple, cheap, micro-sized media player, and with iTA, you can sync with iTunes and have a &#8220;Shuffle&#8221; equivalent for half the price.</p>
