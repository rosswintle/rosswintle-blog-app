<p>Did a short walk in the morning to Poltesco &#8211; a lovely little National Trust-owned cove only a couple of miles from Cadgwith.  It finally rained!!</p>
<p>But this post is mostly about holiday cycling.  We&#8217;ve made our first use of the rack that my dad gave us that lets us put the bikes on the car and go places.  It was a bit nerve racking at first but it&#8217;s very secure!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been such a busy holiday that we only actually did 2 rides.  On Tuesday to Helford (see the post from that day and the <a href="http://www.bikely.com/maps/bike-path/Ruan-Minor-Cadgwith-to-Helford-Passenger-Ferry">route on Bikely</a>), and today, in the afternoon, I did a faster ride by myself on the same route we did to Helford, but only as far as Newtown.</p>
<p>These have been good rides.  Slightly hilly but quiet roads.  A bit disappointing that some roads were very narrow so you didn&#8217;t want to get too much speed up in case anything came the other way.</div>

<p>Fitness-wise, I&#8217;ve got a new strain in the form of an aching wrist, but I had this on the way to Cornwall in the car and so it&#8217;s probably related to driving!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d definitely take the bikes away on holiday again!</p>
