There, it&#8217;s out, you can all start jeering me and calling me a spod and asking where my sandals are, or, at the very least, call me up asking why your screen has turned a nice shade of purple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;">This therefore might not make complete sense to all of you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;">The other day at work I did a software upgrade on a test system.  Once the main upgrade was complete it was supposed to automatically go round and upgrade some components on some remote systems.  Because I don&#8217;t trust this process I was logged on to the remote server and watched it happen.  And I watched it fail.  The process just stopped without doing what it was supposed to do.  I then tried to do the upgrade on the remote system manually and that failed too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;">I logged the fault with my software supplier and today they came back to me to say that it had initially failed because a disk was full, and that when I manually tried to re-run it, it failed again because a file was locked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;">So, we pay thousands of pounds for this software and they people that develop it can&#8217;t even write:</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;">$SUCCESS=open($FILE)</span><br /><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;">if (not $SUCCESS)</span><br /><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;">then</span><br /><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;">  log_error(&#8220;An error occurred while opening $FILE&#8221;)</span><br /><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;">end if</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;">Admittedly an error like this was written to a (very large and mostly indecipherable) log file, but did it not occur to them that this might be something that the user might like to know about?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;">I despair sometimes.</span></p>
