You mostly hear good things about it but occasionally you meet someone that thought it was rubbish.  I can see why people might not like it but I thought it was fascinating, beautiful, educational and inspiring.</div>
<p></p>
<div>A visit to the Eden Project raises lots of questions about our planet.  I&#8217;d probably fall into the category of very-nearly-green-hippy.  Partly driven by my faith &#8211; my belief in a creator and in our duty to look after His creation &#8211; and partly driven by science and common sense, I believe we should reduce, recycle and reuse as much as possible.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been having a lot of conversations at work about being green.  Mostly with people who slightly mock the concept of being overtly, or overly, environmentally friendly.  Mostly with people who think I&#8217;m silly for cycling in the rain (but that&#8217;s another issue altogether).  I feel in a minority there.</p>
<p>But most of the discussions aren&#8217;t actually about the concepts of waste, wastefulness, packaging, reuse of materials and consumerism.  Most of the discussions are about &#8220;Carbon Footprints&#8221;, which I don&#8217;t really understand myself and which, to me, seem to be just marketing to make us feel good about buying a product or service.  But I don&#8217;t actually get what it means to put a tonne of carbon dioxide into the air!  In contrast, I DO get what it means to put a plastic bag in a landfill.  It means that I&#8217;ve wasted some oil &#8211; a precious natural resource that will, one day pretty soon now, run out &#8211; in order to produce something that I&#8217;ve then discarded on a big heap and which will sit there being a plastic bag in the way, for a VERY long time.</div>
<p></p>
<div>I&#8217;m all for being carbon neutral.  But I&#8217;m more for thinking about how much stuff we use and throw away.  And by &#8220;use&#8221; I include &#8220;burn to make energy&#8221;, which means that my concept of &#8220;reducing&#8221; includes lowering emissions, but, so I think, seems to be a more holistic approach.</div>
<p></p>
<div>What&#8217;s this got to do with my holiday and the Eden Project?</p>
<p>Well, there aren&#8217;t many things that I don&#8217;t like about the lovely cottage that we&#8217;re staying in, but one thing that bugs me is that we can&#8217;t recycle.  Everything is thrown in the bin (well, we&#8217;re going to take some stuff home with us too).  This means that in 5 days we&#8217;ve produced about 2 times as much waste as we&#8217;d normally produce at home.  It&#8217;s shocking how, without compost and recycling, it mounts up so quickly.</div>
<p></p>
<div>In contrast, the Eden Project was keen to talk about how it was trying to be &#8220;waste neutral&#8221;.  Reducing the amount of waste that they produce, reusing items where it is possible, recycling what&#8217;s left, and buying recycled goods (and thus creating demand for recycled products).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s expensive, and it sounds like hard work and lots of thinking.  They declare it to be &#8220;a philosophy for life&#8221;.  It&#8217;s a challenge to all of us.  It&#8217;s a challenge to me!  How much do I think about the waste that will be produced by an item that I buy?  How often do I get lazy and throw something away because to take it home and recycle it would be too much hard work?  Am I willing to pay a bit extra for something that&#8217;s locally sourced, recycled, or in &#8220;green&#8221; packaging?</p>
</div>
<p>One other thing that I wondered was, are we doing enough?  That is are we DOING enough?</p>
<p>The Eden Project sells lots of books.  Mostly books about being green and ethical.  It&#8217;s good to read (or write!) an article or book about this kind of thing.  It&#8217;s good to be inspired by the wonders of nature on display at the Eden Project and feel protective of our amazing planet.  It&#8217;s good to read about how others are adopting this philosophy for life.  It&#8217;s good to think and ask the questions.</p>
<p>But when we get to the supermarket, or need to travel somewhere nearby, or book a holiday, or are throwing something in the bin&#8230;when we have a choice to make a difference&#8230;what are we actually going to choose to do?</p>
