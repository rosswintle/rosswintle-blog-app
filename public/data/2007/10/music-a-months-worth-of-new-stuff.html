Sally and I are booked in to see Martyn Joseph and KT Tunstall in the coming months, plus, there was a new Athlete album out that I splashed out on.  Thoughts below:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Drastic Fantsatic &#8211; KT Tunstall</span></p>
<p>The catchiest of the new albums, very easy to get into.  KT is a good songwriter, a very accomplished musican and singer, and she&#8217;s intelligent too.  We very much liked the first album and this one didn&#8217;t disappoint as a follow up.</p>
<p>The songs are a variety of styles, there&#8217;s folk, rock and roll, ballads, pop, even a hint of Latin American.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great album, but I don&#8217;t think it will quite have the lasting appeal of &#8220;Through the Telescope&#8221;.  Enjoying it for the moment though.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Vegas &#8211; Martyn Joseph</span></p>
<p>This is the album about which I&#8217;d like to say the most.  I became a fan of MJ quite recently (probably after the Bush Hall gig&#8230;3 yeas ago?) and missed out on a lot of his older stuff.  But he is one of my favourite musicians.</p>
<p>For those that don&#8217;t know, he&#8217;s a Welsh folk-rocker who writes about stuff that he really cares about and sings and plays with an enormous amount of passion.</p>
<p>This record is a bit different to some of his other stuff.  MJ himself says something like &#8220;it might even make you smile&#8221;.  And that&#8217;s true &#8211; there&#8217;s a tribute to Elvis and some other nice moments, but he remains gritty, slightly angry, political, and, occasionally melancholy.</p>
<p>I must confess that after a few listens I&#8217;m feeling like the album doesn&#8217;t have much new &#8211; it feels like a union of the last two (&#8220;Whoever it was that brought me here&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;Deep Blue&#8221;).</p>
<p>Song-wise examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vegas is a catchy tribute with an easy chorus, in much the same way as &#8220;This Being Woman&#8221;;</li>
<li>&#8220;Weight of the World&#8221; is a bit like &#8220;This Fragile World&#8221;;</li>
<li>&#8220;Nobody Loves You Anymore&#8221; is reminiscent of &#8220;Six Sixty Six&#8221; (though I&#8217;ll avoid comparisons of George Bush and the Devil &#8211; that would be going too far);</li>
<li>&#8220;The Fading of Light&#8221; seems to be an updated &#8220;Yet Still This Will Not Be&#8221;;</li>
<li>and &#8220;The things that we have carried here&#8221; is like &#8220;Whoever it was that brought me here&#8230;&#8221; in more than just the length of the song name.</li>
</ul>
<p>But that shouldn&#8217;t detract from the quality of this album.  MJ&#8217;s consistently good songwriting hasn&#8217;t gone away.  His percussive accoustic guitar playing makes sounds like a single instrument shouldn&#8217;t.  His intricate fingerstyle is beautiful as ever.  And his vocals, though mostly lacking range of pitch, vary from the haunting whispers of &#8220;Kindness&#8221; to the angry growls of &#8220;Nobody Loves You Any More&#8221; .The little flourishes of percussion, harmonica, woodwind, strings, piano, even an electric guitar or two (!) add depth and interest without detracting from the key elements of MJ&#8217;s voice and guitar.</p>
<p>I DO like this album.  A lot.  I will play it over and over.  And the gig in November will be one of the highlights of my year. But I&#8217;d like to see him writing about something a bit different next time&#8230;perhaps a few elections, on both sides of the pond, will make for some more variety in the next album.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Beyond the Neighbourhood &#8211; Athlete</span></p>
<p>And the album I&#8217;ll say the least about.  Certainly the most difficult to get into!</p>
<p>Athlete&#8217;s first album was a catchy, pop-rock record.  The second, Wires, was more downbeat, but more mature.  I still haven&#8217;t quite got to grips with all of it but the music is excellent and it was worth spending time having it grow on me &#8211; there&#8217;s some cracking songs on there.  I suspect this third album is like the second.  It&#8217;s in the shadow of two much more easily accessible albums at the moment, but I will persevere.</p>
<p>Musically it sounds rich and intricate and I suspect there&#8217;s some awesome songs on there &#8211; I&#8217;ve just not found them yet&#8230;or they&#8217;ve not found me.</p>
<p>Maybe more notes required in a few weeks.</p>
