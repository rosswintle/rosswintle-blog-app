<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Exchange!!!</h1></header><main><p>So after a long and complicated couple of days, which I won&#8217;t go into the details of here, we finally exchanged contracts on the house and will complete on Friday!  Wow.  We will own 5% of a house (and be borrowing the rest from the bank).</p>
<p>After weeks of not very much happening this is quite a sudden thing, but we&#8217;re very excited.</p>
<p>Time to pack some boxes, book a van, phone BT, arrange broadband, move utilities, set up redirection, pack some more boxes, hand in notice on the rented house, and a thousand and one other things&#8230;none of which involve writing this blog!</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
