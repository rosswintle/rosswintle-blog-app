<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Back in the saddle!</h1></header><main><p>After the successes of mountain climbing at the weekend I&#8217;m back into cycling to work.  And it feels great.  Going slowly and steadily at the moment but hopefully we&#8217;ll be out on training runs again soon.</p>
<p>Funny how this has become so important to me.  I feel I have some of my identity back now I can cycle again.  And with the new school term starting driving has been a nightmare &#8211; I&#8217;d much rather be speeding along on my bike than sat in traffic!</p>
<p>I have a new day-glo waterproof jacket too.  This is great for visibility and is, in my opinion, a fairly sporty-looking thing (rather than the nerdy day-glo work jackets you can get).  I found a down side today though when I went to put the recycling out before heading off to work.  The next door neighbour thought I was the bin man!!!  Still &#8211; gave Sally a laugh.</p>
