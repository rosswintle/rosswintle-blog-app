<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">New beginnings</h1></header><main><p>I&#8217;m not supposed to be here this evening.  I&#8217;m supposed to be at a friend&#8217;s stag do but I&#8217;m feeling pretty ill and need to just rest.  Sorry Dave.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m taking the chance to kick off this writing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried Blogs before and given up quite quickly &#8211; and probably will this time too.  But I&#8217;ve just moved to a new town and I&#8217;m discovering lots of new things&#8230;or possibly rediscovering old ones.</p>
<p>Actually I&#8217;ve just moved BACK to an &#8220;old&#8221; town, Swindon, my original home, which I moved from about 10 years ago.  It&#8217;s been a big move, from the centre of London to a small, new town in the west.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve long been sceptical of Swindon but I&#8217;m starting to see what a good move it is.</p>
<p>Things I&#8217;m (re)discovering: cycling, gyms, the outdoors, gardens, being involved in a music group at church.</p>
<p>My intention is to record some of my discoveries, trials, and successes.  More for my own benefit than that of others.  But perhaps someone else will find it useful too?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll wait and see.  I give it a month.</p>
