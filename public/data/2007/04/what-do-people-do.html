<p>Got me thinking&#8230;what do people who don&#8217;t believe in God do when I tell them I&#8217;m not well?  The obvious response from a Christian is &#8220;I&#8217;ll pray for you&#8221;, and through that God can speak to us and get us to see the situation through his eyes and show us ways to help.  But the non-believer has no where to go.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so blessed to have friends who can pray, believing it will make a difference.  And it does.</p>
