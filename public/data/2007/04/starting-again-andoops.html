<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Starting again and&#8230;oops!</h1></header><main><p>So, I&#8217;ve been thinking for a while, for a number of reasons, that I&#8217;ll start writing again. Mostly to do with new things that I&#8217;m discovering. As always, it probably won&#8217;t last.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m feeling a bit rubbish today but was entertained by this error from Google &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure if you can read it but it simply says &#8220;Oops!  That wasn&#8217;t supposed to happen.&#8221;&#8230;</p>
