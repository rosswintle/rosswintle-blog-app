I happened across this on the BBC Website &#8211; a cyclist very much like me who&#8217;s won some &#8220;competition&#8221;.  Seems his prize is to train for 10 weeks for a 120 mile ride and keep a video diary of the process.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/cycling/get_involved/6569525.stm">Here&#8217;s the link</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another cool link to a site called <a href="http://www.everydaycycling.com/">Everyday Cycling</a> that has routes, events and a journal/ride log and some community features.  Looks a bit basic but anything that encourages people to get on their bikes regularly is a good thing.</p>
<p>I guess I&#8217;ll keep tabs on his experiences &#8211; if I can find out how to make the BBC website keep me up to date.  He sounds a lot like me &#8211; commutes a short distance but wants to do something bigger.</p>
<p>I love his comments on lycra shorts &#8211; but padded pants are GREAT (hence having them in my blog title &#8211; I&#8217;ll explain it all one day).</p>
