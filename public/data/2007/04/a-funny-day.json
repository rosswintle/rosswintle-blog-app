However, I was just about to leave for the stag day I&#8217;m supposed to be at, when I collapsed in a heap and cried.  I was wept, on-and-off, and uncontrollably, for about 2 hours. There was no reason for it. I can only put it in the category of &#8220;depression&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Theories:<br \/>1) a combination of tiredness, stress, fighting off a bug, giving blood on Wednesday night, and hundred other things&#8230;I&#8217;ve not slept well for about 3 nights now.<br \/>2) my hay fever tablets.  I take loratadine, and have been on them on-and-off for a week or two.  After Googling them Sally found that they can cause depression.  Perhaps taking them after giving blood (and thus having a higher concentration of the stuff in my blood) made me really low.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway.  We eventually decided to both stay at home (which I feel very bad about).  We&#8217;ve sat around in the garden, read the paper, enjoyed the nesting birds (more later), and written a few letters.<\/p>\n<p>I can now empathise with people who&#8217;ve had depression.  It was scary feeling out of control of my emotions.  Just crying for no reason at all!<\/p>\n<p>I can only hope that it doesn&#8217;t come back.<\/p>\n",
