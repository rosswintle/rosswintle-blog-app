<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Lots of lovely links and Googlaholism</h1></header><main><p>Phew &#8211; what a glut of posts to start with.</p>
<p>I mentioned a few links in my last post and just wanted to make a note about the fact that I&#8217;m currently managing my links using <a href="http://www.google.com/bookmarks">Google Bookmarks</a> and <a href="http://toolbar.google.com">Google Toolbar</a>.  This works well as it allows me to keep my favourites with Google and get to them from wherever I can login &#8211; I get the same favourites/bookmarks on all the three computers I mainly use (work, home desktop and home laptop).</p>
<p>In fact, I&#8217;m a bit of a Google addict &#8211; documents, bookmarks, mail, maps, notes, RSS feeds &#8211; they&#8217;re all on Google.  I&#8217;m sure this is a bad thing in the grand scheme of things &#8211; having all your eggs in one commercial basket, but their user interfaces are so simple and intuitive, their software is good and works well, it&#8217;s clean, quick and it all works like a dream.</p>
<p>I should probably hate Google as much as I hate Microsoft but somehow I can&#8217;t bring myself to.  Perhaps that&#8217;s a blog for another time.</p>
<p>The bookmarks are good though.</p>
