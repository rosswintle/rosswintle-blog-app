All the latest gadgets.&#8217; But it&#8217;s not quite true. And it&#8217;s especially not true in the world of entertainment. We barely have HDTV, I&#8217;m not a big gamer, and we still buy most of our music on CD and we purchase real paper books.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve been making forays into digital entertainment and questioning my own desire to have physical media for everything, and also playing with going &#8216;paperless&#8217;. </p>
<p>This is the first in a mini-series of notes about &#8216;Going Digital&#8217;. Each will cover a separate real world thing (books, music, notes) that I&#8217;ve been going digital with, and will evaluate the tools I tried and how close to fully-digital I&#8217;ve become with that thing.</p>
<p>But before tackling the things&#8230;why has Going Digital been so hard, and what changed?</p>

<h2>Not-So-Digital</h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;ve been so slow to embrace digital entertainment media. I mean, I&#8217;ve had an MP3 player for years, I now (somewhat ashamedly) have an iPhone and an iPad. I&#8217;ve been on broadband for years too. I&#8217;m generally not an early adopter of technology, but I certainly get in pre-mainstream.</p>
<p>I guess I&#8217;ve been held back by what-ifs. If all my music and books are digital, it seems easier to lose. I need it backed up, and that backup needs to be safe.</p>
<p>Plus we&#8217;ve had cars with CD players, so CDs have remained important. And we&#8217;ve just not had devices suitable for proper reading on.</p>
<h2>What changed?</h2>
<p>For music, the thing that changed was the cloud. Frustrated with only having a small percentage of my music on my mobile devices, I recently tried out cloud music services to keep all my music in &#8216;the cloud&#8217;.</p>
<p>For books it was the iPad, which I decided could actually be a decent eBook reader.</p>
<p>The iPad has also made a &#8216;paperless office&#8217; more feasible, so I&#8217;ve been playing with tools that achieve that, and note-taking tools in particular.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not found going digital easy, the number of services and apps that you could possibly use is huge and finding the tools that work for you needs trial and error. I can see why people stick with what they know in the form of paper and CD&#8217;s!</p>
<p>I hope the posts that follow help you choose tools without needing to try them out, and help ou on your own journey of Going Digital.</p>
