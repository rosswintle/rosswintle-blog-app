If you missed it you might want to <a href=\"https:\/\/rosswintle.uk\/2013\/06\/going-digital-introduction\/\">read the introduction<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>My History of Digital Music<\/h2>\n<p>Here&#39;s a little potted history of digital music in my life.<\/p>\n<p>Let me let you in to a little secret: I thought Mini-Discs were <strong>great<\/strong>! But the rest of the world wasn&#39;t so keen and they died out with the advent of MP3s.  Having been bitten by that, I was shy of MP3 players and so have generally been slow on the uptake of digital music.<\/p>\n<p>Digital music software didn&#39;t help. The best software in terms of organising files was iTunes, but it was (and still is) big and slow and clunky. That hindered the process.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, our car has always had a CD player, so we&#39;ve always had CDs, and there is, I suppose, a general nostalgia for physical media and a fear of files disappearing that has contributed to us clinging to music on disc.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually I found myself with an iPhone, which was great for music. But as numbers of apps and photos grew it became impossible to store anything like a decent selection of music.<\/p>\n<p>Conveniently, this was around the time that cloud music services started to become available.  It was time to Go Digital! Or was it?<\/p>\n<p>To go fully digital I&#8217;d need a cloud music service to store my music with and to be able to access it from my computer and mobile devices, and I&#8217;d need to be buying music downloads instead of CDs.<\/p>\n<h2>Cloud Music Services<\/h2>\n<p>Cloud music services either give you access to a vast range of music stored at the music service, usually for a subscription, or they let you upload and store all of the music that you own in &#39;the cloud&#39;.  Some services avoid the need to upload ALL of your music by matching it to music that&#39;s already stored at the music service.<\/p>\n<p>I researched a few cloud music services. I don&#39;t listen to music enough to make a subscription to something like Spotify worthwhile, so it was an upload\/matching service that I needed.<\/p>\n<p>At the time I signed up there were only two services available in the UK: iTunes Match and Amazon Cloud Player.  Google Play Music has since become available in the UK.<\/p>\n<h3>Costs and tracks<\/h3>\n<p>These services limit you to a certain number of tracks.  For Amazon this is 250 for the free service and 250,000 for the paid service.  iTunes only has a paid service and it gives you 25,000 songs. Google&#39;s service is free and allows 20,000 songs.<\/p>\n<p>iTunes Match and Amazon&#39;s upgraded storage for cloud player are both \u00a321.99 per year.<\/p>\n<p>So Google&#39;s service is the best value for money. But does it do what I need?<\/p>\n<h3>Functions and Features<\/h3>\n<p>The services are all pretty similar in what they do, they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>store music in &#39;the cloud&#39;<\/li>\n<li>let you stream it (play it without downloading, which requires a connection) * let you download it to your device<\/li>\n<li>act as a backup of your digital music files<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It should be noted that I&#39;m really not too bothered about sound quality. If you are then there are other factors that might affect your choice.<\/p>\n<h3>Complications<\/h3>\n<p>Actually, from what I can tell, the only exception to the list above is iTunes Match which doesn&#39;t let you stream your music: you have to download it and play. But you can play a track while its downloading.<\/p>\n<p>iTunes Match also only works with Apple devices and though iTunes, whereas the other services can be played on multiple platforms through web apps, or phone\/tablet apps.<\/p>\n<p>Google suffers from not having their own app for Apple devices. Third party apps exist but seem to vary in quality. Plus the web app really doesn&#39;t play well with iOS: I found that playing music in the background while doing other things was unreliable.<\/p>\n<h3>Choosing a service<\/h3>\n<p>So while Google seemed best value, it really didn&#39;t work well for a person with Apple devices.  At the time I evaluated them I <em>think<\/em> Amazon&#39;s service didn&#39;t do track matching, so you had to upload your entire collection, which would have taken a LOOOOONG time. So I ended up opting for iTunes Match for a year.<\/p>\n<p>In reality, I don&#39;t think any of these services is ideal. Google&#39;s service is amazing given that its free. And I think that, if I was paying again I&#39;d opt for Amazon&#39;s service rather than Apple&#39;s &#8211; especially now that Amazon&#39;s service has caught up a bit.<\/p>\n<p>So for the time being I have iTunes Match, but I&#8217;m hoping that there will be a decent iOS app for Google Music by the time my renewal comes up.<\/p>\n<h2>So did you &#39;Go Digital&#39;?<\/h2>\n<p>You know what, I didn&#39;t yet! My music is in the cloud, and it&#39;s really good. But I&#39;m still buying CDs. I&#39;m yet to start buying downloaded music in any great volume.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#39;m not really sure why any more. Is there a good reason to buy a CD? Other than, perhaps, to put in the car? CDs take up space, are actually less safe and reliable and, if you don&#39;t care about quality, there doesn&#39;t seem much reason not to be digital only. So I expect I&#39;ll be buying downloads more in the near future.<\/p>\n<p>Do you still buy CDs or Vinyl? What are your reasons? What stops you going digital?<\/p>\n",
