        "rendered": "<p>Gosh I&#8217;m angry. I may regret writing.<\/p>\n<p>This morning, shortly after waking, I heard some news. It wasn&#8217;t about anyone close to me. It involved a family, of which I&#8217;ve met the mother once. The father had died; suddenly and way before his time.<\/p>\n<p>I desperately don&#8217;t want to make some kind of political point out of this tragedy. But I do want to tell you what subsequently happened this morning, and how I felt about it. \u00a0I&#8217;m not going to say what I think should be done. You can make your own minds up.<\/p>\n<p>Because of that news, I approached the morning with a renewed sense of the preciousness of life, and of the importance of keeping myself, Isaac, and Sally safe. I&#8217;d already nearly shed a tear or two. My emotions were on edge before the day had properly started.<\/p>\n<p>Despite grey clouds and a wet seat, I buckled Isaac up and, with helmets and lights on, we cycled, the quietest, safest way we know, to nursery.<\/p>\n<p>On the way home, I confess, I&#8217;m a little cavalier because I don&#8217;t have a kid on the back. By which I mean (&#8230;drum roll&#8230;) I cycle (&#8230;here, it&#8217;s coming&#8230;) ON THE ROAD!<\/p>\n<p>Yes. I know. Perhaps that&#8217;s something I need to change.<\/p>\n<p>And today, while on the road, not one but two cars made dangerous overtaking manoeuvres. One as I navigated a small roundabout that exits on to a blind corner frequented by buses. One at a narrow bit of road as another car was coming the other way.<\/p>\n<p>You could sense that both drivers got half way through the manoeuvre before realising something like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Argh, what&#8217;s coming the other way?<\/li>\n<li>Woah, that cyclist is going a bit quicker than I thought!<\/li>\n<li>Gosh, there actually isn&#8217;t really room\/time to do this safely!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s the slight pause in acceleration, a hesitation long enough for me to know that a decision is being made, then the swerve and pull-away once the driver&#8217;s decided that he may as well finish what he started as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>They were big, posh, expensive cars. A BMW and an Audi. It&#8217;s a gross and wholly unscientific generalisation for which the only data I have is my own recollection of previous incidents, but: they usually are.<\/p>\n<p>I stopped. I physically stopped by the side of the road after the second incident. I considered my route, my clothes, my helmet, my bicycle, my road positioning. I considered whether I should be cycling at all.<\/p>\n<p>I turned left, cycled the last few hundred yards home, opened the door, stepped inside, and cried.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m angry and sad.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want that news to one day be about me.<\/p>\n",
