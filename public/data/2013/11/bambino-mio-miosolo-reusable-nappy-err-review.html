<p>In justification, let me give the back story.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">About this time last year I posted </span><a style="line-height: 1.3em;" title="Reusable/Cloth Nappies: A Plain English Guide for Dads and Dads-to-be" href="https://rosswintle.uk/2012/10/reusablecloth-nappies-a-plain-english-guide-for-dads-and-dad-to-bes/">my experiences of reusable nappies</a><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">. I bigged up the &#8220;bumGenius&#8221; brand as that&#8217;s what I had experience of. It seemed a little unfair to other cloth nappy companies, and the nice folk at Bambino Mio kindly sent some miosolo All-in-One nappies to use (along with some other handy cloth-nappy accessories), on the basis that I post about my experiences.</span></p>
<p>Arguably, waiting was good &#8211; I now have a year&#8217;s experience of using the miosolo&#8217;s. But even so, with apologies to Bambino Mio for being a little late (it&#8217;s been a busy year), here are my thoughts.</p>
<h2>The good stuff</h2>
<p>Things I like about the miosolo:</p>
<p>Generally, in terms of quality and use these are definitely on a par with bumGenius, and they share many of the pros and cons of high-quality, all-in-one (or all-in-two) cloth nappies. The following represent where they are different from the bumGenius nappies that we have and love.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">The inner part is attached to the outer part so they don&#8217;t get separated. As someone who pairs my socks and spends hours tracking down the missing parts of toys that come in sets, this is very pleasing as you don&#8217;t end up having outers with no inners.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">The Velcro waist fastening is good because it gives you more &#8216;granularity&#8217; in the waist size. However, I prefer poppers still (see the related not-so-good thing below)!</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">They have some fancy features that, once you know how to use them make the washing and stuffing process slightly easier. There&#8217;s a little handle for pulling the dirty inner out, and a thing to aid re-stuffing. But&#8230;again, see the downsides of these below.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>The not-so-good stuff</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">The Velcro waist fastening, while giving more flexibility with sizing, has some downsides. We find that they are much easier for a curious child to undo than poppers, and they can stick to other things in the wash. The popper/Velcro thing is probably a matter of personal taste, one isn&#8217;t better than the other, they&#8217;re just different.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">The extra bits for stuffing and washing are confusing. To be honest I was baffled by them at first as there aren&#8217;t instructions that say what they are for (<a href="http://www.bambinomio.com/en/new-to-reusables/user-guides">the website user guides</a> are helpful). But even once you know what they do they don&#8217;t help an awful lot. The bumGenius nappies come apart in the wash so you don&#8217;t need to pull the inner out, so the miosolo&#8217;s special loop seems to just compensate for that fact that you do need to pull the inner out before washing. The stuffing aid was quite a help once I knew what to do with it.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.3em;">The inner is one-size which is quite restrictive. bumGenius comes with two different sizes of inner pad, one of which has poppers to vary its length. Plus you can &#8216;double up&#8217; if you want to. The miosolo&#8217;s only have one inner pad and it&#8217;s a fixed length, which means sometimes your pad is too big and the nappy curls up to try to accommodate it, but this isn&#8217;t a big deal and is made up for by the fact that inners and outers are joined and don&#8217;t get separated and lost.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Summing up</h2>
<p>The bumGenius and the miosolo are both good, high quality, well-designed nappies that will save you money, reduce landfill waste and are actually very easy to use. I&#8217;m sure that had we started out with miosolo&#8217;s we&#8217;d have been just as happy as we are with our bumGenius.</p>
<p>The one thing that really stood out was the friendly and generous nature of the Bambino Mio people. They really are there to help and they&#8217;re full of handy hints and tips. Oh, and, unlike bumGenius, they&#8217;re a UK based company &#8211; that alone may make them worth supporting!</p>
<p>Ultimately there&#8217;s not much in it. Take your pick and enjoy the many benefits of reusable, cloth nappies.</p>
