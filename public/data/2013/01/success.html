<p>He started by wolfing down most of a Weetabix (other wholewheat cereals are available), after which we brushed his teeth. changed his nappy, and read a few books before, right on schedule, going down (with a little encouragement) for a LONG sleep.</p>
<p>That was followed by eating a biscuit, and episode of Raa Raa, and lunch &#8211; he refused the leftover risotto but ate a whole banana, half a piece of toast and some tomato.</p>
<p>Another nappy change followed by which point mummy was nearly home so we went to the front window to wave her in.</p>
<p>All interspersed with little bits of play, toddling around, and showing off (as he does).</p>
<p>There were no tears, and very little crying. Isaac was also unflustered by the whole thing.</p>
<p>I feel astonishingly competent. Today has been a major win. But&#8230;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve learned that even the good times are just a phase. I will have bad days too.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the first full day in nursery. Hmm&#8230;</p>
