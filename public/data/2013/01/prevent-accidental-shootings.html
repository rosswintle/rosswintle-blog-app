<p>There has been a lot of discussion of America&#8217;s gun laws and culture recently after the school shooting in Conneticut.</p>
<p>The danger of gun prevalence in the USA really hit home, though, as I was reading a book over Christmas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading Armin Brott&#8217;s excellent &#8216;<a href="http://amazon.co.uk/dp/1845330935">The New Father: A Dad&#8217;s Guide to the First Year</a>â€™, and then Sally kindly bought me <a href="http://amazon.co.uk/dp/1459609433">the follow-up book that covers years two and three</a>.</p>
<p>There is a section early on in the second book about health and safety in the home. Sensible stuff&#8230;only, this is the US edition of the book, and these words leap off the page at you:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prevent accidental shootings. The only completely foolproof way to do so is never to have firearms of any kind in your home.</p></blockquote>
<p>As we head into 2013 with a highly mobile and intensely curious toddler, I&#8217;m very glad that I live in a country where such deadly objects are so hard to come by.</p>
