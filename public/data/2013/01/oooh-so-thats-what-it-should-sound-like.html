<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Oooh, so THAT&#8217;S what it should sound like</h1></header><main><p>There&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been meaning to do for years now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m quite partial to my music. I know that my taste&#8217;s aren&#8217;t amazing, but I like what I like.  And sometimes &#8211; when the house is empty &#8211; I like to have it a bit louder.</p>

<p>Now that Sally&#8217;s back at work and Isaac&#8217;s at nursery 2.5 days a week, I&#8217;ll have more time to myself. So I spent some of my Christmas money on these.  There&#8217;s a pair of them, and a sub-woofer too. They perch on my desk and my hope was that they&#8217;d be far superior to the tinny chimes of my laptop or iPad&#8217;s speakers.</p>
<p>I really wasn&#8217;t sure what I&#8217;d get for my money. And if I&#8217;m truthful? I&#8217;m really pleased. They&#8217;re actually far too loud and the bass box could really cause issues with the neighbours.  I&#8217;ve got it turned down to &#8220;just about audible&#8221;. Let&#8217;s hope the neighbors are out during the day too!</p>
<p>They&#8217;re amazing though, and it&#8217;s so nice to hear music so much more clearly.  I think I&#8217;ll spend the next month putting on old tunes and exclaiming: &#8220;So THAT&#8217;S what it should sounds like!&#8221;</p>
