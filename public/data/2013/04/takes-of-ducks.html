<body><header><h1 data-pagefind-meta="title">Takes of Ducks</h1></header><main><p>Lots of people have been taking up the new Vine app that lets you record 6 second videos and gotten really enthusiastic about it. Some people have done some really creative things with it and the 6-second limit kinda forces you to be creative. It reminds me of the early days of Twitter where people were really creative with what they could do in 140 chars.</p>
<p>But&#8230;you can probably tell by the tone of my voice&#8230;I don&#8217;t really get it. The app is really clever in how it lets you record and do animation and so on, but I just haven&#8217;t taken to it. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s that 6 seconds is too short, or if its the looping that means you don&#8217;t get to dwell on the message, or if it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m not a visual person and I simply don&#8217;t &#8216;get it&#8217;. Or some or all three of those.</p>
<p>What I have really taken to is a little app called &#8216;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/takes/id605815535?mt=8">Takes</a>&#8216;. Takes rolls video while you line up a photo and then, at the point at which you take the photo, it saves a snapshot of video from around the time you took the photo. The app uses information from your smartphone&#8217;s movement sensors to decide how long the video clip should be. The app then lets you select video snippets and stitches them together, with an optional soundtrack, for you.</p>
<p>Yes, the uses are totally different to that of Vine, the still photos it takes aren&#8217;t great, and the pre-loaded soundtracks are cheesey, but for me, Takes is a magic way of making little documentary videos.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s a little video of some ducks on our decking on holiday to show you what it does, followed by one of our trip to the aquarium (yes, I made the mistake of doing most of this in portrait&#8230;sorry!)</p>
