So it&#8217;s quite amazing that its taken so long to get us using bikes as a family to get around.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been several reasons for this.  For one, my &#8216;workhorse&#8217; bike has had a wobbly stem, and for another we&#8217;ve been working out what sort of seat we want to use.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;d been given a bike seat last year, by some friends, but it was a rear-mounted seat and we weren&#8217;t sure if it was particularly good quality, or if we might prefer a front-mounted seat.  We figure that Isaac likes to chat and interact, and he can get quite wriggly and playful in a car seat, so maybe a front seat would be better.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I finally got the stem of my bike fixed, and had a go at mounting the seat that we&#8217;d been given, just to try it out.  And we popped out and bought Isaac a little helmet (or &#8216;hat&#8217;) too.<\/p>\n<p>And so it began.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday I took him up the road and back first, and I confess, I was a bit nervous and worried about wobbling and falling.  But quickly found my way with it. And Isaac seemed to enjoy being in the seat.<\/p>\n<p>So today we went for a family ride. We did 5 miles or so out and back to Shaw Ridge for a coffee there.  Pretty much all off road, so very safe. And it was great!<\/p>\n<p>In fact, we felt safe, free and are really keen to go on our next family ride.<\/p>\n<p>Isaac&#8217;s verdict? In a quick interview once home he declared his ride on the &#8216;bak&#8217; wearing his &#8216;hah&#8217; with &#8216;daddy&#8217; driving using his current favourite word: a load and firmly stated &#8216;Wow!&#8217;<\/p>\n",
