<p>Today I had a voucher for a free coffee which, judging by the barista&#8217;s face, she&#8217;d not seen before. Yet it was processed with no loss of efficiency.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that the number of beverage combinations a Starbucks till has to handle is HUGE. Combined with all the promotions and offers, and different payment methods that they have, their tills could rapidly descend into a chaotic mess of soft-buttons. But it doesn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t recall ever being held up at a Starbucks till.</p>
<p>As a software engineer this intrigues me. I wonder what their secret is. Is it very, VERY good user interface design? Is it great staff training? A combination of the two? Or something else; magic perhaps?</p>
<p>In any case, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a lesson to be learnt from how they do it. If you&#8217;ve ever worked in Starbucks and can share their secret, let me know in the comments?</p>
