<p>Mailbox aims to help you achieve the sublime &#8220;Inbox Zero&#8221; by giving you a really quick way to archive, delete, &#8220;postpone&#8221; for later, or file in one of a few special folders.  And the principle seems really good.</p>
<p>When I first started using it impressions were that it was really fast, beautifully executed, and integrated really nicely with Google Mail, which I use (apologies to those that don&#8217;t &#8211; Mailbox isn&#8217;t for you just yet).</p>
<p>However, it had a fatal flaw: I use folders and labels a LOT to organise email, and it wouldn&#8217;t let me do that. In theory, with GMail, you can just archive a mail and use search to find it later, but I prefer labelling things so I can search more efficiently.  And yes, I&#8217;m probably a little obsessive about my labelling too.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Special&#8221; folders, called &#8220;Lists&#8221;, that it creates for things like &#8220;To read&#8221; and &#8220;To buy&#8221;, aren&#8217;t what I would normally use at all and were quite limiting.  But I wanted to persevere as I saw the benefits.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1628" alt="Mailbox App Swipe" src="https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_2530-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_2530-300x225.jpg 300w, https://rosswintle.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_2530-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The little change that I made was this: I created a list of my own called &#8220;To file&#8221;. Anything that was dealt with and just needed labels applied could be put in the &#8220;To file&#8221; list, and I could log on to GMail or use the GMail app to bulk-file all my attended-to emails later in the day, keeping my inbox clear.</p>
<p>Well, you&#8217;ll see from the screenshot that I&#8217;m far from Inbox Zero. But trust me, Mailbox is helping me get that number down and I&#8217;m loving it.</p>
