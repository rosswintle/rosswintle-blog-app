<p>And one of Wiltshire&#8217;s biggest towns, my home town of Swindon, is really big on roundabouts.</p>
<p>Co-incidence? Well&#8230;I&#8217;ve always said that there was a link. Crop circles seem to be an ideal way for traffic planners to try out new layouts in life-size arrangements.</p>
<p>And now, <a href="http://www.cyclechat.net/threads/and-the-difference-is.129533/">someone on the cycle chat forum has made that link too</a>! (link care of <a href="http://twitter.com/lofidelityjim">Jim Davis</a>)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the evidence that I have to present:</p>
